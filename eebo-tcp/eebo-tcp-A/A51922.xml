            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I doe account it a great glory, that
ſo deſerving a Gentleman as your ſelf have
drawn my picture with ſo rich a pencill.
In this pourtraict, the ornament of the

which you impute unto me, my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
having wiped them away from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

their rememberance from my memory;
In a manner that beholding my ſelfe in

ſometimes the old Lady of Rendan, who
after her husbands deceaſe having a long
time forborn her looking glaſſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

with too much affection; I believe
when you ſhall come unto the proofe, that
in this you will be on my ſide, and will

and of ſuch mighty Cities when

of them are now ſo ſmall, that we hardly
can diſcern where heretofore they ſtood,
ſo you take pleaſure to deſcribe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
of a beauty, of which there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
no witneſſe, nor appearence, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in your writings. Had you done it to
repreſent the contention of Nature and of
Fortune, you could not have made choice
of a more remarkable Subject, they both
in me having to emulation made eſſay how
far their powers could extend. In that of
Nature, your ſelfe being an eye witneſſe
doe not need inſtructions; but in that of
Fortune, being unable to make deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but by report, which is ſubject to be
delivered by perſons ill informed, or ill

            <p>I have alſo been invited to it by five or
ſix remarkable obſervations in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
which I have found defective, as
when you ſpeak of Pau, and of my voyage
out of France; when you ſpeak of the late
Marſhall of Biron, when you ſpeak of
Agen, and of the Marquis of Canillac. I
will runne over my own Memorialls, to
which I will not give a more glorious
name, although they well deſerve the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a Hiſtory, for the truth which they
nakedly contain, being without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of language, for which I have now
neither the ability, nor the leaſure. This
work then of one afternoon ſhall repaire
to you in a rude and miſhapen lump, like
Bears new whelpt, to receive from you
their beauty and proportion. It is a Chaos
from whence already you have drawn the
light. It is indeed a ſtory well worthy to
be written by a Knight of Honor, a true
Gentleman of France, born of the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
family which was cheriſhed by the
Kings my Father, and my Brothers, and
Coſin and familiar friend to the nobleſt

The occurrences of the precedent with
thoſe of the ſucceeding times doe inforce
me to begin in the reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi>
&amp; in the firſt time that in my remembrance
there fell out any thing worthy of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For as the Geographers in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Earth; when they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to the utmoſt bound of all their
knowledge, doe tell us that beyond that
there are nothing but ſandy Deſerts, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable

               </gap>ble; in
the like manner will I ſay, that beyond
that firſt rememberance of mine, there is
nothing to be diſcovered, but a wilde of
my firſt Infancy, an Infancy wherein we
live, rather guided by Nature, after the
manner of plants, and other creatures, then
of men perſwaded and counſailed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and I will leave unto thoſe who
were the governours of my nonage that
ſuperfluous enquiry, where peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
among thoſe actions of my Infancy,
there will be found ſome as worthy to be

that I made the King my Father
ſome few daies before the fatall blow that
deprived France of peace, and our houſe
of happineſſe: Being then but foure, or
five yeers of age, my Father (holding me

having made too great a proofe of the
excellency of it, conſpired with envy to
become his deadly enemy, depriving him
by death in the fourteenth yeer of his age,
of the honours and the Crowns which

magnanimity that ſhined in him; they
were both at play with the King my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with a fixed eye I did behold
them: I made anſwer to my Father, that
I would have the Marquis; wherefore ſo
replied the King? for (ſaid he) he is not
ſo handſome, for the Prince of <hi>Joinville</hi>
was of a ruddy colour and fair to look on,

of many Lords and Ladies of the

did call upon me to change my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
caſting oftentimes my Howres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fire, and giving me inſtead of them,
the praiers and pſalmes of the Huguenots,
conſtraining me to take them, which as
ſoon as I received, I gave them to Madame
<hi>de Curton</hi> my governeſſe, whom God in
mercy to me had preſerved ſtill a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and who oftentimes would goe with
me to that good man the Cardinall of
Tournon, who did counſaile and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me to ſuffer all things for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of my Religion, and gave me new
Howres and Beades in the place of thoſe
which my Brother of <hi>Anjou</hi> had burned;
And ſome other friends of his who were

               </gap>ealous to pervert me, obſerving me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to weare them, tranſported with
choler, would offer injury unto me, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that it was meer childiſhneſſe and
folly that made me doe ſo, ſaying it did
well appear that I had no capacity, that all
thoſe who were of any diſcretion, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
age or ſex they were, hearing grace
preached, were retired from the abuſes
of the old Superſtition, but I they ſaid,
was as very a foole as my governeſſe. And
my Brother of Anjou, adding threats to
his reproaches, would tell me, that the
Queen my Mother ſhould cauſe me to be
whipped; but this he ſpake of himſelf, for
the Queen my Mother knew not of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
into which he was fallen, and as ſoon
as ſhe did underſtand it, ſhe did extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
check him, and his governours and
cauſing them to re-inſtruct him, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned
them to return to the true, holy,
and ancient Religion of our Fathers,
from which ſhe never did depart: But I
replyed to ſuch threatnings of my Brother,
melting into teares, as the age of ſeven or
eight yeers (at which I then was) is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
enough, that he might cauſe me to be
beaten, and if he pleaſed he might cauſe
me to be killed, that I would rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all the torments that cruelty could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99191:8"/>
then pull damnation on my Soule.
Many more ſuch anſwers of mine and
notes of reſolution and of judgement
might be found, in the diſcovery whereof
I will no longer travaile, intending to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
my Memorialls with that time when I
waited in ordinary on the Queen my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to depart from her no more; For
preſently after the Colloquy of Poiſſy, that
the warrs began, my Brother of Alenſon
and my ſelfe by reaſon of our tender age,
were ſent unto Ambois, whither all the
Ladies of that Country retired themſelves
with us, there was your Aunt the Lady
of Dampierre, who then received me into
her friendſhip, which ſhe continued to her
death, and there was your Coſin Madame
the Dutcheſſe of Rais, who in that place
knew the favour that fortune had done
her, by delivering her at the battell of
Dreux from her afflicting husband Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Annebaut,</hi> a perſon too unworthy
to poſſeſſe ſo perfect, and ſo divine a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
I ſpeak here of the beginning of the
friendſhip of your Aunt with me, and not
of your Coſin which we have preſerved ſo
inviolate, that it continueth yet, and ſhall
doe evermore. But then the age of your
Aunt had a greater complacence with my
Infancy, it being the nature of ancient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99191:9"/>
people to make much of little children,
and thoſe who are of perfect age as was
then your Coſin, to be weary of them,
and to hate their importunate ſimplicity.
I did continue there untill the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the great voiage, when the Queen
my mother cauſed me to return to Court,
to depart from thence no more, of which
I will not ſpeake at all, being then ſo
young, that I cannot retain the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of it but in groſſe, the particulars
being vaniſhed from my memory like a
dreame. I leave therefore the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it to thoſe who being then as you in a
riper age, can remember in particular
the magnificent triumphs that were made,
eſpecially at the Duke of Barrs at the
Chriſtening of my Nephew the Prince of
Lorrain, at Lions at the welcome of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
and Madame <hi>de Savoy,</hi> at Bayons at
the enterview of the Queen of Spain my
Siſter, and the Queen my Mother, and of
King <hi>Charles</hi> my Brother. There I aſſure
my ſelfe you will not forget to repreſent
that ſtately banquet which the Queen my
Mother made in the Iland, with the mask
and manner of the hall, which Nature it
ſeems had appropriated to that effect,
there being diſcovered in the middle of
the Ile, a great green where was a grove
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99191:9"/>
of high timber trees in an ovall form,
round about which my Mother had cauſed
great Neeches to be made, and in every
Neech ſhe had placed a round table for
twelve perſons, the table only of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
with the cloath of State advanced it
ſelf at the upper end of the hall, and was
mounted on foure ſteps of green turfes of
earth. All theſe tables were ſerved by
diverſe troupes of Shepheards diverſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled
with cloath or gold and Sattin,
according to the diverſe habits of all the
Provinces of France. At the landing of
the triumphant boats (in which their
Majeſties wafting from Bayons to the Ile,
were alwaies attended by the way with
the Muſick of man of the Sea-gods, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and rehearſing verſes round about
them) theſe Shepheards were on the green,
troup by troup apart, on both ſides of a
great Alley, caſt up on purpoſe for their
Majeſties to goe to the ſaid Hall, every
troup playing and dancing according to
the faſhion of their Country: The Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tevines
with their Cornets, they of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence
dancing lavalt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es with their Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,
the Burgundians and Champagnians
with the Bagpipes, Treble viols, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
the Brittons dancing loftily with
their fine nimble riſings, and as many tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99191:10"/>
with it, and ſo accordingly of all the
other Provinces. After the ſervice of
whom, and the Banquet ended, the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
were diſcovered with a great troupe
of Satyres to enter the great luminous
rock, ſhining with artificiall light, but
ſparkling more with the jewells and the
beauties of the ladies that ſate above, who
comming down, did dance that moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
maske, the glory of which the Envie of
Fortune not able to endure, came ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in with ſo great a Tempeſt, that the
confuſion and wrack which among the
boates that night had made, brought the
next morning as great a ſubject of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as the magnificent ſetting forth of the
maske before had brought delight. The
like was to be ſeen in all the brave Entries
that were made to expreſſe the Principall
Cities of this Kingdom, whoſe Provinces
here repreſented they did viſite.</p>
            <p>In the Reigne of the mighty King
<hi>Charles</hi> my Brother, ſome few yeers after
the return of the great voyage, the Huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
having begun again the war, the
King and Queen my Mother, being at
Paris, a Gentleman of my Brothers of
Anjou (who hath been ſince King of
France) arrived to bring tidings from him,
that he had brought the Huguenots army
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99191:10"/>
to ſuch an extreamity, that he hoped in
few dayes to force them to give him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
before which time, hee did beſeech
them that he might have the honour to ſee
them, to the end, that if Fortune envious
of the glories which in ſo young an age he
had obtained, ſhould in that deſired ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
after having done good ſervice
to his King, his Religion, and the State,
conjoyne his funeralls with the triumph
of his victories, he might depart this world
with leſſe ſorrow, having ſatisfied them
both in that charge which they had done
him the honor to commit unto him. If
theſe words touched the heart of ſo good
a mother, who did not live, but for her
children only, to preſerve whoſe lives and
eſtates, ſhe every houre abandoned her
own, you are able to judge. Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
ſhe reſolved to depart with the
King, taking with her a ſmall and uſuall
traine of Ladies, as the Lady de <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is,</hi> the
Lady de <hi>Sauva,</hi> and my ſelfe. Being borne
on the wings of deſire, and motherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
ſhe diſpatched the way betwixt
Paris, and Tours, in three daies, which was
not without ſome inconvenience, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Accidents worthy of laughter, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by the poor Mounſieur, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of <hi>Burbon,</hi> who never did forſake her,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99191:11"/>
although he was neither of garbe, of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
nor complexion for ſo great a
Preſence.</p>
            <p>Arriving at Tours, we found my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Anjou,</hi> with the chiefe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Captaines of his Army, who
were the flowers of the Princes, and the
Lords of France, in the preſence of whom
he made an Oration to the King, to give
him an account of all the carriage of his
charge ſince his departure from the Court,
compoſed with ſuch art and eloquence,
and delivered with ſo much Grace, that he
cauſed admiration in all the ſtanders by:
The greenneſſe of his youth did ſo much
the more advance and make apparent the
wiſedome of his words; that ſeemed more
ſuitable with a gray beard, with an old
experienced Captaine, than a young
Gentleman of ſixteen yeers of Age, whoſe
brow the Laurells of two Conqueſts had
already crowned, and Beauty which gives
a greater grace to every Action, did ſo
flouriſh in him, as if ſhe were in emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Fortune, which of them both
ſhould render him moſt glorious. The joy
which my Mother did receive hereat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can
no more by words be repreſented, then
could the Griefe of the father of <hi>Ipbigenia;</hi>
and in any other but her ſelf, whoſe ſoul
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99191:11"/>
was ever wedded to diſcretion, one might
eaſily have perceived the exilience
which ſuch an exceſſe of joy had made,
but ſhe moderating her actions, as well ſhe
could, demonſtrating apparently, that the
Diſcreet doe nothing which they would
not doe, without ſtuddying to proclaime
her joyes, or ſtretch in words thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which the Actions of ſo accompliſhed
and deere a childe did merit, took only the
chiefe points of his oration, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the actions of the warre, to deliberate
on them with the Princes and the Lords
there preſent, to take a thorough reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the war, and to provide things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for it; for the diſpoſing whereof, it
was requiſite to continue there ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
daies; in one of which, the Queen my
mother walking in the Parke, with ſome
of the Princes, my Brother of Anjou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Alley, into which being come, he thus
ſpake to me.</p>
            <p>Siſter, the education which we have had
together, doth no leſſe obliege us unto
love, then the neerneſſe of our blood, and
you have underſtood, that among all my
brothers &amp; ſiſters, I have ever had a greater
inclination to wiſh well to you then unto
any of them, and I have well obſerved that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99191:12"/>
your nature hath ever borne to me the
ſame reſpects of love; hitherto we have
been guided to it by Nature, not by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
neither hath this Action brought us
any profit, but only the pleaſure we have
to converſe together, This indeed was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to our Infancy, but this houre
requires that we no longer live like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
you ſee the great and honorable char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to which God hath called me, and to
which the Queene, our good Mother, hath
advanced me, you ought to believe that
you being the onely thing in the world
whom I doe moſt affect and cheriſh, I
ſhall not be maſter of that greatneſſe or
fortune, of which you ſhall not be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
I know you have capacity and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to doe me good offices with the
Queene my mother, to preſerve me in that
Fortune wherein I ſtand; my principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is to labour to retaine her favor. I
am afraid my abſence will doe me wrong,
and yet the warre, and the charge I have,
conſtraine me almoſt to be alwayes abſent;
In the meane while, the King my brother
is alwayes with her, doth pleaſe and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her in all things. I am afraid, at length
it will prove prejudiciall to me, and that
the King my brother comming to be
great, and being full of courage, will not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99191:12"/>
alwayes minde the chace, but ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of change, will turne the chaſe of
beaſts into the chace of men, and taking
away from me the charge of the Kings
Leivtenant, which he hath given me, will
leade the Army himſelf. This would prove
to me ſo great a Ruine, and a Griefe, that
before I would receive ſo great a fall, I
would imbrace the moſt cruell death. In
this apprehenſion, ſtudying the meanes to
prevent it, I finde it neceſſary for me to
have ſome faithfull perſons that may make
good my part with the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I know not any ſo fit for this, as you,
whom I have ever held for my ſecond ſelf.
You have all the parts that can be deſired
for it, underſtanding, judgement, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
wherefore if you will ſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege
me, as to render your ſelfe obſervant
of her, deſiring you to be always at her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
at her cloſet, at her lying downe, and
briefly all the day, this will obliege her to
communicate her ſelfe unto you; with this
will I expreſſe unto her your ability, and
what comfort and ſervice ſhe ſhall receive
from you, and I will intreat her no more
to take you for a childe, but to imploy you
in my Abſence, as my ſelf; this I doe aſſure
my ſelfe, that ſhe will doe. Speak you to
her with the ſame confidence as to me, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99191:13"/>
aſſure your ſelfe, you ſhall finde her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable.
This ſhall be to you a happineſſe
as great as good, to be beloved of her, and
and herein you ſhall doe much for your
ſelf and me; and for my ſelf, I ſhall next to
God, acknowledge you to be the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my fortunes.</p>
            <p>This language ſeemed very ſtrange to
me, as having yet ever lived without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and minding nothing beſides
hunting, and dancing, not having ſo much
as the curioſity of affecting new faſhions,
or of ſeeming beautifull, as being yet not
indebted to age for that Ambition, and I
was trained up under the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
with ſuch conſtraint and awe, that I
durſt not preſume to ſpeak unto her only,
but when ſhe looked on me, with what
ſpeed I could, I would ſteale away for
fear of doing ſomething that might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
her; inſomuch I was about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſometimes anſwered
God out of the Viſion of the Buſh, <hi>What
am I, ſend thou him whom thou oughteſt to
ſend;</hi> Notwithſtanding, finding in my ſelf
(what I thought there had not been) thoſe
faculties ſtirred up by the object of his
words, which before lay undiſcovered to
me, and being borne with ſpirit enough,
returning to my ſelf from my former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99191:13"/>
thoſe words did much affect
me, and me thought, that I was at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
a creature transformed, and was now
become a thing of more account then
heretofore I had beene, inſomuch, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
confidence in my ſelfe, I anſwered
him; Brother, if God ſhall give me the
capacitie and boldneſſe to talke unto the
Queen my mother, as I have the will to
doe you ſervice in what you deſire of me,
aſſure your ſelfe, you ſhall receive that
profit and content which you have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to your ſelfe, you have reaſon to be
confident of me, for nothing in the world
doth more honour and affect you then my
ſelfe, procure only that I may be with the
Queen my mother, and you ſhall be there
your ſelf, I being only there for you. I
expreſſed theſe words with my heart ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then my mouth, as the effects can
witneſſe: for being departed from him, the
Queen did call me to her cloſet, and ſaid,
Your Brother hath told me the diſcourſe
that you have had together, and now no
longer taketh you for a Childe, no more
will I, it ſhall be a great comfort to me,
to ſpeake to you, as to your Brother. Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your ſelf diligent and dutifull, and be
not afraid to ſpeak freely to me, for I will
have it ſo. Theſe words did ſhoote ſuch
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99191:14"/>
an unbounded joy into my ſoule, as before
it never apprehended, and me thoughts,
that all the contents which I received till
then, were but as ſhaddows to this bliſſe,
with a diſdainfull eye I looked back on the
recreations and exerciſes of my infancy, as
dancing, hunting and the companions of
my childehood, deſpiſing all, as vain and
fooliſh. I did obey this pleaſing comand,
not failing a day to be with the firſt at her
riſing, and with the laſt at her lying down,
and ſhe did me the honour to ſpeake unto
me ſometimes two or three houres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and God gave me the grace that ſhe
remained ſo ſatisfied therewith, that ſhe
could not ſufficiently praiſe me to her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
I talked to her alwayes of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and did advertiſe him of all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
with ſuch fidelity, as I breathed
forth nothing but his deſires.</p>
            <p>In this happy eſtate I did remain ſome
certain time with the Queen my Mother,
during which the battell of Montcontour
was fought, at the news whereof my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Anjou who deſired nothing more
then to be with the Queen my Mother,
ſent her word that he was going to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
Saint <hi>John d' Angeli,</hi> and that the
Kings and her preſence would be of much
importance at the ſiege. Shee more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99191:14"/>
then himſelf to come, reſolved pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to depart, attended onely with her
ordinary train, of which I was one, and
I went with her extreamly joyous, not
foreſeeing the enſuing miſchiefe which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had prepared. Too young as I was,
and unexperienced I did not ſuſpect my
happineſſe, and believing the proſperity
I enjoyed to be permanent, I collected to
my ſelfe a perpetuity of my fortune, but
my envious ſtarrs that could not ſupport
the continuance of ſo happy a condition
did provide me as much affliction at my
arrivall, as I promiſed to my ſelfe pleaſure
by my fidelity by which I thought to have
obliged my Brother; for in his abſence
from Court, he had taken to him <hi>Le Guaſt,</hi>
by whom he was ſo much poſſeſſed, that
he ſaw not but by his eyes, nor ſpake but
by his mouth; This wicked fellow born
for miſchiefe ſuddainly bewitched his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and filled it with a thouſand tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
precepts, as that he ought not love or
truſt to any but himſelfe, that he muſt not
joyn any to his fortunes, no not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or his Siſter, and ſuch goodly Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivilian
tenents, imprinting which in his
underſtanding, and he reſolving to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
them, as ſoon as we were come, after
the firſt ſalutations, my Mother began to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99191:15"/>
commend me, and to tell him with what
faith and diligence I had attended on her,
he anſwered her coldly, that he was glad
of it, but wiſedome he ſaid did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that ſhe ſhould uſe the ſame expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
at all times, and what ſeemed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in one houre, might prove prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in another. She demanded of him,
what did move him ſo to ſpeake, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
he ſeeing the time for his invention
which he had contrived for my ruine,
made anſwer that I was grown very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
and that Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> intended
to be a ſuitor to me, being induced to it
by his aſpiring Uncles, and if it came to
paſſe that I ſhould affect him, it were to
be ſuſpected that I would diſcover to them
whatſoever thing ſhe told me; He told
her, that ſhe was not ignorant of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of that houſe, which had alwaies
ſought to ſuppreſſe and to ruine ours,
for which occaſion it were requiſite, that
ſhe ſhould talke no more of affayres unto
me, but by degrees retire her ſelfe and her
familiarity from me; That very evening I
found the change which that pernicious
Councell had wrought in her, and ſeeing
ſhe feared to ſpeake unto me before my
Brother, having commanded me three or
foure times as ſhe was talking to him to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99191:15"/>
go to bed, I waited untill he was gone out
of the chamber, &amp; then approaching to her
I did beſeech her to tell me if through my
ignorance I were ſo unhappy, as to have
done any thing which might diſpleaſe her.
At firſt ſhe began to diſſemble with me, but
in the end ſhe ſaid, daughter your brother is
wiſe, you muſt not think ill of him, for that
which I ſhall tell you tendeth unto good:
ſhe repeated then all the diſcourſe that had
paſt betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded me to ſpeak
no more unto her before my brother. Theſe
words were as many needles in my heart, as
thoſe were a joy unto me when ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me firſt into her favour; I omitted
nothing to repreſent unto her my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
urging that what he talked of was
a thing of which I never heard, and if any
ſuch thing ſhould happen, it ſhould no
ſooner be ſpoken to me, but forthwith I
would acquaint her with it; But it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
nothing, my Brothers words
had left ſuch a deep impreſſion in her heart
that there was no roome for truth, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
Seeing this, I told her that I was leſſe
ſenſible of the evill of the deprivation of
my happineſſe, becauſe I found no good
by the acquiſition of it, that my Brother
might take me away, as he had given me,
for he preferred me to her without merit,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99191:16"/>
prayſing me when I was unworthy, and
that he now deprived me of it without any
deſert, onely on an imaginary ſubject
which had no being but in his fancy, but
I beſought her to believe, that I would
for ever preſerve the remembrance of what
my Brother had done unto me; hereat ſhe
grew into a great choller, commanding
me not to ſhew the leaſt appearance or
ſigne of any thing. From that time daily
more and more ſhe diminiſhed her favors,
making her Sonne her Idoll, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to content him in this and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
elſe he deſired of her. This afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
oppreſſing my heart, and poſſeſſing all
the faculties of my ſoule, rendered my
body more apt to receive the contagion
of the bad ayre, which was then in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
inſomuch that I fell within few daies
after, to be extreamly ſick of a malignant
and ſpotted Feaver, a ſickneſſe which then
ran fatally up and down, and which at the
ſame time had born away two of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Phyſitians of the King and Queen,
<hi>Chappellain</hi> and <hi>Caſtelan,</hi> intending, as it
ſeems, by taking away the Sheepheards to
make a better market of their flock, and
very few of thoſe eſcaped who were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
I being in this extremity the Queen
my Mother who knew partly the cauſe of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99191:16"/>
it, omitted nothing that might eaſe me,
taking the pains without fearing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to come unto me every houre, which
brought me much comfort, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
of my Brother did as much again
augment my griefe, who after he had
ſhewed himſelf ſo unfaithfull, and was
guilty of ſo great ingratitude, departed
neither day nor night from my bed, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as officiouſly on me, as in the time of
our greateſt friendſhip; but I who by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
had my mouth ſhut, anſwered
not his hipocriſie but by ſighes (as <hi>Burrus</hi>
ſometimes did <hi>Neroe's,</hi> who died by the
poyſon that the tyrant gave him) ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
witneſſing unto him, that the cauſe of
my ſickneſſe was the contagion of the evill
offices that he had done and not of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
ayre: but God had pitty on me, and
delivered me from that danger, and after
fifteen daies the army departing, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me in a Litter, where every evening
retiring to my chamber, I found King
<hi>Charles</hi> who took the pains with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
noble Gentlemen to convey my Litter
to my Bed.</p>
            <p>In this eſtate I came to <hi>Angeirs</hi> to Saint
<hi>John de Angeli,</hi> ſick of body, but more ſick
of minde, where to encreaſe my miſery I
found Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> and his Uncles
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99191:17"/>
arrived, which rejoyced as much my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
giving ſome colour to his former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
as it gave me the apprehenſion to
increaſe my pain, where my Brother, the
finer to ſpin his thred, came every day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Chamber, bringing with him Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Guiſe,</hi> whom he counterfeited to
love entirely. And to give him cauſe to
think ſo, he would oftentimes in imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him ſay unto him, I would to God
you were my brother: To which Monſieur
<hi>de Guiſe</hi> would make as though he did not
underſtand him, but I who knew his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
did looſe all patience, and could not
but tax him for diſſembling.</p>
            <p>About this time there was a report of
my marriage with the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi>
who ſent his Embaſſadours to demand me.
The Queen my Mother enjoyned me to
prepare my ſelfe to receive them, which I
did, but my Brother perſwaded her that
by no means I would be induced to that
marriage, ſhe communed with me about
it in the evening, and demanded of me how
I ſtood affected to it, thinking thereby to
take an occaſion to be angry with me; I
replyed to her, that my will altogether
depended upon hers, and whatſoever was
pleaſing unto her ſhould be as agreeable
unto me: She anſwered me in choller to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99191:17"/>
which before they had raiſed her, that
what I ſpake unto her was not from my
heart, and that ſhe knew well, that the
Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had exhorted me to
entertaine his Nephew, I beſought her
that ſhe would be pleaſed to come to the
effect of the marriage with the King of
<hi>Portugall,</hi> and ſhe ſhould then perceive the
fruits of my obedience; Every day
brought in ſome new tidings concerning
this Subject, to exaſperate her the more,
and to torment me, which were all inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
contrived in the ſhop of <hi>Le Guaſt;</hi> In
a manner that I had not one day of quiet,
For on one ſide the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that my marriage ſhould not bee, and
on the other ſide, Mounſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Court, ſerved alwayes as a pretext
to furniſh new Subjects of perſecution on
me, although that neither he, nor any of
his kindred did ever ſo much as ſpeake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, and it was now more then a yeere,
ſince he was a ſuitor to the Princeſſe <hi>de
Portia,</hi> but becauſe that marriage was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
it reflected alwayes on this illation,
that he aſpired unto mine, which I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
reſolved to write unto my Siſter
Madam <hi>de Lorrayne,</hi> that could doe all in
that Houſe, intreating her to be a meanes
that Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99191:18"/>
from Court, and that the marriage
might be diſpatched betwixt him and the
Princeſſe <hi>de Portia</hi> his Miſtreſſe, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to her how this invention was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted
as much for Monſieur <hi>de Guize</hi>
his ruine, as my owne; the truth of this
ſhe knew very well, and came preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Court, where ſhe cauſed the ſaid
marriage to be accompliſhed, by that
meanes delivering me from detraction,
and giving the Queen my mother to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the truth of that which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſaid. This ſtopped the mouth of all
mine enemies, and gave me reſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
who would have none but his owne birds
flie out of his owne neſt, quite brake off
the marriage with the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi>
and there was heard no more rumour of
it. Some few dayes after, there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of my marriage with the Prince of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> who is now the brave and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
King of <hi>France,</hi> and of my ſelf.
My mother being one day at the Table,
communed there a great while with
Mouſieur <hi>de Meru,</hi> becauſe they of the
Houſe of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> were the firſt that
made the motion. And riſing from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſhe told me that ſhe had ſpoken to
him to conferre with me about it. I made
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99191:18"/>
anſwere, that I having no other will but
hers, it were ſuperfluous, but I beſought
her ſeriouſly to conſider that I was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
and that it would be a great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to me, to be married to one that was
not of my Religion. Afterwards my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
going to her cloſet, called me, and
told me that the Lords of <hi>Montmorancy</hi>
propoſed againe that marriage to her, and
that ſhe willingly would know how I
ſtood affected. I replyed to her againe,
that I had neither choice nor will, but
what was hers, and beſought her againe
to remember, that I was a true Catholick.
At the end of certaine daies, the report
ſtill continuing, the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
mother to the ſaid Prince came to Court,
where the marriage was fully agreed
upon before her death, to whom
there happened a pretty Paſſage, which
deſerveth not indeed to be recorded in
this ſtory, but to be paſſed off in ſilence
twixt you and me. Madam <hi>de Nevers,</hi>
whoſe humour you well know, being
come with Monſieur the Cardinall of
<hi>Burbon,</hi> Madam <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> Madam the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of <hi>Conde,</hi> and her ſiſters, with my ſelf,
to diſcharge the laſt duety due unto her
dignitie and the proximity betwixt us, we
found her not with the pompe and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99191:19"/>
of our Religion, but in the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
cut of affected Huguenotery. She had
about her ordinary bed the curtaines o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
without light, without Prieſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Croſſe, and without Holy-water.
We kept our ſelves ſome five or ſixe paces
from her bed, with the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Madame <hi>de Nevers,</hi> whom in her life
time ſhe hated above all the creatures in
the world, and who ever had returned
good unto her for it, both in will and
words, as you knew ſhe would carry her
ſelf fairely to thoſe ſhe hated, departed
from our troupe, and with many grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
humble and ſubmiſſive curteſies ſhee
came neere unto her bed, and taking her
by the hand, did kiſſe it, and againe with
a lowly courteſie, and moſt full of humble
reſpects, ſhe withdrew her ſelfe unto us,
we who did know their hatred thinking
that—</p>
            <p>Some few moneths after, the Prince of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> who then called himſelfe King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> mourning for the Queene his
mother, came thither, accompanied with
Eight hundred Gentlemen all in blacks,
and was received by the King and all the
Court with great honor, and ſome few
daies after, my Nuptialls were Solemnized
with more magnificence and triumph
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99191:19"/>
then was ever any of my quality. The
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and his troupe had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their blacks into habiliments moſt
rich and gorgeous, and all the Court ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred,
as you know, and can far better
repreſent it. I was royally attired with the
Crowne. Before me I had on a Robe of
powdered Ermines, which gliſtered all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with the ſparkling ſtones that reflected
from the Crown, and behind me the great
blew Mantle, the traine whereof being
foure elles, was carried by three Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the ſcaffolds were ſet up, as it is uſuall
at the marriages of the Daughters of
<hi>France,</hi> from the <hi>Eueſche</hi> to our Ladies,
and covered with cloth of Gold. The
people thronged below to ſee the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and all the Court paſſed along upon
the ſcaffolds. We came to the doore of
the Church, where Monſieur the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> having received us to ſay
the words accuſtomed for ſuch Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
did there the office for that day.</p>
            <p>We being thus, Fortune who never
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ants unto mortality a perfect happineſſe,
changed ſoone after this happy eſtate of
triumphs and of nuptialls into another
cleane contrary, by the hurt which the
Admirall received, which ſo offended
thoſe of the Religion, that it made them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99191:20"/>
even deſperate, inſomuch that old <hi>Pardail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
and ſome other of the chiefe Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
talked ſo loud to the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they made her conceive they had
ſome bad intention: By the adviſe of
Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> and my Brother the
King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> who ſince hath been King
of <hi>France,</hi> a counſell was taken to prevent
them, a counſell to which King <hi>Charles</hi>
was no way acceſſary, who loved Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Rochefoucault, Teligny, la Noue</hi>
and ſome others who were the chiefe of
that Religion, whoſe ſervice he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to make uſe of in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and I my
ſelfe have heard him ſince affirme, that
with much difficultie and importunitie
he conſented to it, and unleſſe they had
made him underſtand that his life and
ſtate were in the utmoſt jeopardy, he had
never given way unto it; And having
known the aſſault which <hi>Mauravell</hi> had
made on Monſieur the Admirall by a ſhot
from a Piſtoll, which he diſcharged out
of a window, whereby thinking to kill
him, hee was onely wounded in the
ſhoulder, the King ſuſpecting truly, that
<hi>Mauravel</hi> made that ſhot, by perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> in revenge of the
death of his father the late Monſieur <hi>de
Guiſe,</hi> whom the ſaid Admirall had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99191:20"/>
to be ſlain in the ſame manner by <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot,</hi>
he was in ſo great a choler againſt
Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> that he ſwore he would
ſee Juſtice executed, and if Monſieur <hi>de
Guiſe</hi> had not withdrawn and hid himſelf
all that day, the King had cauſed him to
be apprehended, and the Queen my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had never more to doe then to make
King <hi>Charles</hi> underſtand, that it was done
for the benefit of his Eſtate, ſo great an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he did beare to Monſieur the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
<hi>la Noüe</hi> and <hi>Teligny,</hi> whoſe ſpirits
and whoſe valour he well obſerved, being
ſo noble a Prince that he affected not any
whom he ſaw not indued with ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and though they had been moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to the ſtate, theſe foxes knew ſo well
to diſſemble, that they had wonne the
heart of this brave Prince, who hoped
to make them profitable to him for
the inlargement of his eſtate, whiles
they propounded to him great and
glorious enterpriſes in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the only
attraction of that royall and mighty ſpirit.
And although the Queen my Mother in
this accident repreſented to him that the
aſſaſſinate, which the Admirall made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the Father of Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi>
did render his Son excuſable in taking
vengeance himſelfe on the Admirall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99191:21"/>
he could not have juſtice done him,
as alſo that although the aſſault which the
Admirall had made on <hi>Charry</hi> maſter of
the Campe (a perſon whoſe valour had ſo
faithfully aſſiſted her during the time of
her regency and his nonage) did render
him worthy of ſuch intreaty, although that
theſe words might make the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the revenge for <hi>Charryes</hi> death
was deeply imprinted in my Mothers
heart, yet his Soule overcome with grief
for the loſſe of thoſe perſons, whom he
thought one day, as I have ſaid, would be
advantagious to him, did ſo ecclipſe his
judgement that he could neither moderate
nor change his paſſionate deſire to ſee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
executed, giving ſtrict command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to ſearch out and apprehend
Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> proteſting that ſuch an
act ſhould not eſcape unpuniſhed. In the
end as <hi>Pardaillan</hi> at ſupper with the
Queen my Mother diſcovered by his
threats, the badd intention of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots;</hi>
and my Mother ſaw that this accident
had brought the affayres to ſuch an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that if they prevented not their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
that night they would attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King and her, ſhe tooke a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
throughly and plainly to acquaint
the King with the truth of all, and of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99191:21"/>
danger in which he was. For this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhe ſelected Monſieur the Marſhall
<hi>de Rais,</hi> from whom ſhe knew that the
King would take it beſt, as being one to
whom the King imputed greateſt truſt,
and one whom he moſt did favour, who
came unto the King about nine or ten of
the clock in the Evening, and told him that
as his moſt faithfull ſervant he could not
conceale the danger wherein he was, if he
perſevered in that reſolution to have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
executed on Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> and
that it was requiſite he undeſtood that the
wound which the Admirall received, was
not only occaſioned by Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi>
but that my Brother the King of <hi>Polonia</hi>
ſince King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Queen my
Mother were both abettors in it; that he
knew the extream diſpleaſure that my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
received at the <hi>aſſaſſinate</hi> on <hi>Charry,</hi>
as great reaſon ſhe had for it, having then
but few ſuch ſervants who depended only
on her, <hi>France</hi> being (as well he knew) in
the time of his nonage divided, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
ſtanding for Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> and
the Hugunots for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> both
of them attempting to diſpoſſeſſe him of
the Crown, which next to God was not
preſerved, but by the wiſdome and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance
of the Queen his Mother, who in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99191:22"/>
her extremity found her not more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
aſſiſted by any then by the ſaid <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
that alſo ſhe obſerved that the ſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
was ever a moſt dangerous and
pernicious member of the State, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
apparence he made of the affection
to his Majeſty, and to ſerve him in his wars
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> his only deſigne was to trouble
<hi>France,</hi> that her intention indeed was only
to take away the Plague of the Kingdome
the Admirall, but miſchiefe and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſo did guide it, that <hi>Mauravell</hi> miſſed
in his ſhot, and that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> thereon
were grown ſo deſperately obſtinate, that
not only attempting againſt Monſieur <hi>de
Guiſe,</hi> the Queen his Mother, the King of
<hi>Polonia</hi> his Brother, but believing that he
himſelfe was conſenting to it, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that night to have their recourſe to
Armes, inſomuch that he ſaw his Majeſty
in a great and moſt apparent danger, by the
Catholicks by reaſon of Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi>
and by the Huguenots for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mentioned. King <hi>Charles</hi> who was
of great wiſedome, and who alwayes had
been moſt obedient to the Queen my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a moſt Catholick Prince, ſeeing
how eminent was the danger, took a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
reſolution to joyn himſelfe to the
Queen his Mother, and to conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99191:22"/>
to her will, and by the Catholiks to
ſecure his perſon from the Huguenots, but
not without extream griefe, that he could
not ſave the lives of <hi>Teligny, la Noue,</hi> and
Monſieur <hi>de la Rochefoucault:</hi> And going
preſently himſelfe to finde the Queen his
Mother, he ſent for Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> and
all the other Princes, and Catholick Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where reſolution was taken that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night to beginne the Maſſacre of Saint
<hi>Bartholomew:</hi> And preſently putting their
hands unto the work, the chaines ſtretched
forth, and the alarme beating, every one
ran into his quarter (according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
given) as well unto the Admirall as
to the Huguenots: Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
himſelfe on the lodging of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
into whoſe Chamber one <hi>Beſme</hi> an
<hi>Almaine</hi> Gentleman having mounted, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having ſtabbed him to death, did throw
him out of the window to his maſter Mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Guiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part I heard nothing of all this,
I ſaw all the world in action. The Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
were ſtrook into deſperation by this
aſſault, and the Lords <hi>de Guiſe</hi> fearing the
execution would not be hot enough, did
whiſper every man in the eare to ſee it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
performed: The Huguenots ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pected
me becauſe I was a Catholick, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99191:23"/>
the Catholiks ſuſpected me, becauſe I was
Eſpouſed to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was
a Huguenot, ſo that I heard nothing of it,
untill that Evening, being at the lying
down of the Queen my Mother, I ſat on a
Coffer neer unto my Siſter of <hi>Lorraine</hi>
whom I ſaw wonderfully penſive: The
Queen my Mother conferring with ſome
there preſent, perceived where I ſate, and
commanded me to go to bed; As I was a
making my courteſy unto her, my Siſter
took me by the arme and held me by it,
and burſting forth in tears, ſhe cryed out,
good God! dear Siſter do not go: Theſe
words ſtrook a great fear into me, which
the Queen my Mother did perceive, and
calling my Siſter to her was very angry
with her, and forbad her to tell me any
thing: My Siſter replyed, there appeared
no reaſon, that my life ſhould be thus made
a Sacrifice, and that without doubt if they
diſcovered any thing, they would revenge
themſelves on me; The Queen my Mother
anſwered, that if it pleaſed God I ſhould
receive no hurt, but howſoever it fell out,
I muſt needs be gone, for fear my abſence
ſhould give occaſion of ſuſpecting any
thing. I ſaw very well they were in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
diſputation, but I did not underſtand
their words, when again ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99191:23"/>
me very roundly to go to bed. My Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
weeping, bad me good night, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to tell me any thing, and I went away
as a thing loſt in amazements, and in fears.
As ſoone as I came into my cloſet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
my ſelfe to Prayer, and beſought
Almightie God, that he would be pleaſed
to take me into his protection, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me, not knowing from what, or
whom: By and by the King my husband
who was in bed, deſired me that I would
haſten to him, which I did, and found his
bed encompaſſed with thirty or forty
Huguenots, which till then I not obſerved,
for but a few daies were paſſed, ſince I
was married to him, they did nothing elſe
but talke of the Accident that befell Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Admirall, reſolving as ſoon as it
was day to demand juſtice of the King on
Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> and if the King would
refuſe to right them, they would then right
themſelves. All that night my ſiſters
teares were ſoaking into my heart, and I
could not ſleep for the apprehenſion into
which ſhe had put me, not knowing whom
to feare: The night in this manner paſſed
away without ſhutting of my eyes; About
the break of day, the King my husband
ſaid, that he would goe play a game at
Tennis, attending till King <hi>Charles</hi> were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99191:24"/>
ſtirring, reſolving with all ſpeed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
juſtice of him, he went out of his
chamber, and all his Gentlemen with him;
I ſeeing it was day, beleeving the danger
which my ſiſter did imply was now paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
being overcome with ſleepe, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my nurſe to make faſt the doore, that
I might ſleep without diſturbance; about
an houre after, I being in a ſound ſleep,
Behold a man knocking with his hands
and feet at the doore, and crying out,
<hi>Navarre, Navarre;</hi> My Nurſe thinking
it to be the King my husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ranne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to the doore. It was a Gentleman
named Monſieur <hi>de Teian,</hi> who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a cut with a ſword on the elbow, and
a thruſt with a halberd through the arme,
and was purſued by foure of the Guard,
who came ruſhing into my chamber with
him. He endeavoring to ſave his life, did
caſt himſelf on my bed, and I perceiving
the man begin to take hold of me, did
throw my ſelfe towards the wall, and he
flung himſelf after me, taking faſt hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me. I did not know the man, and
could not tell if he came thither to violate
me, or whither thoſe of the Guard would
have him, or me, we both cryed out, and
were both equally affrighted. At length
it pleaſed God that Monſieur <hi>de Nanſay,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99191:24"/>
Captaine of the Guard came in, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me in that eſtate, although he was
touched with compaſſion, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
from laughter, and very ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
thoſe of the Guard, for Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and made them depart, giving me
the life of that poore Gentleman who
tooke hold of me, whom I cauſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in my cloſet untill he was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
and changing my linnen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had covered it with blood: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Nanſay</hi> related to me all that had
paſſed, and aſſured me that the King my
husband was in the chamber of the King,
and that he ſhould receive no hurt, and
cauſing me to throw a night-gowne on
me, he did leade me into the chamber of
my Siſter Madame <hi>de Lorraine,</hi> whither I
came rather dead then alive, and paſſing
through the the Preſence chamber, whoſe
doores were all open, a Gentleman called
<hi>Borſe,</hi> ſaving himſelfe from the purſuers,
was ſtruck through with a Halberd ſome
three paces from me, I fell downe on the
other ſide, fainting away, and thought that
the ſame ſtroak had run us both thorough;
And being a little recovered to my
ſtrength, I entered into the chamber where
my Siſter lay, I was no ſooner there, but
Monſieur <hi>de Mioſſans,</hi> chiefe Gentleman
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99191:25"/>
to the King my husband, and <hi>Armagnack,</hi>
chiefe groome of his chamber, came and
beſought me to begge their lives. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
made haſte, and fell on my knees
before the King and the Queen my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
beſeeching them to grant me this
ſuite, to which in the end they condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Some five or ſixe dayes after, they who
had begun this game, knowing that they
had fayled in their principall deſigne, not
ayming ſo much at the Huguenots, as at
the Princes of the Blood, did impatiently
indure that the King my husband, and the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were yet alive, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that no man durſt attempt againſt the
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> becauſe he was my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
they began to weave another web,
perſwading the Queen my mother, that it
was neceſſary to diſſolve the Marriage. In
this reſolution, being one morning at the
riſing of the Queen my mother, on a day
in which we were to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhe took on oath of me to tell her
the truth, and demanded of me if my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
were a man or no, telling me, if he
was not, that ſhe had then means to diſanul
the mariage. I beſought her to believe,
that I underſtood not what her demand
was, for I might well have anſwered as the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99191:25"/>
Roman Lady, whoſe husband being angry
with her that ſhe never told him of his evil
breath, ſhe made anſwere, that ſhe thought
that every mans breath did ſmell as his.
But I told her howſoever it was, ſince ſhe
had placed me with him, it was my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there to ſtay, perceiving very well that
this ſeparation which ſhe ſpake of, was
only to procure a miſchiefe to the King
my husband.</p>
            <p>After this, we accompanyed the King
of <hi>Polonia</hi> as farre as <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who ſome
moneths before his departure from
<hi>France,</hi> having laboured by all meanes to
make me forget the cvill offices of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
and to reduce our friendſhip
to the ſame perfection as it was in our
younger yeers, obliged himſelfe in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
oathes and promiſes at his farewell to
me. His departure out of <hi>France,</hi> and the
Kings ſickneſſe, which began almoſt at the
ſame time, did rouze the ſpirits of the two
parties of this kingdome, making diverſe
projects on the State, the Huguenots ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at the death of the Admirall, by ſealed
writings obliged the King my husband,
and my Brother of <hi>Alenſon</hi> to revenge his
death (gaining my brothers heart a little
before the feaſt of Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> with
the hope to eſtabliſh him in <hi>Flanders)</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99191:26"/>
perſwaded them as the King and Queen
my mother came back to <hi>France,</hi> to ſteale
away into <hi>Campagne,</hi> where certaine
troupes ſhould bee ready to attend
them. Monſieur <hi>de Mioſſans,</hi> a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Gentleman, having heard of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
ſo pernicious to the King his Maſter,
advertiſed me of it, to prevent the bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which might prove ſo prejudiciall to
themſelves, and to the State. I made haſte
immediately to the King, and the Queen
my Mother, telling them that I had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thing to communicate unto them,
which did much concerne them, and
which I never would diſcover, unleſſe they
would aſſure me, that it ſhould not prove
hurtfull to whom I named, and alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a remedy without making ſhow of
knowing any thing. I told them then,
that the next morning, my Brother and
the King my husband intended to joyne
with ſome troupes of Huguenots which
came to ſeek them by reaſon of the oath
and obligation for revenge, which the
Huguenots had made at the Admiralls
death, which obligation, being for their
fathers ſlaughter, was now excuſable by
their children. I beſought them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my brother, and the King my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and to hinder their departure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99191:26"/>
out making it apparent wherefore it was
done; this they accorded to, and it was
carried with ſo much wiſedome and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie,
that without the knowledge of the
cauſe, they had not the means to eſcape.
This being paſſed, we arrived at Saint
<hi>Germans,</hi> where we ſtayed a long time by
reaſon of the Kings ſickneſſe, during
which time, my Brother of <hi>Alenſon</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
by all ſuits and ſervices to render
himſelfe ſo agreeable unto me, that in the
end I vowed him friendſhip, as I had done
before unto King <hi>Charles,</hi> for till that
time, becauſe he had alwayes his educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of Court, we had ſcarce the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of each other, and therefore could
not be familiar; In the end perceiving my
ſelfe invited by ſuch obſequiouſneſſe, by ſo
many obſervances, and proteſtations which
he daily did expreſſe, I did reſolve to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
his love, and to be mindfull of all
good offices that might concerne him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
with this caution, that it ſhould
be without prejudice to the duty which I
owed to King <hi>Charles</hi> my Brother, whom
I honored above all things in the world;
he continued this his affection to me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
witneſſed it with perſeverance to his
end.</p>
            <p>During this time the ſickneſſe of King
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99191:27"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> daily increaſing the Huguenots ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ceaſed to raiſe new troubles by rayſing
new projects, and indeavored again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
my Brother the Duke of <hi>Alenſon</hi> and
the King my Husband from the Court,
which came not to my knowledge as at
the former time, nevertheleſſe it pleaſed
God the miſchiefe ſhould be diſcloſed to
the Queen my Mother ſo neer to be put in
practiſe, that the troupes of the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
were to arrive that day neere unto
Saint <hi>Germans,</hi> in ſo much that we were
conſtrained to remove from thence at two
a Clock after midnight, and to put King
<hi>Charles</hi> into one Litter to recover <hi>Paris,</hi> the
Queen my Mother diſpoſing of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the King my Husband in her own
Charriot, who were not now ſo gently
handled as before; For the King did goe
to <hi>Bois de Vencennes,</hi> from whence it was
not permitted him to depart again: And
time continuing the ſharpneſſe of his Evill
produced daily new occaſions to increaſe
his diſcontents, and the diſtruſt he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of them, to which the combination
and the plots of thoſe who alwaies deſired
the ruine of our Houſe did, as I believe,
lend too much help. Theſe diſtruſts were
carried with ſo much violence, that the
Lords Marſhals alſo <hi>de Montmorancy</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99191:27"/>
               <hi>de Coſſe,</hi> were retained priſoners at <hi>Bois
de Vencennes,</hi> and <hi>la Mole</hi> and the Count
of <hi>Cocanas</hi> were put to death; nay to ſuch
an extremity and height of perfect danger
the affayres were brought, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
of the Court of Parliament were
deputed to hear my Brother and the King
my Husband, who were both reſtrained of
their liberty. The King my Husband ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
none to Counſell him, commanded
me to draw in writing that which he had
to anſwer, to the end that he might not
trouble himſelf nor any other. God gave
me the grace to draw it ſo to purpoſe, that
he remained well ſatisfied, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
were amazed to ſee him ſo well
prepared; And ſeeing by the Death of <hi>la
Mole</hi> and the Count of <hi>Cocanas</hi> they found
themſelves ſo charged that they were in
danger of their lives, I reſolved, although I
was in ſuch favour with King <hi>Charles</hi> that
he loved nothing more then me, to venture
my own fortunes for the preſervation of
their lives, having deliberated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
with my ſelfe, ſeeing that not any
of the Guard looked in, nor cauſed my
women to unmask as daily I went into my
Coach and lighted from it, to diſguiſe one
of them into a woman, and to take him
with me into my Coach: And although
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99191:28"/>
they were well cleared of the Guard, and
that the enlargement of the one was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to aſſure the life of the other, yet they
could never agree which of them ſhould;
come forth, either of them deſiring to be
that perſon, and neither of them being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſtay behinde, ſo that this deſigne
could not be put in execution, but God
did provide a remedy by a means too grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to me, for he deprived me of King
<hi>Charles</hi> who was all the comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of my life, a Brother from whom
I never received but good, and who in all
the perſecutions which my Brother of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou</hi>
brough upon me had alwayes aſſiſted,
adviſed, and directed me: briefly, I loſt in
him what ever I could looſe.</p>
            <p>After this diſaſter fatall to <hi>France</hi> and
me, we went to <hi>Lyons</hi> to meet the King of
<hi>Polonia,</hi> who ſtill poſſeſſed by <hi>le Guaſt,</hi>
rendred of the ſame cauſes the ſame effects
and believing the advice of that pernicious
Spirit which he had left in <hi>France</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and make good his part, he conceived
an extream jealouſie againſt my Brother
of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> ſuſpecting and impatiently bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Union betwixt my Husband the
king and him, and beleeving that I was the
only chain that united and preſerved their
love, and therefore contrived as his apteſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99191:28"/>
and moſt expedient courſe, on the one ſide
to traduce and ſet me at diſtance with the
King my Husband, and on the other to
procure that the Lady <hi>de Sauva</hi> to whom
they both were ſervants ſhould handle
them in ſuch a manner, that the one might
grow extreamly jealous of the other.
This abhominable plot the fountain and
beginning of ſo many Croſſes and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which my Brother and I have ſince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
was purſued with as much heat and
ſubtilty, as it was with wickedneſſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Some are of opinion that God hath
an extraordinary and particular prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Illuſtrious perſonages, and into
thoſe ſpirits where the raiſes of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
doe more brightly ſhine, he gives
them by their good Angels ſome ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
of the accidents which are
prepared for them, be they good or evill;
In which number I may juſtly place the
Queen my Mother, who hath proved ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
examples of it. The very night before
that inauſpicious turnament, ſhe dreamed
that ſhe ſaw the King my Father wounded
in the eye, as the next day he was, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
awaked, ſhe often times beſought him
that he would not tilt that day, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with the pleaſure of ſeeing the
Turnaments without being an Actor in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99191:29"/>
them; inevitable deſtiny permitted not ſo
great a bleſſing to this kingdome that he
ſhould receive ſuch ſaving Counſell: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did ſhe ever looſe any of her Children,
but a little before ſhe ſaw the apparition
of a great flame, whereat ſhe ſuddainly
would cry out God bleſſe my Children!
and immediately after ſhe underſtood the
ſad news which by that fire was preſaged.
In her ſicknes at <hi>Metz,</hi> being in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity
by a peſtilent feaver, which ſhe
took by going to ſee the Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of women; whereof there were many
in that City, which a little before had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly
been infected, from which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
malady, miraculouſly ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
God then reſtoring her to this
ſtate which had ſo much need of her, by the
diligence of Monſieur <hi>de Caſtelan</hi> her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
who like a new <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> made
an admirable proofe of the excellence of
his art: She raving, and attended by King
<hi>Charles</hi> my Brother, and my Siſter and
Brother of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> with many Lords of
the Counſell, and many Ladies and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
who were round about her bed, and
although conceiving her paſt recovery,
would not abandon her, ſhe continued
thoſe raging fits, as if ſhe had beheld the
battell of <hi>Jarnac:</hi> Look how they fly,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99191:29"/>
My Sonne hath the victory; O my God,
my God aſſiſt my Sonne, he now is fallen
on the earth; See where the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
lyes ſlain under yonder hedge: thoſe that
were then preſent cryed out ſhe raved, and
knowing that my Brother of <hi>Anjou</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to joyn in battel with the enemy, they
thought that ſhe had nothing but the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in her head, but the night following
Monſieur <hi>de Loſſes</hi> brought news of it, as
a deſired meſſage, by which he thought to
merit much, to whom ſhe ſaid, you have
done me wrong to waken me for that
which I knew before, for ſaid ſhe, Did I
not ſee it yeſterday? then they underſtood,
that it was not the raving of her feaver,
but a particular prenotion which God
doth give to rare and Illuſtrious perſons.
The Hiſtories doe furniſh us with many
like examples of the ancient Heathen, as
the apparition of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and many more
which I will not now rehearſe, it being not
my intention to beautifie my Memorials,
but only to relate the truth and to advance
them forward, that you may receive them
with greater ſpeed. Of theſe divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
I doe not account my ſelf worthy;
nevertheſſe not ungratefully to conceale
the graces and gifts of God which I have
received, and which I ought to confeſſe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99191:30"/>
and will doe throughout all my life, to
give thanks unto him for it, and that every
one might praiſe in me the wonderfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his power, his bounty, and his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
I profeſſe that never any remarkable
accident hath befaln me either good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
of which I had not before ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement,
either in a dreame or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
and I might well repeat that
verſe
<q>
                  <l>My minde doth ſtill prophetick ſee,</l>
                  <l>All good or bad that fals on me.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The truth whereof I proved then at the
arrivall of the King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> when the
Queen my Mother met him, although it
were ſo hot a ſeaſon that we were even ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
with the throng, while my Brother
and the Queen my Mother were imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
each other, and expreſſing their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
indeerments, yet ſo ſtrange a
cold and univerſall a trembling in every
limbe and joynt poſſeſſed me, that they
who attended on me did perceive it; I
had much adoe to conceale it, when the
King having left my Mother came to ſalute
me. This preſage did touch me to the
heart, howſoever there paſſed ſome few
dayes before the King diſcovered his hate
and badde intention which this malicious
<hi>Guaſt</hi> had made him to conceive againſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99191:30"/>
me. He reported to him that ever ſince
the death of the King, I took in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
the part of my Brother of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> and
had indeered him to the King my husband;
wherefore watching an occaſion to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at their deſigne, which was to break
the friendſhip of my Brother of <hi>Alenſon</hi> &amp;
the King my Husband, by planting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention
betwixt my Husband and my ſelf,
and by tormenting them both with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
pangs for their common love, and
Miſtreſſe the Lady <hi>de Sauva,</hi> one afternoon

Neece of Madame <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſez</hi> told us that the
Abbey of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> was a goodly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
we reſolved to goe thither becauſe
ſhe had an Aunt there, and becauſe there
was no admiſſion for her unleſſe with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of eminent degree; We took her
with us, and as we mounted into the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
although there were ſix of us in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
beſides Madame <hi>de Curton</hi> a Dame of
honour who was alwaies with me, there
was <hi>Liancourt</hi> the Kings chief Eſquire, and
<hi>Camillus</hi> with him, who threw themſelves
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99191:31"/>
on the bearing ſtaves of <hi>Torignyes</hi> charriot,
where holding as faſt as they could, and
playing and jeaſting where they ſate, as
they were of a ſportfull and frolick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
they ſaid, they would goe with
us alſo to ſee thoſe faire and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Ladies; the company of the young
Lady of <hi>Montigny,</hi> who was a meere ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to me, and of thoſe two who were the
Kings aſſociates, was as I beleeve an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
mercy and Providence of God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
me from the imputation of the inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſlander. We came to that religious
houſe, and my charriot, which was eaſie
to be knowne, being guilded over, the
ground-worke being yellow velvet, and
garniſhed with ſilver, did attend us at the
doore, neere unto which place were the
lodgings of many Gentlemen. While
we were in the Abbey, the King going to
ſee <hi>Quelus,</hi> who then lay ſick, having with
him the King my Husband, <hi>de O,</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi>
paſſed by that place, and ſeeing my
charriot empty, he turned towards the
King my husband, and ſaid, See heere
where your Queens charriot is, and heere
doth <hi>Bidus</hi> lodge, I will lay a wager that
ſhe is there, and commanded <hi>Rufus,</hi> a fit
inſtrument for ſuch malice, being a friend
to <hi>le Guaſt,</hi> to goe in, and ſee, who having
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99191:31"/>
found nothing there, yet unwilling that
the truth ſhould hinder the Kings project,
ſpake alowd before the King my husband,
The birds were there of late, but they are
now flowen; this was ſufficient to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
a ſubject to them for diſcourſe till
they returned home. The King my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
teſtifyed in this the Goodnes of his
Nature and Underſtanding, with which
he ſhewed himſelfe to be alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied,
and deteſting in his heart this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
did eaſily diſcover wherefore it was
done. The King made haſte to returne
before me, to poſſeſſe the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with this Invention, and to make me
receive an affront; I arrived preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had the leiſure to doe me this ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
when the Queen my mother had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſtrangely of me before the Ladies,
partly for beliefe, and partly to pleaſe her
Son, whom in all things ſhe idolized. On
my returne (not knowing any thing at all)
as I was going downe unto my chamber,
with all the troupe that accompanyed me
to Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> I did meet my husband,
who as ſoone as he beheld me, began to
laugh, and ſaid, Goe to the Queene your
mother, and I aſſure my ſelfe you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
well chafed thence. I asked him
wherefore, and what the buſineſſe was?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99191:32"/>
he made anſwere, I will not tell you, it
is ſufficient that I beleeve it not, theſe are
Inventions to ſet you and me at diſtance,
and by that means to eſtrange me from the
freindſhip of Monſieur your Brother; See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I could learn from him nothing elſe, I
repayred to the Queen my Mother, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the hall, I met with Monſieur
<hi>de Guiſe,</hi> who ſeeing this diviſion in our
houſe, was nothing ſorry for it, well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
himſelf to collect the pieces of the
broken veſſell, who ſaid to me, I waite here
Madame to tell you, that the Queen hath
entertained a very uncharitable opinion
of you, and related to me all the diſcourſe,
which he received from <hi>de O,</hi> who being
then an entire freind of your Coſins, told
it to Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> to acquaint me
with it. I made haſte unto the chamber
of the Queen my mother, where ſhe was
not to be found, but there I met with
Madame <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and all the other
Princeſſes and Ladies, who ſaid unto me,
Good God (Madame) the Queene your
mother is extreamly incenſed againſt you,
I would adviſe you not to preſent your
ſelfe before her. Indeed I would not, I
replied, if I had done what the King hath
reported of me, but being altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
it is requiſite that I ſhould ſpeake
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99191:32"/>
unto her to acquit my ſelfe. I entred then
into her cloſet, which was made only but
of ſingle wainſcot, ſo that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
with eaſe whatſoever words
were ſpoken; As ſoone as ſhe did ſee me,
ſhe began to vent her choler, and to ſpeak
whatſoever a violent and an outragious
paſſion could deliver. I preſented the
truth unto her, and told her that there
were ten or twelve of us in company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
her to enquire, and not onely
beleeve thoſe who were my friends and
familiar acquaintance, but Madame <hi>de
Montigny,</hi> who was a ſtranger to me, and
<hi>Liancourt,</hi> and <hi>Camillus,</hi> who depended
not but on the King; but ſhe had no eare
either for truth or reaſon, whether it were
that ſhe were prepoſſeſſed with the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
or whither it rather were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the King her Sonne, whom with
all her affection and indeavours, with all
her hopes and feares ſhe idolized, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not to chide and threaten me; I telling
her that the King was he that raiſed this
report, ſhe grew into a greater choller,
and would have made me believe that it
was one of the Grooms of her Chambers
who paſſing by did ſee me, but finding
that this excuſe was too groſſe that I
ſhould receive it into my beliefe, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99191:33"/>
that I remained extreamly offended with
the King, it did the more inſtimulate and
torment her; all this was heard into
her Chamber being full of people; depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thence with as much indignation as
can be conceived, I found in my own
Chamber the King my Husband, who
ſaid unto me, And have you not found
what I told you true? and perceiving me
much afflicted; torment not your ſelf he
ſaid, for this <hi>Liancourt</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> ſhall
attend the King at his going to reſt, and
ſhall acquaint him with the wrong that he
hath done you, and I aſſure my ſelfe, to
morrow that the Queen your Mother
will doe her beſt to make a perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I replyed to him, Sir I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this ſlander too publick an affront
to pardon thoſe that did procure it, but I
account all but light in regard of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they would have done, by pulling on
me ſo great a miſchiefe, as the loſſe of your
love; he anſwered, But God be thanked
that is fruſtrated: to which I replyed, yea
thanks be to God, and to your good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but from this evill it were requiſite
we ſhould derive ſome benefit, which
might ſerve us for inſtruction, to have an
eye to all their policies whereby they
ſhall indeavour to work debate betwixt us,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99191:33"/>
for it is to be believed that ſince the King
hath begun to proceed thus farre he will
not ſtay here, nor deſiſt, till he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen
the bonds of love betwixt my Brother
and your ſelfe; whiles I was ſpeaking
this, my Brother came, and by a new Oath
I obliged them both to the continuation
of their friendſhip, but what Oath is of
ſtrength in love?</p>
            <p>While we were at the Banquet, the
King having conferred with <hi>Liancourt</hi>
and <hi>Camillus,</hi> and the Lady of <hi>Montigny</hi>
had perceived the errour into which the
malice of <hi>Rufus</hi> had cauſed him to fall, and
being no leſſe carefull to recall it then he
was ready to receive it, comming to the
Queen my Mother he did confeſſe the
truth unto her, and intreated her that ſhe
would be pleaſed to excuſe it to me, that
I might not perſevere an enemy againſt
him, fearing much (becauſe he ſaw I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the injury) that I knew as aptly
to revenge my ſelf, as he did to offend me.
Returning from the banquet, I found the
Prophecy of the King my Husband true,
the Queen my Mother ſent for me into her
back Cabinet, which was joyning to the
Kings, where ſhe told me that ſhe had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the truth, and had found it to be all
falſe whatſoever the Groom of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99191:34"/>
had related to her; and perceiving
by my ſemblance that I believed not that
pretext, ſhe endeavoured by all meanes
to take from me the opinion that it was the
King, and finding it advantaged nothing,
the King came preſently into her Cabinet,
and made me many and grand excuſes,
alledging that others made him believe it,
and gave me all the ſatisfaction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of friendſhip that could be
deſired. This being paſſed, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
at <hi>Lyons</hi> a little longer, we went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Avignon, Le Guaſt</hi> daring no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſuch impoſtures, and ſeeing by my
actions that I gave no regard unto him,
he took now another courſe by the Lady
<hi>de Sauva</hi> to advance his miſcheivous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
winning her ſo far, that ſhe gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all by him, and practiſing his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
no leſſe dangerous then thoſe of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,</hi>
ſhe worked the love of my Brother
and of the King my Husband (but light
before and flexible, being both but very
young) to ſuch a height and ſtrength, that
forgetting all ambition, exerciſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
they minded nothing elſe but that
Ladies ſervice, and were ſo ſtrongly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of one another, that although ſhe was
courted by Monſieur <hi>le Guiſe,</hi> by <hi>le Guaſt,
Sovuray</hi> and many others who were all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99191:34"/>
better beloved by her then themſelves, yet
theſe two Brothers neither minded nor
feared any thing but the preferred accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and entertainment of each others
ſervice; And this woman the better to
play her game perſwaded the King my
Husband that I grew jealous of her, and
for that cauſe that I took my Brothers part;
we eaſily believe what is told us by thoſe
we love. He entertaineth this beliefe, he
eſtrangeth, he concealeth himſelf from me
more then from any other, which till then
he never did; for till he received this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
he did ſpeak to me alwaies as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as to a Siſter, knowing that I was no
way inclined unto jealouſy, but deſired
above all things his content, I ſeeing this
which I moſt feared to come to paſſe, which
was the removall of his affection from me,
for till then I alwaies enjoyed the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and ſociety of his love, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that diſtruſt which depriveth of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
is the beginning of hate, whether
it be amongſt friends or kindred, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
beſides that if I could divert the
affections of my Brother from Madame <hi>de

of <hi>le Guaſt</hi> his invention which he had
plotted for our diviſion a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

my beſt indeavour in the behalf of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99191:35"/>
to withdraw him from her, which
would have perſwaded any other who had
not his Soule inchanted with the love and
ſubtilty of theſe fine perſons. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who in all other things believed none
more then me, could not in this retain
himſelfe for his own ſafety or mine, ſo
ſtrong the charms of this Circe were, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
with the diveliſh ſpirit of <hi>le Guaſt,</hi>
inſomuch that inſtead of drawing any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
from my perſwaſions, he diſcloſed to
that woman whatſoever privately I had
ſaid unto him: What can we conceale
from thoſe we love? ſhe exaſperated him
the more againſt me, and ſtrived with
more affection to advance <hi>le Guaſts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
and to perfect her revenge ſhe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incited the King my Husband to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, in a manner that he ſpake no more
unto me: he returned from her very late,
and to deprive him of ſeeing me, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him alwaies to be early at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Queen my Mother to which ſhe
was accuſtomed to go, and all the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he departed no more from her;
my Brother was altogether as carefull in
his ſuit unto her, ſhe making them both
believe that moſt intirely ſhe affected them
which did advance as much their jealouſie,
as their ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:99191:35"/>
We ſtaied a long time in <hi>Avignon,</hi> and
a good ſpace after this in <hi>Burgundy</hi> and
<hi>Champagne,</hi> as we went to <hi>Rhemes</hi> to the
mariage of the King, and from thence we
came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the affayres were
carried after the old manner; the cunning
of <hi>le Guaſt</hi> by this means did ſtill imploy
it ſelfe to our deſtruction. Being at <hi>Paris,</hi>
my Brother did take unto him <hi>Buſſi,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that reſpect unto him which his valor
did deſerve, he was alwayes with my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by conſequence with me, my
Brother and I being for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
together, and giving charge to
all his ſervants to honor and reſpect me as
himſelf, his Gentlemen and ſervants
which attended on him fulfilled this his
pleaſing command, and with ſuch ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they expreſſed no leſſe ſervice to
me then to himſelfe: Your Aunt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this, would tell me oftentimes that
this union betwixt my Brother and my
ſelf made her remember the time of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Orleance</hi> my Uncle, and Madame
<hi>de Savoy</hi> my Aunt; but <hi>Guaſt</hi> who was
the toadſtoole of the time, giving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
interpretation to it, imagined that
Fortune now had levelled him a faire and
eaſie way by which with more dexterity
he might haſten to the But of his deſignes,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99191:36"/>
and by the means of Madame <hi>de Sauva</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought into favour with the King my
Husband, he attempted by all the wayes
that could be deviſed to perſwade him that
<hi>Buſſi</hi> courted me, and ſeeing he could not
prevaile with my Husband to believe it,
being ſufficiently advertiſed by his people
who were alwayes with him, of my demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and that there was no apparence
for any ſuch ſuſpition, he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the King whom he found more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to perſwade, as well for the little good
will he did bear my Brother and my ſelfe,
our friendſhip being ſuſpected and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him, as for the ſecret ſpleen he did
owe to <hi>Buſſi,</hi> who having ſometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, had left him now, to devote
his ſervice to my Brother: The acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch a ſervant as much increaſed the
glory of my Brother, as the envy of our
Enimies, there being nothing in this age
of his ſex and quality like unto him in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
reputation, grace and ſpirit, of whom
ſome have ſaid if we may believe the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
of Soules as ſome Philoſophers
have affirmed, that without doubt the
Soule of your brave Brother <hi>Hardelay</hi> ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
and informed <hi>Buſſi;</hi> The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſſeſt with this by <hi>le Guaſt</hi> related it
to the Queen my Mother, exhorting her
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99191:36"/>
to tell it to the King my Husband, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to put him in the ſame grievances as he
did before at <hi>Lyons;</hi> but ſhe ſeing what ſmall
apparence of truth it had, rejected it and
ſaid, I know not what male-contents
they are who abuſe your fancy with ſuch
ſuggeſtions, my Daughter is unhappy to
be borne in ſuch an age, In our time we
ſpake free to all the world, and to all the
Gentlemen that followed the King your
father, Monſieur <hi>le Dauphin</hi> and Monſieur
<hi>de Orleance;</hi> your Uncles were ordinarily
in your Aunt <hi>Margarets</hi> Chamber and in
mine, and none thought ſtrange thereat,
as there was no reaſon why they ſhould;
<hi>Buſſi</hi> ſeeth my Daughter before you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Husband in his Chamber, this is
not in ſome retired place, or the doore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhut, <hi>Buſſi</hi> is a perſon of quality, and
chiefe in attendance on your Brother;
what can you collect from this, can any
man make more then a meer ſlander of it?
At <hi>Lyons</hi> you made me give her ſo great an
affront in the ſame nature that I am afraid
ſhe will remember it while ſhe liveth.
The King amazed at this, replyed, Madame
I ſpeak not but after others, ſhe demanded
who are they my Son? they are thoſe who
labour to ſow diſſention betwixt you and
all yours: The King being gone ſhe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99191:37"/>
all to me, and ſaid, you are born in a
miſerable age, and calling in your Aunt
Madame <hi>de Dampierre</hi> ſhe began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with her of the honeſt liberty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
which they enjoyed in their youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
years, without being ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction:
<hi>La Guaſt</hi> ſeeing the Mine
blown up, and that it took not fire on that
ſide he expected, addreſſed himſelf to ſome
Gentlemen that followed the King my
Husband, who till that time had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of <hi>Buſſi,</hi> and were now become
his enemies, by reaſon of the jealouſie
which his advancement and his glory had
procured him, they joyning to their envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hatred an inconſiderate zeale to the
ſervice of their Maſter, or to ſpeake more
truly, covering their envy with that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
reſolved one evening (as he went
late from his Maſters lying down) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into his own lodging to aſſault and
ſeize upon him; and becauſe my Brothers
Gentlemen were accuſtomed to keep him
company they knew they ſhould not finde
him with leſſe then fifteen or twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and although he carried no ſword
by reaſon of the wound which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he received in his arme, they knew
his preſence would be enough to double
the courage of his companions: Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99191:37"/>
this and indeavoring to make
their enterpriſe aſſured, they reſolved to
aſſault him with two or three hundred
men, the vaile of night covering the ſhame
of ſuch an aſſault: <hi>Le Guaſt</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a Regiment of the Guard provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them with Souldiers, who putting
themſelves in five or ſix troupes in the
ſtreet through which of neceſſity he muſt
paſſe, they charged on him putting out
their Links and Torches. After a volley
of Harquebuſes and Piſtols, enough not
only to intrap a troupe of fifteen or twenty
perſons, but to defeate a whole Regiment
of Souldiers, they hand to hand did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
with this troupe, labouring continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the mask of night to mark out <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi,</hi>
knowing him by his dove-coloured
Scarfe in which he carried his wounded
arme, which ſerved at that time well for
them, who otherwiſe would have felt the
ſtrength and vigour of it, but they were
ſo well entertained by thoſe few honeſt
Gentlemen from whom neither this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
incounter, nor the horrour of the
night had taken away their judgement, or
their courage, that making as great a
proofe of their valour as of their affection,
to their friend, by fine force they brought
him to his lodging, without loſing any
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99191:38"/>
of their troupe, ſaving one Gentleman on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
who was trained up with him, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
wounded alſo in his arme carried it in a
dove-coloured ſcarfe as <hi>Buſſi</hi> did, yet diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
much from his, it being nothing ſo
rich as his Maſters was, howſoever in the
obſcurity of night either the fury or the
courage of theſe aſſaſſinates, who had the
word given them to fall on the dove-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
ſcarfe, prevailed ſo much, that all
the troupes threw themſelves on that
poore Gentleman and left him dead in the
ſtreet. An Italian Gentleman that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to my Brother being there, ſurpriſed
with feare did runne all bloody into the
Louure and comming up the ſtaires where
my Brothers Chamber was, cryed out that
<hi>Buſſi</hi> was aſſaulted; my Brother immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
would have gone to reſcue him: By
good fortune I was not then in bed, and
was lodged ſo neer unto my Brother that
I heard that affrighted man comming up
the ſtaires, and Proclayming that terrible
news as ſoon as he. I ran forthwith into
his Chamber to hinder him from going
down, and ſent to the Queen my Mother
to intreate her to come and ſtay him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the juſt griefe which he conceived
did tranſport him ſo beyond himſelfe, that
inconſiderately he would expoſe himſelfe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99191:38"/>
to any danger to run headlong to revenge:
we retained him with much adoe; the Q.
my Mother urging there was no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that he ſhould venter himſelf alone
during night, that obſcurity did cover all
vilany, that <hi>le Guaſt</hi> was miſchievous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have done it peradventure on
purpoſe that he might fall into ſome evill
accident. Theſe words were of little
force with him being almoſt deſperate,
but ſhe uſing her authority ſtaied him and
gave the Porters charge that they ſhould
not let him forth, taking the pains herſelf
to ſtay with him till he had learned the
truth of all: <hi>Buſſi</hi> whom God had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               </gap>e being uncapable of feare, being
born for a terrour to his Enemies, a glory
to his Maſter, a helpe unto his friends; as
ſoon as he was entred into his lodging
thinking in what a trouble his Maſter
would be if the newes of this encounter
were brought uncertainly unto him, and
fearing it might throw him upon the
ranks of his enemies, as without doubt it
had, if the Queen my Mother had not
prevented it, ſent forthwith one of his
ſervants who brought him the truth and
the news of all; And the day appearing,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99191:39"/>
               <hi>Buſſi</hi> without fear of his enemies came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Louure with as joyfull and as brave
a preſence, as if the former aſſaſſinat had
been to him a turnament of pleaſure, My
Brother Being alſo as glad to ſee him, as
full of indignation to revenge his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
ſufficiently did witneſſe how ſenſible
he was of the affront that was done unto
him by attempting to deprive him of ſo
worthy and ſo brave a Servant although
<hi>le Guaſt</hi> could not endure that <hi>Buſſi</hi> ſhould
be ranckt before him, or be ſeen to take
the upper hand.</p>
            <p>The Queen my Mother the wiſeſt and
moſt adviſed that ever was, knowing of
what weights were ſuch effects, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
that in the end, they might ſet both

Brother (to take away all pretences) that
<hi>Buſſi</hi> a while ſhould abſent himſelf from
Court, to which my Brother gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
through my intreaties, ſeeing well
that if he ſtayed, <hi>Le Guaſt</hi> would continue
his incendiary deviſes, and would make
him ſerve as a Cloake for his pernicious
deſignes, which were to keep at diſcord
my Brother and the King my Husband as
he had done by his aforeſaid inventions;
<hi>Buſſi</hi> who had no other will but that of his

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99191:39"/>
with the braveſt of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which followed my Brother; this
ſubject was pleaſing to <hi>Le Guaſt,</hi> and at
the ſame time ſeeing the King my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
one night in a great weakneſſe in
which he fainting ſwounded oftentimes
away, which came unto him as I beleeve
by an exceſſe which he had made with
women, where I ſerved and aſſiſted him
as my duty did command me, at which
ſo much he was contented, that he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me to all the world, ſaying that if I had
not perceived him in that extreamity, and
run preſently to his ſuccour to call my wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and his ſervants to him, that he had
been dead, and for this that he would make
farre more deerly of me then hitherto he
had. <hi>Le Guaſt</hi> ſeeing alſo that of late the
love and friendſhip between my Brother
and the King my Husband began to renew
it ſelf, believing that I was the only occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and inſtrument thereof, and that I was
to them (as we may ſee in all naturall
things, but eſpecially in Serpents cut) a
certain naturall balme which doth reunite
and reconcile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the divided parts, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes the courſe of his firſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deſigne, and labouring to contrive
ſome new invention to divide the King
my Husband and my ſelf; did put into the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99191:40"/>
Kings head, who ſome few dayes before by
the ſame inventien of <hi>Le Guaſt</hi> had taken
from the Queen his moſt vertuous and
ſacred Princeſſe one of her Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
whom ſhe loved very deerly, and
who was trayned up with her, named
<hi>Changi,</hi> he thought it now expedient that
the King my Husband ſhould doe the like
by me, taking from me her whom I moſt
affected named <hi>Torigny,</hi> without any
cauſe or reaſon but this, That it was not
requiſite for young Princeſſes to have
ſuch ſervants in whom they might repoſe
any particular confidence; The King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by this wicked fellow talked of it
oftentimes to the King my Husband, who
told him that he knew very well that he
ſhould doe me a grievous diſpleaſure by
it, and if I loved <hi>Torigny,</hi> I had occaſion
ſo to doe, that beſides her education with
the Queen of <hi>Spaine</hi> my Siſter, and her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
on me ſince my Infancy, ſhe was
of an excellent underſtanding, and who
had done him very good ſervice in his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
at <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> that he ſhould
be ungratefull ſhould he not remember
it, and that he oftentimes had ſeen his
Majeſty himſelf make deerly of her. In
this he defended himſelf, but in the end
<hi>Le Guaſt</hi> perſiſting continually to incite
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99191:40"/>
the King who telling my Husband that he
would never love him more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if by the next
morning he had not taken <hi>Torigny</hi> from
me, he was conſtrained to his great griefe
(as ſince he often hath proteſted to me) to
intreat and command me to give way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, which was ſo grievous to me that
I could not but witnes to him by my tears
what an injury and diſpleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I received
by it, demonſtrating unto him that what
moſt afflicted me, was not the removall
of a Servant who ſince my Infancy had
been alwayes profitable and dutifull to
me, but it being known how well I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her, I was not ignorant how great a
prejudice this ſuddain and forced depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of hers would bring to my reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he being unable to allow theſe truths
by reaſon of the promiſe which he made
the King to doe me this great diſpleaſure,
ſhe went away the ſame day to a Coſin of

no longer able to reſiſt the juſt griefes

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ERTAIN dayes after,
ſome faithfull ſervants of
the King my Husband
having made him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the artifice by the
means whereof he was
led unto deſtruction, by eſtranging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and his affections from my Brother,
and my ſelfe, from whom he ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his greateſt ſuccour, and growing
now into neglect, as the King began to
undervalue him, they cauſed him to
ſpeak unto my Brother, who ſince the
departure of <hi>Buſſi</hi> had no way amended
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99191:43"/>
his condition; for every day <hi>Le Guaſt</hi>
cauſed him to receive ſome new indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and knowing that they were both in
the ſame condition at Court, being both
out of favour, and that <hi>Le Guaſt</hi> alone did
govern the world, that they muſt begge
to him for whatſoever they deſired to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the King; and if they chanced to
demand any thing they were rejected
with contempt, that if any one had made
himſelf their ſervant, he forthwith was
cryed down, and laden with a thouſand
ſlanders and complaints, perceiving alſo
that their diſunion was their ruine, they
reſolved to unite and retire themſelves
from Court, and to aſſemble their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and friends together, to demand of
the King a condition and reſpect worthy
of them, my Brother having not yet the
exhibition for his maintenance, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
himſelf on certain ill aſſigned pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
which came unto him onely when it
pleaſed <hi>Le Guaſt,</hi> and the King my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
no way rejoycing in his government
of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> he being not permitted to go
unto it, or to any other of his Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
This reſolution being taken, my
Brother ſpake unto me and ſaid that they
two were now made perfect friends, and
that he much deſired that the King my
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99191:43"/>
Husband and I ſhould be the like, and
intreated me to forget whatſoever before
had paſſed betwixt us, adding that the
King my Husband told him that he was
heartily ſorry for it, and now perceived
that our enemies were too ſtrong and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
for us, that he was reſolved now entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to affect me, and to grant unto me all
deſired ſatisfaction, he beſought me alſo
that for my part I would love him, and in
his abſence aſſiſt him in his affaires; they
both agree on this reſolution, that my
Brother ſhould depart firſt, ſtealing away
in a Caroach, and that certain dayes after
the King my Husband ſhould follow him
under pretence of going to the Chace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both very ſorry that they could not
take me with them, nevertheleſſe aſſuring
themſelves, it being known they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that none durſt offer any violence
to me, intending to make it ſpeedily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that their intention was no way to
trouble <hi>France,</hi> but only to eſtabliſh a
condition worthy of their quality, and to
ſecure their perſons, for among theſe
late troubles they alledged, that they
were not without great danger of their
lives: whether this feare of theirs were
well grounded or no, or whether they
who deſired the ruine and diviſion of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99191:44"/>
Houſe (the better to prevaile themſelves)
had cauſed ſuch alarmes to be given them,
by the daily advertiſements they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>The Evening being come, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſupper of the King was ſerved in,
my Brother changing his cloake, and muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
it about his face, went forth attended
only with one Servant, who was not
known, and walked on foot as farre as
Saint <hi>Honorius</hi> gate, where he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
provided with a Caroach which he
borrowed of a Lady for that purpoſe, into
which being mounted, he came as farre as
certaine houſes about a quarter of a mile
from <hi>Paris,</hi> where having horſes that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him, he there planted himſelf in the
Saddle, and about a mile from thence, hee
was ſaluted by two or three hundred horſe
of his ſervants, who made there their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous
accordingly, as he appointed;
they perceived not at Court his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
till about nine of the clock in the
evening; the King and Queen my mother
demanded of me why he was not at ſupper
with them, and if he were in health or no;
I replyed, that I ſaw him not ſince dinner,
they ſent into his chamber to know what
the buſineſſe was, forthwith it was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that he was not there, they gave order
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99191:44"/>
that they ſhould ſearch all the chambers of
the Ladies to which he was accuſtomed to
goe, they ſought him in the Caſtle, and in,
and round about the Citie; but they found
him not; Immediately the Alarme wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hot, the King grew into a rage, and
ſwolne with choler and deſpite, he ſent to
all the Princes and Lords of the Court,
commanding them to take horſe, and to
bring him back either alive or dead, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that he was gone to trouble his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and to make warre againſt him, and
that he would make him underſtand the
folly he committed in oppoſing a Prince
ſo puiſſant as himſelfe. Many of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Lords refuſed this commiſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating
unto the King, of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
it was, and that they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
their lives in the ſervice of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
as their duties did oblige them, but to
goe againſt Monſieur his Brother, they
well knew that the day would come,
when his Majeſtie would give them but
little thanks for it, and aſſured him that
my Brother would undertake nothing
that might be diſpleaſing to his Majeſtie,
or prejudicial to the State, that peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it was ſome diſcontent that invited
him to remove from Court, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it were expedient that the King ſhould
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99191:45"/>
firſt ſend unto him to informe himſelfe of
the occaſion that moved him to depart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he took a reſolution to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him with ſo extreame a rigour; but
others there were that accepted this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and prepared themſelves to take
horſe, their diligence could not make that
diſpatch, but it was firſt upon the break of
day, which was the cauſe that they could
not finde my brother, and were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to returne, as being not in equipage of
warre; The King for all this was not
more favourable to the King my husband,
but looked with the ſame eye of diſregard
upon him as before, the which confirmed
him in his reſolution, ſo that within a few
daies after, he retired himſelf from Court,
pretending that he was gone on hunting.
For me, the teares which (all that night
after my Brothers departure) were my
companions, had brought on the next
morning ſo great a Rewme on one ſide of
my face, that by reaſon of a fever, I was
conſtrained certain daies to keep my bed,
being very ill, and overcome with many
ſorrows, during which time of ſickneſſe,
the King my husband, whether he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
to prepare for his departure, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being about to leave the Court, he
would beſtow on pleaſure the little time
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99191:45"/>
he had to ſtay, and delight himſelf with the
preſence and company of his Miſtris Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>de Sauva,</hi> had not the leiſure to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
me, but retiring to his reſt at his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
houres, which were about one or
two a clock after mid-night, I knew not of
his comming, we lying in two beds, as our
uſuall manner was, and riſing before I
was awake to be at the riſing of the Queen
my mother, to which as I have ſaid, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>de Sauva</hi> was accuſtomed to goe, he
not ſo much as ſpake unto me, as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
my Brother, and departed in the ſame
manner, without bidding me farewell:
For all this, I was ſuſpected by the King
to be the only cauſe of his departure, who
was ſo incenſed againſt me, that if he had
not been retained by the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I beleeve his choler had wrought
ſome crueltie againſt my life, but reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by her, and daring not doe-worſe, he
ſuddenly whiſpered in my mothers eare,
that it were requiſite, I had a Guard ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me; to keep me from following the
King my husband, and to debar any from
comming to me, that I might not adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
my Brother and him of the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at Court. The Queene my Mother
willing to doe all things with clemency,
told him, that ſhe held it alſo to be very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99191:46"/>
neceſſary, being very glad that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
a little the firſt edge and fury of his
Choler, but ſaid withall, that ſhe would
goe and prepare me to endure my bondage
with patience, alleaging that thoſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
would not allwayes continue in
the ſame termes, that all things in this
world had two faces, that the firſt which
was darke and frightfull, being turned,
when we ſhould come to behold the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
more ſweet and ſmiling, that on
thoſe new events, wee would take new
counſells, that then peradventure he
might have need of my ſervice, that as
wiſedome did adviſe him to live with his
friends, as chancing one day to prove his
enemies, and therefore not too much to
truſt them, ſo friendſhip diſſolving, and
being of power to hurt, the ſame wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
did counſell him to uſe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as chancing one day to prove his
friends.</p>
            <p>Theſe demonſtrances withheld the King
from doing me any hurt, to which he had a
great deſire, but <hi>le Guaſt</hi> aſſiſted him with
an Invention to diſcharge his choler ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, and cauſed him (to doe me the
greateſt diſpleaſure in the world) to ſend
ſome ſwordmen to the houſe of <hi>Chaſtelas</hi>
the Coſin of <hi>Torigny,</hi> and under pretence
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99191:46"/>
of bringing her to the King to drown her
in the river that was neere unto his houſe;
they being arrived, <hi>Chaſtelas</hi> gave them
free admiſſion into his houſe, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing; they ſeeing her, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them uſing as much indiſcretion as
violence in the ruinous charge which was
committed to them, took hold of <hi>Torigny,</hi>
and binding her, did lock her in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
till their horſes were bayted; in the
mean time, behaving themſelves after the
French manner, not regarding what might
happen, they crammed themſelves up to
the very throates with the beſt proviſion
that the houſe afforded. <hi>Chaſtelas,</hi> who
was a diſcreet man, not caring at all if by
the expence of his victualls, he could gain
any time to deferre the departure of his
Coſin, hoping that who hath time, hath
life, and that God might change the Kings
heart, and countermand thoſe people to
deſiſt from ſo great a cruelty, durſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
by any other way to hinder them,
though he had freinds and means enough,
but God who alway looked on my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to deliver me from the danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
which my enemies procured me,
prepared an unexpected ſuccour to reſcue
<hi>Torigny,</hi> which was this; Certain groomes
and Chamberlaines having fled for feare
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99191:47"/>
of theſe ſpoylers, who kept a knocking
and a bouncing within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in a houſe of
pillage, being gone ſome quarter of a mile
from the houſe, God guided that way, <hi>la
Ferte</hi> and <hi>Avantigny</hi> with their troupes,
who were about two hundred horſe, and
were now going to joyne themſelves to the
Body of my Brothers army, and it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that amongſt the troupes of Peaſants,
<hi>La Ferte</hi> beheld a Servant of <hi>Chaſtelas,</hi>
with an afflicted and dolefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and knowing him, asked if there
were any Souldiers, who paſſing by that
way, had done his maſter wrong, the
groome anſwered no, and that the cauſe
which ſo tormented him, was the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in which he left his Maſter, for the
violence offered to his Coſin; Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>La Ferte</hi> and <hi>Avantigny</hi> reſolved to doe
me that good office, to deliver <hi>Torigny,</hi>
prayſing God, that gave them ſo good an
occaſion to witneſſe their ſervice and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to me, and galloping in full ſpeed,
they and all their troupes arrived ſo aptly
at <hi>Chaſtelas</hi> his houſe, that they found
theſe rude fellows on the point of putting
<hi>Torigny</hi> on a horſe, to leade her out to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rowne her; the Horſmen comming all
into the Court with their Swords drawne,
cryed out, Forbeare you Villaines, if
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99191:47"/>
you doe her any violence, you are but
dead! and charging on them, they did fly
away, leaving their priſoner tranſported
now with joy, as before with fear, and
having thanked God and them for this ſo
needfull a deliverance, ſhe cauſed the
Charriot of her Coſin <hi>Chaſtelas</hi> to be
made ready, and accompanied with him,
went with this guard of honeſt men to find
my Brother, who was very glad being
not able to have me with him, to have
there one whom ſo intirely I affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>While the King made this goodly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
to ſacrifice <hi>Torigny</hi> to his anger, the
Queen my Mother who knew nothing of
it came into my Chamber to viſite me, as
I was then making my ſelfe ready, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
with my ſelfe, though I was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the rhewme, yet more ſick in
minde then body by reaſon of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which poſſeſſed me, to go that day
abroad to ſee a little the courſe of the
world on theſe new accidents, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in feare leaſt they ſhould enterpriſe
any thing againſt my Brother and the
King my Husband; My Mother ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, Daughter you need not make
ſuch haſte to dreſſe you, grieve not I pray
at what I ſhall deliver, I aſſure my ſelfe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99191:48"/>
that you doe not think it ſtrange that the
King findes himſelfe offended with your
Brother and your Husband, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the friendſhip that is between you,
believing that you knew of their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he is reſolved to keep you as a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage
of them; he knows how your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
loves you, and that he cannot have a
better gage of him than you, for this cauſe
he hath commanded that a Guard ſhould
be ſet over you, to hinder you that you
ſhould not ſtirre from your Chamber:
His Counſell alſo hath repreſented to
him, that if you were at freedome amongſt
us, you would diſcover whatſoever is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt your Brother and your
Husband, and acquaint them with it.
I deſire you not to grow impatient at this
reſtraint, it ſhall not God willing laſt
long, grieve not your ſelfe that I dare
not come unto you as often as I would,
for I am afraid to give ſuſpition to the
King, but aſſure your ſelfe I will not
permit that any violence ſhall be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and I will labour to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of my power to conclude a peace for
the reconcilement of your Brothers. I
repreſented to her how great was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
that in this I did receive; I would
not deny but that my Brother did alwaies
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99191:48"/>
communicate to me his juſt diſcontents,
but for the King my Husband, ſince <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigny</hi>
was taken from me, we had not ſo
much as talked together, that he came not
to viſite me in my ſickneſſe, nor yet did
ſo much as bid me adieu when he went
away: ſhe replyed theſe be ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
between a Husband and a Wife,
but I know that with kinde words and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
he will regain your heart, and if he
ſhould ſend you word to come unto him,
that you would goe, to which the King
my Sonne will no way give conſent. She
returning I remained certain moneths in
that eſtate, having not any, not ſo much as
my familiar and moſt private friends that
came to ſee me, for feare of the Kings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.
At Court adverſity is alwayes
alone, as proſperity is accompanied, and
perſecution is ſeldome any where aſſiſted
with true and conſtant friends; only the
brave <hi>Grillon</hi> was he who deſpiſing all
prohibitions came five or ſix times into
Chamber ſo aſtoniſhing and frighting the
Cerberuſſes that were ſet to guard my
my doore, that they durſt neither grant,
nor deny him entrance: During this time
the King my Husband being arrived in his
government, and having aſſembled his
friends and ſervants they did demonſtrate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99191:49"/>
unto him what an unkindneſſe and injury
he committed in not taking his leave of
me, nor in ſo much as bidding me fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
at his departure, telling him that
I had underſtanding enough to doe him
ſervice, and that it was needfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
me, that he ſhould receive much
profit by my love and by my preſence, if
things being reconciled, he could have me
with him. He was eaſie to be perſwaded
to this, being removed from that Circe
Madame <hi>de Sauva</hi> whoſe charms had loſt
their force by her abſence, which in her
preſence rendred him without reaſon to
apprehend the policies of our adverſaries,
and that the ſeparation and diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us was as prejudiciall to himſelfe as
unto me; he wrote unto me a very honeſt
letter in which he deſired me to forget
whatſoever had paſſed betwixt us, and
to believe that for the time to come he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
would affect me, which he would
make more apparent to me then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had done, commanding me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
him of the paſſages of the Court-affaires,
and of my own eſtate, and of my
Brothers, for though they were friends,
they were removed from intelligence, my
Brother being in <hi>Champagne</hi> and the King
my Husband in <hi>Gaſcony;</hi> I received that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99191:49"/>
letter being yet a Captive which brought
much comfort to me, and I failed not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
(although the Guard were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that I ſhould not be ſuffered to
write) being aided with neceſſity the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of invention, to ſend oftentimes my
letters to him.</p>
            <p>Certain dayes after my reſtraint, my
Brother knew of my captivity, which did
ſo much incenſe him, that had he not plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his heart as great an affection to
his Country, as he had a part and intereſt
in the State, he had made ſo cruell a war,
as he had then the means, commanding a
brave army, that the people had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the puniſhment for the errour of
their Prince, but retained by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
obligation and affection, hee
wrote to the Queen my Mother, that
if they uſed me ſo ungently they would
throw him into the bottome of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
ſhe fearing to ſee the occaſion of
this warre brought to ſuch an extreamity,
that ſhe knew not how to pacifie it, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the King of what importance it
was, and found him diſpoſed to receive
her reaſons, his anger being qualified by
the knowledge of the danger wherein he
was, being ſeized on in <hi>Languedock, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcogny,
Dauphine,</hi> and <hi>Poictou</hi> by the King
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99191:50"/>
my Husband, and the Huguenots, who
held many goodly Towns and forts; and
by my Brother in <hi>Champagne</hi> who had a
great army compoſed of the braveſt of the
nobility in <hi>France,</hi> and ſince this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of my Brother, being himſelfe not
able either by perſwaſions, threatnings,
or commands, to make any take horſe or
to oppoſe my Brother, all the Princes and
Lords of <hi>France</hi> providently forbearing to
put their finger betwixt two grinding
Milſtones; All this conſidered, the King
gave open eare to the Declaration of the
Queen my Mother, and was as deſirous
as her ſelfe to have a Peace eſtabliſhed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
her that ſhe would be pleaſed to
be a means thereof. She preſently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
her ſelf to goe unto my Brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating
unto the King that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to take me with her, but the King
would not conſent unto it, believing that
I did ſerve him as a ſufficient hoſtate,
thereupon ſhe took her journy without
me, and without ſo much as ſpeaking to
me, when my Brother ſeeing that I was
not with her, repreſented the juſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
which he received, and the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and rough uſage which he found at
Court, adding thereunto the injuries
which were done to me by keeping me in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99191:50"/>
durance, and the cruelty which to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
me they more then offered to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigny,</hi>
proteſting that he would lend no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are to any overture of peace untill the
wrongs which they had done me were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed,
and till he ſaw me ſatisfied, and
free. The Queen my Mother hearing
this, returned, and declared to the King
what anſwer my Brother ſent unto him,
and that it were requiſite if he deſired a
peace that ſhe ſhould go back again, but
for her to goe without me, her journey
would be ſo unprofitable, that it would
rather increaſe, then mitigate the Evill,
as alſo to take me with her, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt contented me, it might doe more
hurt then good, and that it was to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that I would return no more, but
from thence would repaire to the King
my Husband, that it was neceſſary to
take away the guard that was ſet over me,
and to finde a means to make me forget
the rough uſage which I received. This
the King found good, and ſeemed as much
affected to it as her ſelfe. Immediately
ſhe ſent for me, and told me that ſhe had
prevailed ſo much, that ſhe had prepared
things to a way of peace, that ſhe knew
that my Brother and my ſelf did ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the benefit of the State, that ſhe could
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99191:51"/>
conclude a peace ſo advantagious to my
Brother, that he ſhould have occaſion to
reſt himſelf content, and be free from the
tyrany of <hi>Le Guaſt,</hi> or whatſoever other
malicious Spirit did poſſeſſe the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and that if I would aſſiſt her in
making the accordance betwixt the King
and my Brother, I ſhould deliver her
from a great and inſupportable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
ſhee being unable without a
griefe as ſtrong as death to receive the
tidings of the Victory of the one, or other
of her ſonnes, ſhe deſired me that the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
I received might not tranſport me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to thoughts of vengeance, then of
peace; ſhe told me that the King was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that ſhe had ſeen him weep, and that he
would give me ſuch ſatisfaction, that I
ſhould remaine contented with it: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to her, that I never would preferre
my private Good to the Benefit of the
State, for the improvement and ſafety
whereof, I would willingly ſacrifice my
life, and that I deſired nothing more then a
happy peace, to the effecting whereof, I
would devote my ſelf, and all my indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors;
on this, the King came into her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet,
and with a multitude of faire words
did labour to give me ſatisfaction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
me to his friendſhip, finding that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99191:51"/>
my deportment, nor my words gave
him any apparence of the injuries I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
which I did more in contempt of
the offence that he had done unto me, then
for any ſatisfaction to him, having paſſed
the time of my captivity in the pleaſure
and exerciſe of reading, in which I then
began to delight my ſelf, owing this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
not to Fortune, but to the divine
Providence, which then began to provide
me ſo great a remedy to relieve my ſelf in
the afflictions which were prepared for
me, which ſerved me alſo as an introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to devotion, reading in that fayre
and univerſall booke of Nature, ſo many
wonders of the creator of it; for every
well tempered Soul, rearing to it ſelf a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by this knowledge, of which GOD is
the laſt and higheſt round, raviſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
doth addreſſe himſelf to the adoration
of the admirable light of that incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
Eſſence, and making a perfect
circle, delighteth not in any thing but to
follow that Homerick chaine, that exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Ring of Knowledge which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from God himſelfe, the beginning
and end of all things; And ſadneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Joy, which giveth us not leave to
conſider our own actions, rouzeth up the
Soul in its ſelf, which uniting all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99191:52"/>
to reject the evill, and to imbrace the
good, thinkes, and thinkes againe inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly,
to chooſe this Soveraigne bliſſe, in
which we may finde peace with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and theſe are thoſe pious diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that prepare us to arrive at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and the love of God. I received
theſe two benefits from the ſolitude and
griefe of my captivity, to addict my ſelfe
to reading and devotion, of which, before
I ſcarce had taſted, amidſt the vanity and
pompe of my proſperous Fortune. The
King as I have ſaid, ſeeing in me no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of diſcontent, told me that the
Queen my mother ſhould return unto my
Brother in <hi>Champagne,</hi> to mediate a peace,
and beſought me to accompany her, and to
doe there all the good offices I could, for
he knew (he ſaid) that my Brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
more truſt in me, then in any other
in the world, and that whatſoever Good
ſhould ariſe from thence, he would give
me the honour of it, and profeſſe himſelfe
obliged to me; I promiſed him what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to performe, for it conduced to
the Benefit of my Brother, and the State,
ſo to imply my ſelf, as he by it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
contentment. The Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did depart, and I with her, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Sens,</hi> the conferrence was held in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99191:52"/>
a Gentlemans houſe a mile from thence.
The morning following, wee came to the
place of conference, my Brother was
there in perſon, accompanyed with ſome
of his owne troupes, and with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Lords and Catholike Princes of his
Army, among whom alſo was Duke <hi>Caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi>
and Colonell <hi>Poux,</hi> who brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him ſixe thouſand Reiſters, by the
means of thoſe of the Religion, who were
joyned with my Brother in the behalfe of
the King my Husband. For many dayes
they treated on the peace, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, having many diſputations on the
articles, eſpecially on thoſe which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Huguenots, and the agreement
was made with conditions more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to them, then they themſelves could
wiſh, as preſently after it appeared. The
Queen my mother, the peace being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
perſwaded my Brother to ſend
back the Reiſters, and to retire himſelfe
from thoſe, from whom (being ever a
good Catholick) he had a great deſire to
ſeparate himſelfe, not willing to be ſerved
by Huguenots, but only for neceſſitie. In
this peace, there was an Eſtate aſſured to
my brother for his maintenance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his qualitie, in which my
Brother would have me compriſed, being
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99191:53"/>
very earneſt, that the aſſignation of my
dowry in Lands might be eſtabliſhed, and
Monſieur <hi>de Beauvais,</hi> who was deputed
there a party for him, inſiſted on it very
ſtrongly; but the Queen my Mother did
intreate me that I would not give way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and aſſured me that I ſhould receive
of the King what I would demand, on
which I did requeſt them, that they would
not comprehend me in the Articles, and
that whatſoever I had conferred on me, I
had rather receive it from the grace and
bounty of the King and Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
beleeving that it would be a courſe
more beneficiall, and as aſſured to
me.</p>
            <p>The peace concluded, and aſſurance ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on the one ſide, and on the other, the
Queen my mother preparing her ſelfe for
her returne, I received letters from the
King my Husband, by which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that he had a great deſire to ſee me,
intreating me, that as ſoone as I ſaw the
peace concluded, to ſue for leave to come
unto him: I beſought the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who rejected my petition, and by
all means poſſible indeavored to divert me
from it, ſaying, That when I received not
her propoſition to diſanull our marriage,
after the maſſacre of S. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> ſhe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99191:53"/>
then commended my reſolution, becauſe
my husband was made a Catholick, but
now, ſince he hath abandoned the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion, and is turned Huguenot,
ſhe could not permit that I ſhould goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and ſeeing I daily renewed my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
ſhe told me with teares in her eyes,
that if I returned not with her, ſhe ſhould
for ever looſe her credit with the King,
adding, that the King would beleeve that
ſhe had taken me with her for that intent,
and that ſhe had made a ſolemn promiſe to
him to bring me back, ſhe deſired me to
ſtay till my Brothers return, which ſhe
ſaid ſhould be with ſpeed, and that
ſuddainly after, ſhe would take order
for my diſpatch to the King my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after, we returned to
the King to <hi>Paris,</hi> who by reaſon of the
peace, received us with great joy, yet not
well liking the advantageous conditions
of the Huguenots, and determining with
himſelfe, as ſoon as he had got my Brother
to Court, to finde ſome new Invention to
begin the war again, and not let them joy
in that, to which to his grief he condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to withdraw my brother from them,
who ſtayed yet behind a moneth or two,
to give order for ſending backe the Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99191:54"/>
and for the diſmiſſing of his army,
He arrived not long after at Court, with
all the Catholick Nobilitie that aſſiſted
him; the King received him with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
ſeeming to have great joy to ſee
him there, and he made very much of <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi</hi>
alſo, who came with him, for <hi>Le Guaſt</hi>
was lately dead, being ſlaine by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God as he was in courſe of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;
he had a body infected with all ſort
of villanies, and ſubject to a corruption,
which a long time did poſſeſſe it, as the
Devills did his ſoule, to whom he did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
by Magick, and all ſort of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
this Brand of fire and diviſion being
taken from the world, and the King having
his thoughts bent only on the ruine of the
Huguenots, intended to make uſe of my
Brother to command againſt them, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my brother and them unreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and fearing alſo that to prevent it, I
would haſten to the King my husband, he
entertaind us both, as well the one, as the
other, with all the pleaſures that the
Court could yeeld, to make our ſtay there
more delightfull; and ſeeing at the ſame
time that Monſieur <hi>de Duras</hi> was ſent from
the King my husband to demand me, and
with ſo much importunity I urged to be
gone, that he no longer could denie me, he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99191:54"/>
told me (ſhewing firſt it was the love he
did beare unto me, and then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
what a Grace &amp; ornament I brought
unto his Court, which cauſed him ſo long
to ſuſpend my journey) that he would
now conduct me himſelf as far as <hi>Poictiers,</hi>
and returned Monſieur <hi>de Duras</hi> with that
aſſurance.</p>
            <p>Certaine daies after, he ſtayed at <hi>Paris,</hi>
deferring, and not openly refuſing to give
me leave to goe, till he had all things in
readineſſe for the declaration of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
warre againſt the Huguenots, and
by conſequence againſt the King my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and to give a pretence unto it, they
cauſed a rumour to be ſpread, that the
Catholicks complained of the advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conditions, to which they accorded
with the Huguenots at the peace of <hi>Sens.</hi>
This murmur and diſcontent of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
was blowne abroad, that they
came to League and unite themſelves at
Court from all the Cities and provinces
of the Kingdome, enrouling, and ſigning
themſelves, and making a great noiſe (but
privately with the Kings conſent) that
they would chooſe Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> for
Chiefe; there was no other thing ſpoken
of from <hi>Paris</hi> untill you come to <hi>Blois,</hi>
where the King had called the States to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99191:55"/>
during the overture of whom, the
King called my Brother into his cabinet
with the Queen my mother, and ſome of
the Lords of his counſell, and preſented
there unto him, of what importance for
his Authoritie and eſtate was this league,
which the Catholicks had begun, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if they ſhould come to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
heads, and to chooſe thoſe of the
Houſe of <hi>Guize;</hi> that it concerned them
(underſtanding my brother and himſelf)
more then all the reſt, that the Catholicks
had reaſon to complain, and that his duty
and conſcience did oblige him to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the Huguenots rather then the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
he intreated and conjured my
Brother, as an heire of <hi>France,</hi> and a true
Catholick, that he would counſell and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
him in this affayre, whereon the hazard
of his Crowne, and the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo much depended, adding that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to him to cut off all danger that this
League might bring, that he himſelf ought
to make the chiefe, and both to ſhew his
zeal to his Religion, and to debarre them
from chooſing any other, to ſigne himſelf
firſt as Chiefe, and then to have my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſigne, and afterwards all the Princes,
Lords and Governours, and whoſoever
had any charge or power in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99191:55"/>
My Brother could not but offer
that ſervice which he owed to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
and to the preſervation of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion. The King having taken
aſſurance of my Brothers aſſiſtance, which
was the principall end to which the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the League did tend, did ſuddenly
call all the Princes and Lords together,
and cauſing the roll of the ſaid League to
be brought unto him, he firſt there ſigned
himſelf as Chiefe, and then my Brother,
and after him all the reſt, who had not yet
ſigned. The morning following, they
opened the Eſtates, having taken advice of
the three Lord Biſhops of <hi>Lions,</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum,</hi>
and of <hi>Vienne,</hi> who perſwaded him
that after the oath made at his conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no oath made unto the Hereticks could
be of power, the ſaid oath nullifying all
other oathes and promiſes which he
could make unto the Huguenots: this
being pronounced at the opening of the
States, and warre being proclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Huguenots; the King ſent back
<hi>Geniſlac,</hi> who had been there to haſten my
departure, with rough and threatning lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
telling him that he gave his ſiſter to
a Catholick, and not unto a Huguenot,
and if that the King my husband had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to have me, he ſhould turne Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99191:56"/>
againe; all preparations for the warre
were made, there nothing elſe was ſpoken
of at Court, and to render my brother
more unreconcileable with the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,
the King made him Chiefe of one of
his Armies. <hi>Geniſlac</hi> being come to tell
me this ſad farewell, which the King had
given him, I repayred preſently to the
cloſet of the Queen my mother, where I
found the King, and complained how he
had abuſed me with delayes, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
hindered me from going to the
King my husband; and now diſſembled to
depart from <hi>Paris,</hi> to conduct me to
<hi>Poictiers,</hi> to expreſſe an effect ſo contrary.
I repreſented to him, that I was not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
for pleaſure, or to ſatisfie my owne
deſires, but that it was the deſire of King
<hi>Charles,</hi> conjoyned with my mothers, and
his owne, that ſince they had given me to
him, they could not hinder me from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my fortune with him, that I would
goe unto him, and if they refuſed to give
me leave, I would ſteale away in what
diſguiſe and faſhion that I could, though
with the hazard of my life. The King
anſwered, 'Tis not now a time (my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter)
to importune me for leave, and I
profeſſe the truth which you have ſaid, that
I have deferred your going for a while, to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99191:56"/>
denie it in the end for altogether; for ſince
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> hath turned again to
be a Huguenot, I never thought it good
that you ſhould goe unto him; that which
we have done, the Queen my mother, and
my ſelf, is for your ſafetie. I will make
warre againſt the Huguenots, and root
out that Religion, which doth us ſo much
miſchief, and there is not the leaſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of reaſon why you, who are a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
and my ſiſter, ſhould be in their
hands as an hoſtage of me, and who knows
not, but to procure unto me an irreparable
loſſe, they may revenge themſelves on
your life for the evill which I ſhall bring
upon them; no, no, you ſhall not goe, and
if you ſteale away, as you ſay you will,
underſtand that you ſhall have me and the
Queen your Mother for your cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and you ſhall feel our anger to the
uttermoſt of our power, and ſhall rather
impayre, then amend the condition of
your husband. I retired my ſelf with
great diſpleaſure from that cruell ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and taking the advice of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
of my friends at Court, they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it would ill become me to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
in a Court ſo contrary to the king
my husband, and from whence ſo openly
they made warre againſt him, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99191:57"/>
me, as long as the warres continued,
to retire my ſelfe from Court, and were it
poſſible, it were more honourable for me
to finde ſome pretence to goe out of the
kingdome, under the colour of pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
or to viſite ſome of my kindred;
Madame <hi>de Roche-ſur-yon</hi> was one of thoſe
whom I aſſembled to deſire their counſell,
who was then upon her departure to goe
to the waters of <hi>Spau.</hi> My brother was
alſo preſent, and had brought <hi>Mondoucet</hi>
with him, who was Agent for the King in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and being lately returned, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the King, with what griefe the
<hi>Flemmings</hi> ſuffered the uſurpation which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made on the Lawes of
<hi>France,</hi> for the dominion, and ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Flanders;</hi> that many of the Lords
and Commons of their cities had expreſly
commanded him to acquaint his Majeſtie
how much they ſtood addicted to the
French, and that they would lend him all
their helping hands. <hi>Mondoucet,</hi> ſeeing
the King gave no eare to his adviſe, having
nothing in his head, but the Huguenots,
who were now to feele the vengeance of
his diſpleaſure, for aſſiſting my brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, talked no more unto him of it,
but addreſſed himſelf unto my Brother,
who having the true nature of a Prince,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99191:57"/>
loved onely to enterpriſe great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things, being borne rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
then preſerve; he ſuddenly imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the enterpriſe, which pleaſed him ſo
much the more, becauſe he perceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of injuſtice in it, willing to regain
that unto <hi>France,</hi> which was uſurped by
the <hi>Spaniards; Mondoucet</hi> for this cauſe
became my Brothers ſervant, who ſent
him back to <hi>Flanders</hi> under the colour of
accompanying Madame the Princeſſe of
<hi>Roche-ſur-yon</hi> to the waters of <hi>Spau,</hi> and he
obſerving that, during theſe warres, every
one ſought a faire pretence to withdraw
me from <hi>France,</hi> whether it were into
<hi>Savoy,</hi> or into <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> or to Saint <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
or to our Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> whiſpered
theſe words into my brothers eare, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if
the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> could pretend any
malady, which the waters of <hi>Spau,</hi> whither
Madame the Princeſſe of <hi>Roche-ſur-yon</hi> is
now going, might ſerve for cure, this
would fall out very fortunately for you:
my brother much commended his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and being very glad of the diſcovery
of it, ſuddenly cryed out, My deer Queen,
ſtudy no more, for you muſt goe to the
waters of <hi>Spau,</hi> whether Madame the
Princeſſe is going; I have ſometimes
heard you complain of a ſwelling in your
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99191:58"/>
arme, you are to ſay that your Phyſitians
did then preſcribe it, but the ſeaſon was
not fitting, but now the time is ſeaſonable,
and you muſt intreat the King to give
you leave to goe. My Brother declared
not himſelf at that time, wherefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the journey, becauſe that Monſieur
the Cardinall of <hi>Burbon</hi> was then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
whom he ſuſpected for a <hi>Guiſian,</hi>
and inclined to the Spaniſh faction. For
my ſelfe, I underſtood it very well, not
doubting but it reflected on his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
for <hi>Flanders,</hi> of the which <hi>Mondoucet</hi>
had ſpoken to us both. All the company
were of this adviſe, and Madame the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of <hi>Roche-ſur-yon,</hi> who her ſelfe was
going thither, and who loved me intirely,
with great joy did apprehend and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this counſell, and promiſed to goe
with me to the Queen my mother, to have
her grant conſent unto it. On the morning
following, we found the Queene alone,
and I repreſented unto her, what a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
it was unto me, to ſee the King my
husband in a warre againſt the King, and
to be thus removed, and kept aſunder
from him, that while this warre continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it were neither expedient nor hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for me to ſtay at Court, where if I
ſtill continued, I could not avoide one of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99191:58"/>
theſe two Evills, either that the King my
husband would conceive that I ſtayed at
Court only for my owne pleaſure, and
that I aſſiſted him not as I ought to doe, or
that the King would entertaine an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that I ſent daily advertiſements to the
King my husband, that both the one and
the other would procure unto me much
affliction; I beſought her that ſhe would
be pleaſed to think well of it, if for a while
I eſtranged my ſelf from Court, to avoid
all occaſions of ſuſpition, that ſome time
was paſſed, ſince the Phyſitians preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
me the waters of <hi>Spau,</hi> for the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of my arme, to which I had a long
time been ſubject, and that the ſeaſon of
the yeere being now fitted for it, this
journey by her permiſſion would fall out
opportunely, not onely to remove me
from Court, but from <hi>France</hi> alſo; and ſo
the King my husband might underſtand,
that being unable to be with him by reaſon
of the Kings diſtruſt, I would not remaine
in that place where warre was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and that I hoped that her wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
would ſo diſpoſe of things in time,
that the King my husband ſhould obtaine
a peace of the King, and returne into his
favour, that I would attend to heare that
happy news, to have then permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99191:59"/>
unto him, and that in this voyage to
the <hi>Spau,</hi> Madame the Princeſſe of <hi>Roche-ſur-yon</hi>
(who was there preſent) would doe
me the honour to accompany me. The
Queene my mother did much applaude
my reſolution, and told me that ſhe was
glad that I had taken this adviſe, affirming
that this evill counſell which the Biſhops
gave the King, not to make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
but to breake whatſoever he had
contracted with the Huguenots for him,
had for many conſiderations, brought her
much affliction, eſpecially ſeeing this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
torrent drew along with it, and
ruined the moſt underſtanding, and the
faithfulleſt ſervants that the King had in
his counſell (for the King had thereupon
removed foure or five of the moſt noble
and apparent in all his Counſell) More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
ſhe affirmed, it left a deep impreſſion
in her, to ſee the truth of what I repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that ſtaying at Court, I could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide
one of thoſe two evills, either that
the King my husband would diſlike that
ſtay, and be off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nded at it, or that the King
would diſtruſt me, ſuppoſing that I gave
intelligence to the King my husband, ſhee
ſaid that ſhe would perſwade the King to
give conſent unto the voyage, which ſhe
did, and the King diſcourſed with me of it,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99191:59"/>
without the leaſt apparence of being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
being well content that he had diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me from my husband, whom he hated
more then all the world beſides, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that a Poſt ſhould be diſpatched
to Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who commanded
in <hi>Flanders</hi> for the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
him to give me neceſſary warrants to
paſſe freely through the countrey of his
Authority, becauſe I muſt of neceſſitie
travell through <hi>Flanders</hi> to goe to the
waters of <hi>Spau,</hi> which are in the lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Biſhop of <hi>Leige.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being determined, we ſevered our
ſelves for a little ſpace, during which time
my Brother imployed himſelfe to inſtruct
me in ſome deſired offices concerning his
enterpriſe in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the King and
Queene my mother removed to <hi>Poictiers,</hi>
to be neerer the army of Monſieur <hi>de
Mayenne,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Brovage,</hi> and
who from thence was to paſſe into <hi>Gaſcog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
to make warre againſt the King my
husband. My brother alſo was to march
with another army, of which he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
to beſiege <hi>Iſſoire,</hi> and ſome other
Townes which ſhortly after he took in,
and I prepared my ſelf for my Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> attended with Madame the
Princeſſe of <hi>Roche-ſur-yon,</hi> with Madame
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99191:60"/>
               <hi>de Tournon,</hi> my Dame of honour, with
Madame <hi>de Mouy</hi> of <hi>Picardie,</hi> with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>La Chaſtelayne</hi> of <hi>Millon,</hi> with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoſelle
<hi>d' Atrie,</hi> with Madamoſelle <hi>de
Tournon,</hi> and with ſeven or eight Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
more, and with Noblemen, as
Monſieur the Cardinall of <hi>Lenoncourt,</hi>
with Monſieur the Biſhop of <hi>Langres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with
Monſieur <hi>de Mouy</hi> Lord of <hi>Picardie,</hi> with
the chiefe Eſquires, and many other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of my houſe. This company gave
ſuch delight to ſtrangers, who found it
ſo full of ſtate and luſtre, that they had
<hi>France</hi> in farre more admiration: My litter
was of Carnation velvet, imbroydered
with works of Gold and Silke. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the worke, and the Impreſſes
were eaſie to be ſeene; this Litter was
glazed round, and every glaſſe had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in it, there being in the works of Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
and in the glaſſe, fourty different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
with Italian and Spaniſh Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes
on the Sun, and his effects; this litter
was followed with the litter of Madame
the Princeſſe of <hi>Roche-ſur-yon,</hi> and with the
litter of Madame <hi>de Tournon,</hi> my Dame of
Honour, and with ten wayting Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women
on Horſe, with their governeſſe,
and with ſixe caroaches, in which the reſt
of the Ladies and women were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:99191:60"/>
I paſſed through <hi>Picardie,</hi> where the
Citties had commandment from the King
to receive me as if himſelf were preſent,
and they did me all the honour that I
could deſire. Being arrived at <hi>Caſtelet,</hi>
which is a fort three miles from the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
of <hi>Cambreſis,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
whoſe Church acknowledged not then
the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but for her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
ſent a Gentleman unto me, to know
the houre of my departure thence, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to meet me at my entrance into his
Lands, where I found him well attended
with people, who had the habite and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence
of true <hi>Flemmings,</hi> as they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
groſſe in thoſe parts. The Biſhop was
of the Houſe of <hi>Barlemont,</hi> one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
houſes in <hi>Flanders,</hi> but who in a
Flemmiſh breſt had a Spaniſh heart, as
they made it apparent to me, being one of
thoſe that did moſt aſſiſt <hi>Don John,</hi> but yet
he received me with great honour, and
no leſſe Spaniſh ceremonies. I found this
Citie of <hi>Cambray,</hi> although not builded
with ſuch ſtrong materialls as curs of
<hi>France,</hi> yet farre more delightfull, the
Cities and houſes thereof being better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed,
and proportioned, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
very faire and large, a common orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all the Townes in <hi>France;</hi> that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99191:61"/>
which I found in this Citie moſt remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
was the Cittadell, one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and faireſt in Chriſtendome, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſince under the obedience of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Spaniards to their coſts have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
A noble and worthy Gentleman,
Monſieur <hi>de Ainſi</hi> was the Governour of
it, who in grace, in preſence, and all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
requiſite to a perfect Gentleman, was
nothing inferiour to our moſt accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
Courtiers, and no way partaking of
that naturall clowniſhneſſe, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
proper to the <hi>Flemmings.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
made us a banquet, and delighted us
after ſupper, with the pleaſure of a Maske,
to which all the Ladies of that Citie came,
but being there himſelf not preſent (for
ſuddenly after the ſupper, he retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
being as I have ſaid, of a Spaniſh and
ceremonious humour) Monſieur <hi>de Ainſi,</hi>
the moſt apparent in that troupe, was
left behinde, to entertaine me at the
Maske, and to have me afterwards to a
Collation of confects, but very unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as I conceive, for this was he who had
the charge of the Cittadell; I ſpeake this
having learned it to my own expence, and
knowing more (then I would deſire) what
belongeth to the guarditg of ſuch a place.
The remembrance of my brother being
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99191:61"/>
not to be divided from my heart, becauſe
I loved nothing more then him, I often
did thinke on the inſtructions which he
had given me, and ſeeing a fayre opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
offered to doe him good ſervice in
his enterpriſe for <hi>Flanders,</hi> this Citie and
Cittadell being the key thereof, I quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and imployed all the underſtanding
which God had given me to render Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Ainſi</hi> affectioned to <hi>France,</hi> and
more particular to my Brother, God gave
ſuch a bleſſing to my diſcourſe, that he
delighted with it, determined to ſtay with
me as long as poſſibly he could, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
me during the time I ſtayed in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and to this intent, he demanded
leave of his maſter to goe with me to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
where Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
me, ſaying, That he deſired to ſee the
triumphs of that entertainment. This
Flemming Spanioliz'd was notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſo ill adviſed to let him goe, during
this voyage, which continued ten or
twelve daies, he ſpake unto me as often as
he could, openly demonſtrating that he
had a heart addicted to the <hi>French,</hi> &amp; that
he only deſired to live to ſee the houre
wherein he might have ſo brave a Prince
as my Brother for his Lord and Maſter,
deſpiſing the ſervice and commands of his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99191:62"/>
Biſhop, who although he was his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
was but a Gentleman as himſelfe,
and farre inferiour to him in the qualities
and graces both of minde and body.</p>
            <p>Departing from <hi>Cambray,</hi> I lodged the
night enſuing at <hi>Valenciennes</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi>
where Monſieur the Count of <hi>Lalain,</hi>
Monſieur <hi>de Montigny</hi> his brother, and
many other Gentlemen to the number of
two or three hundred came to receive me
at my comming out of the principality of
<hi>Cambreſis,</hi> unto which place the Biſhop of
<hi>Cambray</hi> conducted me. Being arrived at
<hi>Valenciennes,</hi> a Town inferiour to <hi>Cambray</hi>
in force, but not in the ornament of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
buildings and of Churches, where the
fountaines and the Clocks with induſtry
proper to the <hi>Almains</hi> gave not a little
cauſe of wonder to the <hi>French,</hi> it being
not ordinary with them to hear the clocks

Monſieur the Count of <hi>Lalain,</hi> the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>roupe, where his wife and his faire Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Madame <hi>de Aurec</hi> and the moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
and braveſt Ladies of that country
attended to receive me; He told me he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99191:62"/>
was Coſin to the King my Husband, and he
was a perſon of great authority and eſtate,
to whom the <hi>Spainiſh</hi> inſolence was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
odious, being ſtrongly incenſed
againſt them ſince the death of the Count
of <hi>Aigmont</hi> who was his neer kinſman, and
although he maintained his government
without being leagued with the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> or the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> being a thrice
Catholick Lord, yet he could not endure
to ſee <hi>Don John,</hi> or permit that either he
or any of his ſhould enter into his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Don John</hi> not daring force him to
the contrary, fearing that then the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick
league in <hi>Flanders</hi> called the League
of the Eſtates would unite themſelves with
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
wiſely foreſeeing, what a ſtorm and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
would enſue, as they have proved ſince
who have governed there for the King of
<hi>Spain.</hi> The Count of <hi>Lalain</hi> could not
ſufficiently expreſſe what a joy he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to ſee me, and if his native Prince had
then been preſent, he could not be received
with more honour and demonſtrations of
wellcome and affection. Arriving at
Monts at the Countes of <hi>Lalain</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
foureſcore or a hundred Ladies of the
City and Country, of whom I was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not as a ſtrange Princeſſe, but as if I
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99191:63"/>
had been their Soveraign by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of inheritance, the diſpoſition of
the <hi>Femmings</hi> is to be private, merry, and
familiar, and the Counteſſe of <hi>Lalain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this diſpoſition, and having a great
and high Spirit, it gave me preſently an
aſſurance that it were no difficult matter
to enter into a ſtrict friendſhip with her:
The houre of ſupper being come, ſhe went
to the Banquet, and after to dancing which
the Count of <hi>Lalain</hi> continued all the
time of my aboad at <hi>Monts,</hi> which was
longer then I determined, intending to
depart the morning following, but this
good woman inforced me to ſtay a ſeventh
night with them, which I was unwilling to
doe, fearing to overcharge them, nor was
it poſſible for me to perſwade her husband
or her ſelfe, but they enforced me to ſtay
till the eighth day were expired, living
with ſuch familiarity with me, ſhe ſtayed
at my lying down very late, and would
have ſtaied longer but that ſhe did what
was very rare to doe in perſons of her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which notwithſtanding did witneſſe
a nature attended with great goodneſſe,
ſhe nouriſhed her infant with her own milk
ſo that being one morning at the feaſt, and
ſitting next unto me at the table which is
the place where they of that Country doe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99191:63"/>
communicate themſelves with greateſt
friendſhip, and ayming at nothing but my
content, which was altogether to advance
my Brothers deſignes in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſhe being
curiouſly dreſt and almoſt covered with
precious ſtones and rich imbroyderies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on a Kirtle of cloath of gold, whoſe
ground was black, wrought with curious
workes of imbroydery and purles of gold
and ſilver, and a doublet of Cloath of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whoſe ground was white, wrought
with flowers of gold, and buttoned with
great diamonds (a habit proper to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Nurſe) they brought unto the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her little childe, as richly dreſſed as
was the Nurſe that gave it ſuck, ſhe ſet the
Childe on the table betwixt us both, and
freely unbuttoning her ſelfe ſhe gave her
breſt unto her little one; this had been
counted incivility in any elſe, but ſhe did
doe it with ſo great a grace and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as her actions were all accompanied
with it, that ſhe received by it as much
commendation, as the company delight.
The banquet being ended, the dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in the ſame Hall wherein we were,
which was very faire and a large roome,
where being ſeated one next unto another,
I told her that although the pleaſures
which I received in her company might
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99191:64"/>
well be ranked in the firſt number of thoſe
which gave me greateſt reaſon to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them, yet I could almoſt wiſh that
(never had enjoyed them, by reaſon of the
griefe I ſhould receive in departing from
her, and that Fortune ſhortly would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us from ever ſeeing one another, it
being to be numbred amongſt the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of my life, that heaven had not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that ſhe and I ſhould live in one and
the ſame Country. This I ſpake to make
her enter into conference which might
ſerve for the deſignes of my Brother; ſhee
replyed to me, this Country hath been
ſometimes part of <hi>France,</hi> and for this cauſe
their pleadings in law are yet in <hi>French,</hi>
and this naturall affection is not departed
from the hearts of the moſt of us, for my
part I have no other deſire in my Soule,
ſince I have had the honour to have ſeen
you; ſometimes indeed this Country
ſtood affected to the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but
that affection hath been torn from us in the
deaths of the Count of <hi>Aigmont,</hi> of Monſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur
<hi>de Horn</hi> of Monſieur <hi>de Montigny</hi> and of
the other Lords who were all our neer
Coſins, that were then defeated, and pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Nobility of this Country, we
have nothing ſo odious as the Spaniſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and deſire nothing more, then
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99191:64"/>
to be delivered from their tyranny, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
we know not yet how to effect it,
becauſe this Country is divided into diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Religions, but had we been united,
we had thrown out the <hi>Spanyard</hi> long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,
but this diviſion doth render us too
feeble for them: I would to God that
your Brother the King of <hi>France</hi> would be
pleaſed to recover this Country, which in
times precedent was his own, we would
lend him all our helping hands; ſhe ſpake
not this in an unadviſed ſuddaines but with
premeditation to finde from <hi>France</hi> ſome
remedy for their evils. I ſeeing the way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to what ſo much I did deſire, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
The King of <hi>France</hi> my Brother is
not diſpoſed to undertake forrain warres,
eſpecially at this preſent, having in his
own kingdome the factious party of the
Huguenots which is grown ſo ſtrong, that
continually it will hinder him from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing
any wars abroad, but my Brother
Monſieur <hi>de Alenſon</hi> who is nothing inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in valour, wiſedome, and in bounty to
the Kings my Fathers and my Brothers,
will readily attend this enterpriſe, and will
have no leſſe meanes to bring ſuccour to
you, then the King of <hi>France</hi> by Brother,
he is trained up in war, and eſteemed one
of the braveſt Captains of this age, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99191:65"/>
now commandeth the Kings army againſt
the Huguenots, with which he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſince my departure a very ſtrong town
called <hi>Iſſoire,</hi> and ſome others, you cannot
ſeek unto a Prince whoſe ſuccour ſhall be
more profitable to you, being ſo neer your
neighbour, and having ſo great a Realme
as <hi>France</hi> at his devotion, from whence he
may bring all the means and commodities
neceſſary for the warre, and if he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that good office from the Count
your Husband, you may aſſure your ſelves
that you ſhall have what part in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
that you will defire; my Brother is
of a noble diſpoſition not ingratefull, and
who delighteth in nothing more then in
acknowledging a ſervice or good office
done; he doth much reſpect and imbrace
Gentlemen of courage and of honour, and
is alſo followed with the braveſt of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of <hi>France;</hi> I believe they will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude a peace in <hi>France</hi> with the
Huguenots, and that at my return I ſhall
ſee it accompliſhed; If the Count your
Husband be of the ſame reſolution as you
are, and of the ſame deſire, let him (if he
pleaſe) acquaint me with it, and I will
diſpoſe my Brother to undertake it, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
my ſelfe that this Country and your
houſe by it in particular will receive all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99191:65"/>
happineſſe: And if my Brother ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
himſelfe here, you may aſſure
your ſelfe you ſhall ſee me often, our
friendſhip being ſuch that never any Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entertained a Siſter with more perfect
love: She received this declaration with
much content, and told me that ſhe ſpake
not this at adventure, but ſeeing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
I had done her to affect her, ſhe was
reſolved not to leave me, untill ſhe had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to me the eſtate in which her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was, and till ſhe had required that
ſome remedy might be brought from
<hi>France</hi> to releaſe them from the feare in
which they lived, being in perpetuall
warre and danger to ſtoope to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and tyranny of <hi>Spaine;</hi> She intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me that with my conſent ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto her Husband the communication
that paſſed betwixt us, that on the next
morning they both together might talke
unto me of it, I very gladly conſented to
it, and we paſſed away that afternoone in
ſuch diſcourſes, and in what ever elſe I
thought might doe my Brother ſervice, in
which I found that ſhe received great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>The dancing being ended, we repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to heare Veſpers among the Canoneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which is a Religious order that we
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99191:66"/>
have not in <hi>France,</hi> they are Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which are placed there very young,
for the improvement of their marriages,
untill they are of age for husbands, they
lodge not in common dormitories, but in
ſeverall roomes, and in every roome there
are three or foure, or five or ſix young
Gentlewomen with an old woman, of
which old women, there is a certaine and
diſtinct number, who are never married,
nor the Abbeſſe of them, they onely weare
the habite of Religion in the morning at
Mattens, and in the afternoone at Veſpers,
and as ſoone as ſervice is ended, they put
off their religious habite, and apparell
themſelves as other Gentlewomen that
are to marry, going freely with them to
the banquettings and dancing, ſo that they
dreſſe themſelves foure times a day, they
were every day at the banquet, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ordinarily after it. The Counteſſe
of <hi>Lalain</hi> thought it long till the evening
was come, to acquaint her husband with
the good beginnings which ſhe had given
to theſe affaires, which having done, in the
morning ſhe brought her husband to me,
who made a long diſcourſe of the juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
which he had to free himſelf from
the tyranny of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in which he
intended not to undertake any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99191:66"/>
his naturall Prince, knowing that
the Soveraignty of <hi>Flanders</hi> belonged to
the King of <hi>France,</hi> he repreſented to me
what means he had to eſtabliſh my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> having all <hi>Hainault</hi> at his
devotion, which extended as farre as <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,</hi>
he only was in doubt of <hi>Cambreſis,</hi>
which lay betwixt <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Hainault,</hi>
and told me it would be expedient for me
to gaine Monſieur <hi>de Ainſi,</hi> to which I
replyed, that I would beſeech him rather
that he would be pleaſed to ſpeak himſelf
unto him, which he could doe more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then my ſelf, being both his neighbour
and his friend; having then preſented to
him what eſtimation and aſſurance he
might make of the friendſhip of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that the Fortune he ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in, ſhould be with as much greatnes
and authoritie as the remarkeable ſervice
received from a perſon of his Quality
could merit; we reſolved at my returne to
<hi>France,</hi> that I ſhould ſtay at <hi>La fere,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Brother ſhould come unto me,
and that Monſieur <hi>de Montigny</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the ſaid Count of <hi>Lalain</hi> ſhould
come to treate there with him on
thoſe affaires; during the time of my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
there, I did encourage him alwayes,
and fortifie him in that reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99191:67"/>
his wife brought no leſſe affection then my
ſelf; And the day being come that I muſt
depart from this goodly company at
<hi>Monts,</hi> it was not without great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
griefe of all the Flemmiſh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and my ſelf, and above all, of the
Counteſſe of <hi>Lalain,</hi> by reaſon of the great
friendſhip which ſhe had vowed to me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
inforced me to promiſe her, to make
my return that way, as I paſſed into <hi>France.</hi>
I did give unto her a Carcanet of Jewells,
and to her husband a ſeale of pretious
ſtones, which were eſteemed of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
but farre more pretious to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they came from the hand of one
whom ſo intirely they affected; all the
Ladies ſtayed behind, except the Lady of
<hi>Aurec,</hi> who did goe with me to <hi>Namur,</hi>
her husband Monſieur <hi>de Aurec,</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Duke of <hi>Arſcot</hi> ſtaying there, ever
ſince the peace betwixt the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
and the States of <hi>Flanders;</hi> for though
they were both on the States ſide, the
Duke of <hi>Arſcot</hi> was an ancient Courtier,
and one of the moſt remarkable in King
<hi>Phillips</hi> Court, at what time he was in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> and he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in great eſteeme, and next unto the
Grandyes of his Court. The Count of
<hi>Lalain,</hi> with all the Nobilitie of that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99191:67"/>
Countrey conducted me above two miles
beyond his government, untill he ſaw the
troupe of Don <hi>John</hi> appeare, then he took
his leave of me, becauſe he would not ſee
him, only Monſieur <hi>de Ainſi</hi> did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
me, becauſe his maſter the Biſhop of
<hi>Cambray</hi> was of the Spaniſh faction. That
faire troupe being returned, having travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a little farther, I was encountered by
Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who was attended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
with many people, but onely with
twenty or thirty horſe, and with the
Lords, the Duke of <hi>Arſcot,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de
Aurec,</hi> the Marqueſſe of <hi>Varambon,</hi> and
young <hi>Balenſon,</hi> Governour for the King
of <hi>Spaine</hi> in the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
which Noble and gallant Gentlemen, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that I paſſed that way, were come in
a full ſpeed to meet me: of Don <hi>Johns</hi>
owne people, there were none of any
name or faſhion, but one <hi>Lodovick de Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zagua,</hi>
who ſtiled himſelfe Coſin to the
Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the reſt were but meane
people, and of a ſervile countenance, there
being not any with him of the nobility of
<hi>Flanders:</hi> He alighted from his horſe,
and ſet foot on ground to ſalute me in my
litter, which was lifted up, and opened
round; I ſaluted in the French garbe, both
him, the Duke of <hi>Arſcot,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99191:68"/>
Aurec;</hi> after ſome complements, mounting
againe his horſe, he diſcourſed with me
till he brought me to the Towne, whither
we could not come but very late, becauſe
the Ladies at <hi>Monts</hi> detained us as long
as poſſibly they could, ſpending above an
houre in the obſervation of my litter, and
taking great delight to underſtand the
manner, and the devices of it. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of their building was ſo beautifull at
<hi>Namur,</hi> as the Spaniards are excellent
that way, and their Towne ſo lightſome,
that the windowes and the ſhops being
full of ſplendor, one might beleeve that he
ſaw a new day to ſhine there. That night
Don <hi>John</hi> cauſed me and my traine to be
ſerved in our own lodgings and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
thinking that after ſo long a journey,
it would be unmannerly to tire us againe
with the tediouſneſſe of a banquet. The
houſe wherein he lodged me, was well
accomodated to receive me, where they
found means to make a great and fayre
hall, and an appartement for me of
chambers and cloſets, which were hung
round with the faireſt, richeſt, and braveſt
moveables, that I beleeve were ever ſeen,
being all tapiſtries of Velvet or Satten, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſſed

were preſented to him, being then at <hi>Myl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>

remembrance of the glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement
of them, he wrought the bed

in a moſt rich imbroidery, repreſenting
the glorious victory in that battell, which

continued all ſupper time. The Banquet
being ended, and dancing having laſted

<hi>Don John</hi> accompanied me in the Boat,

where that night I was to lodge, which is

Monſieur <hi>de Ainſi</hi> who was the laſt that

griefe took his farewell of me, and with

which did ſo oppreſſe her heart that the

Death, I will relate this tragicall ſtory
in its own place, it being ſo remarkable.
The other was that arriving at <hi>Huy</hi> a town
ſcituate on the declining of a hill, there
brake forth on a ſuddain, ſo impetuous a
torrent falling from the Mountain waters
into the river, that ingroſſing and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all at once, we could no ſooner leape
to land and run with all the ſpeed we could

floud was there as ſoon as we. My lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99191:70"/>
was on the upper and higheſt part of
the Town, where that night we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with what proviſion the Maſter of the

that vaſt Deluge, from which it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully

for on the dawning of the day the waters
were all returned, and retired within their

Monſieur and Madame <hi>de Aurec</hi> returned to

town is great as <hi>Lyons,</hi> and almoſt of the

there being no Religious Houſe which

with <hi>German</hi> induſtry, ſinging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
all variety of Muſick and of

out of my Boat, and conducted me into
a faire and ſtately Palace, ſo richly painted,
and ſet forth with ſo much Gold and
Marble, that there is nothing more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent

her tombe to crave pardon for what his

leave his body for a time without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence

this promiſed, wrought much in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
ſeeing that not only of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
I muſt paſſe either amongſt the one or

Monſieur the Cardinall of <hi>Lenoncourt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuſpected to favour the Huguenots,
and Monſieur <hi>de Deſcarts,</hi> who was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>de Tournon,</hi> who knowing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

five or ſixe dayes journey to <hi>La Fere</hi> being

me with teares in their eyes, that

them was ſick, and the other ſtooped with
the weight of Age, they deſired me not to
forbeare to make long journeys, and that
they would indeavour themſelves to the

ſpake unto the Biſhop of <hi>Leigh,</hi> who was
indeed a Father to me, and gave me his

as farre as I would deſire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was needfull for us to have

he returned thence no more, I expected

that ſhould I have waited till he

was money enough to defray the charges of

cauſed my horſes to be ſtaied, giving this

Madame the Princeſſe of <hi>Roche-ſur-yon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not able to indure this indignity, and
ſeing the danger wherein I was did lend me
what money I thought neceſſary, and they
remaining confuſed at it, I departed thence
having made a preſent to the Biſhop of a
Diamond worth three thouſand Crowns,
&amp; given to all his ſervants either chains or
King of gold, and I came to <hi>Huy</hi> having no

(as all the people there knew of the

and would no longer acknowledge the

ſeized on the Caſtle of <hi>Namur</hi> in my travails
that way, as ſoon as we were lodged, their
drums did beat an Alarm, and they brought
their artillery into the ſtreet, and made
Barricadoes againſt my lodging, ſtretching

theſe perplexities, without having the

warre againſt them, and was taken by them

for their mortall enemy; this town when

               </gap> dominering now

acknowledged any maſter. As ſoon as
they beheld a troupe great as mine to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
their Suburbs, the alarum grew
hot amongſt them, they forſook their glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to run to armes, and all in a tumult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed
of opening the gate they barred it

with the Harbingers and the Marſhall
of my lodging to intreate them to give me
paſſage, but I found them at the gate cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thoſe who did not underſtand them.
In the end I ſtood up in the Litter, and
taking of my Mask, I made a ſigne to the

him to cauſe ſilence to be made, to
the end I might be underſtood, which with
much a doe being obtained, I declared to
them who I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the occaſion of my
Voyage, that ſo farre it was from me to
bring any hurt unto them by my comming
that I would not give them the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, I intreated them to permit me
and my women onely to enter into the
Town, with as few of my Men as they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99191:78"/>
pleaſed, telling them that I would leave
the reſt behinde me in the Suburbs; they
accepted of this propoſition, and I came
into the Town with the moſt apparent of
my troupe in which number was the grand
Maſter of the Biſhop of <hi>Leige,</hi> who by
chance was knowne as I entred into
my lodging, environed with this people
drunken and armed, then they began to
cry out, that they were injured, and to
charge upon him who was a reverend man
of foureſcore yeers of age, having a white
beard down to his girdle. I cauſed him
to make haſte into my lodging againſt
which theſe drunkards plyed their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſes
with volleyes of ſhot as thick as
haile, the walls being made but of earth
only. Seeing this tumult I demanded if
the Hoſt of the houſe were within, by good
fortune they found him, I deſired him that
he would goe unto the window, and make
way for me to ſpeake to the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of them, which with great difficulty
I procured; he having a long time called
to them out of the window, at length the
Burgomaſters came to parly with me, but
ſo full of ſwill, that they knew not what
they ſaid; In the end aſſuring them, that
I knew not that the grand maſter was their
enemy, demonſtrating of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99191:79"/>
it was to offend a perſon of my qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who was a friend to the principall
Lords of the States, and that Monſieur
the Count of <hi>Lalaine,</hi> and all other Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
would give them but little thankes
for this their entertainment of me; having
heard the name of Monſieur the Count of
<hi>Lalaine,</hi> they preſently became of another
minde, and gave more reſpect to him, then
to all the Kings to whom I appertained,
the moſt antient of them betwixt ſtamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and laughing, demanded of me, if I
was then a friend to Monſieur the Count
of <hi>Lalaine;</hi> I ſeeing that his conſanguinity
would ſtand me more in ſtead then all the
Potentates in Chriſtendom, made anſwer,
yes, I am not only his friend, but his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
alſo, then they did reverence to
me, and gave me their right hand of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
offering as much courteſie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had committed inſolence, and
beſought me to excuſe them, aſſuring me
that no wrong ſhould be done to that good
man the Grand-maſter of the Biſhop of
<hi>Leige,</hi> and that he ſhould goe along with
me. The morning being come, as I was
going to heare Maſſe, the Kings Agent
that was reſident with Don <hi>John</hi> named
<hi>Du Bois</hi> who was a French man extreamly
<hi>Spaniolized,</hi> came unto me, ſaying, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99191:79"/>
he had letters and command from the King
to attend and conduct me in my return to
<hi>France,</hi> and for that end he had intreated
Don <hi>John</hi> to let me have <hi>Barlemont</hi> with a
troupe of Horſe for my guard to bring me
without danger to <hi>Namur,</hi> deſiring me
to ſpeak to thoſe of the Town to grant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to Monſieur <hi>Barlemont</hi> who was a
Lord of that Country, and to his troupe
of Horſe; This was done for a double end,
to make themſelves Maſters of the Town,
and to make me fall into the hands of the
<hi>Spanyards.</hi> I found my ſelf here in a great
ſtreight, and communing with Monſieur
the Cardinall of <hi>Lenoncourt,</hi> who had no
greater deſire then my ſelfe to fall into the
hands of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> we concluded to
know of the Towns men if there were any
way by which we might avoide the troupe
of Monſieur <hi>de Barlemont,</hi> and leaving my
little Agent <hi>Du Bois</hi> to diſcourſe with
Monſieur <hi>de Lenoncourt,</hi> I walked into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Chamber where I cauſed thoſe of the
Town to come unto me, and declaring to
them that if they gave entrance to the
troupe of Monſieur <hi>de Barlemont</hi> they were
all undone, becauſe that he would ſeize
on their town for Don <hi>John,</hi> I counſailed
them to arme themſelves, and to ſtand on
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99191:80"/>
their guard, and being ready at the Gate
to ſhew the countenance of men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that would not be ſurpriſed; they
did allow and believe my reaſons offering
to loſe their lives in my ſervice, and gave
me a guide to lead me a way where by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
over the river that ran betwixt the
troupes of Don <hi>John</hi> and mine, I ſhould
caſt them ſo farre behinde, that they could
not overtake me, going all the way after
by Towns which held for the States. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken this reſolution, I ſent them to
the Gate, and Monſieur <hi>de Barlemont</hi> who
was already entred did importunately
perſwade the Townſmen to permit his
troupe to come in alſo. They hearing
this, began all to fall upon him, ſo that
he hardly eſcaped from being maſſacred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, telling him that if his troup
did not forthwith retire from the ſight of
their Town they would diſcharge their
Artillery upon them, this they did to give
me leaſure and the advantage to paſſe the
water, before that troupe could overtake
me. Monſieur <hi>de Barlemont</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<hi>Du Bois</hi> did what they could, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me to goe to <hi>Namur,</hi> where Don
<hi>John</hi> attended me, I made apparence to
doe what they deſired, and to follow their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99191:80"/>
advice, and having heard Maſſe, and
made a ſhort dinner, I came out of my
lodging, attended with two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of the towne in armes, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the way with Monſieur <hi>de Barle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
and the Agent <hi>Du Bois,</hi> I tooke my

               </gap> Mon. <hi>de Barle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
expected me: they obſerving it, told

till I came unto the gate of the Town, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of which, and accompanied with
a good number of the townes men, with
doubled ſpeed I haſted towards the river,
and taking boate, I cauſed all the chiefeſt
of my traine to enter with me, Monſieur
<hi>de Barlemont,</hi> and the Agent <hi>du Bois</hi> crying
continually on the Bank-ſide, that it was
not my neereſt way, that it was croſſe to
the Kings intention, who would have me
goe by <hi>Namur;</hi> notwithſtanding their
out-cries, we ferried over the water with
what ſpeed we could, and while they made
two or three fares to carry my litters and
horſes over, thoſe of the towne, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to give me time, with a thouſand out-cries
and complaints, delayed and amazed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99191:81"/>
Monſieur <hi>de Barlemont,</hi> and the Agent <hi>du
Bois,</hi> reaſoning with them on the wrongs
which Don <hi>John</hi> had done them, having
falſifyed his faith with the Eſtates, and
broken the peace, and arguing with them
on antient quarrells, about the death of
Count <hi>Aigmont,</hi> and threatning them
continually, that if their troupe appeared
nigh the Towne, they would diſcharge
their Ordnance upon them; this gave me
the leiſure to ſecure my ſelf, being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from all feare and danger, by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of God, and this good man whom
they had given to conduct me. I lodged
that night in a ſtrong Caſtle named <hi>Fluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
which belonged to a Gentleman who
held with the Eſtates, and whom I had ſeen
with the Count of <hi>Lalain,</hi> but ſuch was
the miſchance, that the Gentleman was
not within, there being none at home but
his wife only, who ſeeing us in the Baſe-Court
which lay all open, ſhe tooke a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fright, and drawing up the bridge, did
flie into the Caſtle, reſolving, ſay what we
could, not to let us in. In the meane
while three hundred Gentlemen, whom
Don <hi>John</hi> had ſent to intrap me by the
way, knowing that I went to the Caſtle
of <hi>Fleurines</hi> to lodge there, did appeare
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99191:81"/>
upon a little hill ſome mile from thence,
and beleeving that we were got into the
Caſtle, for they might ſee from thence,
that we were all entred into the Court,
there made a ſtand, and lodged there that
night, hoping the next morning to intrap
us. As we were in theſe perplexities,
ſeeing our ſelves no farther than in
the Baſe-court, which was incloſed only
with a weake wall, and defended with as
bad a gate, which had been eaſie to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
we continually parlyed and diſputed
with the Gentlewoman of the Caſtle, who
was inexorable to our prayers; but it
pleaſed God, in the duske of the evening
to ſend her husband Monſieur <hi>de Fleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
who preſently received us into his
Caſtle, and was extreamly angry and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
with his wife for the incivilitie, and
indiſcretion which ſhe ſhewed. This
Gentleman, Monſieur <hi>de Fleurines,</hi> was
ſent on purpoſe to me from the Count of
<hi>Lalaine,</hi> to give me a ſure convoy through
the townes of the Eſtates, being not able
to accompany me himſelf, becauſe he
could not abandon the army, being a chief
Commander for the States, ſo happy was
this Gentlemans incounter with me, that
conducting me into <hi>France,</hi> we paſſed no
more by any Townes, wherein we found
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99191:82"/>
not honourable entertainment, becauſe it
was the Countrey of the Eſtates, this was
the only diſpleaſure which I received, that
I could not paſſe by <hi>Monts,</hi> as I promiſed
the Counteſſe of <hi>Lalain,</hi> our way lying no

long mile from thence, and I could not ſee
her husband the Count of <hi>Lalaine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the warre growing hot, he was in

wrote unto her only from thence, on the

me. She, as ſoone as ſhe learned where I
was, did ſend unto me the chiefeſt of her
Gentlemen to conduct me to the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
of <hi>France,</hi> for I was to paſſe through
all <hi>Cambreſis,</hi> which was divided one half
for the Spaniard, and the other for the
States. I travelled with them to the
Caſtle of <hi>Cambreſis,</hi> from whence they
returning, I ſent her in remembrance of
me, one of my Gownes, which I heard her
very highly prize when I did weare it at
<hi>Monts,</hi> it was of black Satten, covered
with imbroyderies, which coſt me nine

of <hi>Cambreſis,</hi> I was informed, that certain

there a Poſte of my Brothers arrived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

He wrote to me that the Peace was made,

that for himſelf, his condition of eſtate was

of his active Soul, called him to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
of Renowne and Glory. The
peace and pleaſure of our Court, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of that from whence he came, did
render every houre ſo delightfull, that he
could not forbear oftentimes from crying
out, O my Queen, how good it is to be
with you; This Court is a Paradiſe filled
with all variety of delight, and that from
whence I came, a hell, peſtered with all
manner of torments, and furies.</p>
            <p>We ſtayed there about two moneths,
which in that happy eſtate, were to us but
two ſhort daies, during which time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made him account, of what I had
done for him in my voyage into <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and certified him in what terms I had left
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99191:83"/>
his affayres, he thought it expedient that
Monſieur the Count of <hi>Montigny,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Count of <hi>Lalain</hi> ſhould come,
and reſolve him what courſe he was beſt
to hold therein, and to take aſſurances of
their good will, and they reciprocally of
his. He came unto my Brother, with
foure or five of the chiefeſt Lords of <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi>
the one whereof had a letter, and
command from Monſieur <hi>de Ainſi,</hi> to offer
his ſervice to my brother, and to aſſure
him of the Cittadell of <hi>Cambray.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Montigny</hi> promiſed that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Count of <hi>Lalaine,</hi> would deliver
into his hand all <hi>Hainault</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi>
where are many goodly Townes. Theſe
offers and aſſurances being received, my
Brother ſent them back with Preſents,
which were Medalls of Gold, wherin were
his and my figure ſtamped, and with reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
of all additions, and benefits that
they could expect. Returning home, they
prepared all things for my Brothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
who making all the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſpatch he
could to have his forces ready, returned to
Court, to ſee what aſſiſtance the King
would give him to furniſh him in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
and I deſiring to go into <hi>Gaſcogny,</hi>
having prepared all things for that effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> my brother met met on
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99191:84"/>
the way, a dayes journey from it, and the
next day the King, the Queen my Mother,
and the Queen <hi>Louiſa,</hi> with all the Court,
did meet me as farre as Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> where
I was to dine, where they received me
with great honour, and many welcoms,
taking great delight to heare me recount
the honours and magnificence of my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and of my abode at <hi>Leige,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of my return. In this pleaſing
entertainment of diſcourſe, being all in
the charriot of the Queen my Mother, we
came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where having ſupped, and
the Maske ended, the King and Queen
my mother, being both together, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
to them, and beſought them that
they would not think ill of it, if
I intreated them that they would be
pleaſed to grant me leave to goe to the
King my husband, urging, that the peace
being concluded, my journey could not
be ſuſpected by them, and that it would
be prejudiciall to my honour, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
the duty of a wife, ſhould I ſtay
any longer from him: they both expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves to like it well, and with
free applauſe did entertaine the motion,
and the Queene my Mother told me,
that ſhee would accompany me her
ſelfe, her voyage being neceſſary in that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99191:84"/>
Country for the ſervice of the King,
moreover ſhe added, that it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that the King ſhould grant me main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for the expences of my journey,
to which the King did give conſent, and
I deſiring to leave nothing behinde which
might cauſe me to return to Court, being
no longer able to take pleaſure in it, my
Brother going from it, whom I ſaw with
all ſpeed preparing into <hi>Flanders,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
my Mother to remember her ſelfe
in what ſhe promiſed me at the Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with my Brother, and that before
I undertooke my journey into <hi>Gaſcogny</hi>
ſhe would make over the Lands unto me
for the aſſignation of my Dowry: She
acquainted the King with it who found it
very reaſonable, and promiſed me that it
ſhould be done; I beſought him that it
might be done with ſpeed, for I deſired to
begin my journey, if he thought good,
on the beginning of the moneth enſuing:
this alſo was promiſed, but according to
the faſhion of the Court, for inſtead
of diſpatching me, though every day I did
ſolicite him, I was deferred five or ſix
moneths; and ſo likewiſe was my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who was as urgent for his voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> though he repreſented daily
to the King, that it was for the honour
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99191:85"/>
and inlargement of <hi>France,</hi> that it would
prove 'a happy occaſion to hinder the
Civill warres, all the moving ſpirits and
deſirous of novelty having the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to goe into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to paſſe away
their diſcontent and choller there, and
to glut themſelves with Warre, that this
enterpriſe would ſerve as ſometimes <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
did, as a Schoole for the Nobility of
<hi>France</hi> in their exerciſe of armes, and
there revive the <hi>Montlukes,</hi> and brave

ſuch as thoſe great Marſhalls were, who
trayned up in the Warres of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
have ſince ſo gloriouſly and ſucceſſefully
ſerved their King and Country. Theſe
demonſtrances were fair and true enough,
but they had not ſo much weight, as to
be ballanced with the envy which was born
to the enlargement of my Brothers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
to whom every day adminiſtred
new occaſions of delay, to hinder him
from aſſembling his forces, rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

againſt either by <hi>Quelus</hi> or <hi>Gramont,</hi> who
watched by thoſe unjuſt Alarms to rouſe
up my Brothers rage to the overthrowing
of his fortunes. All this was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99191:85"/>
the knowledge of the King; but <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giron</hi>
who then did moſt poſſeſſe him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forſaken my brothers ſervice, and
believing that he was ſenſible of it, (as it
is ordinary, that he who offendeth doth
never pardon) did proſecute my Brother
with ſo ſtrong a hate, that he did vow his
ruine, and at every word did undervalue
and outbrave him, as the impudency of
youth blown up with the Kings favor, did
drive him to all kind of inſolence and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and combined himſelfe with <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> Saint <hi>Maigrin, Gramont,
Mauleon, Livarrot</hi> and other young people
whom the King favoured, and theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
followed by all the Court, after the
faſhion of Courtiers who hunt after favor
did practiſe all things whatſoever came
into their fantaſie; In a manner that not
a day paſſed wherein there was not a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
betwixt them and <hi>Buſſi,</hi> who in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
was not inferiour unto any. My
Brother conſidering that this was not the
way to advance his voyage into <hi>Flanders,</hi>
deſiring rather to mitigate the King then
to exaſperate him, and beleeving beſides
that <hi>Buſſi</hi> being abroad might increaſe the
number of his forces, and provide things
neceſſary for his army; he ſent him
through his principalities to give order
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99191:86"/>
for it; but <hi>Buſſi</hi> being gone, the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Brother ceaſed not, and then
was it underſtood that although his brave
qualities wrought much jealouſly in the
breſt of <hi>Maugiron</hi> and the reſt of theſe
younkers that were neer unto the King,
yet the principall cauſe of their hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Buſſi</hi> was, that he was my Brothers
ſervant; for after he was gone, they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braved
and derided my Brother ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
and with ſuch deſpite, that all the
world perceived it, although my Brother
was very wiſe and patient in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and was reſolved to ſuffer all things
for the diſpatch of his affaires in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
hoping by this means to be quickly gone,
and no more to be found a Subject for
them. This perſecution howſoever and
indignity was very grievous to him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſeeing in hate to him, they did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moleſt and wrong his ſervants, having
lately made Monſieur <hi>de la Chaſtre</hi> loſe a
great ſuit, becauſe that a little before he
became my Brothers ſervant, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo carried away by the perſwaſions of
<hi>Maugiron,</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> who were
friends to Madame <hi>de Senaire,</hi> that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
did ſolicite the proceſſe for her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Monſieur <hi>de la Chaſtre,</hi> who was
then with my Brother, and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99191:86"/>
oppreſt with the injury thereof, did
make my Brother partake of the juſt
griefes he ſuffered.</p>
            <p>In thoſe dayes, the Mariage of Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> was ſolemnized, at which my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(not willing to aſſiſt) deſired me to
be abſent alſo, and the Queen my Mother
who took no pleaſure in the boundleſſe
arrogance of theſe young people, fearing
that all that day would be in debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and exceſſe, and that my Brother
not being there, they would give a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
interpretaion of his abſence, which
might prove prejudiciall to him, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Kings good will, that ſhe ſhould
goe abroad on the mariage day to dinner
at Saint <hi>Maurus,</hi> and took my Brother
and my ſelfe with her: It was on Shro ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munday,
on the evening we returned,
the Queen my Mother ſo prevailed with
my Brother, that he conſented that night
to be preſent at the dancing to content the
King, but inſtead of amending his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it did impaire it; for <hi>Maugiron</hi> and
his companions being there, they began to
play on my Brother with ſuch keene and
pointed language, that a meaner perſon
then himſelfe would have been offended
at it, ſaying that he had loſt his paines to
re-attire himſelfe, that they could not find
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99191:87"/>
him after dinner to ſay ſo much as, Much
good d'it you, to him, that he came in the
houre of darknes, becauſe it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to him, reviling him for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his habit, and for the ſicklineſſe
of his changed complexion: All this was
ſpoken to the Bride that ſate next unto
him; My brother knowing it was done on
purpoſe to make him anſwer, and by this
means to ſet him at diſtance with the King,
did fling away from thence ſo full of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and deſpite, that he could forbeare no
longer; but having deliberated with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Chaſtre,</hi> he reſolved to abſent
himſelfe a while from Court to goe unto
the Chace, thinking by his abſence to
qualifie the heat of theſe young people,
and to render his affayres with the King
more eaſie, for the preparation of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
which was neceſſary to goe unto <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
He addreſſed himſelf to the Queen
my Mother, who was very ſorry to hear
of this difference, and acquainted her
with the reſolution he had taken, which
ſhe did well approve, and aſſured him
that the King ſhould condiſcend unto it,
and that ſhe would ſolicite him in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
for a diſpatch in what he promiſed,
concerning his enterpriſe in <hi>Flanders;</hi> And
Monſieur <hi>de Villequier</hi> ſtanding by, ſhee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99191:87"/>
commanded him to goe unto the King,
and acquaint him with the deſire which
my brother had to goe for a few dayes a
hunting, which the King allowed, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it would be a means to appeaſe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
which were betwixt him and the
young people <hi>Maugiron,</hi> Saint <hi>Luke, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
and the reſt. My brother retiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Chamber holding his ſuit granted,
commanded all his people to be ready the
next morning, to attend him at Saint
<hi>Germans,</hi> where intending to make his
aboad for certain dayes, he gave order
to his chiefe Hunter to have his Dogs in
readineſſe, and betook himſelfe to his reſt
that night, with an intention to riſe early
the morning following to goe unto the
Chace, either to ſolace his ſpirits, or a
little to divert them from the noyſe and
tumult of the Court: Monſieur <hi>de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier</hi>
repaired to the King to demand
leave of him, to which he did accord, but
remayning in his Cabinet, with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> which was five or ſix
young fellows, they preſented to him that
this departure of my brothers was much
to be ſuſpected, and put him into ſuch an
apprehenſion, that they made him commit
one of the greateſt overſights that this our
age did know, which was to take my
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99191:88"/>
brother and his chiefeſt Servants priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which as it was unwiſely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ſo was it raſhly executed; for the
King catching hold of theſe words, went
ſuddainly in the night, in a great paſſion to
finde the Queen my Mother, as if it were a
publick alarm, or as the enemie had been at
the gate, and ſaid unto her, Now Madam!
what doe you think you have done by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
leave for my Brother to go, Doe
not you ſee the danger in which you put
my eſtate, without all doubt, under this
pretence of hunting, there lies ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enterpriſe; I will goe ſeize on him,
and all his people, and I will cauſe his cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to be broken open, I aſſure my ſelf we
ſhall diſcover ſomthing of importance. He
had with him the Captaine of the Guard,
Monſieur <hi>de Loſſe,</hi> and ſome of the Scotch
regiment. The Queen my mother fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in this precipitation, that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
life would be in jeopardie, earneſtly
deſired that ſhee might goe along with
him, and becauſe ſhe was all undreſſed,
throwing her night-gowne on her, ſhe
made haſte up after him to my Brothers
chamber, The King was knocking furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
at the doore, commanding it to be
opened, pronouncing that the King was
there: My Brother awaked at this tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99191:88"/>
and knowing that he had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any thing that might give him the
leaſt occaſion of feare, he commanded
<hi>Cange</hi> the Groom of his Chamber; to open
the doore; the King ruſhing in, began to
taxe him, and to tell him that he would
never leave to practiſe againſt his State
and him, and that he would make him
know what it was to attempt againſt his
Prince: On that, he preſently commanded
the Guard to carry forth his coffers, and
to take the groomes of his chamber with
them; He ſearched my Brothers bed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and turned and toſſed it, to ſee if he
could finde any papers there. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having a letter of Madame <hi>de Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaes,</hi>
which he received that evening, did
take it into his hand, that the King might
not ſee it, the King inforced himſelf to
take it from him, and my Brother reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and with joyned hands intreating him
that he would be pleaſed not to looke on
it, he made the King more deſirous to
peruſe it, beleeving that in that paper he
ſhould finde a ſufficient ground to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
his proceſſe againſt him. In the
end, having opened it in the preſence
of the Queene my mother, they were
as much abaſhed at it, as was ſometimes
<hi>Cato,</hi> who in the Senate having conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99191:89"/>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſhow the paper that was
brought unto him, importunatly implying
that it concerned the benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
he perceived, that it was a
wanton letter of love, directed from his
ſiſter to him. The ſhame of this event,
that came ſo croſſe to the expectation of
the King, augmented by deſpight his
choler, ſo that he gave no eare unto my
brother, who inceſſantly demanded, of
what he was accuſed, and wherefore he
was ſo intreated? He was committed to
the charge of Monſieur <hi>de Loſſe,</hi> and there
was a Guard ſet over him of the Scotch
regiment, with command not to permit
him to talke to any: this was done an
houre after midnight; My brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
ſtill in this manner, was in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perplexitie for me, then for himſelf,
beleeving truly that they would doe the
like by me, and that ſo violent and unjuſt
a beginning, could not have but as unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and ending, and ſeeing that Monſieur
<hi>de Loſſe</hi> had teares in his eyes, for griefe to
ſee things carried after this manner, and
that by reaſon of the Guard there preſent,
he durſt not ſpeak freely to him, he only
asked him what was become of me, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Loſſe</hi> made anſwere, that as yet he
heard nothing of me; My brother ſtraight
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99191:89"/>
replyed, It is a great comfort to me in
this affliction, to heare that my Siſter is at
libertie, but although ſhe be in that free
eſtate, ſhe affecteth me ſo intirely, that ſhe
would rather be in bondage with me, then
live in libertie without me, and deſired
him to goe to the Queen my mother, and
beſeech her that ſhe would be pleaſed to
obtaine of the King, that I might endure
my captivitie with him, this the King did
grant; this unſhaken beleefe which my
brother had of the aſſurance of my love,
was ſuch a particular obligation to me,
though his good offices might challenge
from me many and great acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that I have ever placed it in the firſt
ranke of all; as ſoon as he had this permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which was upon the break of day,
he deſired Monſieur <hi>de Loſſe,</hi> to ſend one
of the Guard to acquaint me with this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
newes, and to deſire me to come
unto him, the yeoman of the guard, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into my chamber, found me aſleep,
not dreaming of any thing that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
he opened my curtaine, as I was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my eyes, and in a language proper to
the Scots, ſaid unto me, <hi>Bon jour</hi> Madame!
Monſieur your brother deſires you, that
you would come unto him. I looked on
the Man, being not halfe awaked, and even
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99191:90"/>
ready to fall aſleep againe, and knowing
him, I demanded of him, if he was not one
of the Scottiſh guard, he anſwered, yes; I
replyed, What is the matter, hath my
brother no other meſſenger then you to
ſend? he anſwered, No, for all his people
are taken from him, and told me in his
language all which that night had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and perceiving I was much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at it, he approached neerer to me, and
ſpake that my ſervants being preſent, might
not heare him, Doe not torment your ſelf
Madame, I have a means to ſave Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
your Brother, and aſſure your ſelfe I
will performe it, but of neceſſitie I muſt
then goe with him; I anſwered him, that
he ſhould be rewarded above his hopes,
and making haſte to dreſſe me, I went with
him alone to my Brothers chamber, In my
way I was to goe through all the Court,
then full of people, who were accuſtomed
to runne to ſee, and honour me, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
how Fortune now had changed
her countenance, they made as though
they had not ſeen me; comming into my
brothers chamber, I found him with ſo
great a conſtancie, that he was not changed
at all from his uſuall diſpoſition, and
tranquility of Mind, and ſeeing me, he
imbraced me, and with a countenance ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99191:90"/>
joyfull then dejected, ſaid, My
Queen, I beſeech you forbear thoſe teares,
In this condition that I am, your grief is
the only thing that can afflict me, for my
innocence and true intentions doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
me to feare any of the accuſations of
my enemyes, but if unjuſtly they ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
againſt my life, they who ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, will be more cruell unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
then me, who have courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to undergoe and deſpiſe the ſtroak
of ſo unjuſt a death, neither is it that ſo
much which I reſpect, for my life hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been accompained with ſo much
ſorrow and affliction, that not knowing
any of the pleaſures of this world I ſhall
not have the griefe to abandon them, the
ſaddeſt apprehenſion which I have is, that
wanting a cauſe to make me juſtly to dye,
I ſhall languiſh in the ſolitude of tedious
impriſonment, where yet I ſhall deſpiſe
the tyranny of my enemies, ſeeing you
will ſo much oblige me as to aſſiſt me with
your preſence; theſe words in ſtead of
ceaſing my tears did ſo increaſe them, that
out of my eies I thought I ſhould have pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
all the moiſture of my life; I anſwered
him in ſobs, that my life and fortunes were
woven into his, that it was in the power
of God alone to hinder me from aſſiſting
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99191:91"/>
him in any condition that I could, that
ſhould the King take me thence, and not
ſuffer me to continue with him I would kill
my ſelfe in his preſence; Paſſing the day
in this diſcourſe, and ſeeking together
the occaſion that made the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
in ſo cruell and unjuſt a courſe
againſt him, and not able to conceive
it, the houre came about for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of the Caſtle gate, where an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
young fellow who was ſervant to
<hi>Buſſi,</hi> being known and ſtaid by the guard,
was demanded by them, whither he was
going, he being amaſed with the ſtrangenes
of the ſuddain interrogatory, made anſwer
that he was going to ſeek his Maſter; this
being told unto the King, it was ſuſpected
that he was within the <hi>Lovure,</hi> where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that after noone from Saint <hi>Germans</hi>
my brother had cauſed him to enter in
with the reſt of the troupe to confer with
him on the affaires of his army which was
going unto <hi>Flanders,</hi> not thinking then
he ſhould ſo ſuddainly depart from
Court as unexpectedly afterwards it came
to paſſe. That evening, on the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
aforeſaid, <hi>Archant</hi> the Captaine of
the Guard received Commandement
from the King to looke him out, and to
ſeize on him and <hi>Simier;</hi> who making
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99191:91"/>
this inquiſition to his griefe, becauſe he
was an intimate friend of <hi>Buſſies,</hi> and by
alliance called him Sonne, as <hi>Buſſi</hi> called
him Father, he came up into <hi>Simiers</hi>
Chamber where he ſeized on him, and
doubting that <hi>Buſſi</hi> there had hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he made a light ſearch being glad
that he did not finde him, but <hi>Buſſi</hi> who
lay then on the bed, and perceived that
he ſhould be left alone, fearing that the
ſame Commiſſion ſhould be given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with whom he ſhould not be in ſo
much ſafety, he deſired rather to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Archants</hi> cuſtody, and being of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and ſpiritfull diſpoſition, in whoſe
breſt no danger could work the baſe effects
of feare, as <hi>Archant</hi> was going out of the
doore to lead <hi>Simier</hi> away, he put out
his head betwixt the Curtains and cryed
out, why, hoe there! What will you go
without me Father, doe not you thinke
my conduct more honourable then ſuch a
rakeſtraws, as is <hi>Simiers; Archant</hi> turned
to him, and ſaid, Ah my Sonne, I would
to God it had coſt me one of my armes
that you were not here; he replyed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſh,
my affaires goe well, playing all the way
as he went with <hi>Simier,</hi> and laughing at
him for the trembling feare wherein he
ſaw him: <hi>Archant</hi> ſhut them up both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99191:92"/>
one Chamber, and ſet a guard over
them, and went from thence to take Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Caſtre,</hi> whom he carried to the
Baſtille.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Monſieur <hi>de Loſſe</hi> a good old man who
had bin governour to the King my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in his nonage, and who tendered
me as his own childe, having now the
cuſtody of my brother, knowing how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
he was dealt withall, and deteſting
the bad counſaile by which the King was
governed, having a deſire to oblige us
both, reſolved to ſave my brother, and
the better to diſcover his intention to me,
commanded the Scotch guard to waite
without doores on the ſtaires head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
onely two with him, in whoſe
ſecrecy he much truſted, and taking me
by the hand he ſaid, There is not a true
Frenchman, whoſe heart bleedeth not to
ſee that which we behold, I have been too
long a ſervant to the King your Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to refuſe to offer up my life a ſacrifice for
his children, I believe that I ſhall have
the guard of Monſieur your brother, in
whatſoever place they will keep him; Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelfe that with the hazard of my
life I will preſerve his, but to the end
that this reſolution may not be perceived,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99191:92"/>
let us talke no more together, but be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of it. This promiſe gave me a little
comfort, &amp; rouzing up my ſpirit, I told my
brother, that we ought not to be kept in
this manner, like people taken by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
without knowing what we had
done, that thus they uſe felons and the
vileſt of malefactors when they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
them priſoners. I intreated Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Loſſe,</hi> ſince the King would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that the Queen my Mother ſhould
come unto us, that he would be pleaſed
to let us know by any of his ſervants the
cauſe of our reſtraint: Monſieur <hi>de Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut</hi>
who was cheife of the Counſaile of
theſe young people was ſent unto us, who
with a gravity that was naturall to him,
told us that he was ſent thither to know
what was that, which we deſired the King
ſhould underſtand; We made anſwer,
that we deſired to ſpeak with any one from
the King to know the occaſion of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
which we our ſelves could not
conceive: He gravely replyed, that we
muſt not demand of Gods and Kings the
reaſon of their actions, that they did all
things for a good and a juſt cauſe; we
made anſwer again, that we were not
perſons to be held as thoſe whom they put
in the the Inquiſition, concerning whom
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99191:93"/>
we muſt divine what they had done; we
could draw nothing elſe from him, but
that he would imploy himſelfe for us,
and that he would doe us all the beſt offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which he could: My Brother began
to laugh out right, but I who was turned
all into griefe to ſee my brother in danger,
whom I cheriſhed above my own life, had
much adoe to forbeare from ſpeaking to
him, as he deſerved.</p>
            <p>While he was making this report unto
the King, my Mother being in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
oppreſt with manifold afflictions,
and even ſick with ſorrow, as a wiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
did foreſee that this exceſſe made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without reaſon or ſubject would bring
a ſwift and dreadfull devaſtation on the
Kingdome, if my Brother had not the
better diſpoſition; and ſent for all the old
Counſellers, Monſieur the Chancellour,
the Princes, Lords, and Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi>
who were all wonderfully offended and
ſcandalized for the bad Councell which
was given to the King, ſaying all to the
Qu. my Mother, that ſhe ought to oppoſe
it, and repreſent unto the King the wrong
which he had done, that they could not
hinder the error from being undone which
already was committed, but they ought
to repeale it after the beſt manner they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99191:93"/>
could. The Queen my Mother with all
the Lords of his Councell repaired pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to the King, and did demonſtrate
to him of what importance were theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
The King having his eyes unſealed
from the pernicious Counſell of theſe
young people, did well approve what
his old Lords and Counſellers had preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, and prayed the Queen my
Mother to repeale it, and to perſwade my
Brother to forget all that was paſſed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he was offended with thoſe
young people for it, and deſired that by
her means a reconcilement might be made
betwixt <hi>Buſſi</hi> and <hi>Quelus.</hi> This being
determined, the guard was taken off my
brother; and the Queen my Mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to his Chamber told him, that he
was to thanke almighty God for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
vouchſafed him in his deliverance from
ſo great a danger, that ſhe had ſeen the
houre wherein ſhe could not ſo much as
hope for his life; that ſince he underſtood
by this that the King was of ſuch a heady
humour that he tooke offence not onely
at effects, but at empty imaginations, and
running uncontrolledly in his opinion,
without ſtaying at any advice, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
whatſoever his fancy did prompt him
to, therefore to put him in no further
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99191:94"/>
grievances, ſhe deſired him to put on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to conform himſelfe in all things
to his will, and that he would preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
unto him without any ſhow of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
at the unjuſt proceedings which had
paſſed againſt his perſon; we made anſwer
to her, that we had much to give thanks
to God for his great mercy in ſecuring us
from the injuſtice that was prepared for
us, and that for this, next unto God we
owed to her alone our ſecond obligations,
but the quality of my brother did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that they ſhould impriſon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cauſe, and take him then from
thence, without any formality of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or ſatisfaction. The Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
that what already had been done God
himſelf could not cauſe to be undone, but
they would recall the diſorder that was
made at his ſurpriſall by making his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
with all the honour and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he could deſire, that alſo it were
requiſite that he againe ſhould content the
King in all things, ſpeaking to him with
ſuch affection and reſpect that the King
ſhould remaine well pleaſed with it, and
alſo that he would be a means that ſuch a
reconcilement ſhould be made betwixt
<hi>Buſſi</hi> and <hi>Quelus</hi> that no more between
them an occaſion ſhould be found for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99191:94"/>
or quarrell, avouching that the
principall motive which produced all
this counſel, and bad effects, was a fear that
they had of the combat which old <hi>Buſſi</hi>
(a worthy father of ſo brave a Son) had
demanded, beſeeching the King that he
would permit him to be his ſon <hi>Buſſies</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and in the like manner, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> might have his father to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
him, that they foure might end the
quarrell, without troubling the Court, or
indangering ſo many people. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
promiſed that <hi>Buſſi</hi> (ſeeing he had no
hope to redreſſe himſelf) ſhould, to come
out of priſon, performe any thing that ſhe
commanded; The Queen my mother,
going downe unto the King, found
him very willing that this deliverance
ſhould be made with honour, and to
this purpoſe he came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Queen my Mother, with
all the Princes, the Lords and others of his
Counſell, and ſent Monſieur <hi>de Villequier</hi>
to tell us he did attend our comming.
Paſſing through the halls and chambers, as
we were going to his Majeſtie, we found
them all full of people, who beheld us
with teares falling from their eyes, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God to ſee us out of danger. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the chamber of the Queen my
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99191:95"/>
Mother, we found the King with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
before rehearſed, who ſeeing my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſaid unto him, that he would deſire
him not to thinke ſtrange, nor be offended
at what he had done, being compelled to
it by the zeale which he had to the quiet
and ſafety of the State, that he now belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that he had no intention to diſturbe
his Kingdom or himſelfe; My brother
made anſwere, that he had vowed ſo much
ſervice to his Majeſtie, that he would
thinke well of whatſoever he was pleaſed
to have done, but he moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
him to conſider, that the devotion
and fidelity which he had teſtified to his
Majeſtie, did not deſerve that rough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
howſoever he accuſed nothing but
his own unhappineſſe, and was ſatisfied
enough, if the King acknowledged his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.
The King anſwered yes, there
was no queſtion of it to be made; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to relie on his love, as much as
heretofore. On this, the Queen my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
joyned them hand in hand, and made
them imbrace each other. Immediately
the King commanded that <hi>Buſſi</hi> ſhould
come forth, and be reconciled to <hi>Quelus,</hi>
and that they ſhould ſet <hi>Simier</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Chaſtre</hi> at libertie. <hi>Buſſi</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the chamber, with that brave
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99191:95"/>
preſence which was naturall to him, the
King told him that he would have an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
made between him and <hi>Quelus,</hi>
and that their quarrell ſhould no more be
mentioned, and commanded him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<hi>Quelus: Buſſi</hi> made anſwere, Sir,
if it be your pleaſure that I ſhould kiſſe
him, I am well diſpoſed to it, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating
his geſtures to his words, he did
accoſt him with the Pantaloone, and in a
lovers complement did imbrace him, at
which all the company, though poſſeſſed,
and almoſt aſtoniſhed with the former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
could hardly refrain from laughter:
the more adviſed judged that it was too
ſlight a ſatisfaction which my brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and not to be parralel'd with ſo
great an Injury. This being done, the
King and Queen my Mother comming to
me, told me it was needfull alſo, that I
ſhould give them my hand, that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhould not entertaine the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of any thing which might make
him ſtart from the obedience which he
owed to the King. I made anſwere that
my brother was ſo wiſe, and had ſo much
devotion to his ſervice, that he had no need
to be perſwaded to it, either by me, or by
any other, and that he never had, nor
ſhould receive any counſell from me, but
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99191:96"/>
what ſhould be conformable to their will,
and his duty. It being then three a clock
in the afternone, and none having dined,
the Queen my Mother deſired that wee
might dine altogether, and afterwards
commanded my Brother and my ſelf to
change our habits, which were ſuitable to
the ſad condition wherein we lately were,
and to make our ſelves ready to be at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with the King, and afterward at the
dancing. She was obeyed in thoſe things
which could be put off, and left behinde;
but for the countenance, which is the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image of the Soul, the paſſion of our
juſt diſcontent was read in perfect Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
and ingraven with all the force
and violence of indignation and diſdaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as we had true cauſe to finde it in all the
acts of this Tragy comedy; which being
ended, Monſieur <hi>de Seurre,</hi> whom the
Queen my mother had given to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to lie in his chamber, and in whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
ſhe often took delight, did chance
to ſtand before her: this was a man of a
diſpoſition bluntly ſharpe, and who with
a careleſſe grace and affectation, would
aſſume unto himſelf the liberty of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing that came into his head, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
ſomthing of the humour of the
Cynick Philoſopher. My mother obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99191:96"/>
him, ſaid unto him, Now Monſieur
<hi>de Seurre;</hi> And what ſay you of all this?
he replyed, It is too much in earneſt, and
too little in jeſt; and turning to me, he
ſpake ſoftly, that my mother might not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
him, I doe not beleeve that this
is the laſt act of the play, the man (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my Brother) would deceive me
much, if he ſhould ſtay here ſtill. This
in this manner being paſſed, the malady
being healed without, and not within, the
young people who poſſeſſed the King,
conceiving of my Brothers nature and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition
by their owne, and their unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
judgements not permitting
them to diſcerne of what force and vertue
was his Countreys love unto a Prince ſo
rarely qualified as was my Brother, they
perſwaded the King, joyning their cauſe
to his, that my Brother would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the publick affront which he received,
but would be alwayes watching an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to revenge it. The King, quite forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the former errour which theſe young
people cauſed him to commit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> received
this ſecond Impreſſion, and commanded
the Captaine of the Guards to looke care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to the gates, that my brother might
not goe forth, and that every night they
ſhould diſcharge the <hi>Loure</hi> of all my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99191:97"/>
ſervants, leaving only him behinde,
who uſually lay in his chamber, or in his
Waredrope. My brother ſeeing himſelf
at the mercy of theſe young heads, who
without either reſpect or judgement
made the King diſpoſe of him as they
pleaſed, fearing leaſt worſe ſhould come
unto him, and having a freſh example of
what without any ground or reaſon late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had befallen him, having three dayes
entertained the apprehenſion of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
was reſolved on the fourth, to remove
from Court, and to retire to his owne
houſe, nor return any more to Court, but
with what ſpeed he could, to diſpatch his
affaires for <hi>Flanders;</hi> he diſcloſed to me
this reſolution, and perceiving it was his
beſt ſecurity, and that neither the King nor
State ſhould receive any prejudice by it, I
did approve it, and contriving the means,
becauſe he could not get out of the gates
of the <hi>Lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> which were ſo curiouſly
guarded, that ſtedfaſtly, and with great
heed they looked in the face of all that
paſſed in and out; I concluded, there was
no other way for him, but to get out at my
Chamber window, which looked down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a deep ditch, and was two ſtories high;
he intreated me to provide for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
a ſtrong cable, and of a ſufficient
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99191:97"/>
length, which ſuddainly I procured, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a boy that was faithfull to me to carry
out that day the cord of a bed, which was
broken, in pretence to have it repaired,
and ſhut againe, and within ſome few
houres after, to bring it back, and with
it, the cord that was neceſſary for us. The
houre of ſupper being come which was on
a faſting night, when the King ſupped not,
my Mother did ſup alone in her little Hall,
and I with her; my Brother although he
was exceeding patient and diſcreet in all
his actions being rouzed up by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the affront which he received,
and of the danger which threatned him,
impatient to be gone, came unto me as I
roſe from table, and whiſpering in my eare
deſired me to make haſte, and repaire unto
my own chamber, where he would attend
me: Monſieur <hi>de Matignon</hi> who was not
yet Marſhall, a dangerous and fine <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
who loved not my Brother, being
either adveriſed of it by ſome one who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
could not hold his peace, or
conjecturing it by the manner which my
brother ſpake unto me, ſaid unto the Q.
my Mother, as ſhe was going to her
Chamber, That without doubt my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would be gone, that to morrow he
would not be there, that he knew it very
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99191:98"/>
well, and that ſhe ſhould doe well to give
order to the contrary: I did even heare
the words he ſpake, ſtanding very neer my
Mother, regarding and curiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all that paſſed, as thoſe doe in the
like eſtate, who being neer their utmoſt
danger, or on the point of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
are floting betwixt feare and hope:
I perceived that my Mother was much
troubled at the news which gave me the
greater apprehenſion to beleeve that we
were diſcovered; entring into her Cloſet,
ſhe tooke me aſide and ſaid; Have you
heard what <hi>Matignon</hi> hath told me? I
made anſwer, I did not underſtand it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
but I perceive it is ſome buſineſſe
that doth afflict you; yes, ſhe replyed,
and that very much, for you know that I
have anſwered the King that your Brother
ſhould not goe, and <hi>Matignon</hi> now is
come to tell me, that he knows he will not
be here to morrow. Finding then my
ſelfe in theſe two extreams, either to faile
in my fidelity to my Brother, and put his
life in hazard, or to ſweare againſt the
truth, a thing which I would not doe to
eſcape a thouſand deaths, I was in ſo great
a perplexity that had not God aſſiſted me,
my faſhion ſufficiently had witneſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my words, the fear I had that we were
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99191:98"/>
diſcovered, but as God aſſiſteth good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and his divine bounty joyned
in this work of my Brothers ſafety, I ſo
compoſed my lookes and words, that ſhe
perceived not any thing but that which I
would have her, and that I offended not
my Soule or Conſcience by any falſe oath.
I demanded of her, if too well ſhe did not
underſtand the hate which Monſieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon</hi>
did beare unto my Brother, that he
was a ſpitefull diſturber of all our quiet,
and who did grieve to ſee us live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
that when my Brother did goe I
would anſwer it with my life; that I was
confident, he having never concealed any
thing from me, that he would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
this deſigne unto me if he had
an intention thereunto; this I ſaid, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my ſelfe that my Brother being ſafe
they durſt not doe me wrong, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
rather to ingage my life then to offend
my ſoule by any falſe oath, or to put my
Brothers life in jeopardy; She ſeeking not
after any other ſence of my words, replied;
Be well adviſed what you ſay, you ſhall
ſerve as caution for him, and anſwer his
abſence with your life; to which I ſmiling
did make anſwer, that it was that which I
deſired; and bidding her good night, I
forthwith repaired to my Chamber, where
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99191:99"/>
putting off my cloaths with all diligence,
haſting unto bed, to be the ſooner ridde
of the Ladyes and Gentlewomen that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on me, I was left onely with the
women of my Chamber, when preſently
my Brother came in, and <hi>Simier</hi> and <hi>Cange</hi>
with him, and having commanded them
to look firſt into the ditch, to ſee if any
one were there, we faſtned the cord to
the poſt of the window; we were ayded
onely with my three women that lay in
my Chamber, and with the boy that
brought the cord; my brother, although
it was a very great height, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of feare deſcended firſt, and
laughing at the danger went ſwinging and
playing down; after him diſcended <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi>
in ſuch a pittifull feare that he could
ſcarce hold the rope for trembling; and
laſt of all <hi>Cange</hi> the groom of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
God ſo happily did guide my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from being diſcovered that he came
to Saint <hi>Geneviefue</hi> where <hi>Buſſi</hi> did attend
him, who by the conſent of the Abby had
made a hole in the Town wall, at which
my Brother did goe forth, and finding
there two horſes ready, he retired to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
without any misfortune. As <hi>Cange</hi>
laſt of all came downe, there aroſe a man
from the bottome of the Ditch who began
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99191:99"/>
to run towards the lodgings neer the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Court which is the way to the <hi>Corps de
guard;</hi> I who in all this adventure appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
not any thing which concerned
my ſelf in particular, but onely the ſafety
or danger of my Brother, ſtood in a maze,
ſtrook through and through with feare,
beleeving that man to be ſome one, who
following the adviſe of Monſieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon</hi>
was placed there on purpoſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
us, and thinking that my Brother
had been ſurprized I fell into a deſpaire,
which cannot be repreſented but by an
eſſay of things like to it: being in theſe
perplexities, my women more curious
then my ſelf, for my ſafety and their own
took the cord and put it into the fire, to
the end that if the misfortune were ſo
great that the man who roſe out of the
ditch, had been ſet there to obſerve us, it
might not be diſcovered; this cord being
very long made ſo great a flame that it
blazed out of the chimney, and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by thoſe of the Guard, who that
night did watch: In a great fright and
with loud importunity they came and
knocked at my door deſiring that ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it might be opened, then I thought that
my brother at that preſent had been taken,
and that we both had been undone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99191:100"/>
notwithſtanding anchored my hope
on God who preſerved my judgement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
(a grace which his divine Majeſty was
ever pleaſed in all my danger to vouchſafe
unto me) and perceiving that the cord
was but halfe burned out, I ſpake unto
my women to goe gently to the doore to
demand what they would have, and to
ſpeake ſoftly to them, as if I were aſleepe,
which they did, and they of the guard told
them that a great fire came out of the tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
of my chimney and made in the darke
of night ſo bright a flame, that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of it did call them thither to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
it: My women made anſwer to
them, it was nothing, and that they were
able to quench it well enough themſelves,
and charged them to take heed that they
did not waken me, on which they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
back. This alarm being paſſed, ſome
two houres after, behold Monſieur <hi>de Loſſe</hi>
came to call me to the King &amp; Queen my
Mother, to give them an account of my
brothers departure, being advertiſed of
it by the Abbot of Saint <hi>Genevifue,</hi> who to
avoid all checks, and by my brothers own
conſent, when he ſaw himſelfe farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
from the danger of being intrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
came to informe the King of it, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that he was ſurprized in his own
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99191:100"/>
houſe, and being ſhut up therein till a
breach in the wall was made for my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
eſcape, he could come no ſooner to
acquaint his Majeſtie with it; He found
me in my bed, for it was yet night, and I
ſuddenly ariſing, and putting on my night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown,
one of my women indiſcreetly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
at it, tooke hold of my gowne,
weeping and crying out, that I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
return unto them. Monſieur <hi>de Loſſe</hi>
beating her back, ſaid, If this woman had
done this before any but my ſelfe, who
am your devoted ſervant, theſe words
of hers might procure great trouble
to you, but give thanks to God,
and feare not any thing, for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
your Brother is ſafe. This aſſurance
of his was to me a needfull, and no leſſe
welcome encouragement, to arme me to
endure all the threats and choller of the
King, whom I found ſitting on the Queen
my Mothers bed, in ſo great a paſſion,
that I beleeve I ſhould have found the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it, if the feare of my brothers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and my mothers preſence had not
detained him. They both ſaid unto me,
that I had obliged my ſelfe unto them, that
my Brother ſhould not goe, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to anſwere for him; I replyed, that
it was true, I had; but in this, that he had
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99191:101"/>
deceived me, as well as them, howſoever I
durſt aſſure them on the forfeit of my life,
that his departure would bring no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his ſervice to his Majeſtie; and that
he was only gone to his owne houſe, to
give order in what was neceſſary for his
voyage into <hi>Flanders.</hi> This aſſurance did
a little qualifie the King, who gave me
leave to return unto my chamber; not long
after, there came news from my brother,
which gave the King reaſſurances of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and obedience; this cauſed the
complaint to ceaſe, but not the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ſhewing in apparence to be willing
to aſſiſt him, but traverſing under hand
the preparations of his Army into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>

            <p>Being returned from <hi>Alenſon,</hi> having all

of my people to come into the Chappell,
certain Huguenots did eſpy them, and
complained of them to <hi>Le Pin,</hi> who was
Secretary to the King my Husband, this
fellow infinitely did poſſeſſe his Maſter,
and had great authority in his Court, and
managed all the affayres for thoſe of the
Religion: Imediately he ſent ſome of the
guard, who drawing them thence, and
beating them in my preſence, did throw
them into priſon where a long time they
ſtayed, and payed great fines; I was the
more ſenſible of this indignity, becauſe I
expected no ſuch matter: I complained to
the King my Husband, and beſought him
that theſe poore Catholicks might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed,
who deſerved not that chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and being a long time reſtrained
from the exerciſe of their Religion did
now aſſemble themſelves on my comming
(the better to celebrate the day of ſo great
a feaſt) to heare Maſſe in my Chappell;
<hi>Le Pin</hi> without being called, did intrude
himſelfe, and without giving ſo much
reſpect to his Maſter, as to give him leave
to anſwer, took the word out of his mouth,
and told me that I ſhould not trouble the
head of the King my Husband with that
matter, for ſay I what I would, it never
the ſooner ſhould be done, adding that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99191:105"/>
they well deſerved the puniſhment they
endured, and for my words they
ſhould ſpeed neither the better nor the
worſe, that I ſhould content my ſelfe
that Maſſe was permitted to be ſaid for
me, and for thoſe my people whom I took
with me. Theſe words did much offend
me, from a man of ſo mean a quality; I
beſought the King my Husband if I were
ſo happy to have any part in his affection,
that he would let me underſtand that he
was ſenſible of the indignity which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from that ſawcy fellow, and that
he would compell him to give me ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for it. The King my Husband
perceiving how juſt my anger and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
were, cauſed him to goe out of my
preſence; telling me that he was very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the indiſcretion of <hi>le Pin,</hi> and that he
ſhould give me what ſatisfaction I deſired;
that concerning the Catholick priſoners
he would adviſe with his Counſellors of
the Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> who ſhould doe
that which might comply with my requeſt.
Having ſaid this unto me, he went into
his Cloſet, where he found <hi>Du Pin,</hi> who
after he had ſpoken with him, changed all
again; ſo that fearing I would requeſt him
to diſhonour <hi>Le Pin</hi> out of his ſervice, he
ſhunned my preſence, and diſſembling
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99191:106"/>
with me deferred what he promiſed. In
the end ſeeing I grew reſolute, that he
ſhould abandon either <hi>Le Pin</hi> or my ſelfe,
which of us he pleaſed, all thoſe that were
preſent, and who all hated <hi>Le Pin,</hi> ſaid
unto him, that he ought not to diſcontent
me for ſo poore a fellow, that had ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
offended me, that if it ſhould be
brought to the eare and knowledge of the
King, and Queen my Mother, they would
take it very ill that he ſtill did entertaine
him. Theſe words did conſtrain him to
put him away, but he ceaſed not to doe
me evill offices, and to make me falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences,
being perſwaded to it, as he
hath told me ſince, by Monſieur <hi>de Pibrac</hi>
who played double with us, who told me
that I ought not to ſuffer my ſelf to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braved
by ſo mean a fellow as <hi>Le Pin,</hi> and
that whatſoever came of it, very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it were, that I ſhould put him thence;
and ſaying to the King my Husband that
there was no reaſon nor appearance that
he ſhould be deprived of the ſervice of a
man that was ſo uſefull to him: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Pibrac</hi> did this to incite me on the
receiving of ſo many and great affronts to
return into <hi>France,</hi> where he was attached
in his eſtate by the Preſident, and one of
the Counſellors of the Councell of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99191:106"/>
King: and to make my condition yet
worſe, <hi>Dayella</hi> being gone, the King my
Husband courted <hi>Rebours</hi> who was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious
wench that loved me not, and who
did me all the bad offices which in her own
behalf ſhe could. In theſe afflictions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ever my recourſe to God, in the end
he had pitty of my tears and permitted that
we ſhould depart from the little <hi>Geneva</hi> of
<hi>Pau,</hi> where as it fell out well for me, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourſe</hi>
ſtayed ſick behinde, from whom
the King my Husband having removed

began to imbark himſelf with <hi>Foſſeuſa</hi> who

for the ſpace of ſeventeen dayes, during

thing in them that was reprovable, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they were Huguenots, but in this
diverſity of Religion there was heard at
all no noiſe of controverſie, or contention

Madame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Princeſſe his ſiſter had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in their devotion to the Sermon,
and I with my traine to the Maſſe, which
was ſaid in a little Chappell in the Parke,
from which when I came forth, we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99191:107"/>
our ſelves to walke either in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faire garden whoſe allyes on each ſide
were ſet with Lawrell and Cypreſſe trees,
or in the park where were walkes of three

made by the Rivers ſide, and the reſidue
of our time we paſſed in all variety of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
pleaſures, dancing being uſually after

<hi>Foſſeuſa,</hi> who depending altogether
on me, maintained her ſelfe with virtue
and ſo much honour, that had ſhe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, ſhe had not faln into that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
which reflected afterwards ſo much
on her, and on my ſelfe: but fortune en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
of a life ſo happy, which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by peace and union, in which had
we continued, we might ſecurely have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
her malice, ſtirred up a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of warre betwixt the King my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and the Catholicks, and wrought
the King my Husband, and Monſieur the
Marſhall of <hi>Biron,</hi> who at the Huguenots
requeſt had charge of the Kings Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> to ſo great an enmity,
that doe I what I could to keep the King
my Husband and him at peace, I could
not prevaile, but they grew into a great
defiance, and hatred one of the other, each
of them complaining to the King. The
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99191:108"/>
King my Husband demanded that Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur
the Marſhall of <hi>Biron</hi> ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the government of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and
Monſieur the Marſhall taxed my Husband
and thoſe of the pretended reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to have enterpriſed many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the treaty of the peace. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this diſunion did daily increaſe
it ſelfe to my great griefe, being unable to
redreſſe it, and Monſieur the Marſhall of
<hi>Biron</hi> perſwaded the King to come himſelf
into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> alledging that his preſence
would ſettle things in a better order, of
which the Huguenots being advertiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that the King came onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle
and to ſeize upon their Towns
which made them reſolve to have recourſe
to armes: this was that which ſo much
before I feared, and being now imbarked
to run the fortune of the King my Husband
and by conſequence ſeeing my ſelfe to be
on a ſide contrary to that of my Religion;
I ſpake to the King my Husband, and to
all thoſe of his Counſell to prevent it,
ſhewing how little advantageous to them
this warre was like to prove, where they
had ſo great a Chiefetaine to oppoſe them,
as was Monſieur the Marſhall of <hi>Biron,</hi> a
great Captaine, and ſtrongly incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, who would not make a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99191:108"/>
and dally with them, as others before
had done, but ſhould he command the
power of the King, and imploy them with
a reſolution to drive them out of the
Kingdome, they were not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
him. But the feare which they had
of the Kings comming into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and
their hopes of many enterpriſes on the
greateſt part of the Townes in <hi>Gaſcogny</hi>
and <hi>Languedock</hi> prevailed ſo much, that
although the King did doe me the honour
to put great truſt and confidence in me,
and the chiefe of the Religion did impute
much to my underſtanding, yet I could
not perſwade them to that, which a little
after to their expence they found too
true. The torrent uncontroul'd muſt run
a while, which ſhortly after will aſſwage
his courſe, when they ſhall come to the
experience of that which I foretold them;
but long before they proceeded to theſe
termes, ſeeing how the affaires diſpoſed
themſelves, I often beſought the King and
Queen my mother to provide a remedy,
by giving ſome content to the King my
husband, but they made no reckoning of
it, and it ſeemeth they were glad that
things were brought to ſuch a paſſe, being
perſwaded by the Marſhall <hi>Biron,</hi> that he
had found a means to reduce the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99191:109"/>
as low as he deſired. This advice
of mine being neglected, the grievances
by degrees advanced themſelves ſo farre,
that in the end they had their recourſe to
armes. They of the pretended reformed
Religion were much diſcontented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they failed in their forces which they
thought to have aſſembled, the army of
the King my Husband being in number
farre inferiour to that of the Marſhall <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
eſpecially all their enterpriſes having
miſcarried, unleſſe that onely on <hi>Cabors,</hi>
which they tooke with Petards, with the
loſſe of many Souldiers, by reaſon that
Monſieur <hi>de Vezins</hi> was there, who fought
with them for the ſpace of two or three
dayes, and who, with them, ſtreet after
ſtreet, and houſe after houſe did diſpute it
out unto the laſt; where the King my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
made apparent both his wiſdom, and
his valour, not as a Prince of his quality,
but as a brave and couragious Captain.
The taking of this Towne did rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage,
then advantage them. The
Marſhall of <hi>Biron</hi> finding his opportunity,
took to the field, ſeizing on, and plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the little Townes which held for
the Huguenots, and putting all to the edge
of the ſword. On the beginning of this
warre, ſeeing the honour which the King
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99191:109"/>
my husband did expreſſe unto me, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me not to abandon him; I reſolved
with my ſelf to run his fortune, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an extream griefe to finde the motive
of the warre was ſuch, that I could not
wiſh the advantage of the one ſide, or the
other, without deſiring it to my owne
dammage; for if the Huguenots had the
better, that would be the Ruine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion, the preſervation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I preferred to my owne life, and if the
Catholicks ſhould win upon the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,
I ſaw the ruine of the King my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
nevertheleſſe my duty command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to ſtay with him; and retained by
his love, and the confidence which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wrote unto the King and
Queen my mother of the eſtate wherein I
ſaw that Countrey, to have them adviſe
of thoſe affaires, which I found they did
too much neglect: I beſought them, that
if in conſideration of me, they would not
ſo much obliege me as to extinguiſh thoſe
flames, in the midſt whereof I ſaw my ſelf
expoſed, that at leaſt they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to command Monſieur the Marſhall of
<hi>Biron,</hi> that the Towne wherein I made my
abode, ſhould be held in neutrality, and
that within three miles of it there no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilitie
ſhould be practiſed, and that I
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99191:110"/>
ſhould obtaine as much of the King my
husband, for thoſe of his Religion. The
King did grant me this, provided that the
king my husband ſhould not be in <hi>Nerac,</hi>
but if he were, that then the neutrality
ſhould no longer be in force. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was obſerved on both ſides, with as
much reſpect as could be deſired, but it
could not withhold the king from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
often to <hi>Nerac,</hi> where Madame his
ſiſter and my ſelfe were reſident; it being
his Nature to delight himſelfe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Ladies, and he was at that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
inamoured on <hi>Foſſeuſa,</hi> whom he
ſerved ever ſince he forſooke <hi>Rebours,</hi> and
from whom I received no bad office, and
for this cauſe the king my husband did
live with me in as much privacy and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity,
as heretofore, ſeeing that I deſired
nothing more then his content in all
things; Theſe conſiderations having
brought him one day to <hi>Nerac,</hi> he ſtayed
there three dayes after being unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from a company ſo delightfull to
him. The Marſhall of <hi>Biron,</hi> who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ſuch an opportunitie, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, made as though he
brought his army that way, to joyn with
Monſieur <hi>de Cornuſſon</hi> the Seneſcall of
<hi>Tholouſe,</hi> on his paſſage over the river,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99191:110"/>
who brought more forces to him, and in
ſtead of marching toward the river, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon <hi>Nerac,</hi> and about nine of the
clock in the morning, he preſented himſelf
with all his army in battell array, within
a Canons ſhot of the towne; The King
my husband (who received advertiſement
the night before of the comming of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſſon,</hi>
deſiring to hinder them from joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their armies into one body) determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to fight with them apart, and was
gone that morning on break of day to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with them on the paſſage over the
river; but being deceived in his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
for Monſieur <hi>de Cornuſſon</hi> paſſed
over the river the night before, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Nerac,</hi> and as he entred in at one
gate, he underſtood that the Marſhall of
<hi>Biron</hi> ſtood in battell array before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
It was that day very ſtormy weather,
and there fell ſo much raine, that the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſes
could doe no ſervice. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the King my husband caſt ſome of his
troupes amongſt the Vines, to keepe the
Marſhall of <hi>Biron</hi> from approaching
neerer, having not the meanes, by reaſon
of the extreame raine which continued all
that day to doe any other feare of warre.
The Marſhall of <hi>Biron</hi> ſtood all the while
in battell array before our eyes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99191:111"/>
onely three or foure of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who demanded in way of turnament
to try their lances for the love of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
he kept his army intire, covering his
artillery till he was ready to diſcharge, and
on a ſudden, making his troupes give way,
and cleave aſunder, he thundered againſt
the Towne with ſeven or eight volleys of
Canon ſhot, whereof one of the bullets
latched on the Caſtle, and having made
this ſhot, he marched thence, ſending a
Trumpet to me to excuſe himſelf, and to
aſſure me, that had I been alone, he would
not for all the world have attempted it,
but I knew, he ſaid, that it was articled in
the neutrality concluded by the King, that
if the King my husband ſhould be at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi>
the neutrality ſhould then be void,
and that he had commandment from the
King, to make warre upon the King my
husband, in whatſoever place he found
him. In all other actions, Monſieur the
Marſhall of <hi>Biron</hi> had rendred great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and expreſſed himſelfe a friend unto
me; for my letters being fallen in the time
of the warre into his hands, he ſent them
ſafe, and faſt ſealed to me, and whoſoever
ſpake on my behalfe, received from him
honour and good entreaty. I made reply
unto his Trumpet, that I knew indeed that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99191:111"/>
Monſieur the Marſhall had done no more
then what pertained to the warre, and to
the Kings commandment; but a man of his
wiſedome might well have ſatisfied both
the one and the other, without offending
his friends, that he might well have given
me leave for thoſe three dayes to take
pleaſure in the contentment I received to
ſee the King my husband at <hi>Nerac,</hi> that he
could not take him in my preſence, but he
muſt ſeize on me alſo, that I was highly
offended at what he had done, and would
complaine unto the King. The warre
after this continued a certaine time, thoſe
of the Religion having always the worſe,
which did much aſſiſt me to prepare my
husband, and diſpoſe him to a peace. I
wrote often to the King and the Queen
my mother concerning it, but they would
not underſtand me, truſting to the good
fortune which as yet accompanied Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Marſhall of <hi>Biron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame time that this warre began,
the Towne of <hi>Cambray</hi> (which ſince my
departure out of <hi>France,</hi> was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the obedience of my Brother, by the
means of Monſieur <hi>de Ainſi,</hi> of whom I
have ſpoken heretofore) was beſieged by
the Spaniſh forces, of which my Brother
was advertiſed, being then at his houſe at
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99191:112"/>
               <hi>Ploſſis les Tours,</hi> and was newly returned
from <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he had received the
Townes of <hi>Montz, Valenciennes,</hi> and ſome
others, which were under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Count of <hi>Lalain,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with my Brother, cauſing him to be
acknowledged for their Soveraigne in all
the Countreys of his authoritie. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defiring to releeve it, had made a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
preſſe for Souldiers, intending with
all ſpeed to march downe with his army
to raiſe the ſiege; and becauſe it could not
ſo ſoon be ready, he put Monſieur <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
into the Towne, to ſuſtaine the ſeige,
expecting the comming of the Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Towne: As he was on theſe
preparations, and began to draw his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
together, the warre with the Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
did interpoſe it ſelfe, which cauſed
him to disband his troupes, to inroll them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the army of the King, which was
marching into <hi>Gaſcogny.</hi> This tooke
from my brother all the hope to releeve
<hi>Cambray,</hi> which he could not looſe, but
he muſt looſe with it not only all the reſt
of the Countrey, which he had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but what moſt grieved him, Monſieur
<hi>de Balany</hi> alſo, and all thoſe good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which he had put into <hi>Cambray.</hi> This
diſpleaſure ſate deepe within him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99191:112"/>
a Prince of great judgement, and who
never fayled of expedients in his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he perceived that the only remedy he
had, was to pacifie <hi>France,</hi> and having a
courage that found nothing difficult, he
undertooke to conclude a peace, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
diſpatched a Gentleman to the King
to perſwade him to it, and to beſeech him
to give him the charge to mediate the
peace: this he did, fearing that thoſe to
whom it ſhould have been committed,
would be ſo tedious in the execution of
their charge, that he ſhould looſe the
means and opportunitie to releeve <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
from whence Monſieur <hi>Balany,</hi> who
had already endured the fury of the ſiege,
ſent my Brother word, that he would give
him ſixe Moneths leiſure to bring down
his ſuccours, but if at that time the Seige
were not rayſed; the neceſſitie and want of
victualls would be ſuch, that he ſhould
not have the meanes to reſtraine the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
from ſurrendring the Towne. God
ſo bleſſed my brother in the deſigne he
had to perſwade the king unto the peace,
that he gave conſent unto it, and was glad
that my Brother offered himſelfe to bring
it to effect, hoping by this means to divert
him from his enterpriſe in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to
which he never was affected: He gave my
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99191:113"/>
brother the Commiſſion to treate it, and
conclude it, exhorting my Brother for his
aſſiſtance in it, to ſend for the Lords of
<hi>Villeroy,</hi> and <hi>Bellieure:</hi> this Commiſſion was
wrought ſo happily by my brother, that
comming into <hi>Gaſcogny</hi> (howſoever he
ſtayed ſeven Moneths in the effecting of it,
which time ſeemed to him as long againe,
becauſe of the labouring deſire which he
had to haſten to the ſuccour of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
although the content which he received
that I was with him, did much abate the
eagerneſſe of that care) yet he made a
peace to the content of the king and all the
Catholicks, leaving the king my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and the Huguenots no leſſe ſatisfied,
having proceeded in it with ſo much wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that he was beloved, and prayſed of
all, having alſo in this voyage wonne the
love of that great Captaine, the Marſhall
of <hi>Biron,</hi> who did there vow himſelf his
ſervant, to receive the charge of his army,
which was going into <hi>Flanders,</hi> whom (to
pleaſe the King my husband) my Brother
removed from his government of <hi>Gaſcog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and put in his place Monſieur the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
of <hi>Matignon;</hi> but before my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did depart, he did deſire that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
might be made betwixt the King
my husband, and Monſieur the Marſhall
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99191:113"/>
of <hi>Biron,</hi> who at the firſt ſight made me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
by an honeſt excuſe, of that
which paſſed at <hi>Nerac.</hi> I was enjoyned to
out-brave him for it with all the ſharpeſt
and moſt diſdainful language that I could;
but I uſed the paſſionate command of my
brother with ſuch diſcretion, as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to his affaires, knowing that the day
might come wherein he might much rely
on the aſſiſtance of ſo brave a Souldier. My
brother returning into <hi>France,</hi> attended
with Monſieur the Marſhall of <hi>Biron,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reived
no leſſe honour and juſt glory for
pacifying ſo great a trouble to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of all, then in the many victories he
atchieved by armes, and made his army
more great and powerfull; but what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
and glory is not attended with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie?
The King taking no pleaſure in it,
and in the ſixe or ſeven moneths time,
while my brother and my ſelf were both
together a treating of the peace in <hi>Gaſcog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
having had the leiſure to finde an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for his anger, conceived that I had
made that warre, and driven the King my
husband to it (who well can witneſſe the
contrary) that my Brother might enjoy
the honour of making the peace, which if
it had depended on me, it had been done
with more ſpeed, and leſſe paines, for his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99191:114"/>
affaires in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> received
great diſadvantage by this delay. But
alas envie and hate doe blinde our eyes,
and make us not to ſee things, as indeed
they are. The King building on this falſe
foundation a mortall hatred againſt my
Brother, and reviving in himſelf the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of what was paſſed, how
when he was in <hi>Poland,</hi> and ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from thence, I ever had preferred my
Brothers contentment and affaires above
his owne, joyning altogether at once, did
vow my ruine and my Brothers; In which
Fortune favoured his reſolution, cauſing
in the ſeven moneths ſpace that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was in <hi>Gaſcogny,</hi> the unhappineſſe to
be ſuch, that he fell in love with <hi>Foſſeuſa,</hi> to
whom the King my husband was a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
ever ſince he forſooke <hi>Rebours:</hi> this
being diſcovered, the King my husband
was offended with me, beleeving that I
did good offices for my brother, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the affection of <hi>Foſſeuſa</hi> from him;
this I no ſooner underſtood, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
ſo much my Brother in my behalf,
preſenting to him what miſerie might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
to me by it, that he who affected my
contentment above his owne, in this did
force his paſſion, and ſpake no more unto
her. Having on this ſide found redreſſe,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99191:114"/>
Fortune, who when once ſhee beginneth
to purſue, retireth never at the firſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-blow,
prepared a new attempt more
dangerous then the former, cauſing <hi>Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuſa,</hi>
who extreamly loved the King my
husband, and who till then permitted him
no other privacies, then what the honeſty
of a familiar love might well enjoy, to take
from him all jealous thoughts which he
had of my Brother, and to make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that ſhe did love him alone, did ſo
abandon her ſelf to content him in all
things, that the miſchiefe grew ſo great,
that ſhe was with Childe, and perceiving
her ſelf in this eſtate, ſhe changed all the
manner of her proceedings with me, and
in ſtead of her accuſtomed method, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free and open, and of doing me all the
good offices ſhe could, to indeere me the
more to the king my husband, ſhe began
now to conceale her ſelf from me, and to
render me as many bad offices, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe had done me good ones: She poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
ſo the king my husband, that in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time, I found a great alteration; he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged,
he conceal'd himſelf from me,
and took not that delight and pleaſure in
my company, as he had done for thoſe
foure or five happy yeers while we were in
<hi>Gaſcogny,</hi> and when <hi>Foſſeuſa</hi> governed her
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99191:115"/>
ſelfe with honour. The peace being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
my Brother returning into
<hi>France,</hi> as I have ſaid, to levie his Army, the
King my husband, and my ſelfe returned
to <hi>Nerac,</hi> where as ſoone as we were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>Foſſeuſa,</hi> either to finde a coverture
for her great belly, or to unburden her ſelf
of what ſhe had, did put it into the Kings
head, to goe to the hot waters that are in
<hi>Bearn.</hi> I beſought the King my husband
to excuſe me, if I accompanied him not, for
he knew that ſince the indignitie I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Pau,</hi> I had made a vow that I would
never returne till there they had free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the Catholick Religion, with
great importunity he preſſed me to goe,
and was very angry at the excuſes which
I made; In the end he told me, that his
Girle (for ſo he called <hi>Foſſeuſa)</hi> had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to take thoſe waters for the evill of
her ſtomacke; I made anſwere that I was
well content that ſhe ſhould goe without
me, and that it would make the world
thinke evill of her, there being no reaſon
for it: In the end I ſo prevailed, that he
was content to goe with her, taking two
of her companions, which were <hi>Rebours</hi>
and <hi>Villeſavin,</hi> with their governeſſe. They
departed thence, and I ſtayed behinde at
<hi>Baviere:</hi> I had every day intelligence
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99191:115"/>
from <hi>Rebours,</hi> who was ſhe whom the
King heretofore had loved, and who was
a corrupt and double-hearted wench, and
deſired nothing more then to turne <hi>Foſſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>
out of favour, hoping to poſſeſſe againe
her place in the affection of the King my
husband, that <hi>Foſſeuſa</hi> did me all the bad
offices in the world, ſpeaking of me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
and diſdainfull words, and
perſwading her ſelfe, if ſhe had a Sonne,
and could get cleere of me, that ſhe ſhould
be married to the king my husband, who
returning from <hi>Baveire,</hi> was reſolved to
goe to <hi>Pau,</hi> and to take me with him,
whether I would or no: Theſe advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
did much afflict me; nevertheleſſe
having my confidence in the mercy of
God, and the goodneſſe of the king my
husband, I paſſed the time of my abode at
<hi>Baveire,</hi> in expecting him, and in powring
out as many teares, as they dranke drops
of water where they were, although the
Catholick Nobility of that Country, with
whom I was accompanied, tooke all the
paines they could to make me forget my
afflictions. At the end of five weeeks, the
king my husband returning with <hi>Foſseuſa,</hi>
and her other companions, underſtood by
ſome of the Lords who were with me,
what ſorrows I endured, for feare of going
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99191:116"/>
unto the <hi>Pau,</hi> which was the cauſe he no
more ſtrongly importuned me, but onely
told me, he had a deſire that I ſhould goe,
but ſeeing my teares and words did joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
witneſſe unto him, that I had rather goe
unto my grave, he changed his reſolution,
and returned to <hi>Nerac;</hi> where ſeeing all
ſpake of <hi>Foſſeuſaes</hi> bigneſſe, and that it was
not onely all the talke at Court, but in the
Countrey alſo, I took upon me to ſilence
the report, and calling her into my cloſet,
ſpake thus unto her: Although ſome time
is paſſed ſince you have eſtranged your ſelf
from me, and I have been induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that you have done me bad offices to
the king my husband, yet the love which I
have borne unto you, and which I have
vowed to perſons of honor, to whom you
appertaine, doth enjoyne me to offer you
all ſuccour that may releeve you in the
miſhap whereinto you are fallen: I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you that you would not be perverſe,
nor by refuſing my love, to ruine both my
honour and your owne; I have ſo much
intereſt in your reputation, that it is as
deere to me as to your ſelf, and beleeve me,
I will performe the office of a mother to
you: Under the pretence of Peſtilence,
which you ſee to be raging in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and eſpecially in this Towne, I have
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99191:116"/>
the opportunity to remove to <hi>Mas de Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi>
which is a private and retired manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the King my husbands: I will take
with me no other traine, then whom you
deſire. In the meane time the King my
husband ſhall ſpend his time in hunting,
and ſhal not ſtir from thence until you are
delivered, and by this means, we may make
the rumour ceaſe which concerneth my
ſelf as much as you: ſhe in ſtead of giving
me thanks, with an extreame arrogance
replyed, that ſhe would make thoſe know
they lyed, that reported it, and ſpeaking as
lowd to me, as I ſpake ſoft to her, in a
great choler ſhe flung away, and ſent the
King my husband to me, who was very
angry for what I had ſpoken to <hi>Foſſeuſa,</hi>
ſaying that they were liars all, and that he
would prove them ſo that taxed her: A
long time he thus diſſembled it with me,
untill certaine moneths being expired, the
houre of her delivery was come. Her
pangs taking her in the morning about
the break of day, being then in bed, in that
chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where all the Virgins lay, that
attended on me, ſhe ſent for my Phyſitian
to come unto her, and deſired him to make
haſte to acquaint the King my husband
with it, which he did; We lay in one cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but in ſeverall beds, as our uſuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99191:117"/>
was, As the Phyſitian told him this, he
found himſelfe in a great perplexity, not
knowing what to doe, fearing on the one
ſide that it ſhould be diſcovered, and on
the other ſide, that ſhe ſhould be ill at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for he loved her intirely. In the end
he reſolved to acquaint me with it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that although ſhe highly had treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
againſt me, yet he ſhould finde me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to doe him any ſervice he commanded;
he opened my curtaine, and ſaid unto me,
Sweet heart I have concealed a thing
from you, which is neceſſary that I now
diſcover; I beſeech you to excuſe me, and
to remember no more what I have told
you on that Subject; only oblige me now
ſo farre, as preſently to riſe, and make haſte
unto <hi>Foſſeuſaes</hi> ſuccour, who is very ill, I
aſſure my ſelf, that knowing in what eſtate
ſhe is, you will not call any thing to minde
which heretofore hath paſſed; You know
how well I love her; in this I beſeech you
to obliege me to you: I replyed to him,
that I honoured him too much, to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at any thing which did proceed from
him, and intreated him that he would be
pleaſed to hunt that day, and take all his
people with him, that it might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
I cauſed her preſently to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the chamber of the Maides,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99191:117"/>
and lodged her in a retired roome, and
brought with me my Phiſitian, and ſome
truſty women to attend her, where very
ſafely ſhe was delivered. It pleaſed God to
ſend her a daughter, which ſince is dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
being delivered, we brought her back to
the chamber of the Maides, where though
we carried it with all privacy and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we could not hinder the report from
being ſpread over all the Caſtle. The
King my husband being returned from
hunting, made haſte to ſee her. She deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him that I might come unto her, as my
manner was, to viſite all my young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
when they were not well, hoping by
this meanes to ſtop the buſie rumour that
ranne of her. The King my husband came
forthwith into my chamber, and found me
lying on my bed, being very weary with
my early riſing, and with the paines I took
to aſſiſt <hi>Foſſeuſa</hi> in her childing throwes,
and deſired me that I would riſe, and goe
unto her: I made anſwere, that when ſhe
had need of my helpe, I was not abſent, but
ſeeing there was nothing to be done, if I
ſhould goe, I ſhould diſcover rather then
conceale the buſineſſe, and that every
finger did point at me already. At this
word he grew very angry, and what moſt
did grieve me, me thought that what I had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99191:118"/>
done that morning did not deſerve that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.
While thus paſſed the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of our affaires, the King, who was
not ignorant of any thing that was done
in the houſes of the Great ones of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and who was preciſely curious to
know the deportments of our Court, did
cauſe the Queen my Mother to write unto
me, that ſhe had a great deſire to ſee me,
that it was too much for five or ſixe
yeeres to be removed from her, that
it was now time to take a journey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Court, and that it ſhould much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the affaires of the King my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and my owne: The King himſelf
did afterwards write unto me to the ſame
effect, and cauſed fifteen hundred Crowns
to be delivered to me that no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
might delay me, and the Queene my
Mother ſent me word, that ſhe would
come her ſelfe into <hi>Xantoigne,</hi> and if the
King my husband would accompany me
thither, ſhe had ſome buſineſſe there to
communicate unto him, and to give
him the aſſurance of the Kings good
will. All theſe faire apparences could
not deceive me in the fruits which were
to be expected from the Court, having
had already too much experience of it,
but I reſolved to receive ſome profit by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99191:118"/>
theſe offers, to advance my own occaſions,
and the affaires of the King my husband,
hoping alſo it would prove a means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from <hi>Foſſeuſaes</hi> love, whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to take along with me, and that
the King my husband ſeeing her no more,
might poſſibly imbarke himſelf with ſome
one elſe that might not prove ſo croſſe and
ſpitefull to me. I had much to doe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the King my husband to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto this journey, becauſe it grieved
him to looſe the company of <hi>Foſſeuſa,</hi> and
becauſe the fame of her late miſchance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every where noiſed abroad, he joyntly
began to ſuffer in his reputation with her.
He made me better cheere then ordinary,
and laboured very much to take from me
the deſire of going into <hi>France.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already made promiſe by my letters
to the King and Queen my mother, and
more eſpecially having received the ſum
aboveſaid for the voyage, the misfortune
which drew me thence, took away with it
againe the deſire which I had to goe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the King my husband did begin to
expreſſe more friendſhip and affection to
mee.</p>
