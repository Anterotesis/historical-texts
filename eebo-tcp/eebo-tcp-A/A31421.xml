         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of whoſe temper is able to
render malice it ſelf candid and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable.
Encouraged alſo by this
conſideration, I hardned my ſelf into
the confidence of this Addreſs, which
I had not otherwiſe attempted, but
that your Lordſhips kindneſs and
generous compaſſion, and the mighty
condeſcention wherewith you were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pleaſed to treat me (while I had
the happineſs of your Lordſhips
neighbourhood, did at once invite
and oblige me to it. I ſay no more,
leſt I ſhould affront that <hi>modeſty</hi>
that is ſo innate to <hi>your</hi> temper, or
<pb facs="tcp:46588:4"/>
come within the leaſt ſuſpicion of
<hi>flattery,</hi> ſo repugnant to <hi>my own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing only there is, which I
cannot but remark, the great honour
which your Lordſhip has done, not
to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> only, but to the
whole <hi>miniſterial</hi> order, that a perſon
of your Rank and Education would
ſtoop to an employment, ſo little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
and regarded in this unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and degenerate Age. And herein
your Lordſhip has been a happy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent;
your example being already
followed by ſome, and will ſhortly
by more perſons of Noble Deſcent
and Pedigree: a thing for which the
Church of <hi>England</hi> was never more
renowned, ſince the Reformation, than
it is at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a time within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of our memmory, when the Biſhops
amongst other things were accuſed
<pb facs="tcp:46588:5"/>
(by one of the Houſe of Peers,<note place="margin">Church-Hiſt. lib. 11. p. 183.</note> though
one that had not the moſt reaſon to
bring in a charge of that nature) to
be in reſpect of their Parentage <hi>de
faece populi,</hi> of the very <hi>dregs</hi> and
<hi>refuſe</hi> of the people (malice will play
at ſmall games, rather than not at
all.) A charge as falſe as it was
ſpiteful: though had it been true, it
had been impertinent; ſeeing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>order</hi> is enough to derive honour
upon the perſon, even when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
as your Lordſhip, bring it along
with him. And indeed ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Order has Epiſcopacy ever
been accounted, even when there have
been no viſible advantages, either of
riches or grandeur to attend it, as
there were not in the more early Ages
of Chriſtianity, that perſons of the
greateſt Birth and Fortunes have not
thought it below them to exchange the
Civil <hi>Tribunal</hi> for the Biſhops
<hi>Throne,</hi> and to lay down the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>I Know not whether it may be any
ſatisfaction to the curioſity of the
Reader, to underſtand the birth and
original of theſe <hi>Papers;</hi> if it be, let him
take this account. No ſooner did I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at years capable of diſcerning, but
I began to enquire into the grounds of
that Religion, into which I had been
baptized: which I ſoon found to be ſo
noble and excellent, in all its <hi>laws</hi> ſo juſt
and rational, in all its <hi>deſigns</hi> ſo divine
and heavenly, ſo perfective of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
ſo conducive to the <hi>happineſs</hi> of
humane nature; a Religion ſo <hi>worthy</hi>
of God, ſo <hi>advantageous</hi> to man, built
upon ſuch firm and uncontroulable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
back'd with ſuch proper and
powerful arguments that I was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinc'd of the <hi>Divinity</hi> that reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in it, and concluded with my ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:46588:8"/>
(and I thought I had reaſon ſo to do)
that ſurely the Diſciples of this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
muſt needs be the moſt excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the world. But alas a few years
experience of the world let me ſee, that
this was the concluſion of one that had
convers'd only with Books, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
of his own mind. I had not been
long an obſerver of the manners of men,
but I found them generally ſo debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and vitious, ſo corrupt and contrary
to the rules of this holy Religion, that
if a modeſt and honeſt <hi>Heathen</hi> was to
eſtimate Chriſtianity by the lives of its
Profeſſors, he would certainly proſcribe
it as the vileſt Religion in the world.
Being offended hereat, I reſolved <hi>to
ſtand in the ways and ſee, and enquire
for the good old way, the Paths wherein
the ancient Chriſtians walk'd:</hi> for I could
not think that this had always been the
unhappy fate and portion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;<note place="margin">Quando Domini no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri adhuc calebat cruor, &amp; fervebat recens in credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus fides. <hi>Hieron. ad Demetr. p. 68. tom.</hi> 1.</note>
and that if the footſteps of true
Chriſtian piety and ſimplicity were any
where to be found, it muſt be in thoſe
times, <hi>when</hi> (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> notes) <hi>the
blood of Chriſt was yet warm in the breaſts
of Chriſtians, and the faith and ſpirit of
Religion more brisk and vigorous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of this deſign, I ſet my
<pb facs="tcp:46588:8"/>
ſelf to a more cloſe and diligent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the firſt Fathers and ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of the Church than ever I had
done before, eſpecially for the <hi>three</hi> or
<hi>four firſt Centures,</hi> for much lower I did
not intend to go, becauſe the life and
ſpirit of Chriſtianity did then viſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
apace; noting as I went along
whatever contributed to my ſatisfaction
in this affair. Had I conſulted my own
eaſe and quiet, I might have gone a
nearer way to work, and have taken
up with what I could have pick'd up of
this nature in <hi>Baronius,</hi> the <hi>Centuries,
&amp;c.</hi> But I could not ſatisfie my ſelf (and
I preſume it would as little have ſatisfied
the Reader) with ſhreds, with things
taken upon truſt, and borrowed at the
ſecond hand. For the ſame reaſon I made
little uſe of the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi>
(eſpecially in ſuch inſtances whereof
there was the leaſt cauſe to doubt) and
the ſpurious and ſuppoſitious Writings
of the Fathers, ſeldom making uſe of
any but ſuch as are of unqueſtionable
credit and authority. And becauſe the
teſtimony of an enemy is ever account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of great moment and regard, I have
been careful to add the teſtimonies that
have been given to Chriſtians and to
<pb facs="tcp:46588:9"/>
their Religion by the known and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Faith;
ſuch as <hi>Pliny, Lucian, Porphyry, Julian,
&amp;c.</hi> more whereof we might have been
furniſhed with, had thoſe Writings of
theirs againſt the Chriſtian Religion
been extant, which the zeal of the firſt
Chriſtian Princes induſtriouſly baniſhed
out of the world. What other Authors
of later date I have borrowed any light
from in this diſcourſe, I have faithfully
produced in the margent. Two Books
indeed I met with, which at firſt ſight
I well hoped would have wholly ſaved
me the labour of this ſearch; the one
written by a perſon of
our own Nation;<note place="margin">A modeſt Diſcourſe of the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, charity, and policy of elder Times and Chriſtians, &amp;c. by Edw. Waterhouſe, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Lond. 1655.</note> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a <hi>Florentine</hi> of
great name and note: but
my hopes were very much
fruſtrated in both.<note place="margin">Paganin. Gaudentius de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Chriſtianorum ante tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Conſtantini. Florent. 1639. quarto.</note> For
the firſt, I no ſooner look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into it, but found my
ſelf wretchedly impoſed
upon by the Title, his <hi>Elder times and
Chriſtians</hi> (not to ſay any thing of his
intermixtures of things nothing to his
purpoſe) ſeldom reaching any higher
than the <hi>middle-Ages</hi> of the Church,
little or nothing being remark'd of the
<pb facs="tcp:46588:9"/>
               <hi>firſt Ages</hi> of Chriſtianity, the only thing
I aimed at. For the other (which I met
not with till I had almoſt finiſhed this
ſearch) I found it miſerably thin and
empty, containing little elſe but ſhort
gloſſes upon ſome few paſſages out of
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> from whence I did not enrich
my ſelf with any one obſervation, which
I had not made before. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
an Epiſtle of <hi>Fronto</hi>'s the learned
<hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Affair;<note place="margin">De vita &amp; moribus Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, &amp;c. Par. 1660. quart.</note> but it contains only
ſome general intimations, and ſeems to
have been deſigned by him (as appears
from that, and ſome other of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles)
as the ground-work of a larger
and more particular diſcourſe. But his
death happening ſome few years after
the date of that Epiſtle, cut off all hopes
of proſecuting ſo excellent a deſign.
Theſe are all that I know of, who have
attempted any thing in this ſubject, none
whereof coming up to the curioſity of
my deſign, I was forced to reſume the
task I had undertaken, and to go on
with it through thoſe ancient Writers
of the Church; the reſult of which
ſearch is laid together in this Book.</p>
            <p>Whether I have diſcharged my ſelf
herein to the ſatisfaction of the Reander,
<pb facs="tcp:46588:10"/>
I know not; ſure I am, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
what I propounded to my ſelf,
<hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Specimen</hi> of <hi>Primitive Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
in ſome of the moſt conſiderable
branches and inſtances of Religion. Here
he will find a <hi>Piety</hi> active and zealous,
ſhining through the blackeſt clouds of
malice and cruelty; afflicted <hi>innocence</hi>
triumphant, notwithſtanding all the
powerful or politick attempts of men or
Devils; a <hi>patience</hi> unconquerable under
the biggeſt perſecutions; a <hi>charity</hi> truly
<hi>Catholick</hi> and unlimited; a <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and
upright carriage in all tranſactions; a
<hi>ſobriety</hi> and <hi>temperance</hi> remarkable to
the admiration of their enemies; and
in ſhort, he will here ſee the divine and
holy Precepts of the Chriſtian Religion
drawn down into action, and the moſt
excellent <hi>genius</hi> and ſpirit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
breathing in the hearts and lives of
theſe good old Chriſtians. Here he will
find a real and evident confutation of
that ſenſeleſs and abſurd <hi>calumny,</hi> that
was faſtned upon Chriſtianity, as if it
required no more than an <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous</hi>
temper of mind; as if under a
pretence of kindneſs and indulgence to
ſinners; it miniſtred to all vice and
wickedneſs. <hi>Celſus</hi> confidently begins
<pb facs="tcp:46588:10"/>
the charge. <hi>There be ſome
amongst the Chriſtians</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>that will neither
give nor receive a reaſon of
their faith,</hi>

fooliſhneſs good and uſeful.
Julian</hi> carries on the
charge ſomewhat higher, as if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion were not only content
with a naked and an empty Faith, but
gave encouragement to ſin, by aſſuring
its moſt deſperate <hi>Proſelytes</hi> of an eaſie
pardon. In the concluſion of his <hi>Caeſars,</hi>
after he had aſſigned the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

delivers over <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> the

As if Chriſtianity
had been nothing elſe
<pb facs="tcp:46588:11"/>
but a <hi>Receptacle</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary</hi> for <hi>Rogues</hi>
and <hi>Villains,</hi> where the worſt of men
might be wicked under hopes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
But how falſe and groundleſs (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as urged and intended by them)
this impious charge was, appears from
the whole deſign and tenour of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and that more than ordinary vein
of piety and ſtrictneſs that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
in the lives of its firſt profeſſors,
whereof we have in this Treatiſe given
abundant evidence.</p>
            <p>To this repreſentation of their lives
and manners, I have added ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
concerning the ancient Rites and
Uſages of the Church; wherein if any
one ſhall meet with ſomething that does
not jump with his own humour, he will
I doubt not have more diſcretion than
to quarrel with me for ſetting down
things as I found them. But in this part
I have ſaid the leſs, partly becauſe this
was not the thing I primarily deſigned,
partly becauſe it has been done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in juſt Diſcourſes. In ſome few
inſtances I have remarked the <hi>corruption</hi>
and <hi>degeneracy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
from the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
Church; and more I could eaſily
have added, but that I ſtudiouſly avoided
<pb facs="tcp:46588:12"/>
controverſies, it being no part of my
deſign to enquire, what was the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Fathers in diſputable caſes,
eſpecially the more abſtruſe and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
ſpeculations of Theology, but what
was their practice, and by what rules
and meaſures they did govern and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
their lives. The truth is, their
<hi>Creed</hi> in the firſt Ages was <hi>ſhort</hi> and
<hi>ſimple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Praefat. in Hilar. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> their Faith lying then (as <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
obſerves) not ſo much in <hi>nice</hi> and
<hi>numerous</hi> Articles, as in a <hi>good</hi> and an
<hi>holy</hi> life. At the end of the Book I have
added a Chronological <hi>Index</hi> of the
<hi>Authors,</hi> according to the times wherein
they are ſuppoſed to have lived, with an
account of the <hi>Editions</hi> of their Works
made uſe of in this Treatiſe. Which I
did, not that I had a mind to tell the
world, either what, or how many Books
I had; a piece of vanity of which had
I been guilty, it had been no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have furniſh'd out a much larger
Catalogue. But I did it, partly to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the requeſt of the Bookſeller, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe I conceived it might not be
altogether unuſeful to the Reader; the
<hi>Index,</hi> to give ſome light to the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by knowing when the Author
lived, eſpecially when he ſpeaks of things
<pb facs="tcp:46588:12"/>
done in or near his own time, and
which muſt otherwiſe have been done
at every turn in the body of the Book.
And becauſe there are ſome Writings
frequently made uſe of in this Book, the
Authors whereof in this <hi>Index</hi> could be
reduced to no certain date, eſpecially
thoſe called the <hi>Apoſtolical Canons</hi> and
<hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> it may not be amiſs here
briefly to take notice of them. And firſt
for the <hi>Canons;</hi> as I am far from their
opinion who aſcribe them to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
ſo I think their great Antagoniſt
Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> bends the ſtick as much too
far the other way, not allowing them a
being in the world till the year 500 or a
<hi>little</hi> before. The truth doubtleſs lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two: 'Tis evident both from
the Hiſtories of the Church, and many
paſſages in <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that there were in the moſt early
Ages of Chriſtianity frequent Synods and
Councils for ſetling the Doctrine and
Diſcipline of the Church, though their
determinations under that notion be not
extant at this day. Part of theſe <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi>
Decrees, ſo many of them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
the Rites and Diſcipline of the
Church, we may conceive ſome perſon
of learning and judgment gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb facs="tcp:46588:13"/>
probably about the beginning
of the third Century, and put them
(eſpecially the firſt <hi>Fifty,</hi> for I look not
upon the whole <hi>eighty five</hi> as of equal
value and authority) if not into the
ſame, into ſome ſuch form and method,
wherein we now have them; ſtiling
them <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Canons,
not as if they had been compoſed by
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but either becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
things conſonant to the Doctrines
and Rules delivered by the Apoſtles, or
becauſe made up of uſages and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſuppoſed to be derived from them,
or laſtly becauſe made by ancient and
<hi>Apoſtolic</hi> men. That many, if not all,
of theſe Canons were ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time extant before the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council, we have great reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
from two or three paſſages amongſt
many others.<note place="margin">Epiſt. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. ad Amphil. Can. 3.</note> S. <hi>Baſil</hi> giving rules about

ſets them at too wide a diſtance, aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to the latter end of the fifth
Century: when 'tis as clear as the Sun
<pb facs="tcp:46588:14"/>
that they were extant, and in credit
with many before the times of <hi>Epihani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
(though ſomewhat altered now from

compoſed by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> (and
thence by an eaſie miſtake aſcribed to <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Romanus)</hi> I am not at leiſure to
conſider. In this Claſs of Writers I may
reckon <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough aſſerted by many to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine,
by <hi>Daillé</hi> thruſt down to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the ſixth Century: but moſt
probably thought to have been written
about the middle of the fourth Age, as
a perſon amongſt us deſervedly of great
name and note has ſhewn in his late <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
of <hi>Ignatius</hi> Epiſtles. Theſe are
the principal of thoſe Authors, who
could not be fix'd upon any certain
year: the reſt have in the <hi>Index</hi> their
particular and reſpective times. To which
I have added the account of the <hi>Editions</hi>
for the more ready finding (if occaſion
be) of any paſſage quoted out of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46588:15"/>
One thing indeed there is which I
cannot but take notice of, it looks ſo
like a piece of vanity and oſtentation,
that the margent is charged with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>quotations:</hi> but whoever conſiders
the nature of my deſign, will quickly
ſee that it was abſolutely neceſſary, and
that it concerned me not to deliver any
thing without good authority; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why I have, where I could, brought
them in ſpeaking their own words:
though to avoid as much of the charge
as was poſſible, I omitted the citing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
in their own Languages, and only
ſet them down in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the Authors ſenſe, though
not always tying my ſelf to a ſtrict and
preciſe tranſlation. How pertinent my
quotations are, the Reader muſt judge;
I hope he will find them exact, being
immediately fetched from the fountain-head;
here being very few (if any) that
have not been examined more than once.
For the method into which the Book is
caſt, I choſe that which to me ſeemed
moſt apt and proper, following S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
diſtribution of Religion into <hi>piety</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, <hi>ſobriety</hi> towards our ſelves,
and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> towards others; and
accordingly divided the diſcourſe into
<pb facs="tcp:46588:15"/>
three parts, reſpecting thoſe three great
branches of Religion; though the firſt
is much larger than either of the other,
by reaſon of ſome <hi>preliminary</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
containing a vindication of the
Chriſtians from thoſe crimes that were
charged upon them, that ſo the rubbiſh
being cleared and thrown out of the
way, we might have a fairer proſpect of
their Religion afterwards. The Book I
confeſs is ſwell'd into a greater bulk,
than I either thought of, or deſired;
but by reaſon of ſomewhat a confuſed
Copy never deſign'd for the <hi>Preſs,</hi> no
certain meaſures could be taken of it.</p>
            <p>And now if after all this, it ſhall be
enquired, why theſe Papers are made
publick, as I can give no very good
reaſon, ſo I will not trouble my ſelf to
invent a bad one. It may ſuffice to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that this diſcourſe (long ſince
drawn up at leiſure hours) lay then by
me, when a tedious and uncomfortable
diſtemper (whereby I have been taken
off from all <hi>publick</hi> Service, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of <hi>ſeverer</hi> ſtudies) gave me too
much opportunity to look over my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and this eſpecially, which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
otherwiſe had never ſeen the
light. Indeed I muſt confeſs I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:46588:16"/>
the eaſilier prevailed with to let
this diſcourſe paſs abroad, that it might
appear, that when I could not do what
I ought, I was at leaſt willing to do what
I could. If he that reads it, ſhall reap
any delight and ſatisfaction by it, or be
in any meaſure induced to imitate theſe
primitive virtues, I ſhall think my pains
well beſtowed: if not, I am not the firſt,
and probably ſhall not be the laſt, that
has written a Book to no purpoſe.</p>

               <head type="sub">Things charged upon the Primitive
Chriſtians, reſpecting their
Religion.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Chriſtian Religion likely to meet with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
at its firſt ſetting out. Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undermined by Calumnies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
Three things by the Heathens
charged upon the Chriſtians; ſome things
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46588:21"/>
reſpecting their Religion;<note place="margin">Part 1.</note> ſome their
outward condition; others their moral
carriage, and the matters of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Their Religion charged with two
things, Impiety and Novelty. The
charge of Atheiſm conſidered, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
out of the Fathers. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
excepted againſt, as incompetent
judges of the affairs of Chriſtianity. In
what ſenſe Chriſtians confeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Atheiſts. The wretched and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
Deities that were amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and the impure manner of their
worſhip. Atheiſm, properly ſuch, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
and denied by Chriſtians. The
account they gave of their Religion, and
the God whom they worſhipped.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NO ſooner did the Son of God
appear in the world, to eſtabliſh
the moſt excellent Religion that
ever was communicated to Mankind, but
he met with the moſt fierce and vigorous
oppoſition: perſecuted and devoted to
death aſſoon as he was born, followed all
his life with freſh aſſaults of malice and
cruelty, his credit traduced and ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
his Doctrine deſpiſed and ſlighted,
and himſelf at laſt put to death with the
moſt exquiſite arts of torture &amp; diſgrace.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46588:21"/>
And <hi>if they thus ſerved the Maſter of the
houſe, how much more them of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;
the diſciple not being above his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
nor the ſervant above his Lord.</hi>
Therefore when he gave commiſſion to
his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to publiſh this Religion to
the world, he told them beforehand,
what hard and unkind reception they
muſt look to meet with, <hi>that he ſent them
forth as Sheep in the midſt of Wolves,
that they ſhould be delivered up to the
Councils, and ſcourged in the Synagogues,
and be brought before Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and be hated of all men for his
names ſake;</hi> nay ſo high ſhould the
quarrel ariſe upon the account of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that men ſhould violate ſome of the
neareſt Laws of Nature, <hi>betray their
friends and kinsfolk; the Brother delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up the Brother to death, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Child, the Children riſing up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Parents, and cauſing them to be
put to death.</hi> This he well foreſaw (and
the event truly anſwered it) would be
the fate of its firſt appearing in the
world: and indeed, conſidering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate and circumſtances of the
world at that time, it could not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
be expected, that the <hi>Chriſtian
Religion</hi> ſhould meet with a better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46588:22"/>
for the genius and nature
of its <hi>Doctrine</hi> was ſuch, as was almoſt
impoſſible to eſcape the frowns and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of men: a Doctrine it was, that
call'd men off from luſts and pleaſures,
and offered violence to their native incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
that required the greateſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſeverity of life, obliged men <hi>to
deny themſelves, to take up their Croſs,</hi>
and to <hi>follow</hi> the ſteps of a poor crucified
<hi>Saviour,</hi> and that upon little other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
at preſent, than the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rewards of another world. It intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>new</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to thoſe of former Ages, and ſuch
as did undermine the received and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
principles of that <hi>Religion,</hi> that
for ſo many Generations had governed
the world; it revealed and brought to
light ſuch truths, as were not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the principles of mens education,
but many of them above the reach of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
comprehenſion, too deep for the
line of humane reaſon to fathom or find
out.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe, and ſuch like accounts,
Chriſtianity was ſure to encounter with
mighty <hi>prejudices</hi> and potent oppoſition;
and to it did; for no ſooner did it peep
abroad in the world, but it was <hi>every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46588:22"/>
where ſpoken againſt:</hi> Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
and the greateſt powers and
policies of the world, did for ſome Ages
confederate and combine together, to
extirpate and baniſh it out of the world:
and certainly, if Arms and Armies, if
ſtrength and ſubtilty, if malice and
cruelty could have ſtifled it, it had been
ſmothered in its infancy and firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
into the world. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all theſe oppoſitions, it ſtill lifted
up his head in triumph, and outbrav'd the
fierceſt ſtorms of perſecution; and as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> told their Enemies, <hi>by every
exquiſite act of cruelty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apol. c. ult. p. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>they did but tempt
others to come over to the party, the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they were mowed down, the faſter they
ſprang up again, the blood of Chriſtians
making the Churches ſoil more fat and
fertile.</hi> Hereupon the great enemy of
mankind, betook himſelf to other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
and ſought to undermine, what he
ſaw he could not carry by open aſſault
and battery; he ſtudied to leaven the
minds of men with falſe and unjuſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
it with whole loads of reproaches
and defamations, knowing no ſpeedier
way to hinder its <hi>reception,</hi> than to
blaſt its <hi>reputation.</hi> For this purpoſe all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46588:23"/>
the arts of ſpite and malice were muſtred
up, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> confidently charged
with all thoſe crimes that could render
them and their Religion vile and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous:
Now the things that were charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Chriſtians, were either ſuch
as reſpected their <hi>Religion,</hi> or ſuch as
concern'd their <hi>outward ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or ſuch as related to their <hi>moral
carriage and behaviour,</hi> with ſome things
relating to the matter or manner of their
Worſhip; we ſhall conſider them in order,
and how the Chriſtians of thoſe times
vindicated themſelves from theſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Religion at its firſt
coming abroad into the world, was
mainly charged with theſe two things,
<hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Novelty:</hi> For the firſt,
'twas commonly cryed out againſt, as a
grand piece of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> as
an affront to their Religion, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
the very being and exiſtence
of their gods; this is the ſum of the
charge,<note place="margin">J. Martyr. Ap. 1. p. 47.</note> as we find it in the ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts;<note place="margin">Athenag. Legat. p 4</note>
more particularly <hi>Caecilius</hi> the
Heathen, in <hi>Minucius Felix</hi> accuſes the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> for a deſperate undone and
unlawful faction,<note place="margin">Arnob l. 1. p. 7. Min. Fael. p. 7.</note> who by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
did <hi>ſnuff</hi> and <hi>ſpit</hi> at the mention
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46588:23"/>
of their gods, deride their worſhip, ſooff
at their Prieſts, and deſpiſe their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as no better than <hi>Charnel-houſes,</hi>
and heaps of bones and aſhes of the dead;
for theſe, and ſuch like reaſons, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
were every where accounted a pack
of <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and their Religion <hi>the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm;</hi>
and ſeldom it is that <hi>Julian the
Emperor</hi> calls <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by any other
name.<note place="margin">Pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. pa. 888. tom. 2.</note> Thus <hi>Lucian</hi> bringing in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the Impoſtor ſetting up for an Oracle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger,
ranks the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi>
and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> as thoſe that were
eſpecially to be baniſhed from his myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Rites. In anſwer to this charge, the
Chriſtians pleaded eſpecially theſe three
things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were for the
moſt part <hi>incompetent</hi> Judges of ſuch
caſes as theſe, as being almoſt wholly
ignorant of the true ſtate of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctrine,</hi> and therefore unfit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
ſentence againſt it. Thus when
<hi>Creſcens the Philoſopher</hi> had traduced the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as atheiſtical and irreligious,
<hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> anſwers,<note place="margin">Juſt. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. loc. laud.</note> that he talked
about things which he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
feigning things of his own head,
only to comply with the humour of his
ſeduc'd diſciples and followers; that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46588:24"/>
the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when
he did not underſtand it, he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a moſt wicked and malignant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and ſhewed himſelf far worſe than
the moſt ſimple and unlearned, who
are not wont raſhly to bear witneſs and
determine in things not ſufficiently
known to them. Or if he did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
its <hi>greatneſs and excellency,</hi> then
he ſhewed himſelf much more baſe and
diſ-ingenuous, in charging upon it what
he knew to be falſe, and concealing his
inward ſentiments and convictions, for
fear, leſt he ſhould be ſuſpected to be a
<hi>Chriſtian.</hi> But <hi>Juſtin</hi> well knew, that
he was miſerably unskilful in matters of
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> having formerly had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and diſputations with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
theſe things; and therefore offer'd
the <hi>Senate of Rome</hi> (to whom he then
preſented his <hi>Apology)</hi> if they had not
heard the ſum of it, to hold another
conference with him, even before the
<hi>Senate</hi> it ſelf: which he thought would
be a work worthy of ſo wiſe and grave
a Council: or if they had heard it, then
he did not doubt, but they clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
how little he underſtood theſe
things; or, that if he did underſtand
them, he knowingly diſſembled it to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46588:24"/>
his Auditors, not daring to own the
truth, as <hi>Socrates</hi> did in the face of
danger: an evident argument that he was
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>not a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi>
but a <hi>ſlave to popular applauſe and
glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They did in ſome ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the charge, that according to the
vulgar notion which the <hi>Heathens</hi> had
of their <hi>Deities,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">J. Mart. Ap. 2. (ſen verius 1.) p. 56. &amp; p. 55.</note> they were <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> i.e.
<hi>ſtrangers and enemies to them;</hi> that the
gods of the Gentiles were at beſt but
<hi>Daemons,</hi> impure and unclean ſpirits, who
had long impoſed upon mankind, and
by their villanies, ſophiſtries, and arts
of terrour, had ſo affrighted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, who knew not really what
they were, and who judge of things
more by appearance than by reaſon, that
they call'd them gods, and gave to every
one of them that name, which the <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
was willing to take to himſelf, and
that they really were nothing but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
fallen and apoſtate ſpirits, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
evidently manifeſted at every turn,
forcing them to the confeſſing it, while
by Prayer and invocating the name of
the true God, they drove them out of
poſſeſſed perſons, and therefore they
trembled to encounter with a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46588:25"/>
as <hi>Octavius</hi> triumphingly tells <hi>Caecilius;</hi>
that they entertained the moſt abſurd
and fabulous notions of their gods,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> and
uſually aſcrib'd ſuch things to them, as
would be accounted an horrible <hi>ſhame</hi>
and <hi>diſhonour</hi> to any wiſe and good man,
the Worſhip and myſterious Rites of
many of them being ſo brutiſh and filthy,
that the honeſter and ſeverer <hi>Romans</hi>
were aſham'd on't, and therefore over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
their Altars, and baniſhed them
out of the roll of their Deities, though
their degenerate poſterity took them in
again,<note place="margin">Apol. c. 7. p. 7.</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves; their gods
themſelves ſo impure and beaſtly, their
Worſhip ſo obſcene and deteſtable, that
<hi>Julius Firmicus</hi> adviſes them to turn
their <hi>Temples</hi> into <hi>Theatres,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">de err. prof. Relig. p. 9.</note> where the
ſecrets of their Religion may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in <hi>Scenes,</hi> and to make their <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Prieſts,</hi> and that the common rout
might ſing the <hi>amours,</hi> the ſports and
paſtimes, the wantonneſſes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties
of their gods, no places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo fit for ſuch a Religion as they.
Beſides the attributing to them hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodies, with many blemiſhes and
imperfections, and ſubjection to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of humane life, and to the laws of
mortality, they could not deny them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46588:25"/>
to have been guilty of the moſt horrid
and prodigious villanies and enormities,
revenge and murther, inceſt and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
drunkenneſs and intemperance, theft
and unnatural rebellion againſt their
Parents, and ſuch like, of which their
own Writings were full almoſt in every

debauch the minds and manners of
youth,<note place="margin">Min. Fael. p. 19. vid. Arnob. adv. gent. l. 1. p. 7.</note> as <hi>Octavius</hi> tells his adverſary,

the ſame purpoſe <hi>Athenagoras,</hi>

acknowledges one God, the maker of

are manifeſtly wrong'd both in word

how dare you make ſo raſh a charge?
To adore the mighty God, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

of the higheſt powers, to pray
to him with the moſt obſequious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
under an afflicted ſtate to lay
hold of him with all our powers, to love
him, and look up to him, is this a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and deteſtable Religion, a Religion
full of ſacriledge and impiety, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and defiling all ancient Rites? is
this that bold and prodigious crime, for
which your Gods are ſo angry with us?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46588:28"/>
and for which you your ſelves do ſo rage
againſt us, confiſcating our Eſtates, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our perſons, burning, tearing, and
racking us to death with ſuch exquiſite
tortures? <hi>We Chriſtians</hi> are nothing elſe
but the worſhippers of the ſupream King
and Governour of the world, according
as we are taught by <hi>Chriſt our Maſter:</hi>
ſearch, and you'll find nothing elſe in our
Religion: this is the <hi>ſum</hi> of the whole

wont to proſtrate and bow our ſelves, him
we worſhip with common and conjoin'd

which are juſt and honeſt, and ſuch as are
not unworthy of him to hear and grant.

               <p>Secondly, Admit the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

and that they ought not to be
eternally bound up in old inveterate Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and Principles, when thoſe which
were abundantly more reaſonable and

tell us <hi>(ſays Clemens Alex.)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Admonit. ad gent. p. 57.</note> that you
may not ſubvert the Cuſtoms received

which we were accuſtomed, when we

rather keep them at the ſame pitch, juſt
as we received them from our Fathers:
why have we left off thoſe toys and
ſports, to which we were wonted while
Infants and Children, but only becauſe
years and diſcretion (although we had

condemned thoſe that went before:

                  <hi>Our way
of Religion</hi> (you ſay) <hi>is new, and yours
ancient: and what does this either hurt

'twill in time become old; is yours old, there
was a time when it was new: the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               </p>
               <p>It may not be impertinent in this
place to take notice of what the Heathens
objected as a branch of this charge:<note place="margin">Id. ib. p. 43. vid. Greg.</note> that

of mankind come no <hi>ſooner,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
this Religion, to lead men into the
truth, to tell the world who this true
God was, and to reduce us to the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of him; if ſo, why did God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to ſtay ſo long, and to be born
(as 'twere) but a few hours before, in
compariſon of the preceding Ages of the
world? To this <hi>Arnobius</hi> anſwers, with
a great deal of <hi>modeſty</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> that
he could not tell; that 'twere eaſie to
retort the ſame captious queſtion upon
them; if 'twere ſo much to the benefit
of the world, that <hi>Hercules, Aeſculapius,
Mercury, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be gods, why were
they born and deified no <hi>ſooner,</hi> that not
only poſterity but antiquity might have
reap'd advantage by them? If there was
reaſon in one caſe, then there was alſo
in the other; but to aſſign proper and
particular reaſons was not poſſible; it not
being within the power of ſuch a ſhort-ſighted
Creature as man is, to fathom the
depth of the Divine Councils, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by what ways or methods he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſes
his affairs; theſe things being
known only to him who is the grand Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
the Soveraign Lord and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of all things: that although we
are not able to aſſign the cauſe why a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46588:35"/>
thing comes to paſs in this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
manner, yet this concludes never
a whit the more, that the thing is not
ſo, or that it is leſs credible, when it has
otherwiſe the moſt clear and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
evidence and demonſtration. More
particularly he anſwers, that our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
cannot be ſaid to have been lately
ſent in reſpect of God, becauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of eternity there is nothing late;
where there is neither <hi>beginning</hi> nor
<hi>end,</hi> there can be nothing <hi>too ſoon,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>too late:</hi> Time indeed is tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by parts and terms, but theſe have
no place in a perpetual and uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeries of eternal Ages: what if that
<hi>ſtate</hi> of things, to which he came to bring
relief, required that <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of time to
come in? what if the condition of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and modern times were in this caſe
not alike? or call'd for ſomewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
methods of cure? it may be the
great God then choſe to ſend <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when
the ſtate of mankind was more <hi>broken</hi>
and <hi>ſhatter'd,</hi> and humane nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more weak and unable to help it
ſelf: this we are ſure of, that if what
ſo lately came to paſs had been neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to have been done ſome thouſands
of years ago, the ſupream Creator would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46588:36"/>
have done it, or had it been neceſſary to
have been done thouſands of years
hence, nothing could have forc'd God
to have anticipated the ſetled periods of
time one moment; for all his actions are
managed by fix'd and eternal reaſons,
and what he has once determined, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be fruſtrated by any change or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And thus we ſee how eaſily,
and yet how ſatisfactorily, the <hi>primitive
Chriſtians</hi> wip'd off that double imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Chriſtianity provides for the trueſt and

The efficacy of Chriſtianity in prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon men of the acuteſt parts and
greateſt learning. The Chriſtians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
for being poor and mean. This
charge (univerſally) falſe. Chriſtianity
entertain'd by perſons of all ſorts, of
the higheſt as well as the loweſt rank.
Several inſtances of ſuch: <hi>Fl. Clemens</hi>
and <hi>Fl. Domitilla (Domitian's</hi> near

Domitian's</hi> Neece, <hi>Acil. Glabrio</hi>
the Conſul, <hi>Apollonius</hi> the Senator, and
others. <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperour proved to
be no Chriſtian: the riſe of the ſtory
whence. Though Chriſtianity had had
no ſuch perſons under its profeſſion, this
had been no juſt reaſonable prejudice.
External pomp and grandeur not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to Religion. The advantages Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
reaped from their meanneſs and
contempt of the world. Of their being
charged as a people uſeleſs and unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the publick. This diſowned.
The opinion that it was not lawful for
Chriſtians to bear Arms, or Offices, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
only to ſome perſons and in ſome
caſes, and why. How much the world
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46588:37"/>
was beholden to Chriſtians, for reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men from vice and wickedneſs. The
Goſpel greatly inſtrumental that way;
its general influence upon thoſe whom it
did not convert: the Writings of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
generally better after Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appeared, and why. The excellent
Prayer of <hi>Simplicius.</hi> Chriſtians very
uſeful by frequent working beneficial
miracles, curing diſeaſes, raiſing the
dead, diſpoſſeſſing Devils, &amp;c. This
miraculous power continued for ſeveral
Ages in the Church. Chriſtians further
traduced as pernicious to the world, as
the cauſe of all publick evils and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
This objected at every turn.
The occaſion of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s and <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>

Charge justly retorted upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and they ſent to ſeek the cauſe of
publick calamities nearer home. Some

unjuſtly charged with it, becauſe the
world was peſtered with ſuch evils before
Chriſtianity appeared in it. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

the youth who are prone to

vice and luxury, we reſtrain, by telling

a thing it is to indulge their luſt, but
into how much danger they precipitate
their ſouls, and what puniſhments the
divine vengeance lays up for ſuch profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate

an account only of ſome few. Not to

                  </gap>)
and for that they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
the Rites and Religion of the

Glabrio,</hi> who, together with <hi>Trajan</hi>
had been <hi>Conſul</hi> the year before. That
the perſons here deſcrib'd were <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
is plain, partly from the Charge of
<hi>Atheiſm</hi> here faſtned upon them (the
common and familiar accuſation, and
the title given to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by the
Heathens, as we obſerv'd before)
and partly becauſe they are ſaid to have
paſſed over to the Rites and Cuſtoms of
the <hi>Jews;</hi> nothing being more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Hiſtorians of thoſe times, than
to miſtake <hi>Christians</hi> for <hi>Jews,</hi> and to

                  <note place="margin">De Script.</note> as S. <hi>Hierom</hi>

to have been a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the
firſt of the <hi>Emperours</hi> that was ſo; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
herein by a whole troop both of
ancient and modern Writers. Nay we
are told by ſome a formal ſtory, that
this <hi>Philip</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> were converted
by the preaching of <hi>Pontius</hi> the Martyr,<note place="margin">Act. Pont. apud. Sur. ad 14.</note>
and baptized by <hi>Fabiam</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Maii. tom. 3.</note>
But notwithſtanding the ſmoothneſs of
the ſtory, and the number of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
I muſt confeſs it ſeems to me ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable, that a perſon of ſo bad a
life, guilty of ſuch enormous villanies, as
that <hi>Emperour</hi> was, ſhould either be, or
be thought a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> or if he was, that
the whole world ſhould not preſently ring
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46588:44"/>
of it. Certain I am, that all Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of that time are wholly ſilent in the
caſe, nor is there the leaſt intimation
of any ſuch thing in any Writer, either
<hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi> before <hi>Euſebius.</hi> Nay
<hi>Origen</hi> who wrote his Book in defence
of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> under the Reign of this
very <hi>Emperour,</hi> and about this very time
(nay and two Epiſtles, one to <hi>Philip,</hi>
the other to his Wife <hi>Severa,</hi> if we may

all other men would quickly be brought

which ſeems to have given both birth

                  <note place="margin">Martyr.</note> was a long time <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Eugen. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Sur. ad 25. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb. tom. 6.</note> he by the means of his
Daughter <hi>Eugenia</hi> was converted to
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> under whoſe ſhelter the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> there enjoyed great peace and
favour (nay the ſtory adds, though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
without any ground, that he was
created Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria)</hi> till the
Emperour being acquainted with his
being a Chriſtian, preſently remov'd
him, and by the help of his Succeſſor
<hi>Terentius</hi> caus'd him to be ſecretly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and made away. This (if any
thing) was the riſe of the ſtory; and
that which makes it more probable, is,
the honour and excellency of that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
the greateſt of all the Offices
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46588:45"/>
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the command and
ſtate little leſs than <hi>regal;</hi> and therefore
the Emperours in their Letter to this
<hi>Philip</hi> (wherein they reproach him for
<hi>ingratitude</hi> and <hi>apoſtaſie)</hi> tell him that in
a manner he was made a <hi>King,</hi> when he
was choſen <hi>Preſident</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
the title of the Governour of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
(as appears from the <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> but
eſpecially the <hi>Notitia Imperii)</hi> was <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus
Auguſtalis;</hi> and how eaſie was it
to miſtake <hi>Philippus Auguſtus</hi> for <hi>Philippus

falſeneſs of that charge, that the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were ſuch a <hi>ſorry inconſiderable</hi> people.</p>
               <p>But however, let us ſuppoſe them to
have been as <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and cruelty of their adverſaries did
endeavour to make them, yet this was
no real prejudice to their cauſe, nor
any great hurt to them. That the moſt
part of us are accuſed to be <hi>poor (ſays
Octavius in anſwer to Caecilius his charge)</hi>
'tis not our <hi>diſhonour,</hi> but our <hi>glory;</hi>
the mind as 'tis diſſolv'd by plenty and

another mans, who is rich in and towards
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46588:46"/>

the truth is, no man can be ſo poor, as
he was when he was <hi>born;</hi> the <hi>Birds</hi> live
without any patrimony entail'd upon

<hi>happier</hi> does he go to Heaven, who is
not <hi>burdened</hi> by the way with an <hi>unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>
load of riches: and yet did we
think <hi>eſtates</hi> ſo uſeful to us, we could
beg them of God, who being <hi>Lord</hi> of
all, might well afford a little to us; but
we had rather <hi>deſpiſe</hi> them than <hi>enjoy</hi>
them, and rather chuſe innocency and

they ſhunn'd it not, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:46588:48"/>
of the firſt Ages of the <hi>Church:</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

never boggling at any thing which

hitherto the price of thoſe dangers that
we have run upon; we have fought for
fidelity, which how ſhall we be able to
keep to <hi>you,</hi> if we do not firſt keep it to

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46588:48"/>
the ſervice of their Prince. Nay thoſe
of them who were ſo bound up by their
private ſentiments, as not to think it
lawful, yet reckoned they otherways
made <hi>equivalent</hi> compenſation: thus
when <hi>Celſus</hi> preſs'd the Chriſtians to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo

Emperours in their Wars;<note place="margin">Adv. Celſ. l. 8. p. 426, 427.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
that they did ſo, though by a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>

there were ſeveral other inſtances which
the Chriſtians pleaded to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
from being <hi>unſerviceable</hi> to the
good of mankind, amongſt which I ſhall
at preſent take notice only of theſe
two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they really ſought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
men from <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> to a good
and a virtuous life; by which means
(beſides that they provided for mens
higheſt and neareſt <hi>intereſt,</hi> the intereſt
of their ſouls, and their eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in another life) they greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
the peace and welfare of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they lived; for vicious and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46588:49"/>
wicked men are the <hi>peſts</hi> and <hi>plagues</hi> of
humane ſociety, that taint and infect
others by their bad examples or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and entail vengeance upon the
places of their reſidence; whilſt good
men engage the favour and bleſſing of
heaven, and both by their counſels and
examples bring over others to ſobriety
and virtue, whereby they eſtabliſh and
ſtrengthen the foundations of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the happineſs of civil life,
and none ſo eminent for this as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
of old; this is the great <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi>
argument wherewith <hi>Origen</hi> at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
turn exalts the honour of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Adv. Celſ. lib. 1. p. 9.</note>
this <hi>(ſays he)</hi> we find in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of thoſe that believe, who are
delivered from that ſink of vices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
before they were wont to wallow:
enquire into the lives of ſome of us,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 21.</note>
compare our former and our preſent
courſe, and you'll find in what filthineſs
and impieties they tumbled, before they
entertained the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine;</hi> but
ſince the time that they entred into it,
how gentle and moderate, how grave
and conſtant are they become,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 53.</note> and ſome
ſo inflam'd with the love of purity, that
they forbear even what lawfully they
might enjoy; how largely are the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46588:49"/>
Churches of God, founded by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
ſpread over all Nations, conſiſting of
ſuch as are converted from innumerable
evil ways to a better mind: And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
vindicating the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
from the miſchievous cavils of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. p. 78</note>
he tells us how 'twas impoſſible
that could be peſtilent and hurtful, which
had converted ſo many from their vices
and debaucheries, to a courſe moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to Nature and Reaſon, and to
a life of temperance and all other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
and the ſame he urges frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in other places, and what greater
kindneſs and benefit could be done to
men?<note place="margin">Lib. 8. p. 427.</note> Does <hi>Celſus</hi> call upon us <hi>(ſays he)</hi>
to bear Offices for the good of our
Country; let him know that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is much more beholden to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
than to the reſt of men, while they
teach men piety towards God, the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar
Guardian of the Country, and
ſhew them the way to that heavenly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is above, which they that live
well may attain to, though here they
dwell in the ſmalleſt City in the world.
Nor do the Chriſtians thus employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 428.</note>
becauſe they ſhun the publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the civil life; but only reſerve
themſelves for the more divine and n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46588:50"/>
ſervices of the Church, in order
to the good and happineſs of men; for
this they think very juſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that they ſhould take care of all
men, of them of their own party, that
they may every day make them better;
of others, that they may draw them to
the belief and practice of piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
that ſo worſhipping God in truth,
and doing what they can to inſtruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
they may be united to the great
God, and to his bleſſed Son, who is
the wiſdom, truth, and righteouſneſs, and
by whom it is that every one is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a pious and religious life.</p>

who by the Laws given them by <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rada</hi>
lived in inceſtuous mixtures with
their own <hi>Mothers, Sisters,</hi> and <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
looking upon it as a lawful and
warrantable practice; till entertaining
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they threw off thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Laws, and ſubmitted to that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46588:50"/>
temperance and chaſtity which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
requires of us. And whereas before
they were wont to caſt out the bodies
of their dead, to be devoured by Beaſts
and Birds of prey, ſince they embraced
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, they abſtained
from that piece of inhumanity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
committed them to the earth;
from which they could not be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either by the Laws of their Country,
or the bitterneſs of thoſe torments which
they underwent. The <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> who
thought it the moſt miſerable thing in
the world to <hi>dye</hi> any other than a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
death, and therefore made a Law
that all perſons arrived to old age ſhould
be offered in Sacrifice and eaten, no
ſooner ſubmitted to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
thoſe barbarous and abominable
Cuſtoms. The <hi>Tibarens,</hi> who uſed to
throw aged perſons down the ſteepeſt
Rocks, left it off upon their embracing
of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Upon the ſame account
the <hi>Hyrcani</hi> and the <hi>Caſpians</hi> reformed
their manners, who were formerly wont
to keep Dogs on purpoſe to devour the
bodies of the dead. Nor did the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
any longer together with their
dead bury thoſe alive who had been
their neareſt friends and kindred. So
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46588:51"/>
great a change <hi>(ſays my Author)</hi> did the
Laws of <hi>Chriſt</hi> make in the manners of
men, and ſo eaſily were the moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations perſwaded to entertain
them, a thing which <hi>Plato,</hi> though the
beſt of all Philoſophers, could never ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
amongſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> his own Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Citizens, who could never induce
them to govern the Common-wealth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thoſe Laws and Inſtitutions
which he had preſcribed them.</p>
               <p>Nay where the Goſpel did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this effect to reclaim men from their
vices and vanities, and to bring them
over to the Religion of the crucified <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;</hi>
yet had it this excellent <hi>influence</hi>
upon the world, that it generally taught
them better leſſons, refin'd their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
and filled their minds with
more uſeful and practical notions about
Religion than they had before. To
which purpoſe it's mainly obſervable,
that thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> who lived in the
time of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> after the Goſpel
publickly appeared in the world, wrote
in a much more <hi>divine ſtrain,</hi> entertained
more honourable and worthy ſentiments
about God and Religion, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of men in their ſeveral capacities,
than thoſe of their Sect that went before
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46588:51"/>
them. Of which I conceive no account
can be given ſo ſatisfactory as this, that
the <hi>genius</hi> and ſpirit of the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
then to fly abroad, and to breathe
in a freer air, and ſo could not but leave

in this caſe.<note place="margin">Arnob. ut ſupra p. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well to ſeek the <hi>true cauſes</hi> of theſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46588:56"/>
things nearer home, and to enquire
whether 'twas not for their own ſakes,
that the Divine Providence was thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with them; there being very
juſt reaſons to think ſo. <hi>Tertullian</hi> points
them to ſuch cauſes as theſe.<note place="margin">Ap. c. 40. p. 33.</note> Firſt, their
horrible <hi>affronting</hi> their <hi>natural notions</hi>
of God, that <hi>when they knew God, they
glorified him not as God, neither were
thankful, but became vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21, 22, 23.</note>
                  <hi>and their fooliſh heart was
darkned, and they changed the glory of
the uncorruptible God into an Image made
like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
four footed beaſts, and creeping things, as</hi>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> had told them long before: and
that therefore 'twas reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">Ap. c. 41. vid. Arnob. l. 1. p. 6, 7.</note>
that God was more angry with
them, who inſtead of him worſhipped
pieces of <hi>wood</hi> and <hi>Statues,</hi> or at beſt
Genii and Devils, than with thoſe who
ſincerely paid their adorations to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Secondly, Paſſing by God the
great Maſter of all goodneſs and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and the ſevere revenger of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
they tumbled themſelves in all
manner of vice and wickedneſs; and
what wonder if the Divine Juſtice fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
cloſe at their heels.<note place="margin">

as if in living <hi>ill</hi> you deſerved <hi>well,</hi> and
as if all that has happened to you were
not <hi>leſs</hi> and <hi>lighter</hi> than your ſins: and

the retirements of thy conſcience,
and behold thy ſelf now, who ſhalt one
day be ſeen naked by all; and thou wilt
find thy ſelf enſlav'd and led captive by
ſome ſins or other; and why then
ſhouldſt thou wonder that the flames of
the divine anger ſhould riſe higher,
when the ſins of men do daily admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
more fuel to it: an anſwer which
he there proſecutes to very excellent
purpoſe. Thirdly, Their prodigious
unthankfulneſs to God for all the former
bleſſings they had received from him:
ſo far as they were <hi>ingrateful,</hi> they were
highly <hi>guilty,</hi> and God could not but
puniſh them; had they ſought him,
whom in part they could not but know,
and been obſervant of him, they would
in this caſe have found him a much more
propitious, than an angry Deity, as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> tells them. Upon theſe and
ſuch like accounts, they might well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it was, that the vengeance of God
did preſs ſo hard upon them, and that
therefore they had no true reaſon to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46588:57"/>
lay the fault at any other door but their
own.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to the thing it ſelf, as
'twas charged upon them, they point
blank denied it to be true, and that for
two reaſons eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the world had been
ſadly and frequently <hi>peſtered</hi> with ſuch
<hi>evils</hi> and <hi>miſeries</hi> long before the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

where were the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the great

were <hi>your gods</hi> themſelves, when the

had not yet received the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation

of which the Country ſmells to

by the <hi>Buſhel:</hi> they were all your
gods that then had the general worſhip,
when the <hi>Gauls</hi> took the <hi>Capitol</hi> it ſelf.
So ſmartly does that <hi>grave</hi> man retort
their own arguments upon themſelves.
<hi>Arnobius</hi> fully and elegantly purſues
this,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. p. 2, 3.</note> that <hi>in this reſpect the former times
were no better than theſe,</hi> which they ſo
much complained of, and bids them run
over the <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> that were
written in all languages, and they would
find that all Nations had frequently had

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe ſince the coming of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46588:58"/>
                  <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the world had been in a

by how much there were fewer Wars,

you were forward to every good work,
adorned with a moſt virtuous and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
converſation, doing all things in
the fear of God, and having his Laws

then not in <hi>talking finely,</hi> but in <hi>living

This one would think ſtrange, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

                  <note place="margin">Ad Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian. pag. 200.</note> So <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I remember, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces

this being the firſt and great cauſe of all

quarrel was about this title, and when
a Chriſtian was guilty of nothing elſe,
'twas this made him guilty, as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
complains at every turn. The truth is,
they mightily gloried in this <hi>title,</hi> and
were ambitious to own it in the face of
the greateſt danger;<note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt.</note> therefore when <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi>

another of them being oft asked by the
<hi>Preſident,</hi> what his <hi>name</hi> was, what his
<hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and whether he was a
Free-man or a Servant, anſwered nothing
more to any of them, than that he was
a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> profeſſing this name to be
Country, Kindred, and all things to him.
Nay ſo great was the honour and value
which they had for this name, that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the Emperour (whom we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

all ways to ſuppreſs it, that when he
could not drive the thing, he might at

and therefore did not only himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
call Chriſtians <hi>Galilaeans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Naz in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vect. in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. 1. p. 81.</note> but
made a <hi>Law,</hi> that they ſhould be called
only by that name. But to return, the
ſum is this, the Chriſtians were ſo buoy'd
up with the conſcience of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
that they cared not who ſaw
them, were willing and deſirous to be
ſcann'd and ſearched to the bottom, and
to lye open to the view of all; and
therefore deſired no other favour, than
that that <hi>Apologie</hi> which <hi>Justin Martyr</hi>
preſented to them,<note place="margin">Ap. 1. p. 51.</note> might be ſet out with
the Decree of the <hi>Senate,</hi> that ſo peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>Thirdly, They appealed for their vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication

againſt thoſe vices of which themſelves
were moſt guilty: that we Chriſtians
do not meaſure wiſdom by mens habits,

not ſpeak great things, but live them,
having this to boaſt of, that we really
attain to thoſe things which they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly

               <argument>
                  <p>The Religion of the ancient Chriſtians
conſidered, with reſpect to God, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and other men. Their piety ſeen
in two things, their deteſtation of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and great care about the matters
of divine Worſhip. What notion they
had of Idolatry; their abhorrency of it.
Their refuſing to give divine honour to
Angels and created Spirits; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Laodicean Council.
Their denying any thing of divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Martyrs and departed Saints.

teſtimonies to this purpoſe.
Their mighty abhorrence of the Heathen
Idolatry. The very making an Idol
accounted unlawful. Hatred of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
one of the firſt principles inſtilled
into new Converts. Their affectionate
bewailing any that lapſed into this ſin.
Several ſevere penalties impoſed by the
ancient Council of <hi>Illiberis</hi> upon perſons
guilty of Idolatry. They were willing to
hazard any thing rather than ſacrifice
to the Gods. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his plot to
try the integrity of his Courtiers. A
double inſtance of the Christian Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in <hi>Julian</hi>'s Army. Their active zeal
in breaking the Images of the Heathen
gods, and aſſaulting perſons while do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſacrifice to them; this whether ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable.
Notwithſtanding all this, the
Chriſtians accuſed by the Heathens of
Idolatry; of worſhipping the Sun:
whence that charge aroſe. Of adoring a
Croſs. Of worſhipping an Aſſes head.
Chriſtians called <hi>Aſinarii.</hi> The abſurd

HAving thus ſeen with how much
clearneſs the ancient Chriſtians
vindicated themſelves from thoſe unjuſt
aſperſions, which their ſpightful and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
adverſaries had caſt upon them;
we come now to take a more direct and

thoſe <hi>virtues</hi> which more immediately

                  <hi>the principal

Age, and the almoſt ſole cauſe of mens
being brought into judgment,</hi> as what in
a manner contains all ſins under it, as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> begins his Book upon that
ſubject; a crime of the <hi>firſt rank,</hi> and
one of the <hi>higheſt ſorts of wickedneſs,</hi> as

                  <note place="margin">Conc. Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berit. Can. 1.</note> They looked upon it as a ſin
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46588:70"/>
that undermined the very being of the
Deity, and raviſhed the honour of his
Crown. Before we proceed any further,
we ſhall firſt enquire what was the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they generally had of Idolatry;
and they then accounted that a man was
guilty of Idolatry, when he gave <hi>divine
adoration</hi> to any thing that was <hi>not God,</hi>
not only when he worſhipped a <hi>material
Idol,</hi> but when he veſted <hi>any creature</hi>
with that religious reſpect and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was <hi>only</hi> due to God: Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<hi>(ſays Tertullian)</hi> robs God,<note place="margin">

at the ſame time it does both <hi>defraud</hi>

he expreſly affirms, that whatever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted

in imitation of the divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
is directly made an Idol: thus
S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> for his ſolid and excellent

<hi>John</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle)</hi> defines Idolatry (which,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz: Orat. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neg. in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivit. Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be <hi>the tranſlation of that worſhip that
is due to the Creator upon the Creature.</hi>
Accordingly we find them infinitely
zealous to aſſert divine adoration, as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46588:71"/>
the proper and incommunicable prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of God alone, and abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing

him, anſwered, <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip
the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou
ſerve;</hi> which is the reaſon why we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to give honours to thoſe ſpirits that
<hi>preſide</hi> over humane affairs, becauſe <hi>we
cannot ſerve two Maſters,</hi> to wit, <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Mammon:</hi> as for theſe <hi>Daemons,</hi> we
know that they have no adminiſtration
of the conveniencies of mans life: yea,
though we know that they are not <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
but <hi>Angels,</hi> that have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fruits and ſeaſons, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of Animals committed to them;
we indeed ſpeak <hi>well</hi> of them, and think
them <hi>happy,</hi> that they are intruſted by
God to manage the conveniencies of
mans life; but yet do not give them that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46588:71"/>
honour that is only due to God; for
this neither does God allow of, neither
do they deſire it; but equally love and
regard us when we do not, as if we did
ſacrifice to them. And when <hi>Celſus</hi> a
little before had ſmartly preſſed him to
do honour to <hi>Daemons,</hi> he rejects the
motion with great contempt,<note place="margin">Pag. 395.</note> away <hi>(ſays
he)</hi> with this counſel of <hi>Celſus,</hi> who in
this is not in the leaſt to be hearkned
to; for the great God only is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored,
and prayers to be delivered up
to none but his only begotten Son, <hi>the
firſt born of every creature,</hi> that as <hi>our
High-Prieſt</hi> he may carry them to <hi>his
Father</hi> and to <hi>our Father, to his God</hi> and
<hi>to our God.</hi> 'Tis true that the Worſhip
of <hi>Angels</hi> did (and that very early, as
appears from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> caveat againſt
it in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians)</hi> creep
into ſome parts of the Chriſtian Church,
but was always diſowned and cryed out
againſt, and at laſt publickly and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned by the whole <hi>Laodicean
Council: it is not lawful (ſays the thirty
fifth Canon of that Council) for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to leave the Church of God, and to
go and invocate Angels, and to make
prohibited aſſemblies: if therefore any
one ſhall be found devoting himſelf to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46588:72"/>
this private Idolatry, let him be accurſed;
foraſmuch as he has forſaken the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, and has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up himſelf to Idolatry.</hi> From which
nothing can be more clear, than that it was
the ſenſe of theſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> that the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of Angels</hi> was not only down-right
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> but a plain <hi>apoſtaſie</hi> from
the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>Nor were they more peremptory in
denying divine honour to <hi>Angels,</hi> than
they were to <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>departed
Saints:</hi> for though they had a mighty
honour and reſpect for <hi>Martyrs</hi> (as we
ſhall take notice afterwards) as thoſe
that had maintained the truth of their
Religion, and ſeal'd it with their blood,
and therefore did what they could to
do praiſe and honour to their memories,
yet were they far from placing any thing
of Religion or divine adoration in it;
whereof 'twill be enough to quote one
famous inſtance. The Church of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Euſeb Hiſt.</note> to

                  </note> tells them,
that after he was dead, many of the
Chriſtians were deſirous to have gotten
the <hi>remains</hi> of his body (poſſibly to have
given them decent and honourable bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46588:72"/>
but were prevented in it by ſome
<hi>Jews,</hi> who importun'd the <hi>Proconſul</hi> to
the contrary, ſuggeſting that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
leaving their <hi>crucified</hi> Maſter,
might henceforth worſhip <hi>Polycarpus,</hi>
whereupon they add, that this ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
muſt needs proceed from ignorance
of the true ſtate of Chriſtians; <hi>this they
did</hi> (ſay they) <hi>not conſidering how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
'tis that ever we ſhould either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
Chriſt, who died for the ſalvation
of mankind, or that we ſhould worſhip
any other. We adore him as the Son of
God; but the Martyrs, as the Diſciples
and Followes of our Lord, we deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
love for their eminent kindneſs to
their own Prince and Maſter; whoſe
Companions and Fellow-Diſciples we
alſo by all means deſire to be.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is ſo much the more valuable in
this caſe, not only becauſe ſo <hi>plain</hi> and
<hi>pertinent</hi> but becauſe ſo <hi>ancient,</hi> and
from perſons of ſo great <hi>authority</hi> in the
Church: For this is not the teſtimony
of any one private perſon, but of the
<hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> according as it
had been trained up under the Doctrine
and Diſcipline of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Diſciple of S. <hi>John.</hi> This was
the Doctrine and practice of Chriſtians

then, and it held ſo for ſome Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
even down to the times of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>

becauſe they are <hi>not God,</hi> but the ſame

honour their <hi>memories,</hi> as of holy men,
who have ſtood for the truth, even unto
death, that ſo the true Religion might
appear, and thoſe which are falſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
to be ſo: but who ever heard a
<hi>Prieſt</hi> ſtanding at the <hi>Altar,</hi> built for the

<hi>Prayers, I offer ſacrifice to thee Peter, or
Paul, or Cyprian;</hi> for in ſuch commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
we offer to that God, who made
them both men and Martyrs, and has
made them partners with holy Angels
in the heavenly glory; and by theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
we both give thanks to the
true God for the victories which they
have gain'd, and alſo ſtir up our ſelves
by begging his aſſiſtance, to contend
for ſuch crowns and rewards as they are
poſſeſſed of; ſo that whatever offices
religious men perform in the <hi>places</hi> of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46588:73"/>
the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they are only <hi>ornaments</hi> to
their memories, not <hi>ſacrifices</hi> or divine
ſervices done to the departed, as if they
were Deities. More to the ſame purpoſe
we may find in that place, as alſo in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
other places of his Works, where
(were it worth the while) I could eaſily
ſhew that he does no leſs frequently than
expreſly aſſert, that though the <hi>honour</hi> of
<hi>love, reſpect,</hi> and <hi>imitation,</hi> yet no <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
adoration</hi> is due either to <hi>Angels, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
or <hi>departed Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the great inſtance, wherein the
primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> manifeſted their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
of Idolatry was in reſpect of
the <hi>idolatrous Worſhip</hi> of the Heathen
world, the denying and abhorring any
thing of divine honour that was done
to their gods. They looked upon the
very <hi>making</hi> of Idols (though with no

ſuch a one no not at the hour of
<hi>death</hi> was to be received into the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>

which ſeverity was, becauſe who ever
underwent that Office muſt do <hi>ſacrifice</hi>
to the gods, and entertain the people

Every Maſter of a Family was

underwent baniſhment and confiſcation,

he placed the Pictures of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>

politickly reducing them to this ſtrait,
that either they muſt refuſe to pay ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

and fall into the arms of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
than by ſuch an ambiguous ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to ſeem to patronize Idolatry. At
another time he fell upon this ſtratagem:
upon a ſolemn day, when the Emperours
were wont to beſtow <hi>Largeſſes</hi> upon the
<hi>Souldiers,</hi> he cauſed the Army to be
called before him, ſitting then in great
pomp and ſplendour, and a large <hi>dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
of Gold to be laid on the one ſide,
and a heap of <hi>Frankincenſe</hi> with fire by
it on the other, proclamation being
made, that they that would ſacrifice the
<hi>one,</hi> ſhould have the <hi>other.</hi> By this means
many of the Chriſtian Souldiers were
enſnared, performed the Sacrifice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Donative, and went home
jolly and ſecure. But being at Dinner
with their Companions, and drinking
to each other (as the cuſtom was) with
their eyes lift up, and calling upon
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and making the <hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi>
as oft as they took the Cup into their
hands; one at the Table told them, he
wondred how they could call upon
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they had ſo lately ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd.
Amazed at this, and asking how
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46588:78"/>
they had abjured him, they were told,
that they had <hi>ſacrificed,</hi> which was all
one as to <hi>deny Chriſt.</hi> Whereupon ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up from the Table, they ran up and
down the Market-place in a furious and
frantick manner, crying out, <hi>we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
we are Chriſtians in heart and
truth;</hi> and let all the world take notice,
that there is but <hi>one</hi> God, to whom we
<hi>live,</hi> and for whom we'll <hi>dye;</hi> we have
not broken the faith which we ſwore to
thee, <hi>O bleſſed Saviour,</hi> nor renounced
our profeſſion; if our <hi>hands</hi> be guilty,
our <hi>hearts</hi> are innocent, 'tis not the <hi>Gold</hi>
that has corrupted us, but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<hi>craftineſs</hi> that deceived us: and
with that running to the Emperour, they
threw down their <hi>Gold</hi> before him, with
this addreſs, we have not, <hi>Sir,</hi> received
a donative, but are condemned to dye;
inſtead of being <hi>honoured</hi> we are <hi>vilified</hi>
and diſgraced; take this Largeſs and
give it to your Souldiers; as for us,
kill us and ſacrifice us to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom
alone we owne as our higheſt Prince; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
us <hi>fire</hi> for <hi>fire,</hi> and for the <hi>aſhes</hi> of
the ſacrifice, reduce us to <hi>aſhes.</hi> Cut off
thoſe <hi>hands,</hi> which we ſo wickedly
ſtretched out; thoſe <hi>feet</hi> that carried us
to ſo great a miſchief; give others the

                  <hi>Gold,</hi> who may have no cauſe to repent
on't; for our part <hi>Chriſt</hi> is enough for
us, whom we value inſtead of all things.
With this noble and generous reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
though the Emperour was highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
yet becauſe he envied them the
honour of <hi>martyrdom,</hi> he would not
put them to death, but baniſhed them,
and inflicted other penalties which might
ſufficiently evidence his rage againſt
them.</p>
               <p>Nay with ſo warm a zeal were they
acted againſt Idolatry, that many of
them could not contain themſelves from
falling foul upon it, where-ever they
met it, though with the immediate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their lives.<note place="margin">Euſeb. de mart. Pal. c. 2. p. 320.</note> So <hi>Romanus</hi> Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con

that the <hi>Jews</hi> when wandring in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,

The piety of Chriſtians in founding
places for the Solemnities of Religion.
They had diſtinct and ſeparate places for
their Publick Aſſemblies, even in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
times. Prov'd out of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
as alſo in the ſucceeding Ages,
from the teſtimonies of the Fathers, and
Heathen Writers. The common objection
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46588:82"/>
of the Gentiles, that Christians had no
Temples, conſidered and anſwered.
Churches encreaſed as Chriſtianity met
with favourable entertainment: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
and repaired by <hi>Diocleſian,
Maximinus, Conſtantine.</hi> The faſhion
of theri Churches oblong; built towards
the Eaſt: The form of their Churches
deſcribed. The <hi>Veſtibulum</hi> or Porch:
the Narthex, and what in it. The Nave
or body of the Church; the Ambo or
Reading-Pew, the ſtation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

and Seats of the Presbyters. The <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conicon,</hi>
what: the <hi>Protheſis.</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
then beautified their Churches. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had Altars in them. Decent
Tables for the celebration of the divine
offices; thoſe frequently by the Fathers
ſtiled Altars, and in what ſenſe. They
had no ſuch gaudy Altars as the Heathens
had in their Temples, and the Papists
now in their Churches. Altars when
begun to be fixed and made of Stone.
Made <hi>Aſylum</hi>'s and places of refuge,
and inveſted with many priviledges by
Chriſtian Emperours. No Images in their
Churches for above four hundred years,
prov'd out of the Fathers. Pictures in

Churches condemned by the Council of
<hi>Illiberis.</hi> An account of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
his tearing the Picture of Christ in the

Chriſtian Churches when
firſt formally conſecrated: the Encoenia
of the ancient Church. Our Wakes or
Feaſts in memory of the dedication of
particular Churches. What Incomes or
Revenues they had in the firſt Ages. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches had ſome ſtanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
even under the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
Theſe much increaſed by the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Princes, their Laws noted to that
purpoſe. The reverence ſhewed at their
going int Churches, and during their

               </argument>
               <p>THE Primitive Chriſtians were not
more heartily zealous againſt the
idolatrous Worſhip of the Heathen-gods,
than they were religiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of whatever concerned the honour
and Worſhip of the true, as to all the
material parts and circumſtances of it;
as will eaſily appear, if we conſider what
care they had about the <hi>place, time,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46588:83"/>
perſons,</hi> and both the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi>
of that Worſhip that they performed to
God, under each of which we ſhall take
notice of what is moſt conſiderable, and
does moſt properly relate to it, ſo far as
the Records of thoſe times give us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it.</p>
               <p>Place is an inſeparable circumſtance
of Religious Worſhip; for every body
by the natural neceſſity of its being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
ſome determinate place either for
reſt or motion: now the Worſhip of
God being in a great part an external
action, eſpecially when performed by
the joint concurrence of ſeveral perſons,
does not only neceſſarily require a <hi>place,</hi>
but a place <hi>conveniently capacious</hi> of all
that join together in the ſame publick
actions of Religion. This reaſon put all
Nations even by the light of Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
erecting <hi>publick places</hi> for the honour
of their gods, and for their own conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
in meeting together to pay their
religious ſervices and devotions. But
my preſent enquiry reaches no farther
than the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they met together for the diſcharge
of their common duties; (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
none can doubt of) but whether
they had <hi>Churches,</hi> fixed and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46588:84"/>
places for the joint performance of
their publick offices. And that they had
even in thoſe early times, will I think
be beyond all diſpute, if we take but
a ſhort ſurvey of thoſe firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity:
in the ſacred Story we find
ſome more than probable footſteps of
ſome determinate places for their ſolemn
conventions, and peculiar only to that
uſe. Of this nature was that <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Room</hi> into which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and

a place commonly known and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to that uſe, there by faſting and
prayer to make choice of a new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;
and this ſuppoſed by a very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
tradition to have been the <hi>ſame room</hi>
wherein our Saviour the night before his
death celebrated the Paſſover with his
Diſciples, and inſtituted the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
Such a one, if not (which I rather
think) the ſame,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 1.</note> was that <hi>one place,</hi>
wherein they were all aſſembled with
one accord upon the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi>
when the Holy Ghoſt viſibly came down
upon them; and this the rather becauſe
the multitude (and they too <hi>ſtrangers of
every Nation under heaven)</hi> came ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to the place upon the firſt rumour
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46588:84"/>
of ſo ſtrange an accident, which could
hardly have been, had it not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known to be the place where the
Chriſtians uſed to meet together: and
this very learned men take to be the
meaning of that <hi>Act. 2. 46. they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
daily with one accord in the Temple,
and breaking bread</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not as we
render it, <hi>from houſe to houſe, but at
home,</hi> as 'tis in the <hi>margin,</hi> or <hi>in the
houſe, they ate their meat with gladneſs
and ſingleneſs of heart, i.e.</hi> when they had
performed their daily devotions at the
<hi>Temple</hi> at the accuſtomed hours of
prayer, they uſed to return home to this
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Room,</hi> there to celebrate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and then go to their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
meals: this ſeems to be a clear and
unforc'd interpretation; and to me the
more probable, becauſe it immediately
follows upon their aſſembling together
in that one place at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi>
which Room is alſo called by the ſame
name of <hi>houſe,</hi> at the <hi>ſecond Verſe</hi> of that
<hi>Chapter;</hi> and 'tis no ways unlikely (as
M. <hi>Mede</hi> conjectures) but that when the
firſt Believers <hi>ſold their Houſes and Lands,
and laid the money at the Apoſtles feet</hi> to
ſupply the neceſſities of the Church, ſome
of them might give their houſes (at leaſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46588:85"/>
ſome eminent Room in them) for the
Church to meet, and perform their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
duties: which alſo may be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the Apoſtles writing to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Chriſtians, ſpeaks ſo often of <hi>the
Church that was in their houſe;</hi> which
ſeems clearly to intimate not ſo much the
particular perſons of any private Family
living together under the ſame band of
Chriſtian diſcipline, as that in ſuch or
ſuch a houſe (and more eſpecially in this
or that room of it) there was the conſtant
and ſolemn convention of the Chriſtians
of that place, for their joynt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of divine Worſhip. And this will
be farther cleared by that famous paſſage
of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where taxing the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
for their irreverence and abuſe of
the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> one greedily eating
before another, and ſome of them to
great exceſs,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>What</hi> (ſays he) <hi>have you not
houſes to eat and to drink in, or deſpiſe ye
the Church of God.</hi> Where that by <hi>Church</hi>
is not meant the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> meeting, but
the <hi>place</hi> in which they uſed to aſſemble,
is evident partly from what went before,
for <hi>their coming together in the Church,
verſe</hi> 18. is expounded <hi>by their coming
together into one place, verſe</hi> 20. plainly
arguing that the Apoſtle meant not the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46588:85"/>
perſons but the place; partly from the
oppoſition which he makes between the
Church and their own private houſes;
if they muſt have ſuch irregular Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
they had houſes of their own,
where 'twas much fitter to do it, and to
have their ordinary repaſt, than in that
<hi>place</hi> which was ſet apart for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
exerciſes of Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to be diſhonoured by
ſuch extravagant and intemperate feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
for which cauſe he enjoins them
in the <hi>cloſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> that <hi>if any
man hunger he ſhould eat at home.</hi> And that
this place was always thus underſtood
by the Fathers of old, were no hard
matter to make out, as alſo by moſt
learned men of later times, of which it
ſhall ſuffice to intimate two of our own,<note place="margin">Nic. Full. miſcell. S. l. 2. c. 9.</note>

from the teſtimony of the Authour of

And <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that upon <hi>Sunday</hi> all Chriſtians
whether in Town or Country, uſed to
aſſemble together in <hi>one place,</hi> which
could hardly be done, had not that place
been fixed and ſetled:<note place="margin">De idolola. c. 7. p. 88.</note> the ſame we find

About this time in the Reign of

the Heathen Hiſtorian tells us, that

abſtained from the word <hi>Temple,</hi> and
I do not remember that 'tis uſed by any

of the firſt three hundred years: and
yet thoſe very Writers who deny Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians

thoſe that ſtood or walked there. Here
ſtood the loweſt order of <hi>Penitents,</hi> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the prayers of the faithful as they

conſiſted of three parts; the firſt
was the <hi>Narthex</hi> (which we have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

that they had no <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Statues</hi> in

which doubtleſs gave birth to
that cuſtom of keeping <hi>anniverſary days</hi>
of commemoration of the dedication
of Churches, which from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
we frequently meet with in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
of the Church, and much prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in after Ages, ſome ſhadow whereof

ſtill remains amongſt us at this day, in

it may give us occaſion to enquire what
<hi>Revenues</hi> Churches had in thoſe firſt Ages
of Chriſtianity. 'Tis more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that for a great while they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick incomes, than either what
aroſe out of thoſe common contributions
which they made at their uſual Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
every one giving or offering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  <p>Time as neceſſary to religious actions as
Place. Fixed times of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
obſerved by all Nations. The Lords
Day chiefly obſerved by Chriſtians:
Stiled <hi>Sunday,</hi> and why. Peculiarly
conſecrated to the memory of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
All kneeling at prayer on
this day forbidden, and why. Their
publick Aſſemblies conſtantly held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this day. Forced to aſſemble before
day in times of perſecution; thence
jeered by the Heathens as <hi>Latebroſa
&amp; Lucifugax Natio.</hi> The Lords day
ever kept as a day of rejoycing; all
fasting upon it forbidden. The great
care of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Emperours, for the honour and
obſervance of this Day. Their Laws to
that purpoſe. Their conſtant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
attendance upon publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
on the Lords Day. Canons of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Councils about abſenting from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46588:100"/>
Worſhip. <hi>Sabbatum,</hi> or <hi>Saturday,</hi>
kept in the Eaſt as a religious day, with
all the publick Solemnities of Divine
Worſhip: how it came to be ſo. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the Weſtern Churches, obſerved
by them as a Faſt, and why. This not
univerſal. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his practice at
<hi>Milain,</hi> and counſel to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in
the caſe. Their ſolemn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faſts either
Weekly or Annual; Weekly on <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
and <hi>Fridays,</hi> held till three in the
Afternoon. Annual Faſt that of <hi>Lent,</hi>
how ancient. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what account called
<hi>Quadrageſima.</hi> Obſerved with great
ſtrictneſs. The <hi>Hebdomada Magna,</hi> or
the Holy Week, kept with ſingular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and the reaſon of it. Feſtivals
obſerved by the Primitive Chriſtians.
That of <hi>Eaſter</hi> as ancient as the times
of the Apoſtles. An account of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Controverſie between the eaſtern
and Weſtern Churches, about the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The intemperate ſpirit
of Pope <hi>Victor. Irenaeus</hi> his moderate
interpoſal. The caſe ſinally determined
by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Vigils of
this Feaſt obſerved with great expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of rejoycing. The bounty of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Emperours upon <hi>Eaſter-day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> The
Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> how ancient. Why
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46588:101"/>
ſtiled <hi>Whitſunday. Dominica in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
why ſo called. The whole ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> kept Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival.
The Acts of the Apoſtles why pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
read during that time. The Feaſt
of <hi>Epiphany</hi> anciently what. <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-day,</hi>
the ancient obſervation of it.
<hi>Epiphany</hi> in a ſtrict ſenſe what, and
why ſo called. The <hi>Memoriae Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
what. When probably firſt begun.
The great reverence they had for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
Their paſſions ſtiled their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and why. Theſe anniverſary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
kept at the Tombs of Martyrs.
Over theſe magnificent Churches erected
afterwards. What religious exerciſes
performed at thoſe meetings. The firſt
riſe of Martyrologies. Oblations for
Martyrs, how underſtood in the ancient
Writers of the Church. Theſe Feſtivals
kept with great rejoycing, mutual love
and charity; their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or common
Feaſts. Markets held for that purpoſe
in thoſe places. The ill uſe which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made of theſe memorials.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TIme is a circumſtance no leſs inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from religious actions
than Place, for man conſiſting of a ſoul
and body cannot always be actually
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46588:101"/>
engaged in the ſervice of God, that's the
priviledge of Angels, and ſouls freed
from the fetters of mortality; ſo long as
we are here, we muſt worſhip God with
reſpect to our preſent ſtate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of neceſſity have ſome definite
and particular time to do it in. Now
that man might not be left to a floating
uncertainty in a matter of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
in all Ages and Nations men
have been guided by the very dictates
of Nature to pitch upon ſome <hi>certain
ſeaſons,</hi> wherein to aſſemble and meet
together to perform the publick offices
of Religion. What and how many were
the publick <hi>Festivals</hi> inſtituted and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
either amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
I am not concerned to take notice of.
For the ancient Chriſtians, they ever
had their peculiar ſeaſons, their ſolemn
and ſtated times of meeting together to
perform the common duties of Divine
Worſhip; of which becauſe the <hi>Lords-Day</hi>
challenges the precedency of all
the reſt, we ſhall begin firſt with that.
And being unconcern'd in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
which in the late times were
raiſed about it; I ſhall only note ſome
inſtances of the piety of Chriſtians in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to this day, which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46588:102"/>
in paſſing through the Writers of
thoſe times. For the name of this day
of Publick Worſhip, it is ſometimes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
by <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
called <hi>Sunday,</hi> becauſe it hapned upon
that day of the week, which by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
was dedicated to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
therefore as being beſt known to them,
the Fathers commonly made uſe of it
in their Apologies to the Heathen Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
This title continued after
the world became Chriſtian, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
it is that it paſſes under any other
name in the Imperial Edicts of the firſt
Chriſtian Emperours. But the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and prevailing name was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or
<hi>Dies Dominica,</hi> the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> as 'tis
called by S. <hi>John</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 10.</note> as being that
day of the Week whereon our <hi>Lord</hi>
made his triumphant return from the
dead;<note place="margin">Ap. 2. p. 99.</note> this <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> aſſures us was
the true original of the title; upon <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
(ſays he)</hi> we all aſſemble and meet
together, as being the firſt day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God, parting the darkneſs from the
rude chaos, created the world, and the
ſame day whereon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
roſe again from the dead; for
he was crucified the day before <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
and the day after (which is <hi>Sunday)</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:46588:102"/>
he appeared to his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
by this means obſerving a <hi>kind</hi>
of analogy and proportion with the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Sabbath which had been inſtituted
by God himſelf. For as that day was
kept as a commemoration of Gods <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
or reſting from the work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo was this ſet apart to religious
uſes, as the ſolemn memorial of <hi>Chriſts</hi>
reſting from the work of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this world, compleated upon the
day of his reſurrection. Which brings
into my mind that cuſtom of theirs ſo
univerſally common in thoſe days, that
whereas at other times they <hi>kneeled</hi> at
prayers, on the Lords day they always
prayed <hi>ſtanding,</hi> as is expreſly affirmed
both by <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ap. 2. p. 98.</note>
the reaſon of which we find in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of the <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> in
<hi>J. Martyr:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Coron. c. 3. p. 102.</note> it is <hi>(ſays he)</hi> that by this
means we may be put in mind both of
our fall by ſin,<note place="margin">Reſp. ad Quest. 115. p. 468.</note> &amp; our reſurrection or reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
by the grace of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that for ſix
days we pray upon our knees, is in token of
our fall by ſin; but that on the Lords day
we do not bow the knee, does ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
repreſent our <hi>reſurrection,</hi> by which
through the grace of Chriſt we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from our ſins, and the powers of
death: this he there tells us was a cuſtom
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46588:103"/>
deriv'd from the very times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
for which he cites <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his
Book concerning <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And this cuſtom
was maintained with ſo much vigour, that
when ſome began to neglect it, the great
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> took notice of it,<note place="margin">Can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that there ſhould be a conſtant
<hi>uniformity</hi> in this caſe, and that on the
Lords day (and at ſuch other times as
were uſual) men ſhould <hi>ſtand,</hi> when they
made their prayers to God. So fit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
did they think it to do all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honour to that day, on which Chriſt
roſe from the dead. Therefore we may
obſerve all along in the ſacred ſtory, that
after Chriſts reſurrection the Apoſtles
and primitive Chriſtians did eſpecially
aſſemble upon <hi>the firſt day of the week:</hi>
and whatever they might do at other
times, yet there are many paſſages that
intimate, that the firſt day of the week
was their more ſolemn time of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
on this day it was that they were
met together, when our Saviour firſt
appeared to them, and ſo again the
next week after: on this day they were
aſſembled when the Holy Ghoſt ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
came down upon them, when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
preached that excellent Sermon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and baptized three thouſand
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46588:103"/>
ſouls. Thus when S. <hi>Paul</hi> was taking his
leave at <hi>Troas,</hi> upon the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the
week, when the Diſciples came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>break Bread, i.e.</hi> as almoſt all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
to celebrate the holy Sacrament,
he preached to them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.</note> ſufficiently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
that upon that day 'twas their
uſual cuſtom to meet in that manner;
and elſewhere giving directions to the
Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (as he had done in
the like caſe to other Churches) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their contributions to the poor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Brethren, he bids them lay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
upon the firſt day of the week, which
ſeems plainly to reſpect their religious
aſſemblies upon that day, for then it
was that every one according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
depoſited ſomething for the relief
of the poor, and the uſes of the Church.</p>
               <p>After the Apoſtles, the Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
obſerved this day, meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for prayer, expounding and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scriptures, celebration of the
Sacraments, and other publick duties of
Religion. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the day called Sunday</hi>
(ſays J. Martyr) <hi>all of us that live ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in City or Country meet together in
one place;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ap. 2. p. 98<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and what they then did,<note place="margin">Lib. 10.</note> he
there deſcribes,<note place="margin">Ep. 97.</note> of which afterwards.
This doubtleſs <hi>Pliny</hi> meant, when giving
<hi>Trajan</hi> an account of the Chriſtians, he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46588:104"/>
tells him that they were wont to meet
together to worſhip Chriſt <hi>ſtato die,</hi>
upon a ſet certain day, by which he can
be reaſonably underſtood to deſign no
other but the Lords day; for though
they probably met at other times, yet
he takes notice of this only, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Chriſtians, whom he had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
had not told him of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at other times, or becauſe this was
their moſt publick and ſolemn conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and which in a manner ſwallowed
up the reſt. By the violent perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thoſe times the Chriſtians were
forced to meet together before day, ſo
<hi>Pliny</hi> in the ſame place tells the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,<note place="margin">Ad <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor. l. 2. c. 4. p. 168.</note>
that they aſſembled <hi>before day-light,
to ſing their morning hymns to Chriſt.</hi>
Whence it is that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſo often
mentions their <hi>nocturnal convocations;</hi>
for putting the caſe that his Wife after
his deceaſe ſhould marry with a <hi>Gentile</hi>-Husband,
amongſt other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
he asks her, whether ſhe thought
he would be willing to let her riſe from
his Bed to go to their <hi>night-meetings;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De ſug. in perſecut. c. 14. p. 543.</note>
and in the caſe of perſecution he tells
<hi>Fabius,</hi> that if they could not celebrate
<hi>Dominica ſolennia,</hi> their Lords-Day So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
in the day time, they had the
<hi>night</hi> ſufficiently clear with the <hi>light</hi> of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46588:104"/>
Chriſt. This gave occaſion to their
ſpightful Adverſaries to calumniate and
aſperſe them:<note place="margin">M. Fael. p. 7.</note> the Heathen in <hi>Minucius</hi>
charges them with their <hi>night-Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi>
upon which account they are
there ſcornfully called <hi>latebroſa &amp; luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugax
natio</hi> an <hi>obſcure and skulking Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orig. adv. Cel. 1. p. 4.—7.</note>
and the very firſt thing that
<hi>Celſus</hi> objects is, that the Chriſtians had
private and clancular Aſſemblies, or
Combinations; to which <hi>Origen</hi> anſwers,
that if it were ſo, they might thank them
for it who would not ſuffer them to
exerciſe it more openly; that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine was ſufficiently evident
and obvious, and better known through
the world, than the opinion and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their beſt Philoſophers; and
that if there were ſome myſteries in the
Chriſtian Religion which were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to every one, 'twas no other
thing than what was common in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sects of their own Philoſophy. But
to return.</p>
               <p>They looked upon the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> as a
time to be celebrated with great expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of joy, as being the happy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Chriſts reſurrection, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
reſtrained whatever might ſavour
of ſorrow and ſadneſs; faſting on that
day they prohibited with the greateſt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46588:105"/>
ſeverity, accounting it utterly unlawful,
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> informs us.<note place="margin">De Cor. mil. c. 3. p. 102.</note> It was a very
bitter cenſure that of <hi>Ignatius</hi> (or whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that Epiſtle was, for certainly it
was not his) that who ever <hi>faſts</hi> on a
<hi>Lords-Day</hi> is a <hi>murderer</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. ad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. p. 112.</note> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'tis certain, that they never faſted
on thoſe days, no not in the time of
<hi>Lent</hi> it ſelf; nay the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> though
otherwiſe great pretenders to faſting and
mortification, did yet abſtain from it on
the Lords-day. And as they accounted
it a joyful and good day, ſo they did
what ever they thought might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the honour of it. No ſooner
was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> come over to the
Church,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vit. Conſt. l. 4. c. 18, 19, 20. p. 534.</note> but his principal care was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> he commanded it
to be ſolemnly obſerved, and that by
all perſons whatſoever, he made it to
all a day of <hi>reſt;</hi> that men might have
nothing to do but to worſhip God, and
be better inſtructed in the Chriſtian
Faith, and ſpend their whole time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing to hinder them in prayer
and devotion, according to the cuſtom
and diſcipline of the Church: and for
thoſe in his Army who yet remained in
their <hi>Paganiſm</hi> and infidelity, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them upon <hi>Lords-days</hi> to go out
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46588:105"/>
into the Fields, and there pour out their
ſouls in hearty prayers to God; and
that none might pretend their own ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to the duty, he himſelf compoſed
and gave them a ſhort <hi>form</hi> of prayer,
which he enjoin'd them to make uſe of
every Lords-Day: ſo careful was he
that this day ſhould not be <hi>diſhonoured</hi>
or <hi>miſ-imployed,</hi> even by thoſe who were
yet <hi>ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.<note place="margin">Cod. Juſt. l. 3. Tit. 12. de feriis l. 3.</note>
He moreover ordained, that there
ſhould be no <hi>Courts</hi> of Judicature open
upon this day, no <hi>Suits</hi> or Tryals at
<hi>Law,</hi> but that for any works of mercy,
ſuch as the <hi>emancipating</hi> and ſetting free
of Slaves or Servants, this might be done.
That there ſhould be no Suits nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
debts upon this day,<note place="margin">Cod. Theod. lib. 2. Tit. 8. de feriis l. 1. lib. 8.</note> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by ſeveral Laws of ſucceeding
Emperours, and that no <hi>Arbitrators</hi> who
had the Umpirage of any buſineſs lying
before them,<note place="margin">Tit. 8. l. 3.</note> ſhould at that time have
power to determine or take up litigious
cauſes, penalties being entail'd upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that tranſgreſſed herein.<note place="margin">Ib. lib. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Theodoſius
the Great,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 5. de ſpectac. l. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>anno</hi> 386. by a ſecond Law ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
one which he had paſſed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
wherein he expreſly prohibited all
publick <hi>Shews</hi> upon the Lords-Day, that
the worſhip of God might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46588:106"/>
with thoſe prophane Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
This Law the younger <hi>Theodoſius</hi>
ſome few years after confirmed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,<note place="margin">Ib. Leg. 5. Dominico.</note>
enacting, that on the Lords day
(and ſome other Feſtivals there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
not only <hi>Christians,</hi> but even
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> ſhould be reſtrained
from the pleaſure of all <hi>Sights</hi> and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles,</hi>
and the <hi>Theatres</hi> be ſhut up in
every place; and whereas it might ſo
happen that the <hi>Birth-day</hi> or <hi>inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Emperour might fall upon
that day, therefore to let the people
know how infinitely he preferred the
honour of God, before the concerns of
his own majeſty and greatneſs, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that if it ſhould ſo happen, that
then the imperial Solemnity ſhould be put
off, and deferred till another day.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take notice but of one inſtance
more of their great obſervance of this
day, and that was their conſtant <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
upon the Solemnities of publick
Worſhip; they did not think it enough
to read and pray, and praiſe God at
<hi>home,</hi> but made conſcience of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>publick</hi> Aſſemblies, from which
nothing but ſickneſs and abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
did detain them: and if ſick, or in
priſon, or under baniſhment, nothing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46588:106"/>
troubled them more, than that they
could not come to Church, and join
their devotions to the common Services.
If perſecution at any time forced them
to keep a little cloſe, yet no ſooner was
there the leaſt mitigation, but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
returned to their open duty, and
publickly met all together. No trivial
pretences, no light excuſes were then
admitted for any ones abſence from the
Congregation, but according to the
merit of the cauſe ſevere cenſures were
paſſed upon them. The Synod of <hi>Illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
provided,<note place="margin">Can. 21. p. 28.</note> that if any man dwelling
in a City (where uſually Churches were
neareſt hand) ſhould for three <hi>Lords
Days</hi> abſent himſelf from the Church, he
ſhould for ſome time be ſuſpended the
Communion, that he might appear to
be corrected for his fault. They allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no ſeparate Aſſemblies, no Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
but what met in the publick
Church; if any man took upon him to
make a breach, and to draw people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
corners, he was preſently condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and a ſutable penalty put upon him.
When <hi>Euſtathius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sebaſtia</hi> (a
man petending to great ſtrictneſs and
auſterity of life) began to caſt off the
Diſcipline of the Church, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46588:107"/>
many odd obſervations of his own,

or <hi>Saturday</hi> (for ſo the word <hi>Sabbatum</hi>
is conſtantly uſed in the Writings of the
Fathers, when ſpeaking of it as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to Chriſtians) was held by them in
great veneration, and eſpecially in the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts honoured with all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Solemnities of Religion. For which
we are to know, that the Goſpel in thoſe
parts mainly prevailing amongſt the
<hi>Jews,</hi> they being generally the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
to the Chriſtian Faith, they ſtill
retained a mighty reverence for the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick</hi>
Inſtitutions, and eſpecially for the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> as that which had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God himſelf (as the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of his reſt from the work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
ſetled by their great Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and celebrated by their Anceſtors for
ſo many Ages, as the ſolemn day of
their publick Worſhip, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
very loth that it ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
antiquated and laid aſide. For this
reaſon it ſeemed good to the prudence
of thoſe times (as in others of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Rites, ſo in this) to indulge the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of that people, and to keep the
Sabbath as a day for religious offices.
Hence they uſually had moſt parts of
Divine Service performed upon that
day, they met together for publick
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46588:108"/>
Prayers, for reading the Scriptures, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the Sacraments, and ſuch
like duties. This is plain not only from
ſome paſſages in <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi>
his Conſtitutions, but from Writers of
more unqueſtionable credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.<note place="margin">Homil. de Sement. in init.</note>
                  <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> tells

ſpeaking of the uſual times of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
meeting, calls the Sabbath and the
Lords day the weekly Feſtivals, on
which the Congregation was wont to
meet in the Church, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Divine Services. Therefore
the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> amongſt other
things decreed,<note place="margin">Can. 16. 49. 51.</note> that upon <hi>Saturdays</hi> the
Goſpels and other Scriptures ſhould be
read, that in <hi>Lent</hi> the Euchariſt ſhould

the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and upon thoſe days on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the time of <hi>Lent</hi> it ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to commemorate and rehearſe the
names of Martyrs. Upon this day alſo
aſwel as upon <hi>Sunday</hi> all <hi>Faſts</hi> were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
prohibited (an infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they counted it a Feſtival day) one

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:46588:109"/>
that before <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
obſerved as a ſolemn Faſt. Things
ſo commonly known as to need no proof.
But though the Church thought fit thus
far to correſpond with Jewiſh Converts,
as ſolemnly to obſerve the Sabbath; yet
to take away all offence, and to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
themſelves from compliance with
Judaiſm, they openly declared that they
did it only in a <hi>Chriſtian way,</hi> and kept
it not as a Jewiſh Sabbath, as is expreſly
affirmed by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>

                  <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> and

before it; and on that day reſt as</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
<hi>but if any were found to</hi> judaize
<hi>they ſhould be accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſtood the caſe in the <hi>Eastern</hi>

ſomewhat different, amongſt them it

                  <hi>(ſays he)</hi> we
commemorate Chriſts reſurrection not

the days of grief and joy; the

days <hi>(viz. Friday</hi> and the <hi>Sabbath)</hi> in
great ſorrow and heavineſs: and he
thinks no doubt ought to be made but
that the Apoſtles faſted upon thoſe two
days, whence the Church had a <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that the Sacraments were not to be
adminiſtred on thoſe days, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concludes, that every <hi>Saturday</hi> or

that a <hi>Saturday</hi> Feſtival was an

But though this ſeems to have
been the general practice, yet it did not
obtain in all places of the <hi>Weſt</hi> alike. In

though ſo great was the prudence

he bound not up himſelf in theſe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

he dined upon <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and when he

he could give him no better advice in

it as an <hi>Oracle</hi> ſent from <hi>Heaven.</hi> So
that even in <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Saturday</hi> Faſt was
not univerſally obſerved. Nay a very
<hi>learned man</hi> (and a Biſhop of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church) thinks it highly probable,<note place="margin">Albaſp. de vet. Eccl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. obſ. 13. p. 90.</note> that
for the firſt Ages eſpecially, <hi>Saturday</hi>
was no more kept as a Faſt at <hi>Rome,</hi>
than in the Churches of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> though
the great argument whereby he would
eſtabliſh it <hi>(viz.</hi> becauſe ſome <hi>Latine</hi>
Churches, who muſt needs follow the

keep it ſo) is very infirm and weak;
and needs no more than that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Church of <hi>Millain</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it, which though under the <hi>Popes</hi>

do the greater honour to it: the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

they have for this time, commanding
all Suits and Proceſſes at Law to ceaſe,
Tribunal-doors to be ſhut up, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners

               <p>We proceed now to enquire what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Feſtivals there were in thoſe firſt
Ages of the Church, which I find to be
chiefly theſe; <hi>Eaſter, Whitſuntide,</hi> and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46588:113"/>
                  <hi>Epiphany,</hi> which comprehended two,
<hi>Christmaſs</hi> and <hi>Epiphany</hi> properly ſo
called. I reckon them not in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
order, but as I ſuppoſe them to have
taken place in the Church. Of theſe
<hi>Eaſter</hi> challenges the precedence both
for its antiquity, and the great ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; that in and from the very times
of the Apoſtles (beſides the weekly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of the Lords day) there has been
always obſerved an <hi>Anniverſary</hi> Feſtival
in memory of Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> no
man can doubt, that has any inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the affairs of the ancient Church; all
the diſpute was about the particular
time when it was to be kept, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a matter of as famous a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
as any that in thoſe Ages exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
the Chriſtian world. The ſtate of
the caſe was briefly this; the Churches
of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſs kept their <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon
the ſame day, whereon the Jews cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
their <hi>Paſſover, viz.</hi> upon the 14.
day of the firſt Month (which always
began with the appearance of the Moon)
moſtly anſwering to our <hi>March,</hi> and
this they did, upon what day of the
week ſoever it fell, and hence were
ſtiled <hi>Quartodecimans,</hi> becauſe keeping
Eaſter <hi>quarta decima Luna,</hi> upon the

14. day after the <gap reason="foreign">

the <hi>Moon.</hi> The other Churches, and
eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Weſt</hi> did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this cuſtom, but kept <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon
the Lords day following the day of the
Jewiſh Paſſover, partly the more to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the day, and partly to diſtinguiſh
between Jews and Chriſtians: the <hi>Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
pleaded for themſelves the practice
of the <hi>Apoſtles; Polycarpus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
who had lived and converſed with
them, having kept it upon that day, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with S. <hi>John</hi> and the reſt of the
Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 5. c. 24. p. 193.</note> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who himſelf knew
<hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and doubtleſs had it from
his own mouth) ſpeaks in a Letter about
this very thing though himſelf was of
the other ſide.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 191.</note> And <hi>Polycrates</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the ſame purpoſe, inſtances not
only in S. <hi>John,</hi> but S. <hi>Philip</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who himſelf and his whole Family
uſed ſo to keep it, from whom it had
been conveyed down in a conſtant and
uninterrupted obſervance through all
the Biſhops of thoſe places, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he there enumerates, and tells us that
ſeven Biſhops of that place in a conſtant
ſucceſſion had been his Kinſmen, and
himſelf the eighth, and that it had never
been kept by them upon any other day;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46588:114"/>
this we are not ſo to underſtand, as if
S. <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles had inſtituted
this Feſtival, and commanded it to be
obſerved upon <hi>that day,</hi> but rather that
they did it by way of <hi>condeſcenſion,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating
their practice in a matter
indifferent to the humour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Converts (whoſe number in thoſe parts
was very great) as they had done before
in ſeveral other caſes, and particularly
in obſerving the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Saturday.</hi>
The other Churches alſo (ſays <hi>Euſebius)</hi>
had for their patronage an <hi>Apoſtolical
Tradition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. c. 23. p. 190.</note> or at leaſt pretended it: and
were the much more numerous party.
This difference was the ſpring of great
buſtles in the Church; for the Biſhops
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtickled hard to impoſe their
cuſtom upon the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches,
whereupon <hi>Polycarpus</hi> comes over to
<hi>Rome</hi> to confer with <hi>Anicetus</hi> who was
then Biſhop about it;<note place="margin">Id. l. 4. c. 14. p. 127.</note> and though they
could not agree the matter, yet they
parted fairly. After this <hi>Pope Victor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
the quarrel, and was ſo fierce and
peremptory in the caſe, that he either
actually did,<note place="margin">H. Valeſ. Annot. in. Euſeb. l. 5. c. 24. p. 105. col. 1.</note> or (as a learned man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines

the <hi>odium</hi> of the Fact) ſeverely threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to excommunicate thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:46588:115"/>
Churches for ſtanding out againſt it:
this raſh and bold attempt was ill reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſober and moderate men of his
own party, who writ to him about it;
and particularly <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (a man, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>
notes, truly anſwering his <hi>name,</hi>
both in his temper and his life, <hi>quiet and
peaceable)</hi> who gravely reproved him
for renting the peace of the Church, and
troubling ſo many famous Churches for
obſerving the cuſtoms derived to them
from their Anceſtors, with much more
to the ſame purpoſe. But the <hi>Aſian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
little regarded what was either ſaid
or done at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſtill went on in their
old courſe, though by the diligent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of the other party they loſt
ground, but yet ſtill made ſhift to keep
the cauſe on foot till the time of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>

               <p>The next Feaſt conſiderable in thoſe
primitive times, was that of <hi>Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
or <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> a Feaſt of great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in memory of
the Law delivered at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> at

bringing in of their <hi>Harveſt;</hi> and of no

Ghoſts</hi> deſcending upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and
other Chriſtians, in the viſible appearance
of <hi>fiery cloven tongues,</hi> which hapned
upon that day, and thoſe miraculous
powers then conferred upon them. It
was obſerved with the ſame reſpect to
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> did with reſpect to
their <hi>Paſſover, viz.</hi> (as the word imports)
juſt <hi>fifty days</hi> after it, reckoning from
the ſecond day of that Feſtival: it ſeems
to ſome to have commenced from the firſt
riſe of Chriſtianity, not only becauſe
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the Church were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
upon that day, but becauſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46588:117"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> made ſo much haſte to be at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which they
underſtand of his great deſire to keep it
there as a <hi>Chriſtian Feaſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20. 16.</note> But the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeems to me no way concluſive,
for the Apoſtle might deſire to be there
at that time, both becauſe he was ſure
to meet with a great number of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and becauſe he ſhould have a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunity to preach the Goſpel to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> who from all parts flock'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Feaſt, as our Saviour himſelf

under the name, and at the general time
of the <hi>Epiphania,</hi> till receiving more
light in the caſe from the Churches of
the <hi>Weſt,</hi> they changed it to this day;
ſure I am S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in an Homily on
purpoſe about this very thing affirms,<note place="margin">Serm. 31.</note>
that it was not above ten years ſince in
that Church <hi>(i. e. Antioch)</hi> it began firſt
to be obſerved upon that day,<note place="margin">Tom. 5. p. 417.</note> and there

the true day of Chriſts Nativity.</p>

The Feaſt of <hi>Epiphany,</hi> properly ſo
called, was kept on the <hi>ſixth of January,</hi>
and had that name from a threefold <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition</hi>
or manifeſtation commemorated
upon that day, which all hapned, though
not in the ſame year, yet upon the ſame
day of the year. The firſt was the <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of the <hi>Star,</hi> which guided the wiſe
men to Chriſt. The ſecond was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>appearance</hi> at the <hi>baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
when all the perſons in the holy <hi>Trinity</hi>
did ſenſibly manifeſt themſelves, the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in the <hi>voice</hi> from Heaven, the <hi>Son</hi> in
the <hi>River Jordan,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in
the viſible ſhape of a <hi>Dove.</hi> This was
ever accounted a famous Feſtival, and
as S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Hom. 23. de Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Chriſti. tom 1. p. 278.</note> was properly
called <hi>Epiphany,</hi> becauſe he came in a
manner into the world <hi>incognito;</hi> but at
his baptiſm openly appeared to be the
Son of God, and was ſo declared before
the world. At this time it was that by
his <hi>going into the River Jordan he did
ſanctifie water to the myſtical waſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of ſin</hi> (as our Church expreſſes it)
in memory whereof,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us,
they uſed in this Solemnity at midnight
to draw water, which they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as <hi>conſecrated</hi> this day, and carrying
it home to lay it up, where it would
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46588:119"/>
remain pure and uncorrupt for a whole
year, ſometimes two or three years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the truth whereof muſt reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the credit of that good man. The
third <hi>manifeſtation</hi> commemorated at
this time, was that of Chriſts <hi>divinity,</hi>
which appeared in the firſt miracle that
he wrought in <hi>turning water into Wine;</hi>
therefore 'twas called <hi>Bethphania,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was done in the <hi>houſe</hi> at that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which
our Saviour honoured with his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
All theſe three appearances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the Solemnity of this Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.</p>
               <p>But beſide theſe, there was another
ſort of Feſtivals in the primitive Church,
kept in commemoration of <hi>Martyrs:</hi> for
the underſtanding of which we are to
know, that in thoſe ſad and bloody
times when the Chriſtian Religion tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over perſecution, and gained
upon the world by nothing more than
the conſtant and reſolute ſufferings of
its profeſſors, whom no threatnings or
torments could baffle out of it; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
generally had a vaſt reverence for
thoſe who ſuffered thus deep in the cauſe
of Chriſtianity, and laid down their
lives for the confirmation of it. They
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46588:120"/>
looked upon <hi>Confeſſors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> as
the great <hi>Champions</hi> of their Religion,
who <hi>reſiſted unto blood,</hi> and dyed upon
the ſpot to make good its ground, and
to maintain its honour and reputation;
and therefore thought it very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do all poſſible honour to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
partly that others might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to the like patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and partly that virtue even in
this world might not loſe its reward.
Hence they were wont once a year to
meet at the <hi>Graves</hi> of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> there
ſolemnly to recite their ſufferings and
their triumphs, to praiſe their virtues,
and to bleſs God for their pious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
for their holy lives and their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
deaths, for their Palms and Crowns.
Theſe anniverſary Solemnities were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>memoriae martyrum,</hi> the <hi>memories of
the Martyrs,</hi> a title mentioned by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
but certainly much older than his
time;<note place="margin">Epiſt. 37. p. 51.</note> and indeed when they were firſt
taken up in the Church is I think not ſo
exactly known: the firſt that I remember
to have met with, is that of <hi>Polycarp</hi>
(whoſe martyrdom is placed by <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
anno</hi> 168.<note place="margin">Euſeb. Chron. ad An. 168.</note> under the third Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
concerning whoſe death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> (of which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46588:120"/>
he was Biſhop) giving an account to the
Church of <hi>Philomelium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 4. c. 15. p. 135.</note> and eſpecially
of the place where they had honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
entomb'd his bones, they do profeſs
that (ſo far as the malice of their Enemies
would permit them, and they prayed
God nothing might hinder it) they
would aſſemble in that place, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the <hi>Birth-day</hi> of his Martyrdom
with joy and gladneſs: where we may
eſpecially obſerve, that this Solemnity
is ſtiled his <hi>Birth-day,</hi> and indeed ſo the
primitive Chriſtians uſed to call the days
of their death and paſſion (quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the manner of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who
kept the <hi>Natalitials</hi> of their famous men)
looking upon theſe as the true days of
their nativity, wherein they were freed
from this Valley of tears, theſe regions
of death, and <hi>born again</hi> unto the joys
and happineſs of an endleſs life. The
ſame account <hi>Origen</hi> gives (if that Book
be his, a very ancient Authour however)
we keep <hi>(ſays he)</hi> the memories of the
Saints,<note place="margin">Expoſe. in Job. l. 3. fol. 39. tom. 2.</note> of our Anceſtors, and friends
that dye in the faith, both rejoycing in
that reſt which they have obtained, and
begging for our ſelves a pious <hi>conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
in the faith: and we celebrate
not the day of their <hi>nativity,</hi> as being
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46588:121"/>
the <hi>inlet</hi> to ſorrow and temptation, but
of their <hi>death,</hi> as the <hi>period</hi> of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
and that which ſets them beyond
the reach of temptations. And this we
do, both <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>People</hi> meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
inviting the poor and needy, and
refreſhing the Widows and the Orphans;
that ſo our Feſtival may be both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>them,</hi> whom we commemorate,
the memorial of that happy reſt which
their departed ſouls do enjoy; and in
reſpect of <hi>us</hi> the <hi>odour</hi> of a <hi>ſweet ſmell</hi> in
the ſight of God. Under <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
theſe days were commanded to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
with great care and ſtrictneſs,<note place="margin">De vit. Conſt. l. 4. c. 23 p 536.</note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
all his <hi>Lieutenants</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Provinces to ſee the <hi>memorials</hi>
of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> duly honoured; and ſo
ſacred were they accounted in thoſe
days, that it was thought a piece of
prophaneneſs to be abſent from them;
therefore S. <hi>Baſil</hi> thought he could not
uſe a more ſolemn argument,<note place="margin">Epiſt 336. tom. 3. p. 328.</note> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
a certain Biſhop to come over to
him upon this occaſion, than to adjure
him by the reſpect he bore to the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi>
of the Martyrs, that if he would
not do it for his, yet he ſhould for their
ſakes, towards whom it was unfit he
ſhould ſhew the leaſt diſregard. Hence
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46588:121"/>
it is that <hi>Libanius</hi> ſometimes takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under no other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

<hi>that haunt and frequent
Tombs and Sepulchers.</hi> For the <hi>time</hi> of
theſe aſſemblies it was commonly <hi>once a
year, viz.</hi> upon the day of their martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for which end they took particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
care to keep <hi>Regiſters</hi> of the days of
the Martyrs paſſions. So <hi>Cyprian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
charges his <hi>Clergie</hi> to note down
the days of their deceaſe,<note place="margin">Loco ſupra annot.</note> that there
might be a commemoration of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>memories</hi> of the Martyrs.
<hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us, that in his time they
did not thus aſſemble once or twice,<note place="margin">De Cur. Graec. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect. Serm. 8. de mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrib. p. 121.</note> or
five times in a year, but kept <hi>frequent</hi>
memorials, oftentimes every day cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
the memorials of Martyrs, with
hymns and praiſes unto God. But I
ſuppoſe he means it of days appointed
to the memory of <hi>particular</hi> Martyrs,
which being then very numerous, their
memorials were diſtinctly fixed upon
their proper days, the Feſtival of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or S. <hi>Paul, Thomas, Sergius, Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
&amp;c.</hi> as he there enumerates them.
For the <hi>places,</hi> theſe Solemnities were
kept at firſt at the <hi>Tombs</hi> where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
had been buried, which uſually
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46588:122"/>
were in the <hi>Coemeteria</hi> or <hi>Church-yard,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
in thoſe times from their places of
Publick Worſhip, and at a great diſtance
from them, as being commonly without
the Cities. Here their burying places
where in large <hi>Cryptae</hi> or <hi>Grots</hi> under
ground, where they celebrated theſe
memorials, and whither they uſed to
retire for their common devotions in
times of great perſecution, when their
Churches were deſtroyed or taken from
them. And therefore when <hi>Aemilian</hi> the
Governour of <hi>Egypt</hi> under the Reign of
<hi>Valerian</hi> would ſcrew up the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. lib. 7. c. 11. p. 258. l. 9. c. 2. p. 349.</note> he forbad their
meetings, and that they ſhould not ſo
much as aſſemble in the places which
they called their <hi>Church-yards;</hi> the ſame
<hi>priviledge</hi> which <hi>Maximinus</hi> alſo had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them. By reaſon of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of theſe places, and their frequent
aſſembling there in the <hi>night,</hi> to avoid
the fury of their Enemies, they were
forced to uſe <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Lamps</hi> in their
publick meetings, but they who make
this an argument to patronize their burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Lamps and Wax-Candles in their
Churches at Noon-day (as 'tis in all the
great Churches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
talk at a ſtrange rate of wild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46588:122"/>
I am ſure S. <hi>Hierom</hi> when
charged with it,<note place="margin">Adv. vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. tom. 2. p. 123.</note> denied that they uſed
any in the day time, and never but at
night when they roſe up to their night-devotions.
He confeſſes indeed 'twas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, where
when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was to be read, they ſet
up Lights, as a token of their <hi>rejoycing</hi>
for thoſe happy and glad tidings that
were contained in it, <hi>light</hi> having been
ever uſed as a <hi>ſymbol</hi> and repreſentation
of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>gladneſs:</hi> A cuſtom probably
not much elder than his time. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when Chriſtianity prevailed in
the world, the devotion of Chriſtians
erected Churches in thoſe places; the
Temples of the Martyrs <hi>(ſays Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret)</hi>

Sermons and Orations, joined in publick
prayers and praiſes, received the holy
Sacrament, offered gifts and charities
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46588:123"/>
for the poor, recited the names of the
Martyrs then commemorated with their
due elogies and commendations, and
their virtues propounded to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the hearers. For which purpoſe
they had their ſet <hi>Notaries</hi> who took the

which were after <hi>compiled</hi> into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Treatiſes,</hi> and were recited in theſe
annual meetings, and this was the firſt
original of <hi>Martyrologies</hi> in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church. From this cuſtom of offering
up prayers, praiſes, and alms at thoſe
times, it is that the Fathers ſpeak ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of <hi>oblations</hi> and <hi>ſacrifices</hi> at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs

               <p>Theſe Feſtivals being times of mirth

reaſonable and commendable, yet
through the folly and dotage of men

becauſe ſo earneſtly <hi>deſired</hi> and ſought

The truth is,<note place="margin">Vid. Chryſ. ibid.</note> till perſons arrived at this

(or but in a large ſenſe as <hi>Candidates</hi>

beget in mens minds the higher eſteem
and veneration for theſe religious myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
nothing producing a greater <hi>contempt</hi>

obſcurity and concealment might ſeem
neceſſary to vindicate them from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and ſecure the majeſty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
that was due to them. This
made the <hi>Fathers</hi> &amp; <hi>Seniors</hi> of the Church
(ſays S. <hi>Baſil)</hi> in preſcribing Rites and
Laws,<note place="margin">Loc. ſupr. laud.</note> leave many things in the dark,

of this enough, if not too much.</p>
               <p>And as they were careful to keep the
higher parts of Chriſtianity within the

not leſs careful to teach and inſtruct the

(as <hi>Balſamon</hi> clearly intimates) till they
were ſufficiently inſtructed in the firſt

all parts, and eſpecially the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Empire, it was found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
yet farther to enlarge the Epiſcopal
Office, and as there was commonly a
Biſhop in every <hi>great City,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi>
(as the <hi>Romans</hi> called it) the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
City</hi> of every <hi>Province</hi> (wherein they
had Courts of Civil Judicature) there
was an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> or a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi>
who had Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction over
all the Churches within that Province.
He was ſuperior to all the Biſhops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

to <hi>ordain,</hi> or to <hi>ratifie</hi> the elections
and ordinations of all the Biſhops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Province, inſomuch that without
his <hi>confirmation</hi> they were looked upon
as null and void. Once at leaſt every
year he was to ſummon the Biſhops under
him to a <hi>Synod,</hi> to enquire into and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Eccleſiaſtical affairs within that
Province; to inſpect the lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

them that were diſorderly and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46588:134"/>

happened between any of them,
he was to have the <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of them; and indeed no matter
of <hi>moment</hi> was done within the whole
Province without firſt conſulting him in
the caſe. Beſides this <hi>Metropolitan</hi> there
was many times another in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
who enjoyed nothing but that
name and title, his <hi>Epiſcopal See</hi> being
by the Emperours <hi>Pragmatic</hi> erected into
the dignity of a <hi>Metropolis.</hi> He was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an <hi>Honorary Metropolitan,</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
real power and jurisdiction, and

that the Biſhop of it might have prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
above the reſt,<note place="margin">Can. 9.</note> and the honour

               </p>

of the Epiſcopal Office, as much ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to that of <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> as theirs
was to ordinary Biſhops, theſe were
called <hi>Primates</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and
had juriſdiction over many Provinces.
For the underſtanding of this it's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to know, that when Chriſtianity
came to be fully ſetled in the world,
they contrived to model the external
Government of the Church, as near as
might be to the Civil Government of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; the parallel moſt
exactly drawn by an <hi>ingenious</hi> perſon of
our own Nation:<note place="margin">Edward Breerwood Patriarch. Governm. of the ancient Church. Queſt. 1.</note> the ſum of it is this.
The whole Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into <hi>Thirteen Dioceces</hi> (ſo they called
thoſe diviſions) theſe contained about
<hi>one hundred and twenty Provinſes,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Province ſeveral <hi>Cities.</hi> Now as in
every City there was a <hi>temporal</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46588:135"/>
for the executing of juſtice, and
keeping peace both for that City, and
the Towns round about it, ſo was there
alſo a <hi>Biſhop</hi> for ſpiritual order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
whoſe juriſdiction was of
like extent and latitude. In every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
there was a <hi>Proconſul</hi> or Preſident,
whoſe ſeat was uſually at the <hi>Metropolis</hi>
or chief City of the Province; and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all inferiour Cities came for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters of importance. And in
proportion to this there was in the ſame
City an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> or <hi>Metropolitan</hi> for
matters of Eccleſiaſtical concernment.
Laſtly, in every <hi>Dioceſs</hi> the Emperours
had their <hi>Vicarii</hi> or <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> who
dwelt in the principal City of the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi>
where all imperial <hi>Edicts</hi> were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
and from whence they were ſent
abroad into the ſeveral Provinces, and
where was the chief <hi>Tribunal,</hi> where all
Cauſes not determinable elſewhere were
decided. And to anſwer this, there was
in the ſame City a <hi>Primate,</hi> to whom the
laſt determination of all appeals from all
the Provinces in differences of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
and the Soveraign care of all the
Dioceſs for ſundry points of ſpiritual
Government did belong. This in ſhort
is the ſum of the account which that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46588:135"/>
                  <hi>learned</hi> man gives of this matter. So that
the <hi>Patriarch</hi> as ſuperiour to <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
was to have under his juriſdiction
not any one <hi>ſingle Province,</hi> but a <hi>whole
Dioceſs</hi> (in the old <hi>Roman</hi> notion of that
word) conſiſting of many <hi>Provinces.</hi> To
him belonged the <hi>ordination</hi> of all the
<hi>Metropolitans</hi> that were under him, as
alſo the <hi>ſummoning</hi> them to Councils,
the <hi>correcting</hi> and reforming the miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours
they were guilty of, and from
his judgment and ſentence in things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
within his cognizance there lay
no appeal. To this I ſhall only add what
<hi>Salmaſius</hi> has noted,<note place="margin">De Primat. c. 19. p. 331.</note> that as the <hi>Dioceſs</hi>
that was governed by the <hi>Vicarius</hi> had
many <hi>Provinces</hi> under it, ſo the <hi>Praefectus
Praetorio</hi> had ſeveral <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> under him:
and in proportion to this probably it
was, that <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were firſt brought
in, who if not ſuperiour to <hi>Primates</hi> in
juriſdiction and power, were yet in <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
by reaſon of the dignity of thoſe
Cities where their <hi>Sees</hi> were fixed, as
at <hi>Rome, Conſtantinople, Alexandria, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a title and dignity
which they retain to this day.</p>
               <p>The next Office to Biſhops was that
of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to whom it belonged
to preach to the people, to adminiſter
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46588:136"/>
Baptiſm, conſecrate the Euchariſt, and to
be aſſiſtent to the Biſhop both in publick
miniſtrations, and in diſpatching the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Church. The truth is, the
<hi>Presbyters</hi> of every great City were a kind
of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Senate,</hi> under the care and
preſidency of the Biſhop, whoſe counſel
and aſſiſtance he made uſe of in ruling
thoſe Societies of Chriſtians that were
under his charge and government, and
were accordingly reckoned next in place
and power to him: thus deſcribed by
S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his <hi>Iambics.</hi>

to preach to the <hi>edification</hi> of the
people, admitted S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (whom he
had lately ordained <hi>Presbyter)</hi> to preach
before him. Which though at firſt 'twas
ill reſented by ſome Biſhops in thoſe parts,
yet quickly became a preſident for other
Churches to follow after.</p>
               <p>After theſe came <hi>Deacons:</hi> What
the duty of their place was appears from
their primitive election,<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> the Apoſtles
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46588:137"/>
ſetting them apart to <hi>ſerve</hi> or <hi>minister
to the Tables, i.e.</hi> to attend upon and take
charge of thoſe daily <hi>proviſions</hi> that were
made for poor indigent Chriſtians; but
certainly it implies alſo their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated
to a peculiar attendance at the
ſervice of the <hi>Lords Table.</hi> And both
theſe may be very well meant in that
place, it being the cuſtom of Chriſtians
then to meet every day at the Lords
Table, where they made their offerings
for the poor, and when poor and rich
had their meales together. And hence
it was ever accounted part of the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
Office, as to take care of the poor,
and to diſtribute the monies given for
their relief and maintenance, ſo to wait
upon the celebration of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
which being conſecrated by the Biſhop
or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the <hi>Deacon</hi> delivered the
Sacramental elements to the people. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this they were wont alſo to <hi>preach</hi>
and to <hi>baptize,</hi> and were employed in
many parts of the publick Service, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in guiding and directing of the
people. The number of them in any one
place was uſually reſtrained to <hi>ſeven,</hi>
this being the number originally inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and which might
not be altered, although the City was
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46588:137"/>
never ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>numerous,</hi> as 'tis in
the laſt <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Neocaeſarean</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
As the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
ſo the <hi>Deacons</hi> were to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to
be aſſiſtent to them, and to give them
all due reſpect and reverence. And
therefore when ſome of them began to
take too much upon them to diſtribute
the Sacrament before the Biſhop or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
and to take place amongſt the
Presbyters, the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> took
notice of it as a piece of bold and ſaucy
uſurpation,<note place="margin">Can. 18.</note> ſeverely commanded them
to know their place, and to contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
within their own <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi>
and neither to meddle with the
Sacrament but in their order, nor to <hi>ſit
down</hi> before the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> unleſs it be
by their leave and command, as 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Synod.<note place="margin">Can. 20.</note> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the firſt Council of <hi>Arles</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the Deacons to do any thing of
themſelves,<note place="margin">Can. 18.</note> but to reſerve the honour
to the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Out of the body of
theſe <hi>Deacons</hi> there was uſually one cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
to overlook the reſt, the <hi>Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con;</hi>
an Office ſuppoſed to have been of
good antiquity in the Church, and of
great authority, eſpecially in after times,
being generally ſtyled the <hi>Eye of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46588:138"/>
Biſhop,</hi> to inſpect all parts and places of
his Dioceſs. This was he that in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was called the <hi>Cardinal
Deacon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Epiſc.</note> who (as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> tell us) was
at firſt but one,<note place="margin">Tit &amp; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. p. 24.</note> though the number en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
afterwards. While Churches
were little, and the ſervices not many,
the Deacons themſelves were able to
diſcharge them, but as theſe encreaſed
ſo did their labours, and therefore 'twas
thought fit to take in ſome inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
under them. This gave being to</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subdeacons,</hi> who were to be aſſiſtent
to the <hi>Deacon,</hi> as the Deacon to the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conc. Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. Can. 43 ubi vid.</note>
and he to the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> One great
part of his work was to wait at the
<hi>Church-doors</hi> in the time of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,<note place="margin">Zon &amp; Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam.</note>
to uſher in, and to bring out the

<hi>Penitents,</hi> that none might miſtake their
proper ſtations, and that no confuſion
or diſorder might ariſe to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the Congregation. When he
was firſt taken in, I cannot find, but he is
mentioned in an Epiſtle of the <hi>Roman
Clergie</hi> to them of <hi>Carthage</hi> about S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi>
retirement,<note place="margin">Inter Epiſt.</note> and elſewhere very

proper buſineſs was, is not ſo certain;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46588:138"/>
by ſome his Office is ſaid to have been
this, to <hi>Follow</hi> (as the world implies) or
to go along with the Biſhop in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of an <hi>honourable</hi> attendant, to be
ready at hand to miniſter to him, and
to be a companion and witneſs of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and unblameable converſation, in
caſe any evil fame ſhould ariſe, that
might endeavour to blaſt his reputation.
But by others he is ſaid to have been a
<hi>Taper-bearer</hi> to carry the <hi>Lights,</hi> which
were ſet up at the reading of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
And this ſeems to be clear from the
fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. 6.</note> where at his
ordination he is appointed to receive at
the <hi>Archdeacons</hi> hand a <hi>Candleſtick</hi> with
a <hi>Taper,</hi> that he may know 'tis the duty
of his place, to light up the <hi>Lights</hi> in the
<hi>Church.</hi> This might very well be in thoſe
times, but 'tis certain the Office of <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lythus</hi>
was in uſe long before that cuſtom
of ſetting up Lights at the reading of the
Goſpel was brought into the Church.
By <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo is mentioned the Office

                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 16. p. 29. &amp; 146.</note> whoſe buſineſs was to

wherein they were performed, which
uſually was in this manner. At their

<hi>i. e.</hi> all that might not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

<hi>Thoſe that are Catechumens go out;</hi> in the

EST, <hi>depart, there is a diſmiſſion of you,
miſſa</hi> being the ſame with <hi>miſſio,</hi> as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa</hi>
oft uſed in ſome Writers for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio</hi>
(and ſo the word <hi>miſſa</hi> is uſed
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46588:162"/>
by <hi>Caſſian</hi> even in his time,<note place="margin">De inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. monach lib. 3. c. 7. p. 26.</note> for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the Congregation.) Hence it
was that the whole Service from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of it till the time that the <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
were <hi>diſmiſſed</hi> came to be called
<hi>Miſſa Catechumenorum,</hi> the <hi>Maſs</hi> or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> as that which
was performed afterwards at the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was called
<hi>Miſſa Fidelium,</hi> the <hi>Maſs</hi> or Service of
the <hi>Faithful,</hi> becauſe none but they were
preſent at it; and in theſe notions and
no other the word is often to be met
with in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and other ancient
Writers of the Church; 'tis true, that
in proceſs of time, as the diſcipline of
the <hi>Catechumens</hi> wore out, ſo that title
which belonged to the firſt part of the
Service was forgotten, and the name
<hi>miſſa</hi> was appropriated to the Service of
the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and accordingly was
made uſe of by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
denote that which they peculiarly call
the <hi>Maſs</hi> or the <hi>propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice of
the <hi>Altar</hi> at this day: and the more
plauſibly to impoſe this deluſion upon
the people, they do with a great deal
of confidence muſter up all thoſe places
of the Fathers where the word <hi>miſſa</hi> is
to be found, and apply it to their <hi>Maſs;</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:46588:163"/>
though it would puzle them to produce
but one place, where the word is uſed
in the ſame ſenſe as they uſe it now, out
of any genuine and approved Writer of
the Church for at leaſt the firſt four
hundred years. But to return, the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens,
&amp;c.</hi> being departed, and the
Church doors ſhut, they proceeded to
the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> at which the <hi>Faithful</hi>
only might be preſent, wherein they
prayed for all ſtates and ranks of men,
gave the the <hi>Kiſs</hi> of charity, prayed for
<hi>conſecration</hi> of the Euchariſt, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the ſacramental Elements, made
their Offerings, and ſuch like; of which
I do not now ſpeak particularly, becauſe
I intend to treat diſtinctly of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
afterwards: for the ſame reaſon
I ſay nothing concerning their <hi>admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

theſe will come under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in another place, as alſo becauſe though
managed at their publick Aſſemblies,
were yet only accidental to them, and
no ſetled parts of the Divine Service.
This in ſhort was the general form of
publick Worſhip in thoſe ancient times,
which although it might vary ſomewhat
according to times and places, did yet for
the main and the ſubſtance of it hold in all.</p>

That which remains, is a little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque
how the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the diſcharge of theſe ſolemn
duties, which certainly was with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> ſuch <hi>geſtures</hi>

Let our <hi>ſpeech</hi> in prayer (ſays <hi>Cyprian)</hi>
be under diſcipline,<note place="margin">Dom. p. 188.</note> obſerving a <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
calmneſs and modeſty; we are to
remember that we are under the eye of
God, whom we are not to offend either
in the <hi>habit</hi> of our body, or the <hi>manner</hi>
of our ſpeech; for as 'tis the faſhion of
thoſe that are impudent to clamour and
make a noiſe, ſo on the contrary it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a ſober man to pray with a <hi>modeſt</hi>
voice: when therefore we come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with our brethren into the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
to celebrate the divine <hi>Sacrifices</hi>
with the Miniſter of God, we ought to
be mindful of <hi>order</hi> and a reverent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
and not to throw about our
prayers with a <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>confuſed</hi> voice,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46588:164"/>
or with a diſorderly prattling to caſt
forth thoſe petitions, which ought with
the greateſt modeſty to be put up to
God. The men prayed with their <hi>heads
bare,</hi> as not aſhamed to look up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for what they begged of God; the
women <hi>covered,</hi> as a ſign of the <hi>modeſty</hi>
of that Sex, and therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
checks the practice of ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in his time, who in time of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
had no covering on their heads, or
what was as good as none; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
<hi>(ſays he)</hi> do they deſerve,<note place="margin">De Virg. Veland p. 504.</note> that
continue <hi>unvailed</hi> in ſinging Pſalms, or
in any mention of God; or do they
think it's enough to lay ſome thin and
ſlight thing over their heads in prayer,
and then think themſelves covered.
Where he manifeſtly refers to thoſe
rules which the <hi>Apostle</hi> preſcribes in this
caſe, and concludes at laſt, that they
ſhould at all times and in all places be
mindful of the rule, being ready and

of God, who if he be in womens <hi>hearts,</hi>
will be known on their <hi>heads, viz.</hi> by a
modeſt <hi>carriage</hi> and <hi>covering</hi> of them in
their addreſſes to him. Their hands they
did not only <hi>lift</hi> up to heaven (a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
in prayer common both among
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46588:164"/>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles)</hi> but they did <hi>expan</hi>
and ſpread them abroad, that ſo by this
means they might ſhadow out an <hi>image</hi>
of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or rather a reſemblance of
him that hung upon it,<note place="margin">De Orat. c. 11. Apol. c. 39.</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
more than once and again informs us:
Prayer <hi>(ſays another)</hi> is a converſing
with God,<note place="margin">Aſterius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſen.</note> and the way to heaven, and
to ſtretch out our hands is to form the
reſemblance of <hi>Chriſt crucified;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hom. de precat. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Phot.</note> which
whoever prays ſhould do, not only as
to the <hi>form</hi> and figure,<note place="margin">Cod. 271. col. 1496.</note> but in reality
and affection; for as he that is faſtned to
the Croſs ſurely dyes, ſo he that prays
ſhould <hi>crucifie</hi> the deſires of the fleſh,
and every inordinate luſt and paſſion. In
the performing of this duty, they either
<hi>kneeled,</hi> which was moſt uſual, or <hi>ſtood,</hi>
which they always did upon the <hi>Lords
day,</hi> for a reaſon which we have ſpoken
of before; fitting was ever held a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of great <hi>rudeneſs</hi> and <hi>irreverence;</hi>
nay <hi>Tertullian</hi> falls heavy upon ſome that
uſed preſently to <hi>clap</hi> themſelves down
upon their ſeats,<note place="margin">De Orat. c. 12. p. 134.</note> as ſoon as ever prayer
was done, and down-right charges it as
againſt <hi>Scripture;</hi> if it be an irreverent
thing (as he <hi>argues)</hi> to ſit down before,
or over againſt a perſon for whom thou
haſt a mighty reverence and veneration;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46588:165"/>
how much more does it ſavour of <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
to do ſo in the preſence of the
<hi>living God,</hi> while the <hi>Angel</hi> is yet ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by thee to carry up the prayer to
heaven, unleſs we have a mind to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi>
God to his face, and tell him that
we are weary of the duty.</p>
               <p>Another cuſtom which they had in
prayer was, that they conſtantly prayed
towards the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> this was ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
common, that there's ſcarce any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46588:165"/>
the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of it was, that hereby they
reſpected <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which God planted

might be reſtored to that ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

               <head type="sub">Of Baptiſm, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of it in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Four circumſtances conſidered. Baptiſm by
whom adminiſtred. By none uſually
without the leave of the Biſhop. The
great controverſie about re-baptizing
thoſe that had been baptized by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
An account of it out of <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
Laymen how ſuffered to baptize. The
opinion of the abſolute neceſſity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
The caſe of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
when but a Child. Women never
permitted to baptize. Perſons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
who. Infants. Sufficient evidence
for Infant-baptiſm in the ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Church. Some paſsages out of
<hi>Cyprian</hi> noted. The baptized moſt-what
adult perſons. The ſtated times of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> and why.
Eſpecially upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eve, and why. In
caſes of neceſſity at any other time. <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici,</hi>
who. Clinic-baptiſm accounted leſs
perfect, why. Vſual to defer Baptiſm till
a death-bed: and the reaſon of it: noted
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46588:168"/>
in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and others. <hi>Being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for the dead,</hi> what (probably.) The
uſual place of Baptiſm in or near the
Church; always before the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>Baptiſterium</hi> or Font where it
ſtood, and how large. Its distinct apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for men and women. A curioſity
in many in thoſe times of being baptized
in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and why. The manner of the
Adminiſtration. The perſon baptized
looked towards the Weſt, and why. Their
anſwering as to the profeſſion of their
faith. Their ſolemn abrenunciation made
twice; and the form of it. Sureties in
Baptiſm. Perſons baptized exorciſed;
what meant by it. Vnction upon what
account uſed; ſeveral reaſons of it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by the Fathers. The ſign of the
Croſs made in Baptiſm, evident out of
the ancient Fathers. Of immerſion, or
putting the perſon under water: what it
ſhadowed out. Generally in uſe in thoſe
Countries, not abſolutely neceſſary in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Trine immerſion: different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of it aſſigned by the Fathers. It
obtained not in <hi>Spain,</hi> and why. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Vnction. Perſons after Baptiſm
clothed in white garments, and why.
Theſe kept in the Church as a teſtimony
of their ſolemn engagement: a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46588:169"/>
instance out of <hi>Victor Uticenſis.</hi> A
brief account of confirmation: the neglect
of it bewailed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OUR Lord having inſtituted <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> as
the two great <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Law, they have accordingly been
ever accounted principal parts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip in the Chriſtian Church;
we ſhall treat firſt of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as being
the <hi>door</hi> by which perſons enter in, the
great and ſolemn rite of our initiation
into the faith of Chriſt; concerning
which, four circumſtances are chiefly to
be enquired into; the <hi>perſons</hi> by and
upon whom; the <hi>time</hi> when, the <hi>place</hi>
where, the <hi>manner</hi> how this Sacrament
was adminiſtred in the ancient Church.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>perſons</hi> by whom this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was adminiſtred, they were the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, the <hi>Stewards of
the myſteries of Christ,</hi> baptizing and
preaching the Goſpel being joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
uſually 'twas done by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>J. Martyr,</hi> the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi>
in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the <hi>Preſident</hi> or chief

him, without whoſe leave and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
neither <hi>Presbyters</hi> nor <hi>Deacons</hi> might
take upon them to <hi>baptize,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Smyrnaeos. p. 6.</note> as not only
<hi>Ignatius</hi> but <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſly tells us,
and if they did,<note place="margin">De Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. c. 17. p. 230.</note> it was only in caſe of
neceſſity, as is affirmed by an ancient
Author who lived in or near the time
of <hi>Cyprian:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiz. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Cypr. p. 138.</note> the ſame S. <hi>Hierom</hi> aſſures
us was the cuſtom in his time, though
otherwhiles we find the Biſhop to begin
the action,<note place="margin">Dial. adv. Lucifer. p. 139.</note> and the Presbyters to carry
it on and finiſh it.<note place="margin">Ambr. de Sacram. l. 3. c. 1.</note> But as Chriſtianity
encreaſed, this became a more familiar
part of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and the <hi>Deacons</hi>
office, and doubtleſs had been more or
leſs executed by them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
though out of reverence to the
Biſhop, and to preſerve the <hi>honour</hi> of
the Church (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
they did it not without his <hi>leave</hi>
and deputation, and 'tis certain that
<hi>Philip</hi> baptized the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who yet
was of no higher order than that of
<hi>Deacon.</hi> Nor was it accounted enough
by ſome in thoſe times, that Baptiſm was
conferred by a perſon called to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
unleſs he was alſo <hi>orthodox</hi> in
the Faith. This became matter of great
buſtle in the Church; hence ſprang that
famous controverſie between <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:46588:170"/>
and <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning
the <hi>re-baptizing</hi> thoſe that had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by <hi>Hereticks</hi> (of which there is ſo
much in <hi>Cyprians</hi> Writings) <hi>Cyprian</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
that they ought to be re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
the other as ſtifly maintaining it to
be both againſt the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>practice</hi>
of the Church. This begot great heats
and feuds between thoſe good men, and
engaged a great part of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church in the quarrel, <hi>Cyprian</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to ſtrengthen his cauſe not
only by arguments from <hi>Scripture,</hi> but
by calling a Council at <hi>Carthage</hi> of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeven <hi>African Biſhops,</hi> who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
for his opinion. How truly <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
maintained this, I am not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to enquire; only I take notice of
two things which he and his Followers
pleaded by way of abatement to the <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi>
of their opinion.<note place="margin">Cypr. Ep. ad Quint. de Haeret. bap. Ep. 71. p. 119. &amp; Concil.</note> Firſt that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they did not aſſert <hi>re-baptization</hi> to
be lawful, this they expreſly deny to
receive any patronage from their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,<note place="margin">Carth. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Cypr. ſenten. 35. p. 286.</note>
for they looked upon that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
that had been conferred by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
as <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid</hi> (ſeeing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
being out of the Church could not
<hi>give</hi> what they <hi>had</hi> not) and therefore
when any returned to the union of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46588:170"/>
Church they could not properly be ſaid
to be re-baptized, ſeeing they did but
receive what <hi>(lawfully)</hi> they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<note place="margin">Cypr. ibid. &amp; Conc. Carthag. ſentent. 8. &amp; Cyrill. praef. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. ad il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumin. p. 9.</note>
Secondly, that they did not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly</hi>
baptize all that came over
from heretical Churches, for where any
had been lawfully baptized by <hi>Orthodox</hi>
Miniſters before their going over to
them, theſe they received at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
without any other Ceremony than
<hi>impoſition</hi> of hands; baptizing thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
who never had any other baptiſm than
that which Hereticks had conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. <hi>Cyprian</hi> being thus ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
baptiſm diſpenſed by <hi>heretical</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
we may wonder what he thought
of that which was adminiſtred by meer
<hi>lay-unordained</hi> perſons, which yet was
not uncommon in thoſe times: for that
Lay-men (provided they were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and baptized themſelves) might and
did baptize others in caſes of neceſſity,
is ſo poſitively aſſerted by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Locis antea citat.</note>
                  <hi>Hierom,</hi> and others, that no man can
doubt of it. A cuſtom ratified by the
Fathers of the <hi>Illiberine</hi> Council,<note place="margin">Can. 38.</note> with
this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that if the perſons ſo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
lived, they ſhould receive <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
from the Biſhop. This without
queſtion aroſe from an opinion they had
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46588:171"/>
of the abſolute and indiſpenſable <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
of Baptiſm, without which they ſcarce
thought a mans future condition could
be ſafe, and that therefore 'twas better
it ſhould be had from <hi>any,</hi> than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this life without it; for excepting
the caſe of <hi>Martyrs</hi> (whom they thought
ſufficiently qualified for heaven by being
<hi>baptized</hi> in their own <hi>blood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyrill. ad Illuminat. Catech. 3. p. 61.</note> inſiſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a twofold Baptiſm, one of <hi>water</hi> in
time of peace, another of <hi>blood</hi> in the
time of perſecution, anſwerable to the
<hi>water</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> that flowed out of our
<hi>Saviours</hi> ſide: excepting theſe) they
reckoned no man could be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being baptized, and cared not much
in caſes of neceſſity, ſo they had it, how
they came by it. As for that act of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>
(mentioned by the Author of
his life in <hi>Photius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cod. 258. col. 1429.</note> and more largely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by <hi>Sozomen)</hi> when a Boy play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the reſt of his Companions,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. lib. 2. c. 17. p. 467.</note>
they formed themſelves into a kind of
Church-ſociety; <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was choſen
Biſhop, and others perſonated the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi>
ready to be baptized, and were
accordingly with all the uſual formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
baptized by <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> This juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile
Ceremony being ended, they were
brought before <hi>Alexander</hi> the then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46588:171"/>
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (who had himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the whole <hi>ſcene)</hi> who enquiring
into the reaſons and circumſtances of the
action, and having conſulted with his
Clergy that were about him, concluded
that thoſe Children ought not to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized,</hi>
and therefore only added his
confirmation to them. But this being
only a particular caſe, and the like not
mentioned that I remember by any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of thoſe times, I only relate it as I
find it. But though this power in caſes
of neceſſity was allowed to <hi>men</hi> (who
were capable of having the miniſterial
office conferred upon them) yet was it
ever denied to <hi>women,</hi> whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
has ſo expreſly forbidden to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
any miniſtry <hi>in the Church of God,</hi>
and accordingly cenſured in the <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical

and others, who records the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46588:172"/>
heretical doctrines and practices of thoſe
firſt Ages of the Church; however af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
it crept in in ſome places, and
is allowed and practiſed in the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day: where in caſes of
neceſſity they give leave that it may be
adminiſtred by any, and in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
whether the perſon adminiſtring
be a <hi>Clergie</hi> or a <hi>Lay-man</hi> (yea though
under <hi>excommunication)</hi> whether he be
a <hi>Believer</hi> or an <hi>Infidel,</hi> a <hi>Catholick</hi> or
an <hi>Heretick,</hi> a <hi>man</hi> or a <hi>woman;</hi> only
taking care, that if it may be, a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
be preferred before a <hi>Deacon,</hi> a <hi>Deacon</hi>
before a <hi>Subdeacon,</hi> a <hi>Clergie</hi> man before
a <hi>Laic,</hi> and a <hi>man</hi> before a <hi>woman;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with ſome other caſes which are
there wiſely provided for.</p>
               <p>From the perſons <hi>miniſtring</hi> we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the <hi>perſons</hi> upon whom it was
<hi>conferred,</hi> and they were of two ſorts,
<hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>adult</hi> perſons: how far the
baptizing of Infants is included in our
<hi>Saviours</hi> inſtitution is not my work to
diſpute; but certainly if in controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
caſes the conſtant practice of the
Church, and thoſe who immediately
ſucceeded the Apoſtles be (as no man
can deny it is) the beſt interpreter of
the Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the diſpute one
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46588:172"/>
would think ſhould be at an end: for
that it always was the cuſtom to receive
the Children of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents into
the Church by Baptiſm, we have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
evidence from the greateſt part of
the moſt early Writers,<note place="margin">J. G. Voſſ. de bapt. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſput. 14. p. 178. &amp; ſeq.</note> 
                  <hi>Irenaeus, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
Origen, Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
I do not produce, becauſe I find
them collected by others,<note place="margin">Forbes. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct. Hist. Theol. lib. 10. c. 5. ſect. 14. &amp; ſeq.</note> and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thence ſo forcible and concluſive,
that the moſt zealous oppoſers of <hi>Infant
Baptiſm</hi> know not how to evade it; the
teſtimonies being ſo clear,<note place="margin">Dr. Ham. Defen. of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. c. 4. ſect. 2.</note> and not the
leaſt ſhadow that I know of in thoſe
times of any thing to make againſt it.
There was indeed in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time a
controverſie about the baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
not <hi>whether</hi> they ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
(for of that there was no doubt)
but concerning the <hi>time</hi> when it was to
be adminiſtred, whether on the <hi>ſecond</hi>
or <hi>third,</hi> or whether as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of
old to be deferred till the <hi>eighth</hi> day:
for the determining of which, <hi>Cyprian</hi>
ſitting in Council with ſixty ſix Biſhops,
writes a <hi>Synodical</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Fidus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 60. p. 97.</note> to
let him know, that it was not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be deferred ſo long, and that it
was their univerſal judgment and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
that the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46588:173"/>
was not to be denied to any, though as
ſoon as he was <hi>born:</hi> concluding, that
it was the ſentence of the Council, that
none ought to be forbidden baptiſm and
the grace of God; which as it was to be
obſerved and reteined towards all men,
ſo <hi>much more</hi> towards <hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi>
Children;<note place="margin">Epiſt. 28. ad Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nym: tom. 2. col. 108.</note> and that this ſentence
of theirs was no <hi>novel</hi> doctrine S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
aſſures us, where ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this <hi>Synodical</hi> determination, he
tells us, that in this <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not make
any new decree, but kept the <hi>Faith</hi> of
the Church moſt firm and ſure. I ſhall
only taken notice of one place more out
of <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De lapſis p. 171.</note> which methinks evidently
makes for this purpoſe, where deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great wickedneſs and miſerable
condition of the <hi>lapſed,</hi> ſuch as to avoid
perſecution had done ſacrifice to the
Idols, he urges this as one of the laſt
and higheſt aggravations, that by their
apoſtaſie their Infants and Children were
expoſed to ruine, and <hi>had loſt that
which they had obtained at their firſt
coming into the world</hi> (which whether
he means it of their <hi>right</hi> to Baptiſm, or
their having been actually baptized, and
loſing the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
is all one to my purpoſe) and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46588:173"/>
therefore he brings them in thus elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleading againſt their <hi>Parents</hi> at the
great day. '<hi>Twas no fault of ours, we did
not of our ſelves forſake the Sacraments
of our Lord, and run over to join with
prophane impieties; the unfaithfulneſs of
others has undone us, we have found our
Parents to be murderers; they denied us
God for our Father, and the Church for
our Mother; for while we alas were little,
unable to take any care of our ſelves, and
ignorant of ſo great a wickedneſs, we were
enſnared by the treachery of others, and
by them betrayed into a partnerſhip of their
impieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the caſe of Infants, but thoſe
who made up the main body of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in thoſe days, were <hi>adult</hi> perſons,
who flocking over daily in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to the faith of Chriſt, were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in at this door: uſually they were
for ſome conſiderable time <hi>catechized,</hi>
and trained up in the principles of the
Chriſtian Faith, till having given teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their proficiency in knowledge
(to the Biſhop or Presbyter,<note place="margin">Conc. Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. Can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 46.</note> who were
appointed to take their examination,
and to whom they were to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
once a week of what they had
learnt) and of a ſober and regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46588:174"/>
they then became <hi>Candidates</hi>
for Baptiſm, and were accordingly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in, which brings me to the next cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
conſiderable concerning</p>
               <p>The <hi>Time</hi> when Baptiſm was wont to
be adminiſtred: at firſt all times were
alike, and perſons were baptized as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
and occaſion ſerved; but the
diſcipline of the Church being a little
ſetled, it began to be reſtrained to two
ſolemn and ſtated times of the year, <hi>viz.

baptized, being <hi>immerſed</hi> or put under

obſerve, that in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Age Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
was adminiſtred with great naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſimplicity, probably without
any more formality than a ſhort prayer,
and repeating the words of inſtitution,
and indeed it could not well be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
conſidering the vaſt numbers that
many times were then baptized at once.

and an <hi>inſufflation</hi> or breathing in
the face of the perſon baptized (which
S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> calls a moſt ancient <hi>tradition</hi>

the expelling of the evil ſpirit,<note place="margin">De nupt. &amp; concup. lib. 2. c. 29. tom. 7. col. 856.</note> and the
breathing in the good Spirit of God:

any ſtreſs upon the bare uſage of thoſe
Symbolick Rites, but wholly upon

deliver thoſe perſons from the power

               <p>The action having proceeded thus far,
the party to be baptized was wholly
<hi>immerged</hi> or put under water, which was
the almoſt conſtant and univerſal cuſtom
of thoſe times, whereby they did more
notably and ſignificantly expreſs the
<hi>three great ends and effects</hi> of Baptiſm;
for as in immerſion there are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
three ſeveral acts, the <hi>putting</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
into water, his <hi>abiding</hi> there for a
little time, and his <hi>riſing</hi> up again; ſo
by theſe were repreſented Chriſts <hi>death,
burial,</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> and in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
thereunto our <hi>dying</hi> unto ſin, the
<hi>deſtruction</hi> of its power, and our <hi>reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
to a new courſe of life; by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
being put into water was lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the putting off the body of
the ſins of the fleſh, and being waſhed
from the filth and pollution of them:
by his abode under it, which was a kind
of burial in the water, his entring into a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46588:181"/>
ſtate of death or mortification, like as
<hi>Chriſt</hi> remained for ſome time under the
ſtate or power of death, therefore <hi>as
many as are baptized into Chriſt,</hi> are ſaid
<hi>to be baptized into his death, and to be
buried with him by Baptiſm into death,
that the old man being crucified with him,
the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that
henceforth he might not ſerve ſin, for that
he that is dead is freed from ſin,</hi> as the
Apoſtle clearly explains the meaning of
this rite: and then by his <hi>emerſion,</hi> or
riſing up out of the water, was ſignified
his entring upon a new courſe of life,
differing from that which he lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>that like as Chriſt was raiſed up
from the dead by the glory of the Father,
even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of
life.</hi> But though by reaſon of the more
eminent ſignificancy of theſe things, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion</hi>
was the common practice in thoſe
days, and therefore they earneſtly urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it and pleaded for it, yet did they
not hold <hi>ſprinkling</hi> to be unlawful, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in caſes of neceſſity, as of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
danger of death, or where conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of immerging could not be had,
in theſe and ſuch like caſes <hi>Cyprian</hi> does
not only allow,<note place="margin">Ep. 76. ad Magn. p. 153.</note> but plead for it, and
that in a diſcourſe on purpoſe, when
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46588:182"/>
the queſtion concerning it was put to
him. Upon this account it is that immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is now generally diſuſed in theſe
parts of the world, and ſprinkling ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in its room, becauſe the tender
bodies of moſt Infants (the only perſons
now baptized) could not be put under
water in theſe cold <hi>Northern</hi> Climates
without apparent prejudice to their
health, if not their lives; and therefore
in this as in other caſes, <hi>God requires
mercy rather than ſacrifice,</hi> eſpecially
conſidering that the main ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
are attained this way, and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
effects of it as <hi>truly,</hi> though not ſo
<hi>plainly</hi> and ſignificantly repreſented, by
ſprinkling, as by putting the body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

But though this cuſtom was in a
manner univerſal, yet in ſome places (in
after times eſpecially) it was otherwiſe,
particularly in <hi>Spain,</hi> where they uſed
it but <hi>once,</hi> leſt they ſhould gratifie the

to be three diſtinct <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> and
gloried that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> did, and held
the ſame with them. Upon this account
they were content to immerge but once;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46588:183"/>
and when differences and controverſies
did ſtill remain about it, the fourth
Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> out of a Letter of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the <hi>great</hi> thus determined the caſe,<note place="margin">Can. 5.</note>
that they ſhould ſtill uſe their <hi>ſingle</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion,
and that this would ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſs the myſteries of Baptiſm, the

of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> party: amongſt others

beſpake him before all the people:
<hi>Theſe, Elpidophorus, thou miniſter of error,

thou cameſt pure out of the holy Font; and
theſe are they that ſhall bitterly purſue thee
when thou ſhalt be caſt into the place of

with curſing, as with a Garment, and
haſt cast off the ſacred obligation of thy

Theſeſe were the main and moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
circumſtances wherewith <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
was adminiſtred in the primitive Church;
ſome whereof were by degrees anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated

were that belonged only to particular
Churches, and which, as they were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
taken up, ſo were as quickly laid
aſide; others were added in after-times,
till they encreaſed ſo faſt, that the uſage

               <p>As a concluſion to this Chapter, I had

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46588:185"/>
diſcourſes, that nothing conſiderable can
be added to them; only I ſhall give this
brief and general account of it: all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
baptized in the ancient Church (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their age and capacity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<hi>adult,</hi> ſome little time after Baptiſm,
<hi>Children,</hi> when arrived to years of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
ripeneſs and maturity) were
brought to the Biſhop, there further to
<hi>confirm</hi> and ratifie that <hi>compact</hi> which
they had made with God in Baptiſm,
and by ſome ſolemn acts of his miniſtry
to be themſelves <hi>confirmed</hi> and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by having the <hi>grace</hi> and bleſſing
of God conferred upon them, to enable
them to diſcharge that great promiſe and
engagement which they had made to
God. This was uſually performed with
the Ceremony of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> the perſon
confirmed being anointed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
or in his abſence by an inferiour
Miniſter; and indeed Unction was an
ancient rite uſed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church
to denote the conferring of gifts or
graces upon perſons, and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
amongſt other reaſons (as many
other uſages were) might be derived
into the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church;<note place="margin">Hen. Valeſ. Annot. ad Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. p. 135. col. 1.</note> though a
<hi>learned</hi> man is of opinion, that <hi>unction</hi>
was never uſed in <hi>confirmation,</hi> but
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46588:185"/>
where the perſon being in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
baptized by ſome of the inferior
Clergy had not been before anointed;
otherwiſe thoſe who had received com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Baptiſm, were not afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
at their confirmation, for which
the Council of <hi>Orange</hi> is moſt expreſs
and clear.<note place="margin">Can. 1.</note> And indeed that Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was often adminiſtred without this
<hi>unction,</hi> no man can doubt that knows
the ſtate of thoſe times, being done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by ſolemn <hi>impoſition</hi> of the Biſhops
hands, and by devout and pious prayers,
that the perſons confirmed might <hi>grow in
grace and the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and be
enabled to perform thoſe vows and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and that profeſſion of Faith which
they had before embraced in Baptiſm,
and then again owned before the whole
Congregation. Till this was done, they
were not accounted <hi>compleat Chriſtians,</hi>
nor admitted to the holy <hi>Communion,</hi>
nor could challenge any actual right to
thoſe great priviledges of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
whence it is that the Ancients ſo often
ſpeak of Confirmation as that which did

The perſons Communicating, the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
or the Faithful: Suſpenſion from
this Ordinance according to the nature
of the offence. The Euchariſt ſent home
to them that could not be preſent. The
caſe of <hi>Serapion.</hi> A cuſtom in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to give the Sacrament to perſons
when dead, if they dyed before they
could receive it, and why. The Euchariſt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46588:186"/>
kept by perſons at home. Sent abroad.
This laid aſide, and in its ſtead <hi>Eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae</hi>
or pieces of conſecrated Bread ſent
from one Church to another, as tokens
of communion. The time of its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration:
ſometimes in the morning,
ſometimes at night: varied according
to the peace they enjoyed. How oft they
received the Eucharist. At firſt every
day. This continued in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time.
Four times a week. Afterwards leſs
frequented. The uſual place of receiving,
the Church: ordinarily, not lawful to
conſecrate it elſewhere. Oblations made
by perſons before their communicating.
Their <hi>Agapae</hi> or Love-Feaſts what. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before or after the Sacrament. How
long continued in the Church. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of celebrating this Sacrament, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out of the moſt ancient Authors.
The holy Kiſs. The general prayer for
the Church, and the whole world. The
conſecration of the Sacrament: the form
of it out of S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> The Bread
common Bread. The ſacramental Wine
mixed with Water. This no neceſſary
part of the inſtitution. Why probably
uſed in thoſe Countries. The poſture of
receiving not always the ſame. Singing
Pſalms during the time of celebration.

Followed with prayer and thanksgiving.
The whole action concluded with the
Kiſs of peace.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> or <hi>Supper</hi> of
our <hi>Lord</hi> being a rite ſo ſolemnly
inſtituted, and of ſuch great importance
in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion had place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
amongſt the Ancients in their
<hi>publick</hi> offices and devotions. In ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which I ſhall much what obſerve
the ſame method I did in treating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> conſidering the <hi>perſons,</hi>
the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>place,</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> of its
celebration. The <hi>perſons</hi> adminiſtring
were the ordinary <hi>Paſtors</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the Church, thoſe who were
ſet apart for the miniſtration of holy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
the inſtitution was begun by our
<hi>Lord</hi> himſelf, and the adminiſtration of
it by him committed to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and
to their ordinary ſucceſſors, to the end
of the world.<note place="margin">De Cor. mil c. 3. p. 102.</note> We find in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that
they never received it from any but the
hand of the <hi>Preſident;</hi> which muſt either
be meant of the particular cuſtom of
that <hi>Church</hi> where he lived, or of <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration</hi>
only; for otherwiſe the cuſtom
was when the <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Preſident</hi> had by
ſolemn Prayers and bleſſings conſecrated
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46588:187"/>
the ſacramental elements, for the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
to diſtribute them to the people,
as well to thoſe that were abſent as to
them that were preſent,<note place="margin">Apol. 2. p. 97.</note> as <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
expreſly affirms, and as the cuſtom
generally was afterwards. For the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
communicating</hi> at this Sacrament, at
firſt the <hi>whole</hi> Church, or body of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
within ſuch a ſpace, that had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the doctrine of the Goſpel, and
been baptized into the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
uſed conſtantly to meet together at the
<hi>Lords</hi> Table. As Chriſtians multiplied,
and a more exact diſcipline became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
none were admitted to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
till they had arrived at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> for who ever were
in the ſtate of the <hi>Catechumens, i. e.</hi> under
inſtruction in order to their Baptiſm, or by
reaſon of any hainous crime under the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi>
and ſuſpenſion of the Church, and
not yet paſſed through the ſeveral ſtages
of the <hi>Penitents,</hi> might not communicate,
and were therefore commanded to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi>
the Church, when the reſt went to
the celebration of the Sacrament: for
looking upon the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> as the
higheſt and moſt ſolemn act of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they thought they could never take
care enough in the diſpenſing of it; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46588:188"/>
who ever was found guilty
of any <hi>ſcandalous</hi> fault, was according to
the nature of the offence debarred the
Communion a ſhorter or a longer time,
and ſometimes all their life, not to be
reconciled and taken into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church, till they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
their repentance to their death-bed.
As for thoſe perſons that could not
be preſent, either through diſtance of
place, ſickneſs, or any other juſt cauſe,
the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was wont to be ſent <hi>home</hi>
to them, ſome little pieces of the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi>
bread <hi>dipt</hi> in the ſacramental <hi>Cup,</hi>
which were uſually carried by the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
or ſome inferior Officer of the
Church, or in caſes of neceſſity by any
other perſon; as in the caſe of <hi>Serapion,</hi>
of whom <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> relates,<note place="margin">Apud Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. l. 6. c. 44. p. 246.</note>
that having been all his life a good man,
at laſt <hi>lapſed</hi> in a time of perſecution,
and though he oft deſired reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet none would communicate with
him; not long after he was ſeized upon
by a mortal ſickneſs, depriv'd of the
uſe of his ſpeech and ſenſes, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to himſelf after four days, he ſends
his Nephew a little Boy late at night for
one of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to come to him;
the Miniſter was at that time ſick, but
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46588:188"/>
conſidering the exigence of the caſe,
gives the Boy a little piece of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi>
bids him to <hi>moiſten</hi> it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
water, and ſo give it him in his
mouth, which he did, and immediately
the old man chearfully departed this
life. For the better underſtanding of
which, we are to obſerve, that thoſe
who had lapſed into Idolatry, were to
undergo a very long time of penance,
and were not many times admitted to
the Communion, till they were near
their death; and becauſe it ſometimes
hapned that they were overtaken with
ſudden death, before the Sacrament
could be adminiſtred to them, thence a
cuſtom ſprung up to give it them <hi>after</hi>
they were <hi>dead,</hi> which they did doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
upon this ground, that they might
give ſome kind of evidence, that thoſe
perſons died in the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>communion</hi>
of the Church,<note place="margin">Vid. Conc. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

carrying the Sacramental Elements up

               <p>For the <hi>Time,</hi> the next circumſtance,
when they met together for this ſolemn
Action, it was in general at their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Aſſemblies, on the <hi>Lords day</hi> always
or the firſt day of the week, as we find
it in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Apoſtles Acts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

on which day all the Churches in

Sacrament,<note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 5 c. 22. p. 286.</note> as the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> informs us.
What time of the day they took to do
it, is not altogether ſo certain; our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

it at <hi>night</hi> at the time of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;

but whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their

'tis probable that the holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
was ſolemnized in the <hi>morning,</hi>

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſures us in his time 'twas

they held their religious Aſſemblies, of
which <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo takes notice in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

yea and upon other days too, if

and the commonneſs of the thing
begat ſome contempt <hi>(Manna</hi> it ſelf was
<hi>ſlighted,</hi> after once it was rained down

for the moſt part to <hi>thrice a year</hi> at the

               <p>Concerning the third circumſtance,
the <hi>Place</hi> where this holy Supper was
kept, much need not be ſaid, it being a
main part of their publick Worſhip al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
performed in the place of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Aſſemblies. 'Twas inſtituted by
our <hi>Saviour</hi> in a private <hi>houſe,</hi> becauſe
of its <hi>Analogie</hi> to the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> and
becauſe the neceſſity of that time would
not otherwiſe admit; by the Apoſtles

in the houſes of Believers, generally
in an <hi>upper room,</hi> ſet apart by the bounty

their <hi>Cryptae</hi> or <hi>Vaults</hi> under ground, and
to celebrate this Sacrament at the <hi>Tombs</hi>
of Martyrs, and over the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of the

were deſigned to the uſes of the

out of them were taken the <hi>Bread</hi>
and the <hi>Wine</hi> for the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the bread being no other than
<hi>common</hi> bread, ſuch as ſerved for their
ordinary uſes, there being then no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
taken of what has for ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, and ſtill is to this day fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſputed between the <hi>Greek</hi> and the
<hi>Latine</hi> Church, whether it ought to be
leavened or unleavened bread. Out of
theſe oblations alſo 'tis probable they
took (at leaſt ſent proviſions extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary)
to furniſh the <hi>common Feaſt,</hi> which
in thoſe days they conſtantly had at the
celebration of the Sacrament, where the
rich and the poor feaſted together at the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46588:193"/>
ſame Table. Theſe were called <hi>Agapae</hi> or
<hi>Love-feaſts</hi> (mentioned by S. <hi>Jude,</hi> and
plainly enough intimated by S. <hi>Paul)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hereat they teſtified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their mutual <hi>love</hi> and kindneſs, a
thing never more proper than at the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper; which is
not only a <hi>Seal</hi> of our <hi>peace</hi> with God,
but a <hi>ſign</hi> and a pledge of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

Whether this Banquet was <hi>before</hi> or <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is
not eaſie to determine; 'tis probable,
that in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, and the Age af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, it was <hi>before</hi> it, in imitation of

                  <hi>That when they came
together for the Lords Supper, they did not
one tarry for another, but every one took his

and exceſs, ſome eating and
drinking all they brought, others (the

nothing left, <hi>one being hungry and

which was never adminiſtred till
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46588:193"/>
the wole Church met together. That
therefore which the <hi>Apostle</hi> reproves and

commanding both rich and poor
to <hi>wait for one another,</hi> and to eat this
common meal together, that they might
the more orderly and unanimouſly paſs
to the celebration of the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper.
In after Ages this Feaſt was not till the
Communion was over, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
feaſted together, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,<note place="margin">Homil. 27. in 1. ad Corinth. p. 559.</note>
and ſo <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expreſly tells
us 'twas in his days; beſides, nothing is
more obvious, than that it was cuſtomary
in thoſe times for perſons to <hi>faſt,</hi> till
they had received the Communion. I
know a very learned man is of opinion,<note place="margin">Albaſ. de rit. Eccleſ. obſ. 18. p. 135.</note>
that theſe <hi>Love-feaſts</hi> were not kept at the

but beſides that his Arguments
are not concluſive, the whole ſtream
of learned Writers runs full againſt him.
Theſe Feaſts continued for ſome Ages,
till great inconveniences being found in
them they were prohibited to be kept in
Churches by the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Synod,<note place="margin">Can. 28.</note> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Vertues, for which the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians

To begin with the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humility</hi> is a vertue that ſeems more
proper to the Goſpel; for though <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi>
now and then ſpake a few
good words concerning it; yet it found
no real entertainment in their lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generally <hi>animalia gloriae,</hi> creatures
pufft up with wind and emptineſs, and
that <hi>ſacrific'd</hi> only to their own praiſe
and honour: whereas the doctrines of
the <hi>Goſpel</hi> immediately tend to level all
proud and ſwelling apprehenſions, to
plant the world with mildneſs and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
and to <hi>cloath men with humility,
and the ornament of a meek and a quiet
ſpirit:</hi> By theſe we are taught to dwell
at home, and to converſe more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
with our ſelves, to be acquainted
with our own deficiencies and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and rather to admire <hi>others</hi>
than to advance <hi>our ſelves:</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
notion of Humility lies in a low
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46588:199"/>
and mean <hi>eſtimation</hi> of our ſelves, and
an anſwerable carriage towards others,
<hi>not thinking of our ſelves more highly than
we ought to think,</hi> nor being unwilling
that other men ſhould value us at the
ſame rate. Now that this was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſpirit of <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity</hi>
will appear, if we conſider how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
they proteſted againſt all <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
and vain-glorious deſigns, how
chearfully they condeſcended to the
<hi>meaneſt</hi> Offices and Imployments, how
ſtudiouſly they declin'd all advantages
of <hi>applauſe</hi> and credit, how ready they
were rather to <hi>give</hi> praiſe to others
than to <hi>take</hi> it to themſelves, <hi>in honour
preferring one another.</hi>

of arrogancy and pride, although

in great meekneſs and humility of mind,
appearing in the world without any

ſhould be deſired,</hi> ſuffering himſelf <hi>to be
deſpiſed and rejected of men, who eſteemed
him not, and hid as it were their faces
from him; who counted himſelf a worm
and no man, and was accordingly made a
reproach of men, and the deriſion of the
people; all they that ſaw him, laughing him
to ſcorn, ſhooting out the lip and ſhaking
the head at him.</hi> Now if our Lord
himſelf was ſo humble-minded, what
ſhould we be, who are come under the

which God ſent upon the world, what

they had no other concernment in this

why the Chriſtians were train'd
up in a defiance of all the ſports and
pleaſures of this life, that they might
be more willing to dye; and that the
cords being cut by which they were
tedder'd to this world, they might be
more nimble and expedite for their
paſſage hence. Their main deſigns were
intent upon the happineſs of another
world, and therefore they regarded
not what they went thorough to come
ſooner to it. Being inflamed (ſayes
<hi>Juſtin Martyr)</hi> with the deſire of a pure

that they ſhall attain to this ſtate, who
by their actions ſtudy to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to God that they follow after
him, and are heartily deſirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him in that life, where
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46588:215"/>
no malice or wickedneſs ſhall take
place. This was the mighty ſupport
they lean'd upon, the great cordial
with which they kept up their ſpirits
in thoſe ſad times of ſuffering and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
the firm <hi>belief</hi> and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they had of enjoying God in
a better life. They knew, that the
more haſt their enemies made to <hi>break
open the cage</hi> of their bodies, the ſooner
their ſouls would be at liberty to <hi>fly</hi> to
the regions of bleſſedneſs and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
And indeed ſo much were their
thoughts fixed upon this, ſo oft did they
uſe to comfort one another by diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
hereafter, that ſome of their
enemies over-hearing and miſtaking
them, accuſed them as <hi>treaſonable affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
of the <hi>Empire:</hi> when alas! (as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin

meant nothing leſs;<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 58.</note> which they might
know by this, that being brought to
tryal, they freely confeſſed themſelves
to be Chriſtians, though they certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knew they muſt <hi>dye</hi> for it: whereas
<hi>(ſays he)</hi> did we expect an <hi>humane

deny it, to avoid death, and ſo expect
a more <hi>convenient</hi> ſeaſon to accompliſh
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46588:216"/>
our deſigns; but ſince our hopes are
not placed in any thing in this world,
we regard not thoſe that take away
our lives, well knowing they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from us, but what we muſt needs
lay down our ſelves. It was their care
then continually to <hi>keep company</hi> with
<hi>dying</hi> thoughts, and to dwell within
the proſpect of eternity; it being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
true of all what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
reports of <hi>Marcella,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epitaph. Marcell. ad Princip. p. 119.</note> that ſhe
<hi>lived</hi> ſo, as alwayes believing that ſhe
ſhould immediately <hi>dye,</hi> and never put

               </p>
               <p>But beſides the influence which the

had upon them, there was one
thing which I doubt not did mightily
contribute to their being <hi>wean'd</hi> from
the world, and did ſtrongly animate
them to a quick and ſpeedy diligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the affairs of the other life, and
that was, the <hi>Opinion</hi> they generally
had of the <hi>day of judgment being near
at hand:</hi> An <hi>Opinion</hi> ſtarted early, as
appears by that caution which <hi>St. Paul</hi>
gives the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> about it;<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2, 3, 4.</note> and it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46588:216"/>
laſted for ſome Ages after, as is evident
from ſeveral paſſages in <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. de cult. foemin. lib. 2. c. 9. ad uxor. lib. 1. c. 5.</note> who
always improves it to this purpoſe, that
men ſhould not unneceſſarily <hi>encounter</hi>
themſelves with the affairs of this life,
but carry themſelves as thoſe that were
immediately paſſing hence. I conclude
with that of <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi> Chriſtians
<hi>(ſays he) dwell</hi> in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Diognet. p. 497.</note>
but as <hi>inmates</hi> and <hi>forreigners;</hi>
they have all things <hi>common</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men as <hi>fellow-Citizens,</hi> and yet
ſuffer all things as <hi>strangers</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners:</hi>
every <hi>forreign Region</hi> is their
<hi>Country,</hi> and every Country is <hi>forreign</hi>
to them: They <hi>marry</hi> like other men,
and beget children, but do not <hi>expoſe</hi>
or neglect their Off-ſpring; they <hi>feaſt</hi>
in common, but do not <hi>exceed</hi> like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men; they <hi>are in the fleſh,</hi> but do
not <hi>live after the fleſh;</hi> dwell upon
<hi>earth,</hi> but their <hi>converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Therefore he compares Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in this world to the <hi>ſoul</hi> in the
<hi>body,</hi> as for other reaſons, ſo eſpecially
for this, that as the ſoul lives <hi>in</hi> the

dwell <hi>in</hi> the world, but are not

to hide the leſs comly parts of the

thoſe injuries and extremities of the

Now to both theſe ends (he tells us)

in theſe reſpects men may uſe different

grants that in ſome caſes men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from the ſtrict rule and diſcipline
of this affair, and that ſuch women as
cannot otherwiſe gain upon their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,

               <p>Now that the <hi>ancient Christians</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd

                  <hi>Juſtin

the Chriſtians, tells him, that they
differ'd not from other men either in
their <hi>Country,</hi> or <hi>Speech,</hi> or the <hi>uſages</hi> of
the civil life; they dwell in their own
Cities, uſe the ſame language with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

are not in any thing affected or phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick;
but inhabiting partly amongſt
<hi>Greeks,</hi> partly in <hi>barbarous</hi> Cities, as
every ones lot is fallen, they follow
the cuſtomes of their Countrey; and
both in clothes and diet, and all other
affairs of outward life, ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

their diſcipline and converſation. I am
not ignorant of what ſome learned men
would have us to believe, that in thoſe

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:46588:220"/>
to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> they were wont to
<hi>change</hi> their <hi>habit,</hi> to leave off the <hi>Toga</hi>
or <hi>Gown</hi> (the common habit almoſt in
all parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) and to
<hi>take</hi> up the <hi>Pallium</hi> or <hi>Cloak:</hi> and this
they think ſufficiently countenanc'd by
the inſtance of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who laying
aſide the Gown, and putting on the
Cloak, was accuſed of lightneſs and
inconſtancy by the people of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
and bitterly perſecuted with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

was forc'd to write an Apology for
himſelf, which he did in his book <hi>de

peculiar to them; and this probably
they did the rather, not only becauſe
this was the moſt plain and ſimple gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46588:221"/>
in it ſelf, but becauſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

I refer the capable Reader, who
has any further curioſity for theſe
things. The <hi>true</hi> beauty of a Chriſtian
in thoſe dayes lay not in <hi>external</hi> and
adventitious ornaments, but in the

with goodneſs and vertue; and
therefore he wittily compares thoſe

look within the veil and covering of

meeting with what is truly beautiful,
that it will excite his horrour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;

all immodest pictures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.
The great modeſty of <hi>Gorgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
Their valuing chaſtity above life:
ſubmitting to any kind of death ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than violate it: Many chuſing to
kill themſelves rather than be deflour'd.
Several inſtances of it. Impurity in
Chriſtians bewail'd as a great ſcandal:
puniſhed by the Church with very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46588:240"/>
penalties. Several paſſages out of
the Fathers and Councils noted to that
purpoſe. Chriſtians accuſed by the
Heathens of inceſt and adultery. The
ſumme of the charge. Their Anſwer.
The Heathens very unfit to bring in
this charge, being themſelves ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
guilty: whole Nations, their
wiſeſt Philoſophers, their very Gods
themſelves: this fully proved againſt
them. The very Gentiles tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
the Chriſtians innocent, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
them to be forcibly proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
A part of their religion not to
give way to wanton looks or unchaſt
deſires. The eminent prevalency of
Chriſtianity in converting perſons
from uncleanneſs and debauchery,
pleaded and aſſerted. The original of
the accuſation enquired into. Found
to ariſe from the beaſtly practices of
the Gnoſticks, &amp;c. who though guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the moſt notorious villanies, and
of theſe in particular, yet ſhrowded
themſelves under the general name of
Chriſtians. Some forced through fear
to confeſs the Chriſtians guilty of
theſe crimes.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:46588:240"/>
A Third conſiderable inſtance of
that ſobriety and moderation for
which the Chriſtians were ſo renowned
of old, was their <hi>Continence,</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining,
from all manner of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which is that Vertue that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

how eminent they were (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what their enemies heavily
charged upon them to the contrary, of
which afterwards) we ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in ſome few particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Chriſtians of thoſe times
were ſo far from breaking in upon any
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchaſt</hi> embraces, that they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abſtained even from <hi>lawful</hi> pleaſures,
and kept themſelves even from the
<hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>undefiled bed,</hi> never
marrying all their life.<note place="margin">Minut.</note> We are (ſays
<hi>Octavius) chaſt</hi> in our <hi>ſpeech,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Foel. p. 26.</note> and <hi>chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
in our <hi>bodies,</hi> and very many of us,
though we do not boaſt on't, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
preſerve a <hi>perpetual</hi> Virginity;
and are ſo far from any extravagant
deſires after <hi>Inceſtuous</hi> mixtures, that
many ſtand at a diſtance from the moſt
<hi>chaſt</hi> and modeſt embraces. Thus <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
Martyr</hi> tells the Emperours,<note place="margin">Apol. 2. p. 62.</note> that
amongſt the <hi>Christians</hi> there were a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46588:241"/>
great many of either Sex, who had
from their child-hood been educated
in the Chriſtian diſcipline, who for
ſixty or ſeventy years had kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>ſingle</hi> and uncorrupt, and he
wiſhed the like could be ſhewn in all
other ſorts of men. To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
another <hi>Apologiſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Athenag. leg. pro Chriſtian. p. 37.</note> 'tis very eaſie
<hi>(ſays he)</hi> to find many amongſt us, both
men and women, who remain unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
even in <hi>old age,</hi> conceiving that
in this ſtate they ſhall have fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of drawing near to God.
Not that they who perſever'd in this
courſe of <hi>Celibate</hi> did combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into diſtinct Societies, and bind
themſelves under an <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>perpetual</hi>
Virginity (as the humour was in after
ages) for of this not the leaſt ſhadow
appears in any of the writings of thoſe
times, they lived promiſcuoſly (till
towards the end of the <hi>third Century)</hi>
applyed themſelves to the buſineſs of
their place and ſtation, and only lived
ſingle, that in thoſe troubleſome and
hazardous times of perſecution, they
might be leſs enſnared with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements
of the world, and be
more free for the exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:46588:241"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When they did marry,
they generally profeſs'd they did it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to comply with the great end of the
<hi>institution, viz.</hi> the propagation of
mankind; not to gratifie wanton and
brutiſh deſires, but to anſwer the great
<hi>end</hi> of nature, that humane ſociety
might not fail;<note place="margin">Justin Martyr i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. p. 71.</note> either <hi>(ſay they)</hi> we
marry not at all, but keep our ſelves
<hi>always</hi> continent;<note place="margin">Athenag. ibid.</note> or if we do marry,
it is for no other end but the bringing
<hi>forth</hi> and the bringing <hi>up</hi> of children;
who ever amongſt us takes a Wife, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws preſcribed us, he
reckons he does it only for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of children; within this his
deſires are bounded and limited; as
the Husbandman concerns himſelf no
further in tilling his ground and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his corn, than to bring forth
the crop at Harveſt. Hence it was that
they ſeldom married more than <hi>once:</hi>
We willingly contain our ſelves (as he
ſpeaks in <hi>M. Foelix)</hi> within the bound
of ſingle marriage,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ſupr.</note> and either know
but <hi>one</hi> woman (and that meerly out
of a deſire of children) or <hi>none.</hi> The
firſt knot being looſed by death, they
very rarely tied a ſecond: which
gained great honour and reputation
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46588:242"/>
both to them and to their Religion
with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> amongſt whom they
lived.<note place="margin">Ad vid. ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior. tom. 4 p. 458.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
hapning on a time between him
and his <hi>Maſter,</hi> who was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his <hi>Mother,</hi> being told that ſhe
was a Widow, and after enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her age, being anſwered that
ſhe was forty years old, and that ſhe
had liv'd twenty years of the time a
Widow, the man was ſurpris'd with a
ſtrange admiration; and cried out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the company, <hi>behold</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>what brave women there are amongſt the
Chriſtians.</hi> The truth is, ſuch was the
heavenly zeal and temper of the firſt
Ages of Chriſtianity, that they would
have no more to do with the World,
than they needs muſt, but induſtriouſly
ſhun'd all its burdens and encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
amongſt which they eſpecially
reckoned marriage, a ſtate not raſhly
to be engag'd in; for once it was <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,</hi>
but for a ſecond time <hi>inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</hi>
And indeed it cannot be denied
but that many of the Ancient Fathers,
<hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Hierom,</hi> and others
did inveigh againſt <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with too much bitterneſs and ſeverity,
violently preſſing many paſſages in

Scripture to ſerve the cauſe, ſtraining
the ſtring many times till it crack'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and not ſticking to cenſure and

The Antient <hi>Canons</hi> (as <hi>Zonaras</hi>

he got off by this wile, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

this caſe, yet the rigour of their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
will be much abated, if what ſome
tell us be true, that many of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46588:243"/>
are not levell'd againſt ſucceſſive
marriages, but againſt having two

to ſhun all <hi>occaſions</hi> and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances

might tend to inveagle their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

what was moſt excellent out of hoth,
the <hi>ſublimity</hi> of the one, and the <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the other; ſhewing that neither
of theſe ſtates in it ſelf did wholly

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46588:247"/>
commended and embrac'd; but that
it is the <hi>mind</hi> that admirably preſides
both over Marriage and Virginity:
And withal further adds concerning
her,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 185.</note> that ſo great was her <hi>baſhfulneſs</hi>
and modeſty, that when ſhe lay under
a moſt acute and dangerous diſtemper,
yet ſhe refuſed to have any <hi>Phyſician</hi>

the faireſt promiſes could not <hi>tempt</hi>

amongſt other effects of his wild and

all places whre he came with Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries

well enough (ſays the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian)</hi>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46588:248"/>
of the Tyrant: the men underwent all
ſorts of puniſhments which cruelty
could invent; the women bore up
with a courage no leſs <hi>manly</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable,
and when any were
drawn out to be abuſed, they rather
ſubmitted their lives to <hi>death,</hi> than
their bodies to <hi>diſhonour.</hi> Of theſe
he tells us of one eſpecially at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
a woman of great birth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
but much more famous for her
Vertues, eſpecially her modeſty and
chaſtity, which ſhe ſtoutly defended,
and preferred before her nobility o
her riches, her excellent parts, or any
accompliſhments whatſoever. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
had oft attempted her by all
Arts of ſollicitation, but all in vain;
till at laſt, not being able to prevail,
his affection ſomewhat attempering his
fierceneſs and cruelty, he would not
put her to death, which ſhe was moſt
ready to have undergone, but ſpoyl'd
her of her eſtate, and then ſent her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
baniſhment; there being many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of others at the ſame time, who
not able to bear the violation of their
chaſtity wherewith the Governours
and Commanders threatned them, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ſubjected themſelves to all kinds

of racks and tortures, and the worſt
<hi>capital</hi> puniſhments which their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

when the caſe ſo happen'd that they

could not provoke the cruel kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

they would rather diſpatch <hi>themſelves,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>An eminent inſtance hereof (though
of the other ſex) S. <hi>Hierom</hi> relates to
this purpoſe:<note place="margin">Vit. Paul. Eremit. tom. 1. p. 237.</note> In the time of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Perſecution a young man a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
then in the flower and beauty of
his age, whoſe conſtancy had been oft
attempted by other means to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
was at laſt ſet upon in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
He was carried into a pleaſant
<hi>Garden,</hi> and into a part of it beſet with
<hi>Lillies</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> hard by the banks of
a <hi>Cryſtal</hi> river, whoſe ſoft <hi>murmurs,</hi>
together with the <hi>muſick</hi> made by the
leaves of the trees wav'd by the gentle
motions of the wind, conſpir'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it a place for <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>delight:</hi>
Here upon a <hi>bed</hi> of <hi>down</hi> the young
man was laid, and that he might not
be able to help himſelf or ſhift his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
was tied down with <hi>ſilken</hi> cords:
the company withdrawing, a beautiful
<hi>Strumpet</hi> was ſent in to him, who began
to careſſe him with kiſſes and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
treating him with all the arts of
wantonneſs, not conſiſtent with <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:46588:256"/>

in this caſe the poor man knew not;
but finding the temptation beginning
to prevail, he preſently bit off his <hi>tongue</hi>
and <hi>ſpit</hi> it in her face as ſhe attempted
to kiſs him, by the greatneſs of his
pain extinguiſhing thoſe <hi>ſenſual</hi> titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which her wicked artifices began
to kindle in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they confidently aſſured
them that amongſt Chriſtians it was
not only unlawful to be <hi>actually</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
but <hi>to look after a woman with
wanton and unchaſte deſires;</hi> our Lord
(ſays <hi>Juſtin Martyr)</hi> has told us that

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46588:256"/>
the freedom of an unchaſte look;
for <hi>whoever</hi> (ſays <hi>our Lord) looks after
a woman to deſire her, has play'd the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
with her in his heart:</hi> we are not
therefore allowed to uſe our eyes to any
other purpoſes, than thoſe for which
God created them, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>lights</hi> to
the body: to abuſe them to wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is to be guilty of adultery, for
as much as they know they were made
for other ends, and cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to themſelves of their own
thoughts; and how is it poſſible for
men under ſuch <hi>limitations</hi> to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than chaſte and ſober? for we
have not to deal with <hi>humane</hi> Laws,
under which a man may be wicked,
and yet eſcape; but our diſcipline
was delivered by God himſelf; we
have a Law which makes our <hi>ſelves</hi>
the <hi>rule</hi> and meaſure of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi>

to the difference of age we account
ſome as <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> others as
<hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Siſters;</hi> the more aged
we honour in the place of <hi>Parents;</hi>
thoſe therefore whom we account
as <hi>Siſters,</hi> or as allied to us in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other relation, we reckon it a
matter of great concernment that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46588:257"/>
they ſhould be chaſte and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They pleaded, that this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
would eaſily vaniſh, if they would
but conſider what a ſtrange <hi>change</hi> and
alteration was in this very caſe wrought
upon perſons at their firſt <hi>converſion</hi> to
Chriſtianity; immediately becoming
quite of another ſpirit and temper from
what they were before. We who before
time (ſays <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> ſpeaking of the
converting power of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
did pleaſe our ſelves in <hi>fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and uncleanneſs,<note place="margin">Apol. 2. p. 61, 62.</note> do now ſolely
embrace temperance and chaſtity;
what an innumerable company could I
name of thoſe who have left their lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury
and intemperance, and come over
to this kind of life; for <hi>Chriſt came
not to call the chaſte and righteous</hi> [they
needed it not] <hi>but the wicked,</hi>

and the unrighteous to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
And in his other <hi>Apology</hi> he
gives an inſtance of a woman, who
having together with her husband
lived a very <hi>vicious</hi> and debauched
courſe of life, after her converſion to
Chriſtianity became ſtrictly chaſte and
ſober; and not content with this, ſhe
urged her husband alſo to do the like
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46588:257"/>
laying before him the doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and perſwading him both by
the rewards and puniſhments of another
World: but he obſtinately refuſing, it
begot a quarrel between them, which
ſtill ripen'd into a wider breach, till it
became matter of publick cognizance,
and was an occaſion for <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>
to write that excellent <hi>Apology</hi> for the
Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Ad Nation. lib. 1. c. 4. p. 43.</note> Upon this account <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

unknown to any that conſidered the
<hi>nature</hi> of its doctrine, and the <hi>tendency</hi>

ſo directly oppoſite to the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi>
and vicious inclinations of men;
the <hi>purity</hi> of its worſhip ſo flatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

to the <hi>looſe</hi> and obſcene rites and

<hi>This Sect</hi> (for ſo they call'd it) <hi>was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

veneration for <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and eſpecially
in matters of Religion, they thought
themſelves concerned to defend that
way, that had been convey'd to them
from their <hi>Anceſtours,</hi> and to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with might and main againſt
whatever might oppoſe it: eſpecially
the <hi>great ones</hi> of thoſe times and the
<hi>Roman Emperours</hi> made it their maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſign
to oppreſs and ſtifle this <hi>infant</hi>
Religion, and to baniſh it out of the

that were dayly ſent abroad into all

that we may the better apprehend the

down one or two of them out of the

to all: We therefore unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decree, that all orders of men, as well
children as ſervants, ſouldiers as private
perſons ſhall offer ſacrifices to the gods,
doing reverence and ſupplication to them.
And if any ſhall dare to violate our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

we command, that he be caſt into priſon,

The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> it's true are not
particularly <hi>nam'd</hi> in it (probably the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> ſo much deteſted the very

their own <hi>Records,</hi> and they would
find. And from this very <hi>Inſcription</hi>
alone it's evident, they thought, that
(at leaſt in that part of the world) they
had wholly <hi>extirpated</hi> and rooted it
out. By all which we may gueſs, what
hot ſervice the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had on't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe Primitive Perſecutions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
their ſufferings were beyond all
imagination great, which yet did but
ſo much the more exerciſe and advance
their <hi>Patience,</hi> the bitterneſs of their
ſufferings making their patience more
eminent and illuſtrious. Of which that
we may take the truer meaſures, 'twill
be neceſſary to conſider theſe two
things, the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of thoſe <hi>torments</hi>
and ſufferings which the Chriſtians ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46588:277"/>
underwent; and then the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of their carriage under them.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, the greatneſs of thoſe
<hi>torments</hi> and ſufferings which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent,
they were as bad as the wit
and malice of either <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Devils</hi>
could invent; in the conſideration
whereof we ſhall firſt take a view of
thoſe puniſhments which were more
ſtanding and <hi>ordinary,</hi> familiarly uſed
amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and
then of ſuch as were <hi>extraordinarily</hi>
made uſe of towards the Chriſtians:
Amongſt their ordinary methods of
Execution, theſe ſix were moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Rack,</hi> the <hi>Wheel,
Burning, wild Beaſts,</hi> condemning to
<hi>Mines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. The <hi>Croſs</hi> deſerves the firſt place
in our account, not only as having
been one of the moſt <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi>
ways of puniſhment amongſt the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> and from them brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> but as being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
by which our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi>
himſelf was put to death. Omitting the
various and different forms and kinds
of it, which were all uſed towards the
Primitive Chriſtians, I intend here only
that that was moſt common, a ſtraight
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46588:278"/>
piece of wood fixed in the ground, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a tranſverſe beam faſtned near the
top of it, not unlike the letter T,
though probably it had alſo a piece of
wood ariſing above the top of it, and
there were <hi>two things</hi> in this way of
puniſhment, which rendred it very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
the <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>ignominy</hi> of it.
Painful it muſt needs be, becauſe the
party ſuffering was faſtned to it with
<hi>nayles</hi> driven through his <hi>hands</hi> and
<hi>feet,</hi> which being the parts where the
<hi>nerves</hi> and <hi>ſinews</hi> terminate and meet
together, muſt needs be moſt acutely
ſenſible of wounds and violence: and
becauſe they were pierced only in
theſe parts ſo far diſtant from the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
this made their death very <hi>lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring</hi>
and tedious, doubled and trebled
every pain upon them: Inſomuch that
ſome out of a <hi>generous</hi> compaſſion have
cauſed malefactors firſt to be <hi>ſtrangled</hi>
before they were <hi>crucified,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sueton. in vit. Caeſ. c. 74. p. 76.</note> as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius

II. The <hi>Rack,</hi> called in Latin <hi>Equu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi>
either from the ſcituation of the

a man on <hi>horſeback,</hi> or rather
from the <hi>horſing</hi> or holding of him up
to it by ropes and ſcrews. The firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of it was to torment the guilty,<note place="margin">Cicer. pro Deiotar. p. 579. tom. 2.</note> or
the ſuſpected perſon to make him <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi>
the truth; what the particular form
of it was is not agreed amongſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men;<note place="margin">Vid. Gallon de cruciat. martyr. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> but this we may probably
conceive, that it was an Engine fram'd
of ſeveral pieces of timber joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
upon the top whereof upon a
long <hi>board</hi> the ſuffering perſon being
laid along upon his back and faſtned to
it by his hands and feet, the Engine
was ſo contriv'd with ſcrews and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
that all his members were <hi>diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
with the utmoſt violence, even to a
<hi>luxation</hi> of all the parts, and this more
or leſs according to the tormentors
pleaſures. Sometimes they were hung
by the hands and feet <hi>under</hi> the top-board
of the Engine, and tormented
in that poſture; This Rack was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
which the Chriſtians were
very frequently put to. Much of the
ſame nature was that which they call'd
the <hi>Cataſta,</hi> being a piece of wood rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46588:279"/>
up like a little ſcaffold, upon which
Chriſtians were ſet, that their torments
might be more conſpicuous; thence
that proverb in <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

Scriptures out of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> as he had
lately confeſſed Chriſt upon the <hi>Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</hi>
In this, as in that of the Rack,
there were certain additional torments
made by inſtruments called <hi>Vngulae,</hi>
which were a kind of iron <hi>pinſers,</hi>
made with ſharp teeth, with which the
fleſh was by piece-meal pull'd and torn
off their backs.</p>

and pay a religious reſpect to the aſhes
of thoſe, who drag'd them to the ſtake,
tore off their fleſh, and put them to
death with all imaginable pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>III. The <hi>Wheel.</hi> This was a <hi>round</hi>
Engine, to which the body of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
perſon being bound, was not
only extreamly diſtended, but <hi>whirl'd</hi>
about with the moſt violent diſtortion;
the pain whereof was unconceivable,
eſpecially as uſed towards the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians, the Wheel to which
they were bound naked being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
full of <hi>iron pricks,</hi> ſometimes a
board full of ſharp-pointed iron pricks
being plac'd under it, ſo that every
time the body of the Martyr came to
it, they <hi>rak'd</hi> off the fleſh with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible

torment. Thus were ſerv'd
thoſe three Martyrs, <hi>Foelix</hi> the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Martyr.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Rom. ad diem April. 23. p. 249.</note> and hundreds
more in other places.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>Burning.</hi> This was done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by ſtaking them down to a pile

laying them to roſt at a ſlow gentle
fire, that they might dye with the
greater torment; otherwhiles they
were hung up either by the neck, hands
or feet, and a fire made under them,
either to <hi>burn</hi> or <hi>choak</hi> them; or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
torches held to ſeveral parts of their

placed in an <hi>iron chair,</hi> or laid upon
an <hi>iron grate,</hi> which was either made
<hi>red hot,</hi> or had a fire continually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under it: of all which ways of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and ſome other near akin to
them, were it not too tedious I could
eaſily give abundant inſtances. This
was accounted one of the <hi>prince</hi> ways
of <hi>capital</hi> puniſhments, and none were

and brethren; but they as couragious
Champions of the true Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to prefer an honourable
<hi>death</hi> in defence of the truth before
<hi>life</hi> it ſelf, little regarded the cruel u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
they met with in it: but rather
as became true Souldiers of God, <hi>arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
with patience, they laughed at all
methods of execution; fire and ſword,
and the piercings of nails, wild beaſts,
and the bottom of the Sea, cutting and
burning of limbs, putting out eyes, and
mutilation of the whole body, hunger,
and digging in Mines, chains and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
all which for the great love that
they had to their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> they
accounted <hi>ſweeter</hi> than any happineſs
or pleaſure whatſoever. Nay the very
<hi>women</hi> in this caſe were as couragious
as the <hi>men,</hi> many of whom undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

muſt not be denied that in ſome caſes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46588:286"/>
they held it lawful and convenient to
<hi>fly</hi> in times of perſecution. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
indeed in a Book purpoſely written on
this ſubject maintains it to be ſimply
and abſolutely unlawful for Chriſtians
to fly at ſuch a time;<note place="margin">Lib. de fug. in perſecut.</note> an aſſertion
which with all the ſubtilties of his
wit, and the flouriſhes of his <hi>African</hi>
eloquence he endeavours to render
fair and pauſible. But beſides the
ſtrictneſs and rigid ſeverity of the man
at all times, this Book was compoſed
after his complying with the Sect of
the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> whoſe peculiar humour
it was to out-do the <hi>Orthodox</hi> by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
the auſterities of Religion,
as appears not only in this, but in the
caſe of <hi>marriages, faſts, pennances,</hi>
and ſuch like. Otherwiſe before his
eſpouſing thoſe opinions he ſeems elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
to ſpeak more favourably of
ſhunning perſecution.<note place="margin">De patient. c. 13. p. 147.</note> But whatever
he thought in the caſe, 'tis certain the
generality of the <hi>Fathers</hi> were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind, that Chriſtians might and
ought to uſe prudence in this affair, and
at ſome times withdraw to avoid the
ſtorm when it was a coming, eſpecially
in theſe two Caſes.</p>
               <p>I. When perſons were of more than
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46588:286"/>
ordinary <hi>uſe</hi> and eminency, the ſaving
of whom might be of great advantage
to the Church. Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> was let
down the wall in a <hi>basket,</hi> when the
Governour of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> ſought his life.
Thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> withdrew from <hi>Carthage,</hi>
and lay hid for two years together,
during which time he gave ſecret or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for governing of the Church.<note place="margin">Athan. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. de fug. ſua Tom. 1. p 545.</note>
Thus <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> when <hi>Syrianus</hi> and
his Souldiers broke into the Church
to apprehend him, was by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
cry both of Clergy and people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
and in a manner forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and ſave himſelf, in which retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he continued ſo long, that the
<hi>Arrians</hi> charg'd him with fear and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe,
inſomuch that for his own vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
he was forced to write an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology</hi>
for himſelf, wherein he learnedly
and eloquently diſcourſes the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
juſtifying himſelf from the inſtances
of the Old Teſtament of <hi>Jacob, Moſes,
David, Elias;</hi> from the example of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelf and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the New,
from the plain and poſitive allowance
of the Goſpel, <hi>when they perſecute you
in one City, flee into another,</hi> and
that <hi>when they ſhould ſee the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of deſolation ſtanding in the holy
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46588:287"/>
place (i. e.</hi> the miſeries that were to

Army) <hi>they ſhould fly unto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
and if upon the houſe top, or in
the field, not turn back to fetch any thing
that was left behind;</hi> that 'twas neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the Apoſtles to ſhun the ſtorm,
becauſe they were the inſtruments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
deputed to propagate and
convey the Goſpel to the World; that
they were herein imitated by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Saints and Martyrs, <hi>who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
about in deſerts and mountains and
in dens and caves of the earth,</hi> being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
careful to avoid the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
of <hi>raſhneſs</hi> and <hi>cowardiſe,</hi> they
would neither <hi>thrust</hi> themſelves upon
danger, nor baſely <hi>run</hi> from death,
when call'd to it, like wiſe Phyſicians
reſerving themſelves for the uſe of thoſe
that needed their aſſiſtance. All which
and a great deal more he rationally
urges in that <hi>Apology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Another caſe wherein they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it lawful for perſons to retire
under perſecutions was, when being but
<hi>new</hi> Converts and as yet <hi>weak</hi> in the
faith, they look'd upon them as not
likely to bear the ſhock and brunt of
the perſecution; in this caſe they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46588:287"/>
thought it better for them to <hi>withdraw</hi>
for the preſent, than to put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a temptaion of being drawn back
to Paganiſm and Idolatry. Thus
when <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> ſaw
the <hi>Decian</hi> perſecution grow extream
hot and violent,<note place="margin">Neſſon. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. de vit. Greg. Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. p. 1001. tom. 2.</note> conſidering the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and infirmity of humane nature, and
how few would be able to bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe fierce conflicts that muſt be
undergone for the ſake of Religion,
perſwaded his Church a little to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
that dreadful and terrible ſtorm,
telling them 'twas a great deal better
to <hi>ſave</hi> their ſouls by flying, than by
abiding thoſe furious trials to run the
hazard of <hi>falling</hi> from the faith: and
that his counſel might make the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
impreſſion upon them, and he might
convince them that in thus doing there
was no danger or prejudice to their
ſouls, he reſolved to ſhew them the
way by his own <hi>example,</hi> and himſelf
firſt retiring out of the reach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
retreated to the mountainous
parts there-abouts that were freeſt
from the rage and malice of the enemy.
Nor was this any <hi>impeachment</hi> of their
zeal and readineſs for ſuffering, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a prudent gaining a little reſpite for
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46588:288"/>
a time, that they might ſuffer with
greater advantage afterwards. They
did not deſire to ſave their heads, when
the honour of their Religion call'd
for it, nor ever by indirect means
ſcrew'd themſelves out of danger,
when once engaged in it, though they
did ſometimes prudently prevent it,
reſerving themſelves for a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
ſeaſon. Thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> withdrew
a little, not out of fear of ſuffering,
but a deſire to prevent his being put to
death in an <hi>obſcure</hi> place (which his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
had deſigned) being deſirous
his Martyrdom ſhould happen in that
place, where he ſo long liv'd, and ſo
publickly preached the Chriſtian
faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
ſuffering, and being terrified
with thoſe miſeries which they ſaw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
undergo, that they freely and in
great multitudes <hi>offered</hi> themſelves to
the rage and fury of their enemies;
embracing death as the greateſt <hi>honour</hi>
that could be done them; they ſtrove
(as <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Sac. Hiſt. lib. 2. p. 143.</note> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ninth perſecution) which
ſhould ruſh firſt upon thoſe glorious
conflicts; men in thoſe days (as he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46588:288"/>
adds) much more greedily ſeeking
<hi>Martyrdom</hi> in the cauſe of <hi>Christ,</hi> than
in after-times they did for <hi>Biſhopricks</hi>
and the preferments of the Church.

They even envied the Martyrdom of

               <p>To theſe I ſhall add but one Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

though of another perſwaſion, yet out
of common compaſſion gave them <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
notice of the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
hoping they would forbear.
But they not at all terrified with the
news, met the next morning in greater
numbers, which the Governour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
went to the place of their

in a careleſs dreſs leading a little child

               <p>When <hi>Lucius</hi> one of the Primitive

he immediately confeſs'd it, and being
forthwith condemned, he heartily
thanked his Judge for it, that by this
means he ſhould be deliver'd from ſuch
unrighteous Governours and be ſooner
ſent home to his Heavenly Father. No
joyfuller meſſage could be told them,
than that they muſt dye for the ſake of
Chriſt: Though we contend with all

your rage and cruelty (as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
tells the Preſident <hi>Scapula)</hi> yet we

more when we are condemned, than

their enemies they accounted the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi>
of their torment, the <hi>enſigns</hi>
of their honour and their happineſs:
When the Heathens reproached them

them <hi>Sarmenticil</hi> and <hi>Semaxii</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>This is the habit

When in priſon, they looked upon

                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. H. Eccl. lib. 5. c 1. p. 160. C.</note> as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

things which ſeem moſt ignominious,
are for the ſake of Chriſt moſt ſplendid

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When ever they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
under the bittereſt torments,
they never diſcovered the leaſt ſign of

                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> exhorting the Martyrs to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

thoſe that had gone before them, that
in the hotteſt conflict they never ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but maintained their ground with
a <hi>free</hi> confeſſion, an <hi>unſhaken</hi> mind, a
<hi>divine</hi> courage, deſtitute indeed of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
weapons, but armed with the
<hi>ſhield</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> in torments they ſtood
<hi>stronger</hi> than their tormentors; their
bruiſed and mangled limbs proved too
hard for the inſtruments wherewith
their fleſh was rack'd and pull'd from
them; the blows though never ſo oft
repeated could not conquer their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46588:293"/>
Faith, although they did
not only ſlice and teare off the fleſh, but
rake into their very bowels; and let
out blood enough to <hi>extinguiſh</hi> the
flames of perſecution, and to <hi>allay</hi> the
heats of the everlaſting fire. And in
another place ſpeaking of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
under <hi>Decius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Cornel. Epiſt. 57. p. 91.</note> he tells us
that the Adverſary did with an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
violence break in upon the <hi>Camp</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but was repulſed with a
ſtrength as great as that wherewith he
came upon them: that then he craftily
attempted the more rude and weak,
and ſubtilly endeavoured to ſet upon
them ſingly, hoping the eaſilier to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent
them; but that he found
them like a <hi>well-compacted</hi> army, ſober
and vigilant, and prepared for battel;
that they could <hi>dye,</hi> but could not be
<hi>overcome;</hi> yea therefore <hi>unconquerable</hi>
becauſe <hi>not afraid</hi> to dye; that they
did not reſiſt thoſe that roſe up againſt
them, being ready not to kill them that
aſſaulted them, but to lay down their
own lives and to loſe their blood, that
they might make the more haſte to get
out of a cruel and malicious world.
Indeed ſo admirable was their patience
and readineſs to dye, that their very
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46588:293"/>
                  <hi>enemies</hi> ſtood amaz'd at it. When <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi>

being partaker of his <hi>Grace</hi> they made
light of theſe <hi>temporal</hi> torments, and
by one ſhort hour delivered themſelves
from <hi>eternal</hi> miſeries: The fire which
their tormentors put to them ſeemed
to them but <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>little,</hi> while they
had it in their thoughts to avoid the

have loſt their lives to keep faith

we be unfaithful to the true <hi>King</hi> of
Heaven? How many have <hi>juſtly</hi> died

Thus generouſly did they bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this uncomfortable ſtate; their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
deſires of Heaven from within,
extinguiſhing all ſenſe of cold and
hardſhip from without. Nay, when

they would but <hi>deny Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 81.</note> they ſhould
make their own terms for riches and
honour; they told him, that he laid his
<hi>ſnares</hi> at a wrong door; that he could
not <hi>give</hi> them, what he endeavoured
to <hi>take</hi> from them; nor could they
cloſe with his offers, without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
loſers by the bargain; that
'twas to no purpoſe to profer a <hi>little</hi> of
the world to them, who deſpiſed the
<hi>whole</hi> of it; that all theſe viſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
were nothing to what they had
in hope and expectation; all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and glory of Heaven and Earth not

which is the <hi>portion</hi> of the
righteous; the one being <hi>ſhort-liv'd</hi>

of no <hi>gift,</hi> but the Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
nor ſought after any other
<hi>Glory</hi> but what was <hi>Heavenly;</hi> that
they <hi>feared</hi> no torments but thoſe of
<hi>Hell,</hi> and that fire that was truly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible;
as for thoſe puniſhments they
inflicted, they accounted them but as
the <hi>blows</hi> of children; and the ill uſage
that their bodies met with, the longer

for a <hi>brighter</hi> crown. Such was the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

               <p>Indeed this conſideration was one of

to all <hi>candid</hi> and ingenuous Readers,
that they knew what they writ to be
true, when they ſo chearfully endured
ſo many and ſuch grievous things only
for the ſake of the Son of God, in

                  <p>Chriſtian Religion admirably provides
for moral righteouſneſs. Do as you
would be done by, the great Law of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46588:301"/>
Chriſt: This rule highly priz'd by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
the Emperour. The firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
accounted honeſty and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
carriage a main part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Their candor and ſimplicity
in their words: Abhorring lies and
mental reſervations, though it might
ſave their lives. Their veracity ſuch,
as no need to be put to thir oaths.
Some few of the Fathers againſt all
ſwearing: Allowed by the greateſt
part in weighty Caſes: That they took
oaths proved from <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and
their taking the <hi>Sacramentum mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare:</hi>
The form of the oath out of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius:</hi>
The ſame expreſly affirmed of
the more antient Chriſtians by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi>
Why refuſing to ſwear by the
Emperours genius. Oaths wont to be
taken at the holy Sacrament, upon the
Communion Table, or the holy <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.</hi>
Some againſt all oaths only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a poſſibility of perjury. Bearing
falſe witneſs condemned and ſtrictly
puniſhed by the antient Church. A

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving given ſome account of
the Religion of the antient
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> both as it reſpected their
<hi>piety</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> and their ſober
and vertuous <hi>carriage</hi> towards <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi>
we come in the laſt place to
conſider it in reference to their <hi>carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi>
towards <hi>others,</hi> which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi>
deſcribes under the title of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:46588:302"/>
under which he comprehends
all that duty and reſpect wherein we
ſtand <hi>obliged</hi> to others; whereof we
ſhall conſider theſe following inſtances:
their <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> in matters of
commerce and traffick; their mutual
<hi>love</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> to one another; their
<hi>unity</hi> and <hi>peaceableneſs;</hi> and their <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
and ſubjection to <hi>civil</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt, their <hi>juſt</hi> and
<hi>upright carriage</hi> in their <hi>outward</hi>
dealings; one great deſign of the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law is to eſtabliſh and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that great <hi>principle</hi> which is one of
the prime and <hi>fundamental</hi> Laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>to hurt no man,</hi> and <hi>to render to
every one his due,</hi> to teach us to carry
our ſelves as becomes us in our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards men. Next to our duty
towards <hi>God,</hi> the Goſpel obliges us to
be <hi>righteous</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> ſincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in all our dealings, <hi>not going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond,
nor defrauding one another in any
matter, to put away lying, and to ſpeak
truth to each other as fellow-members</hi> of
the ſame Chriſtian brother-hood and
ſociety. It ſettles that <hi>golden</hi> rule as
the fundamental Law of all <hi>juſt</hi> and
equitable commerce, <hi>that all things
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46588:302"/>
whatſoever we would that men ſhould do
to us, we ſhould even do ſo to them, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſum of the Law and the Prophets;</hi>
than which as no rule could have been
more <hi>equitable</hi> in it ſelf, ſo none could
poſſibly have been contrived more
<hi>ſhort</hi> and plain, and more accommodate
to the common caſes of humane life.
Upon the account of theſe, and ſuch

the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of old look'd upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty

not able to bear the eminent ſtrictneſs

ſolemnly ratified it with their oaths:

                  <note place="margin">H. Eccl. lib. 7. c 27 p. 749.</note> that having
ſpent all his own eſtate in pious and
charitable uſes, in relieving the needy,
and ſuch as were by ſhipwrack and the
mercy of the ſea caſt upon the coaſt,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46588:327"/>
he freely diſpenſed and diſtributed the
goods and treaſures of his Church
(which by the bounty of charitable
perſons from all parts, who thought
they could not better lodge their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
than in the hands of ſo good a
man, was very rich and wealthy) and
that with ſo liberal a hand, that the
<hi>Steward</hi> or Guardian of the Church
finding its ſtock begin to grow very
low, with ſome reſentment told him of
it, charging him as too profuſe and
open-handed; All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he remitted nothing of his
accuſtomed bounty to the poor. At
length all being ſpent, a <hi>ſtranger</hi> on a
ſuddain comes into the Stewards lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and delivers into his hand a great
<hi>purſe</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> without any diſcovery
either who 'twas that <hi>brought</hi> it, or who
'twas that <hi>ſent</hi> it. And indeed ſo vaſt
and univerſal was the charity of this
good man, that it ſometimes made him
liable to be <hi>impoſed</hi> upon by crafty and
deſigning perſons, whereof the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
in the ſame place gives this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
inſtance. A couple of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
meeting <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and knowing
the charitableneſs of his temper, to
draw the greater alms from him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46588:327"/>
to put this trick upon him. One of
them lies along upon the ground, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf to be dead, the other ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by him paſſionately bewailed the
death of his companion, and his own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
not able to give him burial. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
pitied the man, perſwaded him
to bear his loſs patiently, and not to
expect that his companion ſhould in
this world riſe any more, bid him take
care for his burial, and withal gave
him what was ſufficient for it. No
ſooner was he gone out of ſight, but
the beggar comes to his companion,
jogs him with his foot, and commends
him for ſo ingeniouſly acting the cheat:
<hi>Riſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and with what we have
got let's be merry and jolly to day.</hi> But
alas! the <hi>Comedy</hi> was turned into a <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
ſcene;</hi> the man was really dead,
and could not be recovered by all his
cries or ſtirring; which his companion
no ſooner perceived, but with all haſt
makes after the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> cries and tears
his hair, confeſſes the cheat, and begs
that his companion might be reſtored
to life; but all in vain: the Biſhop bids
him be content, and tells him that God
would not undo what he had done.

                  <hi>Presbyter</hi> and Governour of the <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> There was a Virgin
in that City very rich, but infinitely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
and uncharitable: She had
been oft attempted and ſet upon by
the perſwaſions of good men, but in
vain; at laſt he caught her by this
piece of <hi>pious</hi> policy. He comes to her,
and tells her that a parcel of Jewels,
<hi>Emraulds</hi> and <hi>Jacinths,</hi> of ineſtimable
value, were lodg'd at his houſe, but
which the owner was willing to part
with for five hundred pieces of mony,
and adviſes her to buy them: She
catching at the offer, as hoping to gain
conſiderably by the bargain, delivered
him the mony, and intreated him to
buy them for her, knowing him to be
a perſon of great piety and integrity.
But hearing nothing from him a long
time after, till meeting him in the
Church, ſhe asked him what were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the <hi>Jewels:</hi> He told her he
had laid out the mony upon them (for
he had expended it upon the uſes of
the <hi>Hoſpital)</hi> and deſired her to come
and ſee them, and if the purchaſe did
not pleaſe her, ſhe might refuſe it. She
readily came along with him to the
Hoſpital, in the upper rooms whereof
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46588:329"/>
the <hi>women</hi> were lodged; in the lower
the <hi>men.</hi> He asked her which ſhe
would ſee firſt, the <hi>Jacinths,</hi> or the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds;</hi>
which ſhe leaving to him, he
brought her firſt into the upper part,
where the <hi>lame, blind,</hi> and <hi>Cripple-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
were diſpoſed, and <hi>ſee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the
Jacinths that I ſpoke of:</hi> Then carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her down into the lower rooms he
ſhewed her the <hi>men</hi> in the like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and told her, <hi>Theſe are the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds
that I promiſed, and Jewels more
precious than theſe I think are not to be
found; and now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if you like not
your bargain, take your mony back again.</hi>
The woman bluſhed, and was troubled
to think, ſhe ſhould be hal'd to that,
which ſhe ought to have done freely
for the love of God. Afterwards ſhe
heartily thanked <hi>Macarius,</hi> and betook
her ſelf to a more charitable and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

ask what he would, which he made no
further uſe of than to beg the releaſe of
all his Country men then in bondage,
which was accordingly granted, and
all joyfully ſent home with their ſhips
laden with Corn and Proviſions, I omit
as not pertinent to my purpoſe; they
that are deſirous to know more of it
may read it in the Dialogues of S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi>
from whence I have borrowed the

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46588:333"/>
a witneſs, an act that will find more to
admire and commend it, than to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and follow it.</p>
               <p>A fourth inſtance of Primitive Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
was the great care they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>bodies</hi> of the <hi>dead,</hi> in giving
them <hi>decent,</hi> and where they could,
<hi>honourable</hi> burial; all men naturally
have a kindneſs for their bodies, and
therefore deſire, that what has ſo long
been the manſion of an <hi>immortal</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
may upon its diſ-lodging be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
taken down, and the ruins of it
laid up with honour and ſafety. Mans
body beſides that 'tis the cabinet of an
invaluable jewel, is a curious piece of
artifice, <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi>
the excellent contrivance of the divine
omniſcience, and in that reſpect chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
not to be careleſly thrown aſide,
or rudely trampled in the dirt. This
ſeems to be the common ſence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
it being the care and practice of
almoſt all Nations in the world religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to enſhrine the remains of their
deceaſed friends in Tombs and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres;
thinking it but reaſonable to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
ſo much kindneſs to their departed
friends, as to honour their memories,
and to ſecure from rude barbarous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46588:334"/>
what they left behind them when
they put off mortality. Sure I am this
was eminently the care of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
no dangers or threatnings could affright
them from doing this laſt office to their
deceaſed brethren, eſpecially ſuch as
had been <hi>Martyrs</hi> and Champions for
the Truth.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 2. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ep. Cyp. p. 9.</note> The <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy in an

to the ſick, or the reſt which they
there enumerate and reckon up; tells
them that it could not be neglected
without great danger, and that fidelity
in this matter would be highly acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
to God, and rewarded by him.
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Plague that raged there
(which we mentioned but now) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
the Chriſtians for aſſiſting
their ſick dying brethren,<note place="margin">Ibid. ubi ſupr.</note> that they
cloſed their eyes, laid them out, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their bodies, dreſſed and adorned
them up for burial, and carried them
out upon their own ſhoulders, which
they chearfully did, notwithſtanding
the imminent danger that attended it,
and that it was not long before others
were called to do the ſame offices for
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46588:334"/>
them. Their bodies they decently
committed to the <hi>ground,</hi> for they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
the cuſtom ſo common amongſt
the Gentiles of <hi>burning</hi> the bodies of
the dead; which they did, not (as the
Heathens objected) becauſe they
thought that their bodies once burnt to
aſhes would be difficultly brought to a
<hi>Reſurrection</hi> (a doctrine which they
ſtrenuouſly aſſerted,<note place="margin">Min. Foel. p. 9.—28.</note> and held faſt as
the main <hi>pillar</hi> of their comfort and
confidence) but becauſe they looked
upon it as <hi>inhumane</hi> and <hi>barbarous,</hi> and
contrary to the more ancient and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
uſage of mankind in this matter.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> calls this way of burial by
<hi>inhumation</hi> a piece of piety,<note place="margin">De Anim. c. 51. p. 301.</note> and tells
us they abſtained from burning the
Corps, not as ſome did, becauſe they
thought that ſome <hi>part</hi> of the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the body after death, but
becauſe it ſavour'd of ſavageneſs and
cruelty. Therefore their enemies to
do them the greater ſpite, did not only
put them to death, but very often burn
their dead bodies, and ſprinkle their
aſhes into the Sea, partly to hinder
them from a decent burial,<note place="margin">Amm. Marcellin. lib. 22. p. 1627.</note> and partly
(as in that tumult at <hi>Alexandria</hi> under
<hi>Julian)</hi> that nothing might be left of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46588:335"/>
them to be honour'd as the remains of
Martyrs. As Chriſtianity got ground,
this more civil way of inhumation did
not only take place, but rooted out
the contrary cuſtome even amongſt the
Gentiles themſelves. For though the
Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> gives
ſome intimation of it as remaining in
his time,<note place="margin">C. Theod. l. 6. Tit. 17. de Sep. viol. Lib. 9.</note> yet not long after it wholly
ceaſed,<note place="margin">Saturnal. lib. 7. c. 7. pag. 514.</note> as is expreſly acknowledged by
<hi>Macrobius,</hi> who liv'd in the time of the
younger <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did they ordinarily content
themſelves with a bare interrment, but
prepared the body for its funeral with
coſtly <hi>Spices,</hi> and rich odours and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
not ſparing the beſt drugs and
ointments which the <hi>Sabeans</hi> could
afford,<note place="margin">Apol. l. 42. p. 34.</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> plainly teſtifies.
They who while alive generally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
from whatever was curious and
coſtly, when dead were embalm'd and
entombed with great art and curioſity.
Whence <hi>Eunapius</hi> (much ſuch a friend
to Chriſtianity as <hi>Julian</hi> or <hi>Porphyry)</hi>
derides the <hi>Monks</hi> and Chriſtians of
<hi>Egypt</hi> for honouring the ſeaſon'd and
embalm'd <hi>bones</hi> and <hi>heads</hi> of Martyrs,<note place="margin">De vit. Philoſ in vit. Aedeſ. p. 65.</note>
ſuch <hi>(ſays he)</hi> as the Courts of Juſtice
had condemned, and put to death for
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46588:335"/>
their innumerable villanies. This coſt
the Chriſtians doubtleſs beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bodies of their dead, becauſe
they looked upon death as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into a better life, and laid up
the body as the <hi>candidate</hi> and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant
of a joyful and happy reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Beſides, hereby they gave ſome
encouragement to ſuffering, when men
ſaw how much care was taken to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and ſecure the reliques of their
mortality, and that their bodies ſhould
not be perſecuted <hi>after</hi> death.</p>
               <p>This their enemies knew very well,
and therefore many times denied them
the civility and humanity of burial, to
ſtrike the greater dread into them.
Thus <hi>Maximus</hi> the Preſident threatned
<hi>Tharacus</hi> the Martyr,<note place="margin">Act. SS. Tharac. Prob &amp; Andron. apud Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. ad An. 299. tom. 2.</note> that although he
bore up his head ſo high upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that after his death his body
ſhould be wound up and embalm'd
with ointments and odoriferous ſpices,
yet he would defeat his hopes by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his body to be burnt, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his aſhes before the wind.</p>
               <p>Thus after they had put <hi>Polycarp</hi> to
death,<note place="margin">Euſeb. H. Eccl. lib. 4. c. 15. p. 135<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> they burnt his body out of ſpite
to the Chriſtians who had beg'd it of
the <hi>Proconſul,</hi> only to give it a ſolemn
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46588:336"/>
interrment; whereupon gathering his
bones which the mercy of the fire had
ſpared, they decently committed them
to the earth, and there uſed to meet to
celebrate the memory of that pious and
holy man.</p>
               <p>During thoſe times of perſecution
they were very careful to bury the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> ſome making it
their particular buſineſs by ſtealth to
interr thoſe in the night, who had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the day; this they did with great
hazard and danger, many of them (as
appears from the ancient <hi>Martyrologies)</hi>
ſuffering Martyrdom upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

a work of piety and religion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>There's one circumſtance yet behind

a charity as large as the <hi>circles</hi> of the

ſpeaking of that dreadful plague

Parts under the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi>
wherein ſo many whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
miſerably periſhed, and were ſwept

towards all evidently approved it
ſelf to all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were about
them; they being the only perſons
that during this ſad and calamitous
ſtate of things performed the real
offices of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>humanity;</hi> partly
in ordering and <hi>burying</hi> of the dead
(thouſands dying every day, of whom
no care was taken) partly in gathering
together all the <hi>poor</hi> that were ready
to ſtarve, and diſtributing bread to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of them. The fame whereof
fill'd the ears and mouths of all men
who extolled the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and confeſſed that they had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the charity was the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
in that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at this very
time were under a moſt heavy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.
Thus in the terrible plague
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46588:345"/>
that in the times of <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Voluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
raged ſo much through the whole
world (and that more or leſs for fifteen

when innumerable multitudes were
ſwept away every day, and the ſtreets
filled with the carcaſes of the <hi>dead,</hi>
which ſeemed to implore the help of
the <hi>living,</hi> and to challenge it as their
right by the common Laws of humane
nature; but all in vain, every one
trembling, flying, and ſhifting for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

upon this they unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to aſſiſt their common enemies,
every one lending help according to
his rank and quality. Thoſe who by
reaſon of their poverity could contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
nothing to the charge, did what
was more, they perſonally wrought
and laboured, an aſſiſtance beyond all
other contributions: By which large
and abundant charity great advantage
redounded not to themſelves only <hi>of
the houſhold of faith,</hi> but univerſally
unto all.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſum up what hath been ſaid
upon this Argument in that elegant
Diſcourſe which <hi>Lactantius</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
works of mercy and charity.<note place="margin">Lact. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. c. 7. p. 746.</note>
Since humane nature <hi>(ſays he)</hi> is <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
than that of other <hi>creatures,</hi> who
come into the world armed with offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and defenſive powers, therefore
our wiſe Creatour has given us a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and merciful diſpoſition, that we
might place the <hi>ſafeguard</hi> of our lives
in the mutual aſſiſtances of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For being all created by <hi>one
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46588:346"/>
God,</hi> and ſprung from one common <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
we ſhould reckon our ſelves <hi>a-kin,</hi>
and obliged to love all mankind; and
(that our innocency may be perfect)
not only not to do an <hi>injury</hi> to another,
but not to <hi>revenge</hi> one when done to
our ſelves; for which reaſon alſo we
are commanded <hi>to pray for our very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
We ought therefore to be kind
and ſociable, that we may help and aſſiſt
each other. For being <hi>our ſelves</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to miſery, we may the more
comfortably hope for that help, in caſe
we need it, which our ſelves have
given unto <hi>others.</hi> And what can more
effectually induce us to relieve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent,
than to put our ſelves into
their <hi>ſtead,</hi> who beg help from us? If
any be hungry, let us <hi>feed</hi> him; is he
naked, let us <hi>cloath</hi> him; if wronged
by a powerful oppreſſour, let us <hi>reſcue</hi>
and receive him. Let our doors be
open to <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and ſuch who have
not where to lay their head. Let not
our aſſiſtance be wanting to <hi>Widows</hi>
and <hi>Orphans:</hi> And (which is a mighty
inſtance of charity) let us <hi>redeem</hi> the
captiv'd, <hi>viſit</hi> and aſſiſt the <hi>ſick,</hi> who
are able to take no care of themſelves;
and for ſtrangers and the poor (in caſe
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46588:347"/>
they die) let us not ſuffer them to
want the conveniency of a <hi>Grave.</hi>
Theſe are the offices and the works of
mercy, which who-ever does, offers up
a true and grateful ſacrifice to God;
who is not pleaſed with the <hi>blood</hi> of
<hi>beaſts,</hi> but the <hi>charity</hi> of <hi>men;</hi> whom
therefore he treats upon their own
terms, has <hi>mercy</hi> on them whom he ſees
<hi>merciful,</hi> and is <hi>inexorable</hi> to thoſe who
<hi>ſhut up their bowels</hi> againſt them that
ask them. In order therefore to our
thus pleaſing God, let us make light of
mony, and tranſmit it into the <hi>heavenly</hi>
treaſures, <hi>where neither moth nor ruſt
doth corrupt, nor thieves break through
and ſteal,</hi> nor Tyrants are able to ſeize
and take it from us, but where it ſhall
be kept to our eternal advantage under

The difference in this reſpect between

               </argument>
               <p>THE primitive Chriſtians being of
ſuch a meek, compaſſionate and
benevolent temper as we have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
them, it cannot be thought but
that they were of a very quiet diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and <hi>peaceable</hi> converſation; and
the having been ſo large in that, will
excuſe me for being ſhorter in this.
When our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> came to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
his religion in the world, he
gave a <hi>Law</hi> ſuitable to his <hi>nature,</hi> and
to the <hi>deſign</hi> of his coming into the
world, and to the exerciſe of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as he is <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> a Law
of mildneſs and gentleneſs, of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and forbearance towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
we are commanded <hi>to follow
peace with all men, to follow after the
things that make for peace, as much as
in us lies to live peaceably with all men;</hi>
we are forbidden all feuds and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
enjoyned <hi>not to revenge our ſelves,
but to give place unto wrath, to let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46588:348"/>
and wrath, and anger, and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and evil ſpeaking be put away from
us, with all malice, to be kind one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tender hearted, forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even as God for Chriſt's ſake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives
us.</hi> Theſe are the Laws of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
which whenever they are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertained produce the moſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and <hi>good natur'd</hi> principles, the
moſt innocent and quiet carriage.
This eminently appeared in the life of
our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> who was the moſt
incomparable inſtance of <hi>kindneſs</hi> and
<hi>civility,</hi> of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>quietneſs;</hi> we
never find him all his life treating any
with ſharpneſs and ſeverity but the

of ſurly, malicious, <hi>ill-natur'd</hi> fellows,
and could be wrought upon by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
methods; otherwiſe his mildneſs
and humility, the affablity and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingneſs
of his converſation, and his
remarkable kindneſs to his greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
were ſufficiently obvious both
in his life and death; and ſuch was the

formerly valued our mony and eſtates
before all things elſe, do now put them

               <p>But for the better underſtanding of
this it may be uſeful to obſerve, what a

the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion made in the

had been under, or had been ſuſpected
of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> declaring their
abſolution, and recommending them to
be received in the number of the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi>
Laſtly, they were granted to all,

whereever they came, upon the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

to be <hi>Catholick</hi> and Orthodox, and as

A piece of prudence which <hi>Julian</hi> the

Upon which account the ancient <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>

eſp;ecially to ſuch of the Clergy as were

it being directed to the Biſhop of that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46588:353"/>
Dioceſs, that he would receive him,
that ſo he might take no offence, but
that peaceable concord and agreement
might be maintained between them.
By theſe arts the prudence of thoſe
times ſought to ſecure the peace of the
Church, and as much as might be, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all diſſentions that might ariſe.
And where matters of any greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>Hence thoſe many <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>

did the good Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
take for compoſing the <hi>Arrian</hi> contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
which then began firſt to infect
and over-run the world? How much
his heart was ſet upon it, his ſollicitous

arguments, what affectionate intreaties

Letter (yet extant in his Life)
which he wrote to the Authors of thoſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46588:354"/>
impious and unhappy controverſies.
But when this would not do, he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of <hi>three hundred and eighteen Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>
and in his Speech at the opening
of that Council conjur'd them by all
that was dear and ſacred to agree,<note place="margin">Ibid. lib. 3. c. 12. p. 489.</note> and
to compoſe thoſe diſſentions which
were riſen in the Church, which he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
proteſted he looked upon as
more grievous and dangerous than any
war whatſoever, and that they created
greater trouble and inquietude to his

without ever reading them, he
bundled and ſeal'd them all up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and having reconciled and made

immediately threw them into the fire

Or, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> in

to undergo what ever you have a mind

yet for your peace and quiet ſake,
am content to be baniſhed the throne, and

               <p>The ſame excellent temper ruled in

after they had fallen into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

               <p>Nay, when good men were moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
about the main and foundation-articles
of Faith, ſo as ſometimes rather
to hazard <hi>Peace,</hi> than to betray the
<hi>Truth,</hi> yet in matters of <hi>indifferency,</hi>
and ſuch as only concern'd the <hi>rituals</hi>
of Religion, they mutually bore with
one another, without any violation of
that Charity which is the great law of
Chriſtianity. Thus in that famous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
about the keeping of <hi>Easter,</hi>
ſo much agitated between the <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the obſervation of it, yet alwayes

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46588:356"/>
though differing in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Rites and Ceremonies, yea even
when their rites and cuſtoms ſeemed to
claſh by meeting together at the ſame
place. Thus when <hi>Polycarp</hi> came to
<hi>Rome</hi> from the Churches of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to
treat with <hi>Pope Anicetus</hi> about this and
ſome other affairs, though they could
not ſatisfie each other to yield the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
yet they <hi>kiſſed</hi> and embraced
one another with mutual endearments,
received the Holy Communion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and <hi>Anicetus</hi> to do the greater
honour to <hi>Polycarp</hi> gave him leave to
celebrate and conſecrate the <hi>Euchariſt</hi>
in his Church, and at laſt they parted
in great peace and friendſhip; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the obſervotion not at all
hindering the agreement and harmony
of the Churches, it being agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them by common conſent (ſays
<hi>Sozomen</hi> ſpeaking of this paſſage) that
in keeping this feſtival they ſhould each
follow their own <hi>cuſtom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">H. Eccl. lib. 7. c. 19. p. 734.</note> but by no
means break the <hi>peace</hi> and communion
that was between them; for they
reckoned it <hi>(ſays he)</hi> a very fooliſh
and unreaſonable thing, that they
ſhould fall out for a few rites and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
who agreed in the main Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:46588:356"/>
The Chriſtians of thoſe times had
too deeply imbibed that precept of our
Saviour, <hi>love one another, as I have
loved you,</hi> to fall out about every nice
and trifling circumſtance; no, when
highlieſt provoked and affronted
they could <hi>forbear</hi> and <hi>forgive</hi> their
<hi>enemies,</hi> much more their <hi>brethren,</hi> and
were not like the <hi>waſpiſh</hi> Philoſophers
amongſt the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who were ready
to fall foul upon one another for every
petty and inconſiderable difference of
opinion that was amongſt them. So
<hi>Origen</hi> tells <hi>Celſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 5. p. 273.</note> Both amongſt your
Philoſophers and Phyſicians <hi>(ſay he)</hi>
there are <hi>Sects</hi> that have perpetual
feuds and quarrels with each other,
whereas we who have entertained the
Laws of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and have
learnt both to ſpeak and to do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his doctrine, <hi>bleſs them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
us, being perſecuted, we ſuffer it;
being defamed, we entreat;</hi> nor do we
ſpeak dire and dreadful things againſt
thoſe that differ from us in opinion, and
do not preſently embrace thoſe things,
which we have entertain'd: But as
much as in us lies we leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted
that may perſwade them to
change for the better, and to give up
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46588:357"/>
themſelves only to the ſervice of the
great Creatour, and to do all things as
thoſe that muſt give an account of their
actions. In ſhort, Chriſtians were careful
not to offend either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> but to
keep and maintain peace with both;
thence that excellent ſaying of <hi>Ephraem

The Laws of Chriſt that

in doing it. Chriſtians ſuch,
even under the heavieſt oppreſſions and
perſecutions, and that when they had
power to have righted and reveng'd
themſelves. An excellent paſſage in
<hi>Tertullian</hi> to that purpoſe. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Chriſtian Souldiers in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s
Army. The famous Story of
<hi>Mauricius,</hi> and the <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion
under <hi>Maximinianus</hi> reported at large
out of <hi>Eucherius Lugdunenſis.</hi> The
injuſtice of the charge brought againſt
them by the Heathens, of being enemies
to Civil Government. Accuſed of
Treaſon. Of their refuſing to ſwear
by the Emperours genius. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
to ſacrifice for the Emperours
ſafety, and why they did ſo. Their
refuſing to own the Emperours for gods,
and why. Their not obſerving the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Feſtivals of the Emperours, and
the reaſons of it. Accuſed of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and holding unlawful Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
An account of the <hi>Collegia</hi> and
Societies in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
forbidden upon that account.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46588:358"/>
The Chriſtian Aſſemblies no unlawful
Conventions. A vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the unlawful factions
forbidden by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws. Their
confident challenging their enemies to
make good one charge of disturbance
or rebellion againſt them. Their Laws
and principles quite contrary. The
Heathens them ſelves guilty of rebellions
and factions, not the Chriſtians. The
Teſtimony given them by <hi>Julian</hi> the
Emperour. A reflection upon the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for corrupting the
doctrine and practice of Chriſtianity
in this affair. Their principles and
policies in this matter. <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s
poſition, that 'tis lawful to depoſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
and heretical Princes, and that the
Primitive Chriſtians did it not to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
Diocleſian, &amp;c.</hi> only becauſe they
wanted power, cenſured and refuted.
This contrary to the avow'd principles
of honest Heathens.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HOw much Chriſtian Religion
tranſcribed into the lives of its
profeſſors contributes to the happineſs
of men not only in their ſingle and
<hi>private</hi> capacities, but as to the <hi>publick</hi>
welfare of humane ſocieties, and to the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46588:358"/>
common intereſts and conveniences of
mankind, we have already diſcovered
in ſeveral inſtances; now becauſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy</hi>
and Civil Government is the
great ſupport and inſtrument of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
peace and happineſs, we ſhall in the
laſt place conſider how eminent the firſt
Chriſtians were for their <hi>Submiſſion</hi>
and <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And certainly there's ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular inſtance wherein Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtianity did more triumph in
the world, than in their exemplary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Powers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
under which they lived; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
their perſons, revering their

contrary to the Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and where they were, ſubmitting to
the moſt cruel penalties they laid upon
them with the greateſt calmneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
of ſoul. The truth is, one great
deſign of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law is to ſecure
the intereſts of <hi>civil</hi> Authority; <hi>our
Saviour</hi> has expreſly taught us, <hi>that we
are to give unto Caeſar the things that

When a <hi>tax</hi> was demanded of him,
though he was the <hi>Son</hi> of God, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
not to pay <hi>tribute</hi> unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
even when it put him to the expence

The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> though unjuſtly ſcourged
before the <hi>Council,</hi> yet made no tart

When <hi>Herod</hi> had cut off S. <hi>James</hi> his

               <p>Nor did this excellent ſpirit die with

would give them a long life, a ſecure
reign, and undiſturbed houſe, powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
faithful Senators, honeſt Subjects,
a quiet people, and indeed what-ever they
can wiſh for, either as men or Emperours.</hi>
They that think <hi>(ſays he)</hi> that we are not

let them look into the commands of
God recorded in our <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which
we freely expoſe to the view of all;

there they'l find that we are enjoyn'd

ſo much ſuch as they? And yet we are
plainly and particularly commanded to
<hi>pray for Kings, for Princes, and all that
are in authority, that the state of things

               <p>For all <hi>cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>tributes</hi> none

rated upon them for maintenance of

the <hi>Heathen-temples,</hi> yet for all <hi>other</hi>
tributes they had cauſe to give the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> thanks for ſo faithfully paying
what was due, it being their principle

inſomuch, that ſhould they examine

would eaſily find that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
to pay that one tax was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
compenſated and made up in

The truth is, they were admirably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and conſcientious as in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo eſpecially in thoſe that related
to the publick, and concern'd their
duty and obedience to their rulers and

               <p>Nor were they thus only in <hi>Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>

endeavouring to pacifie and

               <p>
                  <hi>Maximianus Caeſar</hi> (whom <hi>Diocleſian</hi>
had lately taken to be his Colleague in
the <hi>Empire)</hi> a bad man, and a bitter
perſecutor of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> was ſent
into <hi>France</hi> to ſuppreſs a mutiny and
rebellion riſen there; to ſtrengthen his
Army there was added to it a band of
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> called the <hi>Thebaean Legion,</hi>
conſiſting according to the manner of
the <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Six thouſand ſix hundred
ſixty ſix</hi> faithful, expert and reſolute
Souldiers. Coming to <hi>Octodurus</hi> (a
place in <hi>Savoy)</hi> and being ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſacrifice to the gods, he cauſes his
Army to come together, and commands
them under a great penalty to ſwear
by the <hi>Altars</hi> of their gods, that they
would unanimouſly fight againſt their
enemies, and perſecute the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
as enemies to the gods; which the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baean
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46588:364"/>
Legion</hi> no ſooner underſtood, but
they preſently withdrew to <hi>Agaunum</hi>
(a place eight miles off, call'd at this
day S. <hi>Mauritzs,</hi> from <hi>Mauricius</hi> the
Commander of the <hi>Legion;</hi> a place
equally <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed

the wicked and ſacrilegious command,
and to refreſh themſelves, tyred with
ſo long a march; but the Emperour
taking notice of the Army as they came
to ſwear, quickly miſs'd the <hi>Legion,</hi>
and being angry, ſent Officers to them
to require them forthwith to do it;
who enquiring what it was that they
were commanded to do, were told by
the meſſengers, that all the Souldiers
had offered ſacrifices, and had taken
the forementioned oath, and that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
commanded them to return preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and do the like: To whom the
heads of the Legion mildly anſwered,
That for this reaſon they left <hi>Octodurus,</hi>
becauſe they had heard they ſhould be
forced to ſacrifice, that being <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
and that they might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
with the Altars of <hi>Devils,</hi> they
thought themſelves oblig'd to worſhip
the <hi>living</hi> God, and to keep that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46588:364"/>
which they had entertain'd in the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> to the laſt hour of their life: that
as they were a <hi>Legion</hi> they were ready
to any ſervice of the war; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to him to commit ſacriledge as he
commanded, they could not yield.</p>
               <p>With this Anſwer the meſſengers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and told the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that
they were reſolved not to obey his
Commands, who being tranſported
with anger, began thus to vent his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
<hi>Do my Souldiers think thus to
ſleight my Royal Orders, and the holy
Rites of my Religion? Had they only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
the Imperial Majeſty it would have
call'd for publick vengeance, but together
with the contempt of me, an affront is
offered to Heaven, and the Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is as much deſpiſed as I am. Let the
obſtinate Souldiers know, that I am not
only able to vindicate my ſelf, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the quarrel of my gods. Let my
faithful Servants make haſte, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
every tenth man according as the
fatal lot ſhall fall upon him: By this
equal death let thoſe whoſe lot it ſhall be
to die firſt, know, how able</hi> Maximian
<hi>is ſeverely to revenge both himſelf and his
gods.</hi> With that the command is given,
the <hi>Executioners</hi> ſent, the Emperours
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46588:365"/>
pleaſure made known, and every <hi>tenth</hi>
man is put to death; who chearfully
offer'd their necks to the Executioners,
and the only contention amongſt them
was, who ſhould <hi>firſt</hi> undergo that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
death. This done, the <hi>Legion</hi> is
commanded to return to the reſt of
the Army. Whereupon <hi>Mauritius</hi> the
General of the <hi>Legion,</hi> calling it a little
aſide, thus beſpake them; I congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
(moſt excellent <hi>fellow-ſouldiers)</hi>
your <hi>courage</hi> and valour, that for the
love of Religion, the command of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>

you have ſeen your fellow-ſouldiers,
with minds full of joy, undergoing a
glorious death: how much afraid was
I, leſt being arm'd (and how eaſie is it
for ſuch to do ſo) you ſhould under a
pretence of <hi>defending</hi> them have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to <hi>hinder</hi> their happy fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals:
—See, I am encompaſſed round
with the bodies of my fellow-ſouldiers,
whom the diſmal Executioner has torn
from my ſide; I am beſprinkled with
the blood of the <hi>Saints,</hi> my clothes died
with the reliques of their ſacred <hi>blood;</hi>
and ſhall I doubt to follow their <hi>death,</hi>
whoſe <hi>example</hi> I ſo much congratulate
and admire? Shall I concern my ſelf to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46588:365"/>
think what the <hi>Emperour</hi> commands,
who is equally ſubject to the ſame law
of mortality with my ſelf?—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
we once took this <hi>Military
Oath,</hi> that with the utmoſt hazard of
our lives we would defend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth;
this we then engaged
to the <hi>Emperours,</hi> though no <hi>Heavenly</hi>
Kingdom was promiſed to us; and if
we could promiſe this out of devotion
to a <hi>Military</hi> ſervice, what then is to
be done, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſes ſo much
to them that engage with him? Let
us willingly expoſe our lives to this
moſt precious death; let us ſhew a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
courage, and an unviolated faith.
Methinks I ſee thoſe bleſſed ſouls ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before <hi>Chriſts</hi> tribunal, whom the
<hi>Emperours</hi> Officer juſt now baniſhed
out of their bodies: that's the true
glory which will recompence the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this life with a bleſſed eternity:
Let us by the Meſſengers unanimouſly
return this Anſwer to the Emperour;
<hi>We acknowledge,</hi> Caeſar, <hi>that we are your
Souldiers, and took up Arms for defence
of the Empire; nor did we ever baſely
betray our truſt, or forſake our ſtation, or
deſer'd that the brand either of fear or
cowardiſe ſhould be ſet upon us; nor
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46588:366"/>
ſhould we ſtick now to obey your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
did not the Laws of Chriſtianity,
wherein we have been inſtructed, forbid
us to worſhip devils, and to approach the
polluted altars of the gods. We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
you are reſolved either to defile us
with ſacrilegious worſhip, or to terrifie us
with a decimation: Spare any further

meetings (thoſe of them eſpecially that

of the <hi>Senate,</hi> or the conſtitution of
the Prince) partly by reaſon of their
number, and the great confluence to
them, partly by reaſon of their luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

by the State with a jealous eye, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
after that the <hi>Commonwealth</hi>

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46588:370"/>

theſe <hi>Colledges</hi> to the antient

               <p>Under the notions of theſe <hi>ſocieties,</hi>
it was, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

looking ſomewhat like thoſe <hi>illegal</hi>

the eye of an <hi>enemy)</hi> it was the leſs
wonder, if the Heathens accuſed them
of hatching treaſon, and the Magiſtrates
proceeded againſt them as contemners
and violaters of the Law.</p>
               <p>But to this the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> anſwered,
that their <hi>meetings</hi> could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
amongſt the <hi>unlawful factions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertull. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. c. 38. p. 30.</note>
having nothing common with them;
that indeed the wiſdom and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the State had juſtly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſuch factions to prevent ſeditions,
which might thence eaſily over-run
and diſquiet all Councils, Courts,

But no ſuch thing could be ſuſpected
of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Aſſemblies, who were
frozen as to any <hi>ambitious deſigns</hi> of
honour or dignity, ſtrangers to nothing
more than publick affairs, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

would be ſome reaſon to condemn

the ſame <hi>united,</hi> as is every <hi>ſingle</hi>
perſon, hurting no man, grieving no

together, it was rather to be called a
<hi>Council</hi> than a <hi>Faction.</hi> To which <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
adds,<note place="margin">Contr. Celſ. lib. 1. p. 5.</note> That ſeeing in all their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
they ſought nothing but truth,
they could not be ſaid to conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Laws,</hi> ſeeing they deſigned
nothing but to get from under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

be thundred againſt with curſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privations,
every bold and treacherous
<hi>Prieſt</hi> be authorized to brand his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
perſon with the odious names of
<hi>Infidel, Heretick</hi> and <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> and be
<hi>Apoſtolically</hi> licenſed to ſlander and
<hi>belibel</hi> him, and furniſhed with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
to free his Subjects from their
duty and allegiance, and to allure them
to take up arms againſt him? And if
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46588:372"/>
theſe courſes fail, and men ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
loyal, they have diſciples ready by
<hi>ſecret</hi> or <hi>ſuddain</hi> arts to ſend him out of
the world. And if any man's conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be ſo nice as to boggle at it, his
ſcruples ſhall be removed, at worſt it
ſhall paſs for a <hi>venial</hi> crime, and the
<hi>Pope</hi> perhaps (with the help of a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that it be done for the intereſt
of the <hi>Catholick</hi> cauſe) by his <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
ſhall create it meritorious.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (whoſe wit and
learning were imployed to uphold a
tottering cauſe) maintains it ſtiffly,<note place="margin">De Rom. Pontif. lib. 5. c. 7. Col. 891.</note> and
in expreſs terms, that if a <hi>King</hi> be an
<hi>Heretick</hi> or an <hi>Infidel</hi> (and we know
what they mean by that, nay he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
names the <hi>reformed</hi> Princes of
<hi>England</hi> amongſt his inſtances) and
ſeeks to draw his Dominions unto his
Sect; it is not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to deprive him of his Kingdom.
And although he knew that the whole
courſe of antiquity would fly in the
face of ſo <hi>bold</hi> an aſſertion, yet he goes
on to aſſert, that the reaſon why the
<hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> did not attempt
this upon <hi>Nero, Diocleſian, Julian</hi> the
Apoſtate and the like, was not out of
<hi>conſcience,</hi> or that they boggled out of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46588:373"/>
a ſenſe of duty, but becauſe they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>means</hi> and power to effect it. A
bold piece of falſhood this, and how
contrary to the plain and poſitive Laws
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the meek and <hi>primitive</hi>
ſpirit of the Goſpel! But by the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi>
leave it could not be for want
of power, for if, as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves, he
may be <hi>Maſter</hi> of any man's life that
<hi>undervalues</hi> his own,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 4. pag. 9.</note> it was then as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to have ſlain <hi>Nero</hi> or
<hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as it was of later times for
<hi>Gerard</hi> to piſtol the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
or <hi>Ravillac</hi> to ſtab the King of <hi>France.</hi>
Nay, take one of his own inſtances,
<hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> a Prince bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and that left no method unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to ſeduce his Subjects to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm</hi>
and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet though the
greateſt part of his Army were <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
they never ſo much as whiſpered a
treaſonable deſign againſt him, uſing
no other <hi>arms</hi> (as we noted out of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen)</hi>
but <hi>prayers and tears.</hi> Had
S. <hi>Paul</hi> been of their mind, he would
have told the <hi>Chriſtian Romans</hi> quite
another ſtory, and inſtead of bidding
them be ſubject to <hi>Nero not only for
wrath, but for conſcience ſake,</hi> would
have inſtructed them to take all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46588:373"/>
to have murdered or depoſed
him. But I ſhall not reckon up the
villanies they have been guilty of in
this kind, nor purſue the odious and
pernicious conſequences of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and practice; thus much I could
not but take notice of, being ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
oppoſite to the whole tenor of
the Goſpel, and ſo great a ſcandal to
<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And I verily believe that
had the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> been no
better <hi>Subjects,</hi> than their <hi>Emperours</hi>
were <hi>Princes,</hi> had they practiſed on
them thoſe bloody artifices which have
been common amongſt thoſe that call
themſelves the only <hi>Catholicks,</hi> that
barbarous dealing would have been a
greater curb to the flouriſhing of the
Goſpel, than all the <hi>ten</hi> perſecutions.
For how could an impartial <hi>Heathen</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have believed their doctrine to
have been of God, had their actions
been ſo contrary to all principles of
natural Divinity. Sure I am <hi>Pagan
Rome</hi> was in this caſe more <hi>Orthodox,</hi>
and their <hi>Pontifices</hi> far better <hi>Doctors</hi>
of <hi>Divinity:</hi>

What penalties inflicted upon delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

This puniſhment how expreſſed

rigour of it ſometimes mitigated.
Delinquent Clergy-men degraded, and

               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:46588:375"/>
HAving travelled through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſtages of the ſubject I had
undertaken; I ſhould here have ended
my journey, but that there one thing
remains, which was not properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
under any particular head,
being of a general relation to the
whole; and that is to conſider what
<hi>Diſcipline</hi> was uſed towards offenders
in the antient Church; only premiſing
this, that the Chriſtian Church being
founded and eſtabliſhed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a
<hi>Society</hi> and Corporation <hi>diſtinct</hi> from
that of the Common-wealth, is by the
very nature of its conſtitution (beſides
what poſitive ground and warrant
there may be for it in <hi>Scripture)</hi> inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with an <hi>inherent</hi> power (beſides
what is borrowed from the <hi>Civil</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate)
of cenſuring and puniſhing
its members that offend againſt the
Laws of it, and this in order to the
maintaining its peace and purity. For
without ſuch a fundamental power as
this, 'tis impoſſible that as a Society
it ſhould be able to ſubſiſt, the very
nature of a community neceſſarily
implying ſuch a right inherent in it.
Now for the better underſtanding what
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46588:376"/>
this power was, and how exerciſed in
the firſt Ages of the Church, we ſhall
conſider theſe four things: What were
the uſual <hi>crimes</hi> that came under the
diſcipline of the antient Church; what
<hi>penalties</hi> were inflicted upon delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
perſons; in what <hi>manner</hi> offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were dealt with; and by <hi>whom</hi> this
diſcipline was adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What the uſual <hi>crimes</hi> and
offences were which came under the
diſcipline of the antient Church; in
the general they were any offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law, any vice or
<hi>immorality</hi> that was either <hi>publick</hi> in it
ſelf, or made known and made good to
the Church. For the holy and good
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe times were infinitely
careful to keep the honour of their
Religion unſpotted, to ſtifle every ſin
in its birth, and by bringing offenders
to publick ſhame and penalty to keep
them from propagating the malignant
influence of a bad example. For this
reaſon they watched over one another,
told them <hi>privately</hi> of their faults and
failures, and when that would not do,
brought them before the <hi>cognizance</hi>
of the Church. 'Tis needleſs to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
up particular crimes, when none
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46588:376"/>
were ſpar'd. Only becauſe in thoſe
days by reaſon of the violent heats of
perſecution the great temptation which
the weaker and more unſettled Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were expoſed to, was to <hi>deny</hi> their
profeſſion, and to offer <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to the
Heathen-gods, therefore lapſing into
<hi>Idolatry</hi> was the moſt common ſin that
came before them, and of this they had
very frequent inſtances, it being that
which for ſome Ages mainly exerciſed
the Diſcipline of the Church. This
ſin of Idolatry or denying <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
thoſe times was uſually committed
theſe three ways: Sometimes by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to the rage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their enemies, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a virtual renouncing Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
This was eſpecially remarkable
under the <hi>Diocletian</hi> perſecution in the
<hi>African</hi> Churches. For <hi>Diocletian</hi> had
put forth an <hi>Edict</hi> that <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
ſhould deliver up their Scriptures and
the Writings of the Church to be
burnt. This command was proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with great rigour and fierceneſs,
and many Chriſtians to avoid the ſtorm
delivered up their Bibles to the ſcorn
and fury of their enemies. Hence
they were ſtyled <hi>Traditores</hi> (of whom
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46588:377"/>
there is frequent mention in <hi>Optatus</hi>
and S. <hi>Auguſtin)</hi> with whom the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
refuſing to joyn after the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was over, the difference broke out
into Schiſm and faction, and gave birth
to that unhappy Sect of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi>
which ſo much exerciſed the Chriſtian
Church. Otherwhiles Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
guilty of Idolatry by <hi>actual</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing,
or worſhipping Idols; theſe
were called <hi>Thurificati,</hi> from their
burning <hi>incenſe</hi> upon the altars of the
Heathen Deities, and were the groſſeſt
and vileſt ſort of Idolaters. Others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
fell into this ſin by baſely <hi>corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the Heathen Magiſtrate, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
a <hi>warrant</hi> of ſecurity from him
to exempt them from the penalty of
the Law, and the neceſſity of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and denying <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Theſe were
called <hi>Libellatici,</hi> of whom we ſhall
ſpeak more afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What <hi>penalties</hi> and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were inflicted upon delinquent
perſons, and they could be no other
than ſuch as were agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and conſtitution of the Church,
which as it tranſacts only in <hi>ſpiritual</hi>
matters, ſo it could inflict no other than
<hi>ſpiritual</hi> cenſures and chaſtiſements.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46588:377"/>
'Tis true indeed that in the firſt Age
eſpecially, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had a power to
inflict <hi>bodily</hi> puniſhments upon offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which they ſometimes made uſe of
upon great occaſions, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> ſtriking
them dead upon the place for their
notorious couzenage and groſs hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie:
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> puniſhed <hi>Elymas</hi>
with blindneſs for his perverſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
oppoſition of the Goſpel; and
this doubtleſs he primarily intends by
his <hi>delivering over perſons unto Satan,</hi> for
no ſooner were they excommunicated
and cut off from the body of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but <hi>Satan</hi> as the common <hi>Serjeant</hi>
and Jaylor ſeized upon them, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by actual poſſeſſing, or ſome other
ſign upon their bodies made it appear
that they were <hi>delivered</hi> over into his
power. This could not but ſtrike a
mighty terrour into men, and make
them ſtand in awe of the <hi>cenſures</hi> of
the Church; and queſtionleſs the main
deſign of the divine providence in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
this <hi>extraordinary</hi> gift was to
ſupply the defect of civil and coercive
power, of which the Church was then
wholly deſtitute, and therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome more than ordinary aſſiſtance
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46588:378"/>
eſpecially at its firſt conſtitution, ſome
viſible and <hi>ſenſible</hi> puniſhments to keep
its ſentence and determinations from
being ſleighted by bold and contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
offenders. How long this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
power laſted in the Church, I
know not, or whether at all beyond
the <hi>Apostles</hi> age. The common and
ſtanding penalty they made uſe of was
<hi>Excommunication</hi> or ſuſpenſion from
communion with the Church; the
cutting off and caſting out an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſon as a <hi>rotten</hi> and infected
member, till by repentance and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
diſcipline he was <hi>cured</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
and then he was re-admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Church-ſociety, and to a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ordinances and priviledges
of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>This way of puniſhing by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
was not originally inſtituted
by our <hi>Lord</hi> or his Apoſtles, but had
been antiently practiſed both amongſt
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 'Twas commonly
practiſed by the <hi>Druids</hi> (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> who
lived amongſt them informs us) who,<note place="margin">De Bell. Gall. lib. 6. p. 135.</note>
when any of the people became irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and diſorderly, preſently <hi>ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
them from their ſacrifices. And
the perſons thus ſuſpended were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46588:378"/>
in the number of the moſt <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi>
and <hi>exercrable</hi> perſons: All men
ſtood off from them, <hi>ſhun'd</hi> their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and converſe as an <hi>infection</hi> and
a plague: they had no benefit of <hi>Law,</hi>
nor any <hi>honour</hi> or reſpect ſhewn to
them; and of all <hi>puniſhments</hi> this they
accounted moſt <hi>extreme</hi> and ſevere.

               <p>This ſuſpenſion and the penance that

ſometimes for the whole life; nay, in
ſome caſes it was not taken off at death,

of God, without any teſtimony of their

<hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> giving <hi>Fabius</hi>

tells him, that one of the Biſhops
that ordain'd him return'd after to the
Church, with tears bewailing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
whom at the inſtance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
he receiv'd unto <hi>Lay-communion.</hi>
The ſame <hi>Cyprian</hi> writing about this

that returning to the Church

he was re-admitted, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

and ſpeaking elſewhere of <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides</hi>

making account he was very
well dealt with, if upon his repentance
he might but communicate as a <hi>Laick,</hi>
and be received amongſt the number
of the <hi>Faithful.</hi> This S. <hi>Baſil</hi> tells us
was an ancient <hi>Canon</hi> and practice of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46588:380"/>
the Church, and accordingly ordains,
that a <hi>Deacon</hi> guilty of fornication

being thruſt down into the rank of the
<hi>Laity,</hi> ſhould in that quality be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Communion.</p>
               <p>Indeed they ſtrove by all ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable

and there joyn'd himſelf to <hi>Novatian</hi> a

his deſign, between them they
ſtarted this amongſt other <hi>heretical</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that the lapſed who through fear
of ſuffering had fallen in the time of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46588:380"/>
perſecution were not to be admitted
to repentance, and that though they
ſhould never ſo oft confeſs their ſins,
and never ſo ſincerely forſake them, yet
there was no hope of ſalvation for
them, at leaſt-wiſe (for ſo I incline to
underſtand them) that it was not in the
power of the <hi>Church</hi> to abſolve or give
them any hopes of pardon, leaving
them to the judgment of God; ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

that <hi>Novatus</hi> and his party,

were dealt with, both as to their
<hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> and <hi>penance,</hi> and as to their
<hi>abſolution.</hi> This affair was uſually ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
after this order; At their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
aſſemblies (as we find in <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian)</hi>
amongſt other parts of their holy
exerciſes,<note place="margin">Apol. c. 39. p. 31.</note> there were exhortations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs,
and a <hi>divine cenſure;</hi> for the
judgment is given with great weight,
as amongſt thoſe that are ſure that God
beholds what they do; and this is one
of the higheſt <hi>praeludiums</hi> and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of the <hi>judgment</hi> to come, when
the delinquent perſon is baniſhed from
the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Prayers, Aſſemblies,</hi>
and all holy <hi>Commerce.</hi> By this paſſage
we clearly ſee, that the firſt thing in
this ſolemn action was to make <hi>reproofs</hi>
and <hi>exhortations,</hi> thereby to bring the
offender to the ſight and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his faults; then the <hi>ſentence</hi> or
<hi>cenſure</hi> was paſſed upon him, whereby
he was ſuſpended, not only from the
Communion of the Holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but
from all holy commerce in any (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>publick)</hi> duty of religion. We
cannot imagine, that in every perſon
that ſtood under this capacity, a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
ſentence was always denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46588:381"/>
him, it being many times ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the fact he had done was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and <hi>notorious,</hi> as in the caſe of the
<hi>lapſed</hi> that had offered ſacrifice, for in
this caſe the offender was look'd upon
as <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
commerce forborn towards him.
'Tis true, that in ſome caſes the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
(as we ſhall ſee more anon) finding
ſuch lapſed perſons truly penitent did
receive them into <hi>private</hi> Communion,<note place="margin">Euſeb. H.</note>
ſo did thoſe Martyrs <hi>Dionyſius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
ſpeaks of in his Letter to <hi>Fabius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. lib. 6. c. 42. p. 241.</note> they took the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
that had fallen into idolatry into
their company, and Communicated
with them both at <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Meals;</hi>
but to <hi>publick</hi> Communion they were
never admitted till they had exactly
fulfilled the diſcipline of the Church,
which principally conſiſted in many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
acts of repentance and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
more or leſs according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the offence.</p>
               <p>During this ſpace of penance they
appeared in all the formalities of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and mourning,<note place="margin">Tert. de poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. c. 9. p. 127.</note> in a ſordid and
ſqualid habit,<note place="margin">Vid. Euſeb. lib. 5. c. 28. p. 197.</note> with a ſad countenance,

                  <hi>Church doors,</hi> (for they were not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to enter in) falling down upon their
knees to the Miniſters as they went in,
and begging the prayers of all good
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> for themſelves, with all the
expreſſions and demonſtrations of a
ſorrowful and dejected mind; reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lower they lay in repentance,
the higher it would exalt them; the
more ſordid they appeared, the more
they ſhould be cleanſed and purified;
the leſs they ſpared themſelves, the
more God would ſpare them: at theſe
times alſo they made open <hi>confeſſion</hi> of
their faults, this being accounted the
very ſpring of repentance, and without
which they concluded it could not be
real,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Out of confeſſion</hi> (ſays <hi>Tertullian)
is born repentance, and by repentance
God is pacified;</hi> and therefore without
this neither riches nor honour would
procure any admiſſion into the Church.
Thus <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports,<note place="margin">Ibid. lib. 6. c. 34. p. 232.</note> that when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi>
the Emperour would have gone
in with the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> upon
<hi>Eaſter-eve</hi> to have partaked of the
prayers of the Church, the Biſhop of
the place would by no means ſuffer it,
unleſs he firſt made confeſſion of his
ſins, and paſſed through the order of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46588:382"/>
the <hi>Penitents,</hi> being guilty of very
great and enormous ſins; which 'tis
ſaid he very willingly ſubmitted to, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
by his actions his real and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
fear of the Divine Majeſty. This
ſtory, though as to the main of it, it
might be true, yet as faſtened upon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
the Emperour, I have formerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be falſe, and that it's rather
meant of one <hi>Philippus</hi> who was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> but however this was,
'tis certain that a perſon as great as he,
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> for his bloody and
barbarous ſlaughter of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi>
was by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Millain</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended,
brought to publick confeſſion,
and forced to undergo a ſevere courſe
of penance for eight months together;
when after great demonſtrations of a
hearty ſorrow, and ſincere repentance,
not more rigidly impoſed upon him,
than readily and willingly received by
him, after his uſual proſtrations in the
Church (as if unworthy either to ſtand
or kneel) crying out in the words of
<hi>David, My ſoul cleaveth unto the duſt,
quicken thou me according to thy word,</hi>
after having oft torn his hair, beat his
forehead, water'd his cheeks with <hi>tears,</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:46588:383"/>
and humbly beg'd peace and pardon,
he was abſolved, and reſtored to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church; of which
paſſage they who would know more,
may find the ſtory largely related by
<hi>Theodoret.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">H. Eccl. lib. 5. c. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeverity was uſed towards of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
partly to make them more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of their ſins, partly to affright and
deterr others, but principally to give
<hi>ſatisfaction</hi> both to God and his
Church concerning the reality and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of their repentance. Hence it is
that theſe <hi>Penances,</hi> in the Writings of
thoſe times are ſo often called <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi>
for whenever thoſe Fathers uſe
the word, 'tis either with reſpect to
<hi>men</hi> or <hi>God;</hi> if to <hi>men,</hi> then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that by theſe external acts of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and mortification they <hi>ſatisfie</hi>
the Church of their repentance,<note place="margin">Aug. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid. c. 65. tom. 3.</note> and
make reparation for thoſe offences and
ſcandals which they had given by
their ſins: If to <hi>God,</hi> then 'tis taken
for the acknowledgement of a mans
fault, and the begging of pardon
and remiſſion:<note place="margin">De Lapſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 177.</note> Thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſtate of impenitent ſinners,
aggravates it by this, that they do <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46588:383"/>
nec ſatisfacere,</hi> ſin, but make no
ſatisfaction, <hi>i.e.</hi> (as in the very next

deflere,</hi> confeſs and bewail their
ſins;<note place="margin">Ibid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 173<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and before, diſcourſing about
Gods being the only object of tears
and ſorrow for ſin, which is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
to God and not man, he tells us
'tis God that is to be appeaſed by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
that he being greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
is to be intreated by a long and
full repentance, as being alone able to
pardon thoſe ſins that are committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. So that the ſatisfaction
which they reckon'd they made to God
conſiſted in ſeeking to avert his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
and to regain his forfeited fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by a deep contrition and ſorrow
for ſin, by a real acknowledgement and
forſaking of their faults, and by an
humble giving to God the glory both
of his mercy and his juſtice.<note place="margin">Tert. de poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. c. 8. p. 126, 127<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

or Intendment of ſatisfaction: And
a little after he deſcribes it thus; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>is that whereby we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
our offence to God, not as if
he were ignorant of it, but inaſmuch as
by confeſſion ſatisfaction is forwarded, by
confeſſion repentance is produced, and by
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46588:384"/>
repentance God is appeaſed.</hi> The ſame
both he, <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſe in the ſame ſence; which I note
the rather, becauſe of that abſurd and
impious doctrine, ſo currant amongſt
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and which they pretend
to derive from theſe very Fathers, that
by works of penance <hi>compenſation</hi> is
made to God for the debt of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that was contracted, whereby at
leaſt the temporal penalties due to ſin
are <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> expiated and done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
But this beſides that it is flatly
repugnant to the doctrine of <hi>antiquity,</hi>
how much 'tis derogatory to the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
of divine grace, and the <hi>infinite</hi>
ſatisfaction of the <hi>Son</hi> of God, I ſhall not
now ſtand to diſpute. To return there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
This term of penance was uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exacted with great rigour, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
diſpenſed with, no indulgence or
admiſſion being granted till the full
time was compleated. Therefore <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
ſmartly chides with ſome <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
who had taken upon them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the lapſed before their time,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 9. p. 21.</note> and
that whereas in leſſer offences men
were obliged to the juſt time of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and to obſerve the order of
diſcipline, they in a crime of ſo heinous
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46588:384"/>
a nature had hand over head admitted
them to Communion before they had
gone through their penance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and fulfilled the regular cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and orders of the Church.</p>
               <p>The time of penance being ended,
they addreſſed themſelves to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church for <hi>Abſolution,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. Epiſt. 11. p. 24.</note>
hereupon their repentance was taken
into examination, and being found to
be ſincere and real, they were openly
re-admitted into the Church by the
impoſition of the hands of the Clergy,
the party to be abſolv'd kneeling down
between the knees of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or in
his abſence of the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his hand upon his head ſolemnly
bleſſed and abſolved him, whence
doubtleſs ſprang that abſurd and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
calumny which the <hi>Heathens</hi> laid
upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they were
wont <hi>Sacerdotis colere genitalia;</hi> ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
were they to catch at any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
which the moſt crooked and
malicious invention could inſinuate and
ſuggeſt: The penitent being abſolved,
was received with the univerſal joy
and acclamation of the people, as one
returned from the ſtate of the <hi>dead</hi> (for
ſuch 'tis plain they accounted them
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46588:385"/>
while under a ſtate of guilt, eſpecially
the lapſed, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> poſitively affirms
them to be) being embraced by his
brethren,<note place="margin">Id. Epiſt. 27. p. 39.</note> who bleſſed God for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,<note place="margin">Vid. Epiſt. 46. p. 60.</note>
and many times <hi>wept</hi> for the joy
of his recovery, who upon his abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was now reſtored to a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, and to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acts of Church-Communion, which
by his crimes he had forfeited, and
from which he had been ſuſpended, till
he had given ſatisfactory evidence of
his repentance, and purpoſe to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
under the exact diſcipline of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
This was the ordinary way
wherein they treated <hi>criminals</hi> in the
Primitive Church; but in caſes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
(ſuch as that of danger of death)
they did not rigidly exact the ſet time
of penance, but abſolved the perſon,
that ſo he might dye in the peace and
communion of the Church. The ſtory
of <hi>Serapion</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned,<note place="margin">Euſeb. H.</note> who being ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſurpriz'd with death while he was

able to dye till he had received ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
ſent for the Presbyter to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
his repentance and abſolve him;
but he being alſo at that time ſick, ſent
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46588:385"/>
him a part of the <hi>Conſecrated</hi> elements,
which he had by him, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
whereof he breathed out his
ſoul with great comfort and ſatisfaction
that he now died in Communion with
the Church.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the time of theſe <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary</hi>
humiliations often varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the circumſtances of the
caſe, it being much in the power of the
Biſhops and Governours of the Church
to ſhorten the time, and ſooner to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
and take them into Communion,
the <hi>Medicinal</hi> vertue of repentance ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not in the <hi>duration,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. 2. ad Amphil.</note> but the <hi>manner</hi>
of it, as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks in this very caſe.
A learned man has obſerved to my
hand four particular caſes wherein they
were wont to <hi>anticipate</hi> the uſual time
of abſolution:<note place="margin">Forbeſ. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct. Hiſt.</note> The firſt was (what I
obſerved but now) when perſons were
in danger of death;<note place="margin">Th. lib. 12. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. p. 674.</note> this was agreed to
by <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 52. ad Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. p. 67.</note> and the Martyrs, and the
<hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, and the Letters (as he
<hi>tells</hi> us) ſent through the whole World
to all the Churches; this alſo was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for by the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. 13.</note>
That as for thoſe that were at the point
of death, the ancient and <hi>Canonical</hi>
rule ſhould be obſerved ſtill, that when
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46588:386"/>
any were at the point of death they
ſhould by no means be deprived of the
laſt and neceſſary <hi>Viaticum, i.e.</hi> the
Holy Sacrament, which was their great
<hi>Symbol</hi> of Communion. And here for the
better underſtanding ſome paſſages it
may not be unuſeful once for all to add
this note, that whereas many of the
ancient <hi>Canons</hi> (of the <hi>Illiberine</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
eſpecially) poſitively deny commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to ſome ſorts of penitents even at
the <hi>hour</hi> of death, they are not to be
underſtood, as if the Church merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
denied all <hi>indulgence</hi> and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to any penitent at ſuch a time, but
only that it was thought fit to deny
them the uſe of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which
was the great <hi>pledge</hi> and teſtimony of
their communion with the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond caſe was in time of <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
perſecution, conceiving it but fit
at ſuch times to diſpenſe with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the diſcipline, that ſo <hi>Penitents</hi>
being received to the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and to the communion of the Church,
might be the better armed and enabled
<hi>to contend earneſtly for the Faith.</hi> This
was reſolved and agreed upon by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 54. p. 76.</note>
and a whole Council of <hi>African</hi>
Biſhops, whereof they give an account
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46588:386"/>
to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in
regard perſecution was drawing on,
they held it convenient and neceſſary,
that communion and reconciliation
ſhould be granted to the <hi>lapſed,</hi> not
only to thoſe that were a <hi>dying,</hi> but
even to the <hi>living,</hi> that they might
not be left naked and unarmed in the
time of battel, but be able to defend
themſelves with the ſhield of <hi>Chriſts</hi>
body and blood. For how <hi>(ſay they)</hi>
ſhall we teach and perſwade them to
ſhed <hi>their</hi> blood in the Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
if we deny them the benefit of <hi>his</hi>
blood? How ſhall we make them fit to
drink the <hi>cup</hi> of martyrdom, unleſs we
firſt admit them in the Church to a
right of communication to drink of the
<hi>cup</hi> of the blood of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> A third
caſe wherein they relaxed the ſeverity
of this diſcipline was, when great <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi>
were concerned, or ſuch perſons
as were likely to draw great numbers
after them; in this caſe they thought
it <hi>prudent</hi> and reaſonable to deal with
perſons by ſomewhat milder and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
methods, leſt by holding them to
terms of rigour and auſterity, they
ſhould provoke them to fly off either
to <hi>Heathens</hi> or to <hi>Hereticks.</hi> This
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46588:387"/>
courſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us he took, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with the neceſſity of the times,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 52. ubi prius.</note>
and like a wiſe Phyſician yielded a little
to the humour of the patient, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for his health, and to cure his
wounds; and quotes herein the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who dealt
juſt ſo with <hi>Trophimus</hi> and his party;<note place="margin">Epiſt. 55. p. 85.</note>
and elſewhere, that out of an earneſt
deſire to regain and reſettle the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
he was ready to connive at many
things, and to forgive any thing, and
did not examine and exact the greateſt
crimes with that full power and ſeverity
that he might, inſomuch that he thought
he did almoſt <hi>offend</hi> himſelf in an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal
remitting other mens <hi>offences.</hi>
Laſtly, in abſolving penitents, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating
the rigours of their repentance,
they uſed to have reſpect to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
of the penitent, to his <hi>Dignity,</hi> or
<hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Infirmity,</hi> or the <hi>courſe</hi> of his
paſt life; ſometimes to the greatneſs of
his <hi>Humility,</hi> and the impreſſion which
his preſent condition made upon him.
Thus the <hi>Ancyran</hi> Council impowers
Biſhops to examine the manner of mens
Converſion and Repentance,<note place="margin">Can. 5. vid.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
either to moderate,<note place="margin">Conc. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. Can. 12.</note> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their time of penance, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46588:387"/>
that regard be had to their
Converſation both before and ſince
their offence, that ſo clemency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
may be extended to them.
So for the caſe of perſons of more than
ordinary <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>dignity,</hi> or of a more
tender and delicate <hi>Conſtitution,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot. lib. 2. c. 4. p. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>
determines, that in chaſtiſing
and puniſhing their offences they be
dealt withal in a more peculiar manner
than other men,<note place="margin">Tom. 4.</note> leſt by holding them
under over-rigorous penalties they
ſhould be tempted to fly out into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
and ſo throwing off the reins of
modeſty, and the care of their own
happineſs and ſalvation, ſhould run
headlong into all manner of vice and
wickedneſs. So wiſely did the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and piety of thoſe times deal
with offenders, neither letting the reins
ſo looſe as to patronize <hi>preſumption,</hi> or
encourage any man to ſin, nor yet hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them ſo ſtrait, as to drive men into
<hi>deſpair.</hi>

               <p>The fourth and laſt circumſtance
concerns the <hi>Perſons</hi> by whom this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
was adminiſtred; now though
'tis true that this affair was managed in
the <hi>Publick</hi> Congregation, and ſeldom
or never done without the conſent and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46588:388"/>
approbation of the people (as <hi>Cyprian</hi>
more than once and again expreſly tells
us) yet was it ever accounted a <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial</hi>
act, and properly belonged to
them.<note place="margin">Apol. c. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaking of Church

<hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Majores natu,</hi>
the <hi>Seniors</hi> that preſide in the Church,
tells us, that to them belongs the
power of <hi>baptizing, impoſing hands,
(viz.</hi> in penance) and <hi>ordination.</hi> By
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> it was primarily and uſually
adminiſtred, the determining the time
and manner of repentance, and the
conferring pardon upon the penitent
ſinner, being acts of the <hi>higheſt</hi> power
and jurisdiction, and therefore reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to appertain to the higheſt order in
the Church. Therefore 'tis provided
by the <hi>Illiberine</hi> Council,<note place="margin">Can. 32. p. 40.</note> that penance
ſhall be preſcribed by none but the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;</hi>
only in caſe of neceſſity, ſuch as
ſickneſs, and danger of death, by leave
and command from the Biſhop, the
<hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Deacon</hi> might impoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and abſolve. Accordingly we
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46588:388"/>
find <hi>Cyprian</hi> amongſt other directions to
his Clergy how to carry themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the lapſed,<note place="margin">Epist. 12. p. 25. Vid. Conc. 2.</note> giving them this, that
if any were over-taken with ſickneſs,<note place="margin">Carthag.</note>
or preſent danger,<note place="margin">Can. 4.</note> they ſhould not ſtay
for his coming, but the ſick perſon
ſhould make confeſſion of his ſins to
the next <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or, if a Presbyter
could not be met with, to a <hi>Deacon,</hi>
that ſo laying hands upon him he might
depart in the <hi>peace</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>But though while the number of
Chriſtians was ſmall, and the bounds
of particular Churches little, Biſhops
were able to manage theſe and other
parts of their office in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
yet ſoon after the task began to
grow too great for them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
about the time of the <hi>Decian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
when Chriſtians were very
much multiplyed, and the number of
the lapſed great, it ſeem'd good to the
prudence of the Church partly for the
eaſe of the Biſhop, and partly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the modeſty of perſons in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought before the whole Church
to confeſs every crime, to appoint a
<hi>publick penitentiary</hi> (ſome holy, grave,
and prudent <hi>Presbyter)</hi> whoſe office it
was to take the confeſſion of thoſe ſins
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46588:389"/>
which perſons had committed after <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi>
and by prayers, faſtings, and other
exerciſes of mortification to prepare
them for abſolution. He was a kind of
<hi>Cenſor morum,</hi> to enquire into the lives
of <hi>Christians,</hi> to take an account of
their failures, and to direct and diſpoſe
them to repentance. This Office con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for ſome hundreds of years, till
it was abrogated by <hi>Nectarius</hi> (S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtomes</hi>
predeceſſor in the See of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople)</hi>
upon the occaſion of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
ſcandal that aroſe about it.<note place="margin">Socrat. H. Eccl. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. c. 19. p. 278. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Sozom. lib. 7. c. 16. p. 726.</note> A
woman of good rank and quality had
been with the <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
all her ſins committed ſince bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
he enjoyn'd her to give up her
ſelf to faſting and prayer; but not long
after ſhe came to him, and confeſſed,
that while ſhe was converſant in the
Church to attend upon thoſe holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
ſhe had been tempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
folly and leudneſs with a <hi>Deacon</hi> of
the Church, whereupon the <hi>Deacon</hi>
was immediately caſt out; but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being excedingly troubled at the
ſcandal, and the Holy Order hereby
expoſed to the ſcorn and deriſion of
the Gentiles, <hi>Nectarius</hi> by the advice of
<hi>Eudaemon</hi> a Presbyter of that Church
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46588:389"/>
wholly took away the Office of the
publick <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> leaving every one
to the care and liberty of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to prepare himſelf for the Holy
Sacrament. This account <hi>Socrates</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
us he had from <hi>Eudaemon</hi>'s own
mouth; and <hi>Sozomen</hi> adds, that almoſt
all Biſhops follow'd <hi>Nectarius</hi> his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in abrogating this Office.</p>
               <p>But beſides the ordinary and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
office of the Clergy, we find even
ſome of the Laity, the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and
<hi>Confeſſors,</hi> that had a conſiderable hand
in <hi>abſolving</hi> penitents, and reſtoring
them to the communion of the Church.
For the underſtanding of which we
are to know, that as the Chriſtians of
thoſe times had a mighty reverence for
<hi>Martyrs</hi> and Confeſſors as the great
Champions of Religion, ſo the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
took upon them to diſpenſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
caſes; for it was very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary
in times of perſecution for
thoſe who through fear of ſuffering
had lapſed into Idolatry to make their
addreſs to the Martyrs in priſon, and
to beg peace of them, that they might
be reſtored to the Church; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
their petitions, and weighing
the circumſtances of their caſe did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46588:390"/>
grant their requeſts, mitigate
their penance, and by a <hi>note</hi> ſigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their hands ſignifie what they had
done to the Biſhop, who taking an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their condition, abſolved and
admitted them to communion. Of
theſe <hi>Libelli,</hi> or Books granted by the
<hi>Martyrs</hi> to the <hi>lapſed,</hi> there is mention
in <hi>Cyprian</hi> at every turn, who complains
they were come to that exceſſive num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 10. 11, 12. &amp; alibi.</note>
that <hi>thouſands</hi> were granted almoſt
every day;<note place="margin">Epiſt. 14. p. 27.</note> this many of them took
upon them to do with great ſmartneſs
and authority, and without that reſpect
that was due to the Biſhops, as appears
from the <hi>note</hi> written to <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
in the name of the <hi>Confeſſors;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 16. p. 29.</note>
which becauſe 'tis but ſhort, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſhews the form and manners of thoſe
<hi>pacifick Libells,</hi> it may not be amiſs to

peremptory and magiſterial, and
therefore of this confidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
and careleſneſs in promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
granting theſe <hi>letters</hi> of <hi>peace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 22. p. 34.</note>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> not without reaſon complains

               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Libells granted by the
Martyrs, there were other <hi>Libelli</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Heathen-Magiſtrates (of which
it may not be impertinent to ſpeak a
little) whence the lapſed that had had
them were commonly called <hi>Libellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi>
and they were of ſeveral ſorts;
ſome writing their names <hi>in Libellis</hi>
in Books, and profeſſing themſelves to
worſhip <hi>Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and the reſt of
the Heathen Gods, preſented them
to the Magiſtrate; and theſe did <hi>really</hi>
ſacrifice, and pollute not their <hi>ſouls</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but their <hi>hands</hi> and their <hi>lips</hi> with
unlawful ſacrifices, as the Clergy of
<hi>Rome</hi> expreſſes it in a letter to S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 31. p. 44.</note>
theſe were called <hi>Thurificati,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. Epiſt. 52. p. 66, 67.</note>
and <hi>Sacrificati,</hi> from their having offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
incenſe and ſacrifices. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of this nature was that <hi>Libell</hi> that
<hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of in his Epiſtle to the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46588:391"/>
Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 97. lib. 10.</note> preſented to him
while he was <hi>Proconſul</hi> of <hi>Bithynia,</hi>
containing a Catalogue of the names
of many, ſome whereof had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
to be <hi>Christians</hi> and denied it,
others confeſſed they had been ſo ſome
years ſince but had renounc'd it; all
of them adoring the Images of the
gods, and the Emperours Statue, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſacrifice, and <hi>blaſpheming Chriſt;</hi>
and were accordingly diſmiſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
by him. Others there were
who did not <hi>themſelves</hi> ſign or preſent
any ſuch <hi>Libells,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. 31. p. 44.</note> but ſome Heathen-friends
for them (and ſometimes out of
kindneſs they were encouraged to
it by the Magiſtrates themſelves) and
were hereupon releaſed out of priſon,
and had the favour not to be urged to
ſacrifice.<note place="margin">Can. 7. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodic. Tom. 2. pa. 1. p. 12.</note> Nay, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
ſpeaks of ſome Maſters, who to
eſcape themſelves compelled their <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
to do ſacrifice for them, to whom
he appoints a three years penance for
that ſinful compliance and diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
A third ſort there was, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the edge and keenneſs of their
<hi>Judges</hi> was to be taken off with a ſum of
<hi>money,</hi> freely confeſſed to them that
they were Chriſtians and could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46588:391"/>
pray'd them to give them a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>
of diſmiſſion, for which they would
give them a ſuitable reward: Theſe
were moſt properly called <hi>Libellatici</hi>
and <hi>Libellati. Cyprian</hi> acquaints us
with the manner of their addreſs to
the Heathen Magiſtrate, bringing in
ſuch a perſon thus ſpeaking for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
I had both <hi>read</hi> and <hi>learnt</hi> from
the Sermons of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God is not to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to Idols,
nor to <hi>worſhip</hi> Images; wherefore that
I might not do what was unlawful,
having an opportunity of getting a
<hi>Libell</hi> offered, (which yet I would not
have accepted had it not offered it
ſelf) I went to the Magiſtrate, or cauſed
another to go in my name and tell him,
that I was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and that it was
not lawful for me to ſacrifice, nor to
approach the altars of the Devils, that
therefore I would give him a reward to
excuſe me, that I might not be urged
to what was unlawful. Theſe though
not altogether ſo bad as the <hi>Sacrificati,</hi>
yet <hi>Cyprian</hi> charges as guilty of <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi>
Idolatry, having defiled their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
with the purchaſe of theſe
Books, and done that by <hi>conſent,</hi> which
others had <hi>actually</hi> done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:46588:392"/>
I know <hi>Baronius</hi> will needs have it
(and boaſts that all that had written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him were miſtaken in the caſe)
that theſe <hi>Libellatici</hi> were not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from denying Chriſt,<note place="margin">Annal. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. ad Ann. CCLIII Num. XX. &amp; ſeqq. tom. 2.</note> nor gave mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to that end; that they only requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Magiſtrate, that they might
not be compelled to offer ſacrifice, that
they were ready to <hi>deny Chriſt,</hi> and
were willing to give him a reward to
diſpence with them only ſo far, and to
furniſh them with a <hi>Libell</hi> of ſecurity,
and that they did really deny him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they obtained their <hi>Libell.</hi> But
nothing can be more plain both from
this and ſeveral other paſſages in <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
than that they did not either <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi>
or <hi>privately</hi> ſacrifice to Idols, or
actually <hi>deny</hi> Chriſt; and therefore
bribed the Magiſtrate, that they might
not be forced to do what was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
And hence <hi>Cyprian</hi> argues them
as guilty by their <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>conſent,</hi> and
that they had <hi>implicitly</hi> denied <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
how?<note place="margin">De Lapſis, p. 176.</note> by <hi>actually</hi> doing it? No, but
by <hi>pretending</hi> they had done what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were really guilty of. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Cardinals</hi> miſtake aroſe from a
not right underſtanding the ſeveral
ſorts of the <hi>Libellatici,</hi> the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46588:392"/>
of (as we have ſhewn) did <hi>actually</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
and deny <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now having taken this view of
the ſeverity of diſcipline in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church, nothing remains but to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi>
and <hi>imitate</hi> their piety and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
their infinite hatred of ſin, their
care and zeal to keep up that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and purity of manners that had
rendred their Religion ſo renowned
and triumphant in the world: A diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
which how happy were it for the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> world, were it again reſetled
in its due power and vigour, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
is the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> of
our <hi>own Church</hi> concerning the ſolemn
<hi>Quadrageſimal</hi> Penances and Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>In the Primitive Church</hi> (ſay the
<hi>Preface</hi> to the Commination) <hi>there was
a godly Diſcipline, that at the beginning
of Lent, ſuch perſons as ſtood convicted
of notorious ſin were put to open penance,
and puniſhed in this world, that their
ſouls might be ſaved in the day of the
Lord; and that others admoniſhed by
their example, might be the more afraid to
offend: Which ſaid Diſcipline it is much
to be wiſhed might be reſtored again.</hi>
