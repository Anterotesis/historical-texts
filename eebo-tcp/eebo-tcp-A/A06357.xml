            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

produce, a people presented themselues to mine eyes, cloathed in linnen garments, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what low descending, of a gesture and garbe as I may say, maidenly and well nigh effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; of a countenance shy and somewhat estranged: yet smiling out a glosed and bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full familiarity, whose vse in the Companies affaires occasioned their presence there.</p>
                  <p>Truth to say, mine eyes vnacquainted with such obiects, tooke vp their wonder and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and this admiration the badge of a fresh Trauailer, bred in mee the importunity of a Questioner: I asked what manner of people those were, so strangely notable, and notably strange? Reply was made, they were <hi>Banians,</hi> a people forraigne to the knowledge of the Christian world; their Religion, Rites, and Customes, sparingly treated of by any, and they no lesse reserued in the publication of them: but some opinions they deriued from the Philosopher <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> touching Trans-animation of soules. It was thought the nouelty would make the discouery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, gratefull and acceptable to some of our Countrey men, that some of my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors had beene scrutinous to bring this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to light; but whether deterred with the Fictions and <hi>Chymeraes,</hi> wherewith <hi>Banian</hi> writings abound, that might make it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of acceptation, or the shynesse of the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> who will scarce admit a stranger
<pb facs="tcp:9362:7"/>
conuersation, the worke was left to him that would make a path through these impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The President, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Kerridge,</hi> was vrgent with me, to redeeme their omissions, and to see if I could worke somewhat out of this forsaken Subiect. The truth was, I was willing to earnest his loue to mee by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, who to giue this vndertaking the better promotion, interested himselfe in the worke, by mediating my acquaintance with the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> whose eminence of place, was an attractiue to draw on this discouery and manifestation.</p>
                  <p>I that thought my obseruance would bee well tooke, if I could present my Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with any thing new from these forraigne parts, begun my worke, and essayed to fetch materials for the same out of their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, and by renewed accesse, with the helpe of Interpreters, made my collections out of a booke of theirs called the SHASTER, which is to them as their Bible, containing the grounds of their Religion in a written word.</p>
                  <p>If any therefore bee affected to peruse or reuise the Religion, Rites, and Customes, of the said <hi>Banians,</hi> leauing out for the most part such prodigious Fictions as seeme inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on sense and reason; here they shall meete with the best Essence and ground of

this Sect, digested into such a forme, as shall best cleare the knowledge thereof, and such as I presume neuer had a like discouery by any yet in the Presse.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great God (say the <hi>Banians</hi>) being alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himselfe how hee might make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and power ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to others; for his great vertue had beene obscured and hid, if it had not beene commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to his creatures. What meanes might then bee better to giue euidence of both
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9362:9"/>
these, then the creation of a world, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therein?</p>
                     <p>For this cause the Almighty consulted with himselfe, about the making of this great worke, which men call the World or Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, and as the Ancients (say they) haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered; the Lord made foure Elements as the ground-worke of this mighty frame; to wit, Earth, Aire, Fire, and Water, which foure Elements were at first all mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a confusion, but the Almighty sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them in manner following.</p>
                     <p>First, it is deliuered, that by some great Cane or like instrument, hee blew vpon the Waters, which arose into a bubble, of a round forme like an egge, which spreading it selfe further and further, made the Firmament so cleare and transparent, which now compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the world about.</p>
                     <p>After this, there remaining the Earth, as the sediment of the Waters, and some liquid substance with the same; the Lord made of both these together, a thing round like a ball, which hee called the lower world, the more solid part whereof became the Earth, the more liquid the Seas; both which making one Globe, he by a great noyse or humming sound, placed them in the middest of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, which became aequi-distant from it on euery side.</p>
                     <p>Then he created a Sunne and Moone in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9362:9"/>
Firmament, to distinguish the times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and thus these foure Elements that were at first mixt together, became separate and assigned to their seuerall places; the Aire to his place, the Earth to his, the Water to his place, and the Fire to his place.</p>
                     <p>These Elements thus disposed, each of them discharged his seuerall parts; the Aire filled vp whatsoeuer was emptie; the Fire began to nourish with his heate; the Earth brought forth his liuing creatures; and the Sea his. And the Lord conueyed to these a seminall vertue, that they might bee fruitfull in their seuerall operations, and thus the great world was created.</p>
                     <p>This World, as it had his beginning from foure Elements, so it was measured by foure maine points of the Compasse; <hi>East, West, North,</hi> and <hi>South</hi>; and was to be continued for foure Ages; and to be peopled by foure <hi>Casts</hi> or sorts of men, which were maried to foure Women appointed for them, of which wee shall speake as order may giue occasion.</p>
                     <p>God hauing thus made the world, and the creatures thereto belonging; then God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, as a creature more worthy then the rest, &amp; one that might be most capable of the workes of God. The earth then did at Gods voyce and command, render this creature from his bowels, his head first appearing, and after that his body, with all the parts and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9362:10"/>
members of the same, into whom God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed life, which as soone as he had receiued, witnessed it selfe: for, colour began to shew it selfe red in his lippes, his eye liddes began to disclose the two lights of Nature, the parts of his body bewrayed their motion, and his vnderstanding being informed, hee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Maker, and gaue him worship.</p>
                     <p>That this creature might not bee alone, who was made by nature sociable; God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded him with a Companion, which was Woman; to whom not so much the outward shape, as the likenesse of the minde and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position seemed agreeing: and the first mans name was <hi>Pourous,</hi> and the womans name was <hi>Parcoutee,</hi> and they liued conioyned together as Man and Wife, feeding on the fruites of the earth, without the destruction of any liuing creature.</p>
                     <p>These two liuing in this coniunction, had foure sonnes; the first was called <hi>Brammon,</hi> the second <hi>Cuttery,</hi> the third <hi>Shuddery,</hi> the fourth <hi>Wyse.</hi> These foure brethren were of Natures distinct each from the other; the foure Elements claiming in each of them a different predominance: For <hi>Brammon</hi> was of an earthly constitution, and therefore Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly; and <hi>Cuttery</hi> was of a fiery consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and therefore of a Martiall spirit. <hi>Shuddery</hi> was of a flegmaticke constitution, and therefore of a peaceable or conuersable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9362:10"/>
disposition; <hi>Wyse</hi> was of an ayery temper, and therefore full of contriuements and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions.</p>
                     <p>And because <hi>Brammon</hi> was of a melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly constitution, and ingenious; God indued him with knowledge, and appointed him to impart his Precepts and Lawes vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; his graue and serious looke, best fitting him for such a purpose: for which cause hee gaue him a Booke, containing the forme of diuine Worshippe and Religion.</p>
                     <p>And because <hi>Cuttery</hi> was of a Martiall temper, God gaue him power to sway king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with the Scepter, and to bring men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order, that the Weale-publicke might thriue by vnited indeauours for the common good: as an Embleme of which the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty put a sword into his hand, the instrument of victory and domination.</p>
                     <p>And because <hi>Shuddery</hi> was of a nature mild and conuerseable, it was thought meete, that he should bee a Merchant, to inrich the Common-wealth by Trafficke, that so euery place might abound with all things, by the vse of shipping and Nauigation: as a moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to put him in minde of which course of life, he had a paire of Ballances put into his hand, and a bagge of waights hung at his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, instruments most accommadate to his profession.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, because <hi>Wyse</hi> was of an Ayery tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9362:11"/>
whose conceipts vse to bee more subtle and apprehensiue, he was indued with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inuentions, and was able by his first thoughts, to forme any thing that belonged to the Mechanicke or handy-crafts man: For which purpose hee had a bagge of tooles or instruments, consisting of such variety, as were necessary to effectuate the workes of his fancy or conceipt.</p>
                     <p>Thus you haue the first Man and Woman, and the Progeny from them descending, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Banians</hi> tradition; and a world to be raised of so few, the persons (as they thinke) could not be better fitted to the same, the whole world being well considered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of, and subsisting by, such foure kindes of men.</p>

                     <p>Thus carried on with the hopes of some Aduenture, hee intended that whatsoeuer should first cope with him, should haue the sense of his fury; when being come to a Mountaine, whose height might make things farre distant visible to the eye, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a creature of goodly personage, like himselfe, stalking forward with a Martiall steppe, no lesse slowe then maiesticke in pace; which two approaching, as desirous to make experiment of each others fortitude vpon their meeting together, it appeared to bee a Woman, whose tresses in a comely fertility hung downe by her shoulders, which by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ayre, turned into a carelesse disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, euery blast that made an alteration in the same, gaue a new grace to her excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and made her presence more full of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty.

He made answer, That God the maker of light, that makes all obiects visible, had sent him thither to admire her excellency, which was so rare, That it was not fit it should bee sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a place so solitary, but had reserued it as a blessing for his eyes to view and admire: and because it was pitty desolation and lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse should bee a waster and obscurer of such louelynesse, hee had with hazard of his life aduentured ouer seuen Seas, to be blest with the enioyment thereof; a labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile worthy of so rich a recompence, and a worthy recompence and satisfaction for such

a labour: intreated her therefore, to accept of such a blessing as God had prouided for her by his society.</p>
                     <p>But she that could not be brought to thinke of a course of life different from her former, told him that in his absence shee found no need of his presence, neither did shee at that present stand inclined to accept of his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that therefore he would leaue her to the liberty of her owne free dispose. He loath to lose the happinesse of his eyes, importuned her to view the roomes of his building, as if he meant to wooe her with the faire workes of his handes: but she taking his importunity in euill part, told him, that if hee desired her not to shunne the place, hee would dismisse her freely. So turning from him with some displeasure, because shee was by him vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly detained, she fled from him with coye distaste, he almost expiring with the sadnesse of her departure, whose presence he could not purchase and his pleasure therein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her anger.</p>

So trauersing

the woods to and fro, hee at last came into a Valley, where hee found her cropping the flowers, and gratifying her senses with their seuerall odours; on whom intruding ere shee well perceiued, he said: Oh sweeter then all Flowers or sents that the field can boast of, whose louelinesse hath drawne me to make proffer of new kindnesse, fly me not who hast had a former tryall of my behauiour towards thee.

Further, he conceiued that the power aboue had not prompted him with the ieopardy of a thousand liues to cut a path through seuen ragged Seas in a floating habitation, but euen to that end that the bitternesse of all those euils might be sweetned by his enioyment of her.</p>
                     <p>She desirous to breake off this speech, as vngratefull to her eares, turned backe this discourse, desiring him to take his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments elsewhere, then in quest after her; that if she could preuaile with him in any request, it should be in this, to leaue her, and neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to disturbe her with such motions. So both departed, she indisdaine, he in sadnesse and sorrow, for such dismission: giuing him onely this as a doubtfull comfort at their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that if she found her selfe inclined to his society, she knew where to finde him, and to manifest to him such alteration,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wyse</hi> likewise seeing <hi>Brammon</hi> to lose his respect, the more to make him despised sought to bring in a new forme of Religion, communicated to him in vision, concerning the worshippe of Images, and bowing to Pagods vnder greene trees, with other new ceremonies; which since <hi>Brammons</hi> booke contained not, the dispute was great whether they should be receiued as Canonicall, but vpon <hi>Wyses</hi> asseueration that they were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from God, they were receiued as part of the Ceremoniall Law.</p>
                     <p>Thus euery day presenting new platformes of wickednesse, and sinnes that made a noyse, God grew angry, and the heauens were cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with blacknesse and terror, the Seas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to swell as if they meant to ioyne with the cloudes in Mans destruction, great noyse was heard aloft, such as vseth to dismay mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wretches, and thunder and lightning fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the Poles, such as seemed to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a finall wracke to the Earth; but as if the world needed cleansing of his defilement, and pollution, there came a Flood, that couered

                     <p>Seeing therefore the first Age miscarried by their sinfulnesse, (for whose purity God had so well prouided) the Almighty deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to beginne the second Age by three persons of greater perfection and excellency, then the other, called, <hi>Bremaw, Vystney,</hi> and <hi>Ruddery.</hi>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:9362:27"/>The Almighty therefore descending from heauen vpon a great Mountaine, called <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purbatee,</hi> vpon the top of the same the Lord pronounced his word, and said, Rise vp <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maw,</hi> the first of liuing Creatures in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Age, the earth then did render from her wombe <hi>Bremaw</hi> at the voyce of God, who did acknowledge and worshippe his Maker: and by a second and third Command from the same place, raised <hi>Vystney,</hi> and <hi>Ruddery,</hi> who with no lesse reuerence adored their Maker likewise.</p>
                     <p>But God that maketh nothing without his vse or end, did not make these to liue idle, but to be seruiceable in the worlds restoring; to the first therefore which was <hi>Bremaw,</hi> hee gaue the power to make the Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (say the <hi>Banians</hi>) as great persons doe not their worke but by deputies, so neither was it fit God should be seruile to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but giue them their being by his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

meete they should bee fitted with meanes capable for the discharge of their seuerall charges. That <hi>Bremaw</hi> therefore might haue power to make the Creatures, hee indued him with the Abilities of Creation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.

Lastly, that <hi>Ruddery</hi> might bee a fit Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of Gods Iustice, God gaue into his possession whatsoeuer might tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of liuing Creatures; therefore <hi>Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery</hi> was made the Lord of Death, and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whatsoeuer might tend to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Man, whether it were Sicknesse, Famine, Warre, or Pestilence, or any thing else that might bee a plague for sinne.</p>
                     <p>According also to the seuerall Assignations of these persons to their particuler Charges, they were alloted a determinate time of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon Earth.

                     <p>Nought wanted now, but that they should euery one in their seuerall turnes shew the powers conferred vpon them.

The second Tract vnfolded their ceremoniall Law, shewing what cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes they were to vse in their worship.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9362:30"/>
meete to each Cast or Tribe: such was the summe of this Booke deliuered to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maw,</hi> of which particulars if any desire more distinct knowledge, we shall propose the pith and substance of this in that which followes.</p>
                     <p>First then the Tract that containeth the Morall Law, and was by <hi>Bremaw</hi> published to the Nations, comprised in the same eight Commandements; which are these following.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>The first Commandement, Thou shalt not kill any liuing Creature whatsoeuer it bee, hauing life in the same; for thou art a Creature of mine, and so is it, thou art indued with a soule, and it is indued with the same, thou shalt not therefore spill the life of any thing that is mine.</p>
                        <p>The second, Thou shalt make a Couenant with all thy fiue senses. First with thine eyes that they behold not things that bee euill. Secondly with thine eares that they heare not things that bee euill. Thirdly with thy tongue that it speake not things that bee euill. Fourthly with thy pallate that it taste not things that bee euill, as wine or the flesh of liuing Creatures. Fifthly with thy hands, that they touch not things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:9362:31"/>The third, Thou shalt duely obserue the times of deuotion, thy washings, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and prayers, to the Lord thy God: with a pure and vpright heart.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, Thou shalt tell no false tales or vtter things that bee vntrue, by which thou mightest defraud thy Brother in dealings, bargaines, or Contracts, by this cosenage, to worke thine owne peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</p>
                        <p>The fift, Thou shalt be charitable to the poore, and administer to his need, Meate drinke and Money, as his necessity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and thine owne ability inableth thee to giue.</p>
                        <p>The sixt, Thou shalt not oppresse, iniure or doe violence to the poore, vsing thy power vniustly to the Ruine and ouerthrow of thy Brother.</p>
                        <p>The seuenth, Thou shalt celebrate certaine Festiuals, yet not pampering thy body with excesse of any thing, but shalt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue certaine seasons for fasting, and breake off some houres of sleepe for wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9362:31"/>
that thou mayest be fitter for deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holinesse.</p>
                        <p>The eight, Thou shalt not steale from thy Brother any thing how little soeuer it bee of things committed to thy trust in thy profession or calling, but shalt content thy seife with that which hee shall freely giue thee as thy hyre, considering that thou hast not right to that which another man calleth his.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>These eight Commandements are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst the foure Tribes or Casts, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating to each two Commandements in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Brammon</hi> and <hi>Shuddery</hi> the Priest and the Merchant man are bound in greatest strictnesse of Religious obseruance, and hold the greatest agreement in their worshippe; and <hi>Cuttery</hi> and <hi>Wyse</hi> the Ruler &amp; the Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts man, do most correspond in theirs.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Bramanes</hi> which are the Priests, they giue the first and second Commandements, as placing the strictest parts of Religion in these two things. First in the preseruation of liuing Creatures from destruction. Next in Abstinence from things forbidden, as in the eating of Flesh, or drinking of Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9362:32"/>
which obseruance they doe also strictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne the Merchant-men.</p>
                     <p>Next, more particularly they apportion to <hi>Shuddery,</hi> as most proper to his profession, the third, and fourth Commandements, which two precepts inioyne to Deuotion, and binde from cosenage in their dealings, a sinne too incident to those that are conuersant in the ballance and waights, who are so myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in that particular as may well neede an Act of Religion to restraine them from such fraudulency.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Cuttery</hi> their Rulers or Magistrates, they attribute the fift and sixt Commandements, as knowing oppression to bee a sinne most common to the Mighty, and inioyning them to Charity, who are best able to relieue the necessities of the poore.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Wyse</hi> the handycrafts man they referre the seuenth and eight Commandements, who haue neede of some free times of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyment, yet giuen to lauishment of their gettings, if they were not admonished by their Law; as also binding them from theft, a sinne to which they may be inuited by oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, as they discharge the duties of their callings in other mens houses.</p>
                     <p>In fine, to all these they owe a generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance, but are more particularly cautious in keeping the Commandements appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their owne peculiar Tribe or Cast.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:9362:32"/>Since then the Lawes or Precepts of any Religion, are no further to be allowed, than they seeme to be well grounded, and to carry truth and good reason with them: Me thinks by the way, here is something to be excepted against, in this <hi>Banian</hi> Law, which distingui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shing them from men of other Religions, may bee examined whether it may haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance or no.</p>
                     <p>The principall part of their Law admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing prodigious to opinion, we passe ouer, onely that which commeth into excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that which is laid downe in the first and second Commandement, and is enioyned the <hi>Bramanes</hi> and <hi>Banians</hi> to obserue, <hi>viz.</hi> First, that no liuing creature should be killed. Next, that they should not taste wine, or the flesh of liuing creatures.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the first, that they should not kill any liuing creature, the reason by which they confirme this precept, is because it is en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dued with the same soule that man is.</p>
                     <p>This we deny, for the <hi>Banians</hi> here seeme to halt in their Philosophy, and the learning of the Ancients, who haue deliuered, that there is a threefold kinde of soule. First, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getant soule, such as is in hearbes and plants. Secondly, a sentient soule, such as is in beasts. Thirdly, a reasonable soule, such as is in man; which soule hath more noble Acts to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it selfe from the other two; As also

that when the other doe <hi>interire cum corpore,</hi> perish with the body, this suruiueth, and therefore is not the same soule, as shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be prooued.</p>
                     <p>But that this Tenent of theirs denying the slaughter of liuing Creatures for Mans vse is nothing soueraigne, may appeare by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which after the Flood declareth Gods allowance in this particular, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     </q>
                     <p>Neither haue they beene abhorrent to this practise themselues, if the report of History may be credited, for <hi>Coel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rodigin</hi> reporteth, that the ancient <hi>Indians</hi> (which are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now in mention) when <hi>Liber Pater</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered those parts, were cloathed with the skinnes of wilde beasts, which were before by them slaughtered. Neither is this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9362:33"/>
by the <hi>Cutteries</hi> now, and therefore may seeme to be a Tradition of their owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, neither from the beginning by them practised, nor by authenticke law enioyned, that it should be an essentiall part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>And so we come to their second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which containeth in it two prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be excepted against. The first, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to drinke of wine: the next, the eating of flesh.</p>
                     <p>To the first, whereas the <hi>Bramanes</hi> and the <hi>Banians</hi> abstaine from wine by a Religious kinde of forbearance, at all times and seasons, without the absolute vse of the creature; we answer, that this is a Tradition voyde of ground or reason.</p>
                     <p>First, it is against the common end and vse of the Creature, which God hath made to comfort the heart of Man, obseruing these cautions. First, that men drinke not too much for the quantity. Secondly, for the manner, not in boasting or ostentation. Thirdly, for the time, that it be not when Religious fasts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire forbearance. Fourthly, for the place, that it be not where the vse of the creature may bring scandall.</p>
                     <p>Next, those that haue abstained from wine, haue abstained for diuers endes, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely obseruing the points of this <hi>Banian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction. The <hi>Romans</hi> did forbid their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9362:34"/>
the drinking of wine, but it was because they might not forget the bonds of duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Masters. They did also inioyne their women to abstaine from wine, but it was as <hi>Valer. Max.</hi> reports, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Ne in aliquod dedecus prolaberentur, quia proximus à Libero Patre intemperantiae gradus ad inconces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam venerem esse consueuit:</hi> Least they should fall into defame, for that the next neighbour to intemperancie is vnbridled lust. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> forbad their souldiers the iuyce of the grape, but it was least drowsinesse should oppresse them in their watch to a publique perill. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests called <hi>Sarabaitae,</hi> did for temperate ends abstaine from wine, but it was not for euer. That false Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by his Law forbad the drinking of wine, but it was a Tradition and Imposture of his owne, and the very <hi>Mullaes</hi> and Priests do not obserue it alwayes at present, as I my selfe haue beheld. The <hi>Leuites</hi> were forbid to drinke wine, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10.9. but it was onely before their enterance into the Sanctuary, that as <hi>Tremelius</hi> obserueth, they might not deliuer the Counsels of the Lord with a troubled minde, but know what was fit for their administration: this was no perpetuall prohibition. The <hi>Nazarites</hi> vowe was to drinke no wine, but this was not euer, but in the dayes of separation. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.2, 3. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi> vowed to drinke no wine, but this was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9362:34"/>
arbitrary, and not by Religious obligation, and not for euer, but for 30. yeeres, the space betweene <hi>Iehu</hi> and <hi>Ioachim</hi> the latter, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah.</hi> The ciuill abstinence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse is not to be condemned, but this absolute disannulment of the vse of Gods Creature.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the confirmations of men most temperate doe condemne this interdiction of wine. <hi>Gallen</hi> called it the nurse of old age: <hi>Mnesytheus</hi> allowed men <hi>laxare habenas,</hi> to loose the reynes in merry and harmelesse Potations. Rigid <hi>Seneca</hi> said, though a man ought not by drinking to drowne his sence, yet hee might by drinking drowne his cares. <hi>Plato</hi> that leaned to some of the opinions that this people hold, said that wine was a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of God against old age, that a man might haue <hi>Vsum liberaliorem vini,</hi> a more liberall vse of wine; and others thinke, that <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> did not altogether abstaine from the Greeke wines.

                     <p>To the second prohibition, laid downe in their second Commandement, concerning the eating of flesh, wee thus make our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
                     <p>First, it is certaine, that these <hi>Bramanes</hi> or <hi>Banians</hi> will not eate of the flesh of liuing creatures, that haue either had life in them, or the likenesse thereof; Egges therefore come within the precincts of their abstinence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they suppose the life to bee in the shell, by which they become hatched or animate; Roots also that are red are abstained from, because they hold consanguinity with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of blood. Neither will they cure their Feauers by <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> but by fasting, because they suppose some of the life issueth with the blood. The reason why they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre men from eating of flesh, is because they suppose there is a kinde of <hi>Metempsycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> or passage of soules from one creature to another, that the soules of men did enter into other liuing creatures, which should make men to abstaine from tasting of them. Which opinion of theirs, that it may appeare to bee vaine, wee will shew first who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this opinion, concerning such <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempsychosis,</hi> and how it hath had his successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of maintainers. Secondly, what is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9362:36"/>
and substance of this opinion. Thirdly, shew the reasons by which it is maintained. And lastly, proceed to the refutation of the same.</p>
                     <p>First, then for the originall of this opinion, though certainely these <hi>Indians</hi> are a people ancient, yet may it not be thought, that this opinion began first amongst them. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause History that is the light of times, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them to be slaughterers of liuing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Next, because <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that haue name for defending this <hi>Metempsycho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> or <hi>Metempsomatosis,</hi> haue an honoured mention amongst the people. It is likely therefore that they haue met with some of their writings, in this particular, by which they haue become knowne to them. Thirdly, because <hi>Iamblichus</hi> with <hi>Chaeremon</hi> the <hi>Stoicke,</hi> thinke it to be first maintained amongst the <hi>Egyptians</hi>: That from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> then it came to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that after it had beene rife amongst them, it was made more tenable by the wits and learnings of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Empedocles, Apolonius, Tyanius,</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> and might in <hi>Liber Paters</hi> discoueries of those parts, bee dispersed amongst this people, as well as by a Scholler of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who spread it in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it found fauour with <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> that superstitious Emperour, and was maintained by the <hi>Albanienses,</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> confuted by <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:9362:37"/>Secondly, touching the substance of this opinion that gained the Patronage of so great Schollers. They did hold, that there was a passage of soules of one Creature into another, that this Transmeation was of the soules of men into beasts, and of beasts into men: hence <hi>Pythagoras</hi> auerred himselfe to be <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Empedocles</hi> in his verse affirmed himselfe to bee a Fish. This made it an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable crime to eate flesh, least as saith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian in Apologet. Cont. gent. Cap.</hi> 48. <hi>Bubulam De aliquo Proauo, Quispiam obsonaret</hi>: Some should eate vp the Oxeflesh, that had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp his great Grandfathers soule. This opinion gayned propugnation and defence by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> by this meanes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that beleeuing the soules immortality, it might gaine assent with others by this thought of its suruiuing in other bodies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its relinquishment of the deceased, as <hi>Greg. Tholoss.</hi> affirmeth in his <hi>Syntax. Art. Mirab. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the reasons by which they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce assent to this Transanimation of soules, were these, because the soule was impure by the sinnes and corruptions of the body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was needfull it should bee sublimed from this corruption, by such transmeation out of one body into another, as Chymicall spirits gaine a purer essence by passing through the Still or Limbecke, diuers times;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9362:37"/>
euery Distillation taking away some of his grosse part, and leauing it more refined. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, because it was meete the soule should make a satisfaction for the filthinesse it had contracted, by remaining in the prison of the body, an exile from blessednesse a longer time, till this passage from one body to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had so purified them, that they might be fit to enter into the <hi>Elysium</hi> or place of blisse.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, in confutation of this opinion for prohibition of eating of flesh from supposall of a <hi>Metempsychosis</hi>; we maintaine that there is no such <hi>Metempsychosis,</hi> or transanimation of soules.</p>
                     <p>First, the immortality of the soule wee euince without this <hi>Chymera</hi> of the fancy, by an argument drawne from mans dissolution: this is the nature of all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that they should bee resolued into that which they were at first before their coniunction. Man is compounded of soule and body, the very dissolution of these two in death declareth this, for that cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated that was not before conioyned. This composition was by life, and a creature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, being in the soule alone, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that the soule had it before euer it came to the body, or else that which was dead could neuer haue liued by the meanes of that which was likewise dead. If the soule had this life before the body, it must needes haue the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9362:38"/>
same after in his separation, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is immortall.</p>
                     <p>Next in confutation of their reasons for this opinion: We answer. First, that the soule is not cleansed by such Transmeation from body to body, but rather defiled by that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse those bodies contract, as water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth defiled by infusion into an vncleane vessell. Much more, since they affirme the soules of men enter into beasts, which are creatures of greater impurity. Besides, those spirits that are subtiliated by Stils and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks, the fire is effectuall to their subliming, but the bodies haue not the goodnesse in them that may tend to the soules greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in such Transmeation. To conclude, it is improbable the soule should be enioyned to such a satisfaction for sinne, as tendeth to its greater defilement. These reasons therefore auaile little to confirme the soules Transmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the manner premised.</p>
                     <p>We in the last place shall prooue this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempsychosis,</hi> to be no other then a vaine imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by the reasons following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then, that the soules are not deriued from one another <hi>per traducem,</hi> by way of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, appeareth by <hi>Adams</hi> speech to <hi>Eue, Gen.</hi> 2 23. <hi>This is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh:</hi> he doth not say, soule of my soule and spirit of my spirit. It appeareth then, that though shee receiued her body
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9362:38"/>
from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet she had her soule from God. And this is that which <hi>Zachery</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.1. <hi>The Lord formeth the Spirit of a man within him</hi>: whence <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Eam infundendo creari, &amp; creando insundi,</hi> That the soule being put into man was created, and by creating was into man infused; if therefore God created some, why not all?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of spiritual things &amp; corporal, there shold seeme the same manner of increase; but the bodies haue new beings, therefore the soules.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the soules were purified by their passage from one body to another, then that man that had the soule last, should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all that knowledge that was enioyed by them that had it before, and so the Infant should be an experienced creature in past oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences: but we discerne no such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ripenesse of knowledge in one more then another, but that all our habits are gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by industry; which whilst <hi>Plato</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, saying, that the wandering soules did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from the diuell a draught of the cuppe of <hi>Obliuion,</hi> and so were forgetfull of that which is past; <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thus taunteth him: I<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Plato</hi> had tryall that his soule was obtused with such a draught: I wonder that he could remember, that his soule had lost her remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if this were true, it would follow, that the soules of beasts should be immortall,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9362:39"/>
which would be absurd to thinke in these bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowing times. Hauing therefore proued this opinion of passage of soules out of one body into another to be a fancy, and nothing reall, this may bee no iust cause to detaine them from eating the flesh of creatures, that haue had life in them. Neither would they, if there were great reason to the contrary, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as they doe in the Casts of <hi>Cuttery</hi> and <hi>Wyse,</hi> whom if they pleased they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine by the like iniunction. All which thus euidenced, this already deliuered may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to publish concerning the first Tract in the Booke deliuered to <hi>Bremaw,</hi> touching the Morall Law.</p>

to set forth the Religion of this people, shall be the Subiect of this present Chapter.</p>
                     <p>First, then they are enioyned to frequent washings of their bodies in Riuers: The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of which custome they say began with this second Age of the world, and was made a part of their worshippe, to keepe in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the destruction that was brought vpon the world, for their defilement and sinne. The Ceremony obserued in their washings is this: First, to besmeare their bodies in the mudde of the Riuer, the Embleme of mans filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and corruption by nature; then walking into the Riuer, and turning their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sunne, the <hi>Bramane</hi> vtters this prayer: <hi>Oh Lord, this man is foule and polluted as the Clay or Mudde of this Riuer, but the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof can purge off the defilement; doe thou in like manner cleanse away his sinne,</hi> so diuing and plunging himselfe three times in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whilst the <hi>Bramane</hi> iterateth the name of the Riuer wherein hee washeth, called <hi>T<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, they vse a certaine Vnction in the forehead of red painting, that hauing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9362:40"/>
certaine graines stucke in the glutinous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is as their testimony that God hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them for his people; this is no other then to keepe in minde the memory of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which accordingly as the Marke vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, is daily by them renewed, according to their Washings, with the vtterance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words accompanying the action, to put them in minde to bee such as becommeth Gods marke.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they are enioyned to tender cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Offerings and Prayers vnder greene Trees, the originall of which custome they deriue from <hi>Wyse,</hi> to whom they say God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by vision vnder a Tree, as is formerly mentioned, with iniunction of worshippe in those places; so that the <hi>Bramanes</hi> vnder such greene Trees, erect Temples to Pagods, in which they giue attendance to performe Religious Rites and Ceremonies, to such as repaire thither. The Tree peculiarized for this worshippe, is called by some, as by <hi>Pliny,</hi> and others, <hi>Ficus Indica,</hi>, the Indian Figtree; and by <hi>Goropius Becanus,</hi> affirmed to bee the tree of life that grew in the Garden of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>; how farre sorth to be beleeued, I referre to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Walter Raleighs</hi> 1.

It is a Tree of fertill growth, whose branches be spreading, ample, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, from whose boughes so dispred, doe descend certaine stemmes, that rooting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues anew in the earth, propagate an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, and so dilate it, that it seemeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the custome of other Trees to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. To this Tree when they repaire, they thither bring Offerings, there they receiue Vnctions, and there are sprinklings of seuerall coloured powders; there they pay their Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which they number by the clapper of a little Bell; there they pray for health, for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for fruitfulnesse of issue, for successe in affaires, there they often celebrate their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuals with great concourse. In which May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game of superstition to make further inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would be but vaine and fruitlesse.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they are enioyned to certaine prayers in their Temples, which may hold some resemblance with common Seruice, were it purged of superstitious Ceremonie; the summe of which deuotion, is the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certaine names of God, dilated and explained, where also they vse processions, with singing, and loud tinckling of Bels, which chaunting is of their Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with offerings to Images, and such like impertinent seruices.</p>

                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:9362:41"/>Fiftly, they are enioyned to Pilgrimages to Riuers farre remote, as to the Riuer <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> there to wash their bodies, and to pay their offerings, that the concourse of people repairing thither is great, and the golden of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings of Treasure and Iewels throwne into his siluer waues, vnualuable; hee is likewise esteemed blessed and purified from sinne, that can dye with a pallate moystned with that water.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, another portion of their worshippe they bestow in Inuocation of Saints, to whom they attribute the powers of giuing successe to seuerall affaires, they therefore that would bee happy in Marriage, inuoke <hi>Hurmount</hi>; they that are to begin the workes of Architecture, <hi>Gunnez</hi>; they that want health, <hi>Vegenaut</hi>; the Souldier in his assault in feates of Armes, cryes, <hi>Bimohem</hi>; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable inuoke, <hi>Syer</hi>; and they that are in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, giue their Orisons to <hi>Mycasser.</hi>

                     <p>Seuenthly, their Law bindes them to giue worshippe to God, vpon sight of any of his creatures, first presented to the eye after the rising Sunne: Especially they pay their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Sunne &amp; Moone, which they call the two eyes of God; as also to some beasts which they hold more cleane then others, they giue extraordinary kinde vsage; as to Kine, and Bussalaes, to whom they attribute so much innocence and goodnesse by the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9362:41"/>
soules of men entring into them, that they besmeare the floores of their houses with their dung, and thinke the ground sanctified by such pollution.</p>
                     <p>In the eighth place, touching their Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zings or naming of their Children, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof is different in the Cast of the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> and other Casts. For those that are of the other Casts, are onely washt in water; then some of the kindred of the party deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, menaceth the point of a writing penne against the forehead of the Child, with this short prayer, That God would write good things in the front of that Child. All those then that are present saying, Amen to that prayer; they giue to the Child the name by which hee shall bee called, and so putting an Vnction of red oyntment in the middest of his forehead, as a signe that the Infant is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into their Church, and marked for one of Gods children, the Ceremony is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued. But then the Children that are of the Cast of the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> are not onely washed with water, but annointed with oyle, with certaine words of consecration, in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner: <hi>Oh Lord we present vnto thee this Child, borne of a holy Tribe, annoynted with oyle, and cleansed with water</hi>; vnto which adding the former Ceremonies, they all pray that he may liue a righteous obseruer of the Law of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi> so enquiring out the exact time of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9362:42"/>
Childs birth, they calculate his Natiuity, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering by the position of the twelue signes of heauen, the chances or mischances that may happen vnto him; all which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale, and at the day of the Childs Marriage, (which they accoumpt one of the happiest dayes in his life) publisheth the dangers past, and the coniecturall euils to come in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queale of his life.</p>
                     <p>In the ninth place, concerning their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: It is considerable, that the time is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the custome of other Nations, for they Marry about the seuenth yeere of their age, because they accoumpt Marriage one of the most blessed actions of mans life; to dye without which, they accoumpt it a great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse, which often happeneth by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation and delay of time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also that the Parents might before their death see their Children disposed, which commeth to passe by these earely coniunctions. Next for their contract in Marriage, the Parents of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, doe prepare the way by priuate confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; the intention and purpose being made knowne, and betwixt them agreed vpon, then there are Messengers and Presents sent to the Parents of the Mayden to bee married, with the noyse of Trumpet and Drumme, and the singing of songs in the praise of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Bride, which may truely giue her the merite of one worthy to be coueted and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9362:42"/>
sought vnto: which presents being accepted, then there are gifts sent backe to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, in token of their acceptance of the nuptiall proffer, with like singing of Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks in praise of the Bridegroome, seeting him forth to bee so well composed, as may well deserue acceptation. So the <hi>Bramanes</hi> appointing a day for the solemnization of the Marriage, then there is a certaine Show, to publish to the whole Towne this Marriage intended. This Show is first by the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, who in Nuptiall pompe attended with all the mens Children in the Towne, of the same Tribe, some on horsebacke, some in Pallankins, some in Coaches, all adorned with Iewels, Scarfes, and Pageant like habiliments, make their Cursitation round about the most publicke streets in the Towne, with Trumpets and kettle Drummes, and guilded Pageants; the Bridegroome is distinguished from the rest by a crowne on his head, decked with Iewels very rich. And hauing thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished himselfe: The next day followeth the Bride in like pompe crowned, attended with all the Girles of the same Tribe in no lesse brauery and triumphant accommodation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to view of the Spectators. The day drawing to his decline, they repaire home to accomplish the full Rites of Marriage. The Ceremony obserued in their Marriage is, that they neuer are conioyned together but at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9362:43"/>
the going downe of the Sunne, at which time a fire is made, and interposed betweene the Married couple, to intimate the ardency that ought to be in their affections; then there is a silken string that incloseth both their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to witnesse the insoluble bond of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, that in Marriage there ought to bee no desertion or forsaking one another. After this bond there is a cloath interposed betwixt them, shewing that before Marriage they ought not to make their nakednesse knowne one to another; this custome they say was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the meeting of <hi>Brammon</hi> with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatree,</hi> who because they were naked, couered their immodest parts, till the words of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony were vttered. So the <hi>Bramanes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing certaine words enioyning the man to affoord all things conuenient to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and charging the Woman to loyalty in the marriage vowe, with pronunciation of a blessing of fruitfull issue to them both; the speeches concluded, the cloath interposed, rest away; the bond by which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt vnloosed, and after that, full freedome to communicate themselues to each other. Dowry there is none giuen, that the drifts of Marriage might not be mercenary, saue the Iewels worne on the Bridall day; and to the Feast none repaire but those of the same Cast. To conclude, in marriage they haue some particular legall iniunctions, by which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9362:43"/>
the Tribes are differenced: as first, that no woman may bee admitted to second Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, except in the Tribe of <hi>Wyse,</hi> which are in the handycrafts men. Secondly, that men in all Tribes are admitted to second Marriages, except in the <hi>Bramanes.</hi> Thirdly, that euery Tribe do marry of such as are of his owne Cast: Therefore the <hi>Bramanes</hi> must marry with such as are descended from the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>; and the <hi>Cutteryes,</hi> with such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the <hi>Cutteryes</hi>; so likewise the <hi>Shudderyes.</hi> But the <hi>Wyses</hi> are not onely enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to match into their owne Tribe, but into such as be of their owne Trade; as a Barbers sonne, to a Barbers daughter, and so of others to keepe their Tribes and Trades from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as for their burials, this is their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome; when any man is desperately sicke, and past hope of recouery, they inioyne him to vtter <hi>Narraune,</hi> which is one of the names of God, importing Mercy to Sinners, of which mercy at that time he standeth most in need. His spirits languishing, they stretch out his hand, pouring faire water into it, as the offering of his life, praying to <hi>Kistner uppon</hi> the God of the water, to present him pure to God, with this offering of his hand. His life being departed, they wash his body as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his cleannesse and purity; this is the Ceremony obserued in the visitation of their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9362:44"/>
sicke. After this, for the buriall of their dead: it is after this manner. First, they beare the dead body to a Riuers side appropriate to such purpose, where setting the Corps downe on the ground, the <hi>Bramane</hi> vttereth these words; <hi>Oh earth, wee commend vnto thee this our Brother, whilst he liued thou hadst an interest in him; of the earth he was made, by the blessing of the earth he was fed, and therefore now hee is dead, we surrender him vnto thee.</hi> After this putting combustible matter to the body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended and lighted by the helpe of sweete oyle, and aromaticall odours strowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the <hi>Bramane</hi> saith, <hi>Oh Fire, whilst be liued, thou hadst a claime in him, by whose naturall heate he subsisted, wee returne therefore his body to thee, that thou shouldst purge it.</hi> Then the sonne of the deceased, taketh a pot of water, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it on the ground, vpon which he setteth a pot of Milke, when throwing a stone at the lower pot, he breaketh it to sheards, which rendereth the water to losse, and perishing; the vessell of milke aboue defrauded of his support, powreth forth his humidity on the ground likewise, vpon which the Sonne thus moralizeth the action; That as the stone by his violence, caused the vessels to yeeld forth their humour: so did the assault of sicknesse ruine his Fathers body, and bring it to losse as milke or water, that is spilt on the ground, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to bee redeemed. The body then being
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9362:44"/>
incinerated or burnt to ashes, they disperse the ashes abroad into the Ayre, the <hi>Bramane</hi> vttering these words: <hi>Oh Ayre, whilst hee liued by thee he breathed, and now hauing breathed his last, we yeeld him to thee.</hi> The ashes falling on the water, the <hi>Bramane</hi> saith: <hi>Oh water, whilst he liued thy moysture did sustaine him, and now his body is dispersed, take thy part in him:</hi> So giue they euery Element his owne, for as they affirme man to haue his life continued by the foure Elements, so they say he ought to bee distributed amongst them at his death. After this funerall solemnity, the <hi>Bramane</hi> presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the sonne or neerest kindred of the deceased, a Register of the deceases of his Ancestors, as also readeth to him the law of Mourners. That for tenne dayes he must eate no Beetle, nor oyle his head, nor put on cleane cloathes, but once euery month throughout the whole yeere, on the day of the month in which his Father deceased, must make a feast, and pay a visitation to that Riuer that drunke vp his Fathers ashes. Since these lawes and iniunctions, there hath sprung vp a Custome amongst them, that the women that suruiue their husbands, should offer themselues vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue to be sacrificed in the flames with them, which to this day is obserued in some places, &amp; for some persons of greater worth, though the examples be more rare now, then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, of which custome <hi>Propertius</hi> thus speaketh.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9362:45"/>
of the husband, the woman should no longer suruiue, that so they might become more carefull of their preseruation. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster sort, to gaine an honour out of the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my cast vpon their Sexe, did by voluntary sufferance remooue all suspition of such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chination of euill, since they were so ready to cope with the terror of death, to confirme their loue: The Ceremony whereof is this; When their husbands dye, they array them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their best ornaments and Iewels, and accompany the body to the funerall pit, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all the way encomiasticke Songs, in praise of their deceased husbands, expressing a desire to be with them: the body then being layd in the Graue, the woman with a cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance imparteth her Iewels to her dearest friends, leapeth in to the Corps, whose head shee layeth in her lappe; the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke sounding aloud, the pile is kindled by the fire, and set on a flame, whilst she maketh herselfe a Martyr to approoue her loue.</p>

                     <p>And because there could bee no inuention more commodious for the gouernment of the world, then was vsed by the foure Tribes in the first Age, as to haue <hi>Bramanes</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the people in matters of Religion; to haue <hi>Cutteryes</hi> that should sway the Scepter, and keepe men in obedience; to haue Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men that should vse Trafficke and Trade as did <hi>Shuddery</hi>; to haue seruile and manufactory men, that should serue the vses of the world in the handicrafts, as did <hi>Wyse</hi>: Therefore they were by this Tract bound to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9362:46"/>
keepe their owne peculiar Tribe or Cast, and to obserue what was proper to the faculties of each in seuerall; which accordingly was done, and is yet continued so farre as it lyeth in their power to conserue this Ancient forme of gouernment and policie: wherein if I shall somewhat digresse from their iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which for the most part present things lesse pertinent to be knowne, to a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular display of their manners, I shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discharge the parts required in this Tract.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bramanes</hi> then being the first of these Tribes, something shall be noted in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar touching them; and first of the name <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9362:47"/>
the first of the second Age, to whom the Law was deliuered.</p>
                     <p>Touching the kindes of these <hi>Bramanes,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them for such as discharge the Priestly office amongst the people, they are of two sorts: First, the more common <hi>Bramanes,</hi> of which there are a greater number in <hi>India:</hi> or the more speciall, of which there be fewer, and these be called by the <hi>Banians, Verteas,</hi> by the <hi>Moores, Sevrahs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The common <hi>Bramane</hi> hath eighty two Casts or Tribes, assuming to themselues the names of that Tribe; which were so many wise men or Schollers famed for their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning amongst them, called <hi>Augurs,</hi> or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, of such a place of dwelling. Thus the prime of them was called <hi>Visalnagranauger,</hi> that is, the Augur of <hi>Visalnagra,</hi> the 2 <hi>Vulna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granauger,</hi> that is, the Augur of <hi>Vulnagra,</hi> a towne so called; and so of the rest according to these 82 Casts to be distinguished, being <hi>Bramanes</hi> of the discipline of such an <hi>Augur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These <hi>Bramanes</hi> as they discharge their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall function, in praying with the people, or reading their Law, haue some peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions: As first, that they should straine their bodies into certaine mimicall gestures, so as may most face the people to gaze vpon them and listen to them; that they pray with both their hands open to heauen, as ready to receiue the things they pray for; that they pray with demissiue eyelids, and sitting with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9362:47"/>
their knees deflected vnder them, to shew their feare and reuerence. Next that they must neuer reade of the booke deliuered to <hi>Bremaw,</hi> but it must be by a kinde of singing, and quauering of the voyce, which they say was not onely practised by <hi>Bremaw,</hi> when it was published; but was also inioyned by God, that they might make his Law as the matter of their reioycing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bramanes</hi> are likewise the Seminaries of discipline amongst the younger sort of that Cast, whose orders both in their initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and entrance into that manner of learning is obseruable; as also no lesse in their confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ordination to the Priesthood: for first, about the seuenth yeere of their age they are receiued to discipline, being cleane washed, to intimate the purity of that Cast; then they are receiued naked, to shew that they haue stript off all other cares, to apply themselues to study; then their heads are sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, a long locke being onely left on the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the head, to shew that they must not forsake their study, if they doe, by that locke they shall be drawne backe againe. They are bound to a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> silence and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; prohibited haulking, spitting or cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; wearing about their loynes a girdle of an <hi>Antilops</hi> skinne, and another thong of the same about their necke, descending vnder the left arme. About the foureteenth yeere of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9362:48"/>
their age (if they be capable) they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be <hi>Bramanes,</hi> exchanging those leather thongs, for foure sealing threds, that come ouer the right shoulder, and vnder the right arme, which they sleepe withall, and neuer put off, but weare them in honour of God, and the three persons, <hi>Bremaw, Vystney,</hi> and <hi>Ruddery,</hi> and as the badge of their profession; in which ordination they are enioyned: First, not to alter their Cast or Tribe. Next to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue all things enioyned in the <hi>Bramanes</hi> Law. Lastly, not to communicate the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their Lawes to any of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. These bee the most of the principall things obserued by these <hi>Bramanes.</hi>

                     <p>Now for the more speciall <hi>Bramane,</hi> by them called the <hi>Vertea,</hi> he is some man of the Cast of the <hi>Shudderyes,</hi> or Merchant men, who for deuotion taketh this condition on him; hee is one that for his habit weareth a woollen garment of white, descended to the middle of his thigh, leauing the lower parts naked; his head is alwayes vncouered, as a witnesse of his perpetuall reuerence of God aboue; they doe not shaue, but plucke off all the hayre on their heads, saue some small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder on the crowne; the like they do from their chinne also.</p>
                     <p>Of this sort of <hi>Bramane</hi> there be seuerall Casts likewise; one is called the <hi>Soncaes,</hi> and these goe not to Church, but performe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9362:48"/>
Rites at home. Another is of the <hi>Tup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paes,</hi> these goe to Church to pray. A third is of the <hi>Curthurs,</hi> and these pray by themselues, without society. A fourth called the <hi>Onke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaus,</hi> and these indure not Images. A fift cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Pushaleaus,</hi> the most strict of them all.</p>
                     <p>These kinde of <hi>Bramanes</hi> haue a Festiuall called <hi>Putcheson,</hi> which is kept once euery Month, by fiue dayes solemnization, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt each day of the fiue they keepe a fast; this feast is kept at the ablest mens houses, and commonly at those times a pension is giuen, to restraine the death of cattell, or other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures.</p>
                     <p>More strict they seeme to be in many things then the common <hi>Bramanes,</hi> for the other are not forbidden marriage, these are; more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinent they are in dyet, for out of the former Feasts they eate nothing, but what is giuen them, and reserue nothing for another meale. More cautelous they are for the preseruation of things animate, for they will drinke no water but boyld, that so the vapour which they suppose the life of the water, may goe out. They disperse their very dung and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure with a beasome, least it should generate wormes that bee subiect to destruction; and they keep an hospital of lame &amp; maimed fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fowle, redeemed by a price, which they seeke to restore: They haue all things com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon, but place no faith in outward washings,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9362:49"/>
but rather embrace a carelesse and sordid nastinesse. And this is sufficient to note con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this kinde of <hi>Bramane.</hi>

That par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of <hi>Bremawes</hi> booke that concerned this Cast or Tribe, contained certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of gouernment and policie, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which being but of common im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, I rather chuse to omit, and proceede to shew some other things notable concerning this Tribe, touching their state or condition.

                     <p>As they were in their flourishing estate, they were the Ancient Kings and Rulers of <hi>India,</hi> especially of that part called <hi>Guzzarat,</hi>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:9362:49"/>
and were called by the name of <hi>Raiahs,</hi> which signifieth a King, whereof some were of greater dominion than other, according as they were of greater force. These <hi>Raiahs</hi> had principally foure men about them of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The first of which were the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> who by Southsaying and Augury did shew the Kings what time was most meete to beginne their designes to prosecute them with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. The second was one called the <hi>Pardon,</hi> which was a man of policy in the carriage of State businesse, and dispatched all matters of Iudicature, hauing reference to the King for Iustice. The third was one that was called the <hi>Moldar,</hi> or the Kings Chamberlaine, who was most commonly present with the King, as the companion of his conuersation. The fourth was the Generall of the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the field, called <hi>Disnacke,</hi> who was sent abroad about all expeditions of warre. These were the foure that had chiefe eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy about the King. Furthermore, these <hi>Raiahs</hi> are said to haue thirty sixe Tribes, as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble families whence they were descended; some were of the Cast or Tribe of <hi>Chaurah</hi>; some of the <hi>Solenkees</hi>; some of the Tribe of <hi>Vaggela</hi>; some of the <hi>Dodepuchaes</hi>; some of the <hi>Paramars</hi>; that so no man of obscure birth might presse to dignity, but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from some of the thirty six families; thus the <hi>Raiahs</hi> liued in their flourishing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>

                     <p>It is then deliuered in their History, that there was a <hi>Raiah</hi> called <hi>Rauisaldee,</hi> who had a sonne called <hi>Syderaijsaldee: Rauisaldee</hi> suffering the common change of Mortalitie, his sonne was careful to expresse his duty to his decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed father, in a costly Monument, at a place called <hi>Sythepolalpore,</hi> which being finished with great curiositie of Art, and cost corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to that curiosity, being pleased with the worke, and desiring to keepe his Fathers memory and his owne lasting by that Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee consulted with the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> to know whether that Temple should long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, or if that pile of goodly workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

treasure brought him. His Parents better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by their owne necessitie what was meete for him to doe, then his heroicke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position would be taught, importuned him to take the treasure, vrging their owne needes, and how conuenient a helpe it might bee to raise him to those fortunes that were to him diuined. So apprehending the counsell to bee but reasonable, hee tooke the treasure, and gaue an <hi>Escript</hi> or writing, that albeit the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens had decreed that he should scatter some stones of that building, yet hee would picke them out of the Corners thereof in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as should fulfill his fortune, and make good his promised fauour to <hi>Syderaijsaldee,</hi> in the sparing of that Temple and Tombe of his Father. By this money of composition, <hi>Alaudin</hi> gathered Souldiers, and betooke himselfe to Armes, wherein he prooued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so resolute, that hee gained great fame, whereunto his diuining fortunes became such a Sparre, that he was made King of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> and after that made inuasiue conquests on <hi>Guzzarat,</hi> fulfilled his promise to <hi>Syderaijsal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> in treatie on the fore mentioned businesse. In which conquest hee ouerthrew many <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iahs,</hi> to the great ruine and decline of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> State: But growing weary of this long warre, and many <hi>Raiahs</hi> flying to places inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible, led with a desire to returne to <hi>Delee</hi> his natiue place, hee committed the further

managing of these warres to one <hi>Futtercon,</hi> that was his Cupbearer; in this manner. For <hi>Alaudin</hi> considering how great he was grown from nothing (and that accidentally) he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined as accidentally to heape this fortune vpon another; purposing ouer night with himselfe, that whosoeuer did first present him the next morning with any gift, on him to confirme the gouernment of that part of <hi>Guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarat</hi> hee had conquered. It so fell out, that whilst this secret was lodged vp in the Kings brest, that the fore mentioned <hi>Futtercon,</hi> the Kings wine keeper, by the rising Sunne ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Cuppe of wine to the Kings hand; who smiled and looked fauourably vpon him, and in the presence of his Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed him his Successor in the Gouernment of that he had wonne, inioyning them all so to acknowledge him, and to doe whatsoeuer he should command in the further prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that conquest: so <hi>Sultan Alaudin</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Delee,</hi> and the said <hi>Futtercon</hi> did further inuade <hi>Guzzarat,</hi> and so did the rest of the <hi>Mahoometans</hi> that succeeded him, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the <hi>Banian</hi> State and Regiment.</p>
                     <p>Now for their present estate, some of the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iahs</hi> yeelded, others flying to retyrements im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, lay in the Mawe of the Countrey, and could not be conquered euen to this day: but making outroades, prey on the <hi>Cassaloes</hi> passing by the way; and sometimes come to

                     <p>First, vnder the name of <hi>Banians</hi> is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed either such as are Merchants onely, or Brokers for the Merchant, for nothing is bought but by the mediation of these, who are called <hi>Banians,</hi> which importeth as much in the <hi>Bramanes</hi> language wherein their Law is written, as a people innocent and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, because they will not indure to see a Fly or Worme, or any thing liuing iniuryed, and being strucken beare it patiently without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting againe.</p>

                     <p>In this vproare of vngodlinesse, the Lord grew angry, and full of indignation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended on Mount <hi>Meropurbatee,</hi> acquainting <hi>Bremaw</hi> with the wickednesse of the world, who descended and premonished them of the iudgement to come, which a while husht the cry of their wickednesse; but they fell to their old euils againe. <hi>Bremaw</hi> then interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them, but the Almighty would not be pacified, but took <hi>Bremaw</hi> vp into his bosome, the time of his aboad on earth being expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he might not behold the euils of the time to come.</p>
                     <p>Then the Lord made knowne his purpose of destroying the world to <hi>Vistney,</hi> whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and office being to preserue the people, did intercede for them: but the Lord would not be pacified, but gaue charge to <hi>Ruddery,</hi> whose office was to bring iudgement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction on sinners, to cause the bowels of the earth to send out a winde, to sweepe the Nations as the dust from the face of the earth.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Ruddery</hi> enraged the windes in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, which brast forth into Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the great body of the world had her trepidations and wauerings, the day see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to change colour with the night, the Mountaines and hils were hurled from their

                     <p>But because the head of all the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders was from the wickednesse and ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Kings and Rulers, therefore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9362:55"/>
the Lord vtterly raced out all of the Tribe or Cast of the <hi>Cutteryes</hi>; those that were preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from destruction by the skirt of <hi>Vistneys</hi> preseruation, being some few of the other three Casts or Tribes.</p>
                     <p>Now because these foure Casts were so necessary to the worlds gouernment, that it could not subsist without them, though the Cast of the <hi>Cutteryes</hi> perished intyrely, for their wickednesse; yet that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed againe from a holier beginning, the Lord appointed that from the <hi>Bramanes</hi> the line of the Kings should bee renewed. So the Chiefe of the <hi>Bramanes</hi> that was then preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by <hi>Vistney,</hi> was called <hi>Ducerat</hi>; the next child that was borne after this destruction, and which was the youngest of foure, was chosen to propagate the race of their Kings, and Rulers, who being religiously educated, might as well fauour piety as pollicy, and with holinesse and prudence gouerne men in their seuerall Tribes.</p>
                     <p>So he did many worthy Acts, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly maintained Religion, was a Patron to the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> and Churchmen, and his name was <hi>Ram</hi>; who became so memorable for his worthy deedes, that his name is made hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the mention amongst them euen to this day, that whensoeuer they meete and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute one another, they cry <hi>Ram, Ram,</hi> as a word importing the wishes of all good.</p>

                     <p>So the Almighty was againe angry, that after so many iudgements, the people would not be warned to his feare, therefore by Gods appointment, <hi>Ruddery</hi> caused the earth to open and swallow them vp aliue, reseruing onely some few of the foure Tribes, as a last tryall for the new peopling of the world againe.

Gouernment, when the <hi>Scythians</hi> had better arguments to pleade than they. How fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and like an old womans tale seeme their deuised <hi>Medium</hi> for the worlds propagation, in placing foure women at the foure windes?

Touching their Law, the maine Pillars thereof haue beene demolished in its Confutation: <hi>The Kingdome of God consists not in meates and drinkes.</hi> For other their Ceremonies and Rites, contained in their second Tract of the booke, what man of reasonable vnderstanding doth not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their superstitions, which place their faith in outward washings, lotions, and sprinklings? in worshippe of Sunne, Moone, and other liuing creatures, in paintings, vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and garish processions, in offerings vnder greene trees, in cringings, beckings, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to Images, and other multifarious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? all euidences of braines intoxicate with the fumes of Errour and <hi>Polytheisme.</hi> As for their foure Tribes or Casts, as in all

else, how Pythagorically they stand vpon the number of foure; the world was formed of foure principles; diuided into foure points of the Compasse; to endure for foure Ages; planted by foure men, matched to foure wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; restored againe by foure; and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished by foure seuerall destructions; in foure seuerall Elements: and to conclude, like <hi>Sadduces</hi> denying the Resurrection, in which consisteth the hopes of the blessed: Of which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. <hi>If in this life one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we haue hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</hi>

                     <p>Touching this, the <hi>Persees</hi> affirme, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing was, there was a God, that was the maker of all things, who when he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to make himselfe knowne by his workes in the Creation of the <hi>Vniuerse,</hi> and the creatures therein, did diuide this great worke of the creation, into a sixfold labour.</p>
                     <p>First then, they say hee made the heauens with their Orbes, a place most glorious and pleasant, which he adorned with great lights and lesser; as the Sunne, Moone, and Stars; as also hee did make the Angels, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their seuerall dignities, he placed in their seuerall Orders one aboue another, which place he made a habitation of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for such as should liue holily in this life,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9362:68"/>
and hauing thus done, that he might teach vs to doe great designes with consideration and aduise, he rested fiue dayes from the worke of further creation.</p>
                     <p>Next he made Hell, in the lower parts of the world, from which he banished all light and comfort; that as heauen might be a place of happinesse, to those that are good and please the Almighty, so this might be a place of horrour and punishment, to such as offend his Maiesty; wherein as in heauen, so God had made seuerall mansions that exceeded each other in dolour, which were proportioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees of offenders; about which time <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the chiefe of Angels, with other of his Order, conspiring against God, to gaine the Soueraignety and command ouer all, God threw him from the Orbe of his happinesse, together with his confederates and accomplices, dambd him to hel the place that was made for offenders, and turned them from their glorious shapes, into shapes blacke, vgly, and deformed; till the times of the world should be consummate, when al of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders in generall should receiue their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of punishment and condemnation. So God hauing accomplished this second la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, desisted from the worke of the creation fiue dayes more.</p>
                     <p>After this, the Almighty begunne the third labour of the creation, which was to make
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9362:68"/>
the Earth, which together with the Waters called Seas, make this lower world like a Globe or Ball, so agreeing together, that the Seas humidity maketh the Earth fruitfull, and the Earths soliditie, boundeth the waters in their due confine; which worke thus fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, God suspended the worke of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for fiue dayes more and rested.</p>
                     <p>The fourth labour was to make the Trees, Plants, and Hearbes, that so the earth might bring forth fruites pleasant to the eye, and taste, and for the comfort of the Creatures liuing in the earth; this also done, God rested and gaue the former respite to his labours.</p>
                     <p>The fift worke was to make Creatures fit to abide in the places forementioned, as Beasts of all sorts, to forrage in the greene pastures; Fowles to cleane the Ayre with their nimble Pencions; Fishes to swimme in the vnknowne depths of the watery Ocean. The world thus replenished with creatures, God resumed his wonted rest and intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this labour.</p>
                     <p>And lastly vndertooke his sixt labour, which was the forming of Man and Woman, to whom the rest of the Creatures were made ministratory and seruile, whose name their Records deliuer to be <hi>Adamah,</hi> and <hi>Euah,</hi> who being the first two by whom the multitudes of mankinde should be propagated: God as they affirme, did cause <hi>Euah</hi> to bring forth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9362:69"/>
two twinnes every day: for a thousand yeeres together, death did diminish none of the numbers of mankinde by mortality.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Lucifer</hi> thus deposed with the rest of his Order, grew malignant both to God and man; and as God did good, so he laboured to doe euill, and to perturbe his actions, and tempt men to sinne and wickednesse, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make man odious to his Maker, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so making himselfe an enemy to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which God yet did not fully reuenge, as knowing nothing but euill to bee in him and his confederates.</p>
                     <p>But the better to preuent his mischiefe, set certaine superuisors ouer his creatures to preserue them in that state wherein they were at first created. Thus to one <hi>Hamull</hi> was committed the charge of the heauens; to <hi>Acrob</hi> the ouersight of the Angels, that they relapsed not as <hi>Lucifer</hi> had done; to <hi>Ioder</hi> the ouersight of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres; to <hi>Soreh</hi> the care of the Earth; to <hi>Iosah</hi> the command of the Waters; <hi>Sumbolah</hi> had the charge of the beasts of the field; <hi>Daloo</hi> of the Fish of the Sea; <hi>Rocan</hi> of the trees; <hi>Cooz</hi> of Man and Woman; and <hi>Sertan</hi> and <hi>Asud</hi> to whom God had giuen strength and power, were made the guardians of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the euill spirits, to master and conjure them from mischiefe to Gods creatures, who yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the watch of <hi>Sertan</hi> and <hi>Asud,</hi>

                     <p>The sinnes of men growing great, they say it appeareth in their Records, that there came a Flood or Inundation, which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Earth and the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, some few onely God preserued to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the generations of the times following; that so there might not bee an vtter ruine of mankinde.

she had conceiued, to her great feare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of life: when on a sodaine stept in a man, of person goodly, and of warlike As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, with a truncheon on in his hand in rescue of her, who with fury and resolution vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and recouered the Child from the <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins,</hi> that would haue torne it in peeces, and with gentle hand putting the Child into the wombe of his Mother, did by soueraigne Art close vp the rupture, that was by the <hi>Griffins</hi> torne and dilacerate; whose Agony thus mitigated by this worthy Person, the <hi>Griffins</hi> were driuen away, the fierynesse of the heauens altered, and <hi>Dodoo</hi> awaked out of her dreame and slumber.</p>

The King then proposed them. The first whereof was, that he might ascend to heauen and descend from thence when he list. The second was, that he might know what God would doe at present and in time to come. The third was, that he might neuer dye. The fourth was, that no instrument whatsoeuer, might haue the power to wound him or hurt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zertoost</hi> thus replyed, that these were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and high demands, neither did so great power rest in him as to grant them, neither was it meete that any one man should haue them all, for that therein hee should rather seeme to bee a God then man; yet difficult

So the first which was to ascend to heauen and descend thence at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, was obtained for <hi>Gustasph,</hi> who they say had this power granted him. The second which was to know what would fall out at present or hereafter, was granted to the Kings Churchman, that so hee might direct the King in his designes, what should bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, what should be left vndone. The third which was to liue for euer, was granted to <hi>Gustasphs</hi> eldest sonne, called <hi>Pischiton,</hi> who yet liueth (as they say) if wee will beleeue them, at a place in <hi>Persia,</hi> called <hi>Demawando Cohoo,</hi> in a high mountaine with a Guard consisting of thirty men, to which place all liuing creatures else are forbidden to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, least they should liue for euer, as they do that abide there, who neuer suffer morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The last, which was neuer to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Instrument or weapon, was granted to the youngest sonne of <hi>Gustasph,</hi> called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spandiar,</hi> who they say by <hi>Zertoosts</hi> prayers, was made invulnerable, that he might put himselfe into the danger of Battell, without feare or hazard.</p>

                     <p>The third was called <hi>Zertoost,</hi> because <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toost</hi> was the bringer thereof, and this contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Law and matters that concerned Religion, which bookes according as their matter was diuers, so they were deliuered to men of seuerall studies and learning.</p>
                     <p>The first of these bookes called <hi>Astoode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> which treated of Iudiciall Astrologie, was committed to their <hi>Iesopps,</hi> or wise men, which are knowne by the name of <hi>Magies.</hi>

                     <p>The second which treated of Physicke, was giuen to their Physitians to instruct them in that Science.</p>
                     <p>The third which contained their Law, and matters of Religion called <hi>Zertoost,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to their <hi>Darooes</hi> or Churchmen, that they might know how to worshippe God themselues, and also instruct others in the knowledge of the same worshippe; of such three Tracts did this booke or volume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
                     <p>These Tracts were likewise diuided into certaine Chapters, whereof seauen were contained in the Wisemans or <hi>Iesopps</hi> booke; seauen in the Physitians booke; and seauen in the <hi>Darooes</hi> or Churchmans booke.</p>

                        <p>First, to haue shame euer with them, as a remedy against all sinne, for a man would neuer oppresse his inferiors, if hee had any shame, a man woald neuer steale if hee had any shame, a man would neuer beare false witnes if he had any shame, a man would neuer bee ouercome with drink if hee had any shame; but because this is layd aside, men are ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt any of these, and therefore the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedin</hi> or Layman must thinke of shame.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, to haue feare alwayes present with them, and that euery time the eye twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or Closed his leddes together, they should stand in feare at those times of their prayers, least they should not goe to Heauen, the thought of which should make them feare to committ sinne, for that God sees what maner of ones they are, that looke vp towards him.</p>

                     <q>
                        <p>First, to know in what manner to pray to God, obseruing the rites prescribed in the Zundauastaw, for God is best pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that forme of prayer, that he hath giuen in his owne booke.</p>
                        <p>The second, to keepe his eyes from coueting or desiring any thing that is anothers, for God hath giuen euery man what he thinkes meete for him; and to desire that which is anothers, is not onely to dislike of Gods disposure of his owne gifts, but to chalenge to himselfe that which God hath denied him, and whereof hee seeth him vnworthie.</p>
                        <p>The third, to haue a care euer to speake the truth, for all truth commeth from God, and as it is most communicated to men of God, so they should most shew it in their words and Actions: but <hi>Lucifer</hi> is the Father of falshood, and whosoeuer vseth

                        <p>The fourth, to bee knowne onely in his owne busynes, and not to enquire after the things of the world, it belonging onely to him to teach others what God would haue them doe.

foule and loathsome, and stopping the passages of his breath, least theire cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted aire should enter into him to defile him.</p>
                        <p>The seauenth, to forgiue all Jniuries, shewing himselfe the patterne of meekenes, that hee may bee thought one that cometh from God, for wee offend God euery day, yet hee giueth vs things that are good, when wee deserue that hee should recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence euill for euill.</p>
                        <p>The eighth, to teach the common people to pray according to the directions in the booke of theire Law, to goe and pray with them for any good they desire to obtayne, and when they come to the place of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to ioyne in common prayer together.</p>
                        <p>Ninth, to giue lycense for marriage, and to ioyne the man and woman together, and that no Parents match theire Children, without the consent and approbation of the <hi>Herbood.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>The first is that he must neuer touch any of a strange Cast or Sect, of what Religion soeuer, nor any Layman of his owne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but he must wash himselfe, because God hath made him especially holy to himselfe, for which cause hee must not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God in prayer, with the touch of others vncleannesse.</p>
                        <p>The second is, that hee must doe euery thing that belongeth to himselfe with his owne hand, both to witnesse his better humility, as also the better to preserue his purity, viz. to set the hearbes in his owne Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to sow the graine of his owne field, to dresse the meate that hee eateth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he haue his wife to administer to him in that, which is not euer vsuall.</p>
                        <p>The third is, that he take the tythe or tenth of all things from the <hi>Behedin,</hi> as the Lords dues, and imploy it to such vses as he thinketh meete, since the Lord hath made him as his Almoner, and dispenser of Charity.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is, that as he must vse no Pompe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9362:83"/>
or superfluity, so of that great Reuennue that commeth yeerely to him, hee must leaue nothing ouer-plus at the yeeres end, that must not bee bestowed in good vses, either in Charitable Contributions to the poore; or in building of the Temples of God.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, that his house bee neere adioyning to the Church, where hee must keepe and make his abiding, continuing in Prayer and abstinence, not ostentating himselfe to publike view, but liuing recluse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred from the world, as a man wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to God.</p>
                        <p>The sixt, that hee must binde himselfe to greater purity then others, both in his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent washings, and also in his dyet, in feeding on meates accoumpted more pure by the Law, as also that he liue sequestred from his wife in time of her pollutions.</p>
                        <p>The seauenth is, that whereas the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bood</hi> is enioyned only to be known in the Law, or booke called <hi>Zertoost,</hi> that the <hi>Distoore</hi> bee acquainted with all the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9362:84"/>
learning contayned in the <hi>Zunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastaw,</hi> both in that part which treateth of judiciall Astrologie, committed to the <hi>Iesopp</hi> or wise man, as also in that which concerneth the Physition, and most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the booke of the Law, for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that hee should informe all men, and none should bee found like him therin, before hee bee admitted to be high Priest.</p>
                        <p>The eight that hee must neuer eate or drinke excessiuely, for these are enemies to the high speculations required in a high Priest.</p>
                        <p>The Ninth that he stand in feare of no body but God, nor feare any thing but sinne, for hee is so to trust in God, that hee must not feare what Lucipher can do vnto him.</p>
                        <p>The tenth that God hath giuen him p<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The eleauenth that according to the wisdome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9362:84"/>
that God hath giuen him, he be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne in what manner God cometh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale himselfe, in what manner Lucipher, and how to descide betweene falshood and truth.</p>
                        <p>The Twelfth that when God manifesteth him selfe to him in visions of the Night, and sheweth him in what manner hee made his workes in the Creation, hee should not reveale Gods secretts, but keeping them to himselfe, should admire his power, for God doth not publish himselfe to any as he doth to his <hi>Distoore</hi> or high Priest.</p>
                        <p>The thirteenth that hee keepe an euer liuing fyer, that neuer may go out, which being kindled by that Fyer that <hi>Zertoost</hi> brought from heauen, may indure for all ages, till fyer shall come to destroy all the world, and that he say his prayers ouer it, according as is enordered by the booke of the Law.</p>

                     <p>First then, touching their liberty in meates and drinkes, and their customes obserued in their Feast and Fasts: Their Law alloweth them great liberty in meates and drinkes, but because they will not giue offence to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> amongst whom they liue, nor displease the <hi>Moores</hi> vnder whose gouernment they are, they especially abstaine from eating of Kine and Hogs-flesh, meates prohibited by the Lawes of the two former. It is obserue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able also amongst them, that they eate alone, as a meanes for greater purity and cleannesse, for they suppose they participate of anothers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9362:85"/>
vncleannesse by eating with him: they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise drinke euery one in seuerall cuppes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar to theire owne vses, for the same cause, and if any chance to drinke in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans cuppe, they wash it three times, and abstaine from the vse thereof for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine season after.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for their Festiualls inioyned by their Lawes, they obserue sixe in the yeare, and these feasts are celebrated for fiue dayes together, each of them according to the sixe works of the Creation. The first is called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duserum,</hi> which is vpon the fifteenth of their Moneth called <hi>Fere,</hi> which is our Februarie, for ioy that the Lord made the Heauens to be a place of glory, to entertaine such as seare hm. The Second is called <hi>Petusahan,</hi> which is vpon their month <hi>Sheruar,</hi> our Aprill, the six and twentieth, for that the Lord had made Hell, to bee a place for the Diuell and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. That feast therefore is a memoriall to put them in minde that they take heed of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, that may bring them thither. The third is <hi>Yatrum,</hi> celebrated vpon the sixe and twentieth of their Month <hi>Mahar,</hi> which is our May, in memory that the Lord made the Earth and Seas, to bring forth Creatures for the vse of man. The fourth is <hi>Medearum,</hi> kept vpon the sixteenth of their Month <hi>Deh,</hi> which is our <hi>August,</hi> in memory that God made the plants and Trees, by whose fruites
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9362:86"/>
man is sustained &amp; nourished. The fift is <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mespetamadum,</hi> vpon the Month <hi>Spindamud,</hi> which is our <hi>October,</hi> beginning on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeth day, in remembrance that God made the Beasts, fish, and foule, Creatures ordained for the sustenance of Man. The sixt is called <hi>Medusan,</hi> falling in the eleauenth of their Month <hi>Ardebest</hi> which is <hi>December,</hi> for ioy that then the Lord made Man and Woman, from whence all mankind had their Originall.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, touching their fasts. After euery one of their feasts, they obserue a fiue dayes Abstinence, eating but one meale a day, in memory that the Lord after euery one of these labours, rested fiue dayes, and whensoeuer they eate of any foule or flesh, they cary some part of it to the <hi>Eggaree</hi> or Temple, as an offering to appease God, that for the Sustenance of man they are forced to take away the life of his Creatures, and these are the rites most notable touching their meates and drinkes.</p>
                     <p>Now in the second place for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe of fier, because this is an Idolatry most notably distinguishing their worshipp from the worshipp of other Sects. First for the ground of this their worship of fier, it is fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Lawgiuer <hi>Zertoost,</hi> who as they affirme, being rapt vp to heauen, had fier deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto him from God, &amp; brought it thence together with the Booke of their Law, as

the worship by them to bee embraced, and by their law enioyned: moreouer they affirme that <hi>Zertoost</hi> being in the forementioned rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the place of Glory, did not see God, but heard him speaking to him out of the fire, and when the fire was deliuered, receiued it as the vertue of God, and his first borne of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, and for these causes to bee worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reuerenced.</p>
                     <p>Next for the nature or qualitie of this fire. The first fire thus worshipped and idolized, was that <hi>Zertoost</hi> brought from heauen with him, which was a liuing fire, that nothing could extinguish; but whether this haue certainly bin preserued in the succession of time, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to all, is vnknowne, vpon defect hereof, they are licenced to compose a fire of diuers mixtures, to bee kept liuing from time to time, to which they are to performe their inioyned worship: such is that which i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> idolized in <hi>India,</hi> where this Sect remaineth in a place called <hi>Nuncery,</hi> that hath not beene extinguished for the space of two hundred yeares, as they affirme. First then this fire consisteth of that fire, that is made by the sparkes flying from the flint, by the smiting of a steele. Secondly of that fire that is made by the rubbing of two peeces of wood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a custome much vsed amongst the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of ruder manners, by which they kindle their fiers in all places where they neede.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9362:87"/>
Thirdly, of such fire as is occasioned by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning falling on some tree or thing accendible. Fourthly of such fire as is called wildfire, which flying from place to place and lighting on matter combustible, consumeth it. Fiftly of artificiall fier, made by Coles or wood, most ordinarie in vse. Sixtly of the fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Banians</hi> vse to burne the bodies of their dead. Seauenthly of the fire that is made by burning Glasses and the Beames of the Sunne; of all these Ingrediences they compose their idolatrous fire, which they call their <hi>Antisbeheraun</hi> or Religious fire.</p>
                     <p>Lastly for their Ceremonie or rite bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about this fire so variously composed, and by their <hi>Distoore</hi> or high priest so tended, that it may not extinguish: whensoeuer the <hi>Persees</hi> assemble themselues together to this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp, the <hi>Distoore</hi> or in his absence the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bood,</hi> together with the Assembly, encompasse the fire about, and standing about eleauen or twelue foote distant therefrom; (for they hold it so holy that they feare to approach too neare) the <hi>Distoore</hi> or <hi>Herbood</hi> vttereth this speech: That forasmuch as fire was deliuered to <hi>Zertoost</hi> their Lawgiuer from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who pronounced it to bee his vertue and his excellencie, and that there was a lawe deliuered for the worshippe of this fire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by so many Miracles, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they should hold it holy, reuerence and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9362:87"/>
worshippe it as a Part of God, who is of the same substance, and that they should loue all things, that resemble it, or were like vnto it, as the Sunne and Moone which proceeded from it, and are Gods two witnesses against them, if they should neglect that Religion and worshippe so enioyned: as also to pray to God that hee would forgiue them, if in the ordinary vses of this Element, so seruiceable to mans neede, they should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spill water, which might in some manner quench it, or spitt in it vnawares, or put such fewell to it to keepe it burning, as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and vnworthy of that holynes, that was in that Element, or whatsoeuer abuses els they should do, as they vsed it in the necessary seruices of their life. And this is the summe of their worship touching the Fier.</p>
                     <p>In the third place for their Baptisme or naming of Children, when they enter them into the Church, this is their forme. As soone as euer the Child is borne, the <hi>Daroo</hi> or Churchman is sent for to the parties house, who obseruing the punctuall time of his Birth calculateth his Natiuitie; after that, consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the name of the Child, at last the Parents and friends approuing the same name that the Churchman giueth, the Mother in the presence of them all giueth the name to the Child, there being no Ceremonie but the naming of the Infant as then vsed. After this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9362:88"/>
the kindred of the Child together with the Infant accompany the Church man to the <hi>Eggaree</hi> or Temple, where he taketh faire wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and putting it into the Barke or rynd of a tree called <hi>Holme,</hi> which groweth at <hi>Yesd</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> and is admired in this one particular as they affirme, for that the Sunn of heauen giueth it no shadowe: hee thence powreth the water into the Infant, vttering this Prayer that God would cleanse it from the vncleanes of his Father, and the menstruous pollutions of his Mother, which done, it departeth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the seauenth yeare of the Childs Age, when the same is more capable of his entrance into their Church, hee is led thither by his Parents, to haue a further confirmation, where hee is taught by the Church man to say some Prayers, and to be instructed in Religion: wherein when hee is prompt, hee vttereth his prayers ouer the fire, hauing a Cloath fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about his head, &amp; ouer his mouth &amp; nost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rills, according to their generall custome in that worshippe, least the breath yssuing out of their sinfull Bodies, should taint that holy fire. Then after Prayers bee concluded, the <hi>Dar<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> giueth him water to drink, and a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate leafe to chewe in his mouth, to cleanse him from inward vncleanesse; so washing his body in a Tanck with cleane water, and putting on him a linnen Cassock which hee weareth next his skinne, called <hi>Shuddero,</hi> which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9362:88"/>
descendeth to his waste, as also a girdle of Cammells haire called <hi>Cushee,</hi> which hee euer weareth about him, and is wouen like Inckle by the preachers owne hand, he vttereth these Prayers ouer him: That God would make him a true follower of the Religion of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> all the dayes of his life, of which those garments are the Badge or signe, that hee might neuer beleeue in any lawe, but that which was brought by <hi>Zertoost,</hi> that hee might continue a worshipper of their fire, that he might eate of no mans meate, nor drinke of any mans cuppe, but in all things might obserue the Rites and customs of the <hi>Persees.</hi> All which transacted, hee is held a confirmed <hi>Persee,</hi> and one of their owne Sect.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, touching their Mariage and the rites in them obserued. They haue a fiuefold kinde of Mariage distinguished by seuerall names. The first they call <hi>Shausan,</hi> which is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a mans sonne and a mans daughter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the time of their youth, where the Parents agree without the knowledge of the Children; to this they attribute much, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to goe to Heauen that are maryed in this state. The second is called <hi>Chockerson,</hi> when the party once widowed, is maryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The third <hi>Codesherah<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>san</hi> when a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man enquireth out a husband for herselfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her owne free choyce. The fourth <hi>Ecksan,</hi> when a young man or Mayd dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9362:89"/>
they bee marryed, then they haue a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome to procure some mans son or daughter to be matched to the party deceased, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the state of Marriage to bee a meanes to bring people to happines eternall in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world. Those that commonly vse this, are the richer sort, who by a price hyre the parties to such a Contract with a summe of money. The fift is called <hi>Ceterson,</hi> when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hauing no Son, a daughter of his owne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Sonnes, he adopteth some of them, to bee his, and maryeth them as if they were his owne Children, for they account that Man vnhappie that hath not a Male or Female, a Sonne or a daughter to ioyne in the state of Marriage.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Rite or Ceremony ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in their Marryages, it is this; the parties being agreed and mett together for the purpose of Contracting, about the time of Midnight, the Parties to bee maryed are set vpon a bed together (for they are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in their Churches:) opposite to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to bee maryed, stand two Churchmen, the one in the behalfe of the man, the other in behalfe of the woman, with the kindred of each by the <hi>Herbood</hi> or Church man to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deputed; holding ryce in their hands, an Embleme of that fruitfulnesse, they wish to them in their generations. Then the Churchman that standeth in the mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9362:89"/>
moueth the question to the woman, laying his forefinger on her forehead, saying, Will you haue this man to bee your wedded husband? who giuing consent, the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deputed in the Womans behalfe, lay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing his forefinger on the Mans forehead, moueth a like question, of which receuing answer they ioyne their hands together: the man making a promise to her, that hee will giue her so many <hi>Dinaes</hi> of gold, which is a peece worth thirtie shillings, to binde her to him, implying by that promise to maintaine her with all things necessarie; the woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine promiseth that all shee hath is his: so the <hi>Herboods</hi> or Churchmen scattering the Ryce vpon them, prayeth God to make them fruitfull and send them many sonnes and daughters, that may multiply as the seede in the Eares of haruest, that they may liue in vnity of minde, and many yeares together in the state of wedlocke. Thus the Ceremony being done, the Womans Parents giue the Dowry, for the Men giue none, &amp; the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age feast is celebrated for 8. dayes after, when such time is expired, they are all dismissed. And this is all that may be obseruable about their Marriages or Matrimoniall Ceremonie.</p>
                     <p>In the last place for the Buriall of their dead, two things are notable. First the place of their Buriall. Secondly, the Ceremonie vsed therein, differing them from others. First
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9362:90"/>
for the place of their Buriall, they haue two places or Tombes built of a round forme, a pretty height from the ground, sufficiently capacious and large; within they are paued with stone, in a sheluing manner; in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of them a hollow pit, to receiue the bones consumed and wasted; about by the walls are the shrowded and sheeted Carkeyses layd, both of men and Women, exposed to the open aer. These two Tombes are somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant one from the other, the one is for all those that are of commendable life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, but the other is for such as are notorious for some vice, and of publique defame in the world for some euill, by which they are branded. Touching the Ceremony obserued in the Burialls of their dead, whensoeuer any of them are sick vnto death, the <hi>Herbood</hi> or Churchman is sent for, who prayeth in the Eare of the sicke Man in this manner, Oh Lord thou hast commanded that wee should not offend, this man hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: That wee should doe good: this Man hath done euill: That we should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe thee, this man man hath neglected: Lord forgiue him all his offences, all his euills, all his neglects. When hee is dead the Churchman commeth not neere him by tenne foote, but appointeth who shall bee the <hi>Nacesselars</hi> or Bearers, they then carry him on an Iron Biere, for the lawe forbiddeth that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9362:90"/>
the body of the dead should touch wood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a fewell to the fier they accompt most holy; and those that accompany the dead are interdicted all speech, because the graue or place of the dead is a place of rest and silence. Being come to the place of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, the <hi>Nacesselars</hi> or Bearers lay the body in, and the Churchman standing remoate from the place, vttereth the words of Buriall in this Manner. This our Brother whilst hee liued consisted of the foure Elements, now he is dead let each take his owne, earth to earth, aer to aer, water to water, and fire to fire. This done, they pray to <hi>Sertan</hi> and <hi>Asud</hi> to whom was giuen the Charge ouer <hi>Lucipher</hi> and the euill Spirits, that they would keepe the Diuells from their deceased Brother, when hee should repayre to their holy fier, to purge himselfe: for they suppose the soule to bee vagrant on Earth for three dayes after his decease, in which time <hi>Lucipher</hi> molesteth it: for security from which molestation it flyeth to their holy fier, seeking preseruation there: which time concluded it receiueth Iustice or reward, hell or heauen. Vpon this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they all (as their busynes will permit) assemble themselues for three dayes together, and offer vp their prayers at morning, Noone and euening, that God would bee pleased to bee mercifull to the soule departed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the sinnes that the party committed in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9362:91"/>
his lifetime. After the three dayes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and that they thinke the definitiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is past what shall become of him, they on the fourth day make a Festiuall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their mourning.</p>

What seeme these <hi>Persees</hi> to be like in their religious fire? but those same Gnats, that admiring the flame of fire, surround it so long, till they proue <hi>ingeniosi insuam ruinam,</hi> ingenious in their owne destruction. And if the <hi>Papists</hi> would hence gather ground for Purgatory, and prayers for the dead, and many other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions by them vsed, to bee found in these two Sects, wee can allow them without any shame to our Profession, to gather the weedes of superstition out of the Gardens of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Idolaters.

indeed, wil make these Errours as a Sea marke to keepe his faith from shipwracke.
