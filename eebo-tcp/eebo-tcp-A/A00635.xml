            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T were to bee wiſhed (Right Honourable) that as ſinne multiplieth it ſelfe, ſo the knowledge and true feare of God, ſhould euerie way be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed among men. For, thereby it would come to paſſe, by the bleſsing of God, that fewer ſhould tread the path of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than (alas) doe now. And although it lieth not in man, to ſtoppe the courſe, and to damme vppe the ſtreames of iniquitie (for this muſt be perfourmed by the Lords owne arme, or els all mens indeuours are but vaine) yet is it
<pb facs="tcp:2076:3"/>
the part of all thoſe that feare God, to doe what they may, for the effecting of this work. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, albeit the attempts of the men of God, haue not alwaies the effectes which they deſired, yet their labours, both in preaching and writing, haue not bene deſtitute of their fruite, in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, greater or ſmaller, as the Lord thought it meet.</p>
            <p>The Lord in this latter age, hath raiſed vp diuers, and excellent men for this purpoſe, and he hath greatlie magnified his mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs in this Iland: and vs, in the enioying of his goodnes, if we can make a right vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But becauſe wee were not worthie of them, therefore he hath manie times, in the middeſt of their yeares, yea, and ſome in the very ſpring and beginning of their ſtrength, to warne vs, what he is likely to doe with the the reſt, if wee be not more thankfull. Amongst the number of thoſe, whome in the Lords great mercies wee inioyed, and loſt for our vnthankfulneſſe, M. <hi>DVDLEY FENNER</hi> was one, whome the Church of God in this age could haue hardlieſt ſpared: he ended his teſtimonie in this life, being
<pb facs="tcp:2076:3"/>
vnder thirtie yeares of age: but yet of that growth in the knowledge of God, that fewe (if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer anie of his yeares) haue left behind them the like monuments of great knowledge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the true and ſound feare of God, as hee hath done. His works both in Latine and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh doe beare witneſſe hereof. And it is not meet that I ſhould enter into anie farther commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of him: although, both in regard of the outward fauour of God towards him, as being born an heire of great poſſeſsions, &amp; eſpeciallie, in conſideration of his ſpirituall vnderſtanding in the wayes of the Lord, his great learning, his conflicts with the aduerſaries of God, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, and patient ſuffering for the trueth: there are manie thinges that make his name bleſſed among the Sainctes.</p>
            <p>Some Treatiſes of his, being printed at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times, and now rare to be gotten, I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and preſumed to dedicate vnto your Lordſhippe: not doubting, but in regard, both of the Authour, (who being a faithfull Miniſter of Ieſus Chriſt, I know you will eſteem, though vnknowne vnto you) and eſpeciallie, in
<pb facs="tcp:2076:4"/>
reſpecte of the notable handling of the trueth, which they containe, you will accept them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not vnbeſeeming your Lordſhip, that they were publiſhed vnder your name. And if I ſhuld ſay, both in regard of the worke it ſelfe, and alſo the Authour, that it were no ſmall honour vnto a Chriſtian Noble-man, that they come foorth vnder his Patronage, I think I ſhould not ſpeak amiſſe.</p>
            <p>That one treatiſe of houſhold gouernment, doth ſo commend the whole worke vnto a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Maiſter of a Familie, as who ſo doth well reade and conſider it, muſt needs thinke, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hath proceeded out of the ſame fornace, doth deſerue to be highlie accounted of. And happie were it for all families, that they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned according to the preſcription, ſet downe in this Treatiſe. Your Lordſhip, I truſt, will make that profite hereof, among the reſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto adioyned: namelie, that it will be a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation vnto you, in that, wherein your familie is alreadie reformed, and a direction for that perfecting of the gouernment thereof, whollie according vnto the word. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb facs="tcp:2076:4"/>
it is, that I haue dedicated this and the reſt vnto your Honour. Touching my ſelfe, I will ſay no more, but as I deſire to ſhew my ſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in my vocation, vnto the whole Church of God in generall; ſo I would willingly gratifie your Honour in particular. And ſo accept this, as a teſtimony of my good wil towards your Lordſhip, whome I vnderſtand (and knowe in ſome meaſure) to beare no ſmall affection and good wil vnto the trueth, and all thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame. Thus I commend you to God, &amp; to the worde of his grace, that is able to builde you vp further, and giue you an inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them which are ſanctified.

Contrarie to this, is the common and whole caſting off of this care, vnleſſe in worldly matters. The firſt part of this rule is prooved by theſe places.

            <p>The ſecond part of this rule, is prooved by the example of Abraham, who had his elder ſervant in his houſe, who was over all that he had, and to whome hee committed the waightie dutie of providing a wife for his ſonne. [Geneſ. 24.2. Then Abraham ſpake vnto the elder ſervaunt of his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, which was over all that he had, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Put now thy hand vnder my thigh. 3 that I may binde thee with an othe, by the Lord God of heaven, &amp; God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife vnto my ſon of the daughters of the Cananits, amongſt whom I dwell. 4.

            <p>Secondly, in the workes themſelues, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence &amp; vnderſtanding to heare and receiue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2076:15"/>
the word, to be touched according to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with joy and aſſurance of fayth receiue ſolace and increaſe of grace, by the right vſe of the Sacraments; and after, to cal to minde and try by the Scripture thinges delivered, and ſo hold faſt the good, &amp; to applie the comfort of the ſacraments vnto al temptations afterward. [Pſal. 78.2. Heare my doctrine, O my people, incline thine eare to the wordes of my mouth. Nehem. 8.10. After Nehemiah (to witte, the Kinges Embaſſadour) and Ezra the Prieſt and Scribe, and the Levits teaching the people, ſaid vnto al the people.

Math. 26. And when they had ſong a Pſalme, they went out into the mount Olivet. 1. Theſſ. 5.20. Quench not the Spirit: Set not light by preaching: Trie al things: Hold faſt that which is good.]</p>
            <p>For obedience of life, it behooveth them to teach them, call on them, and ſee them do this which they learn, that the publike miniſterie, &amp; private vſe of the word be not contemned, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, vnprofitable vnto them, and ſo God pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>voked, not onely againſt their familie, but alſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2076:15"/>
the Church of which they are. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to this, is, that men both themſelues and their families goe to the publike miniſterie, as to a common matter, let it fall after to the ground, without any looking into the certaintie of doctrine, the power &amp; practiſe of it; and ſome with the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the the word become worſe, both they and their houſholdes, than thoſe which neuer heard it. [Exod. 13.1. And declare vnto thy ſon in that day, ſaying: For this hath the Lorde done theſe thinges vnto me, when I went out of Aegypt. 9 So ſhal it bee vnto thee for a ſigne vpon thine hand, &amp; for a monument betweene thine eies, that the doctrine of the Lord may be in thy mouth: to wit, that the Lord with a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hand brought thee out of Aegypt.] Which with the reſt of the law ſheweth, that at thoſe times this muſt be done, and that ſo throughlie, that this worke by this meanes, may bee a liuelie ſigne, and the doctrine be ſo vnderſtood, that it may more fruitfullie and liuelie be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by conference one to another. Alſo [Act. 10.24. And the other day after, they entred into Caeſarea. And Cornelius waited for them, having gathered together his kinſmen and ſpeciall friendes. Nehem. 8.13. And all the people came to eate and drinke, and to ſende portions, and to make great joy, becauſe they vnderſtood thoſe words which they had made knowen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1.

For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the things which he hath foreſhewed by the worde of the Lord, againſt the altar which is at Bethel, &amp; againſt all the high places which are in the Cities of Schomron, ſhall come to paſſe. Iob. 1.5 After it came to paſſe, when they had finiſhed the daies of the banquet, that Iob ſent and ſanctified them, and riſing early, he offered a ſacrifice according to the number of them al.

            <p>The duties in reforming, are thoſe duties wherby they muſt labor to reform everie thing amiſſe, which is eſpied, for Gods glorie &amp; their good, and leaſt it creepe further.

<list>
                  <item>Thoſe which they muſt do by themſelues.</item>
                  <item>Thoſe which they muſt procure to be done by others.</item>

            </p>

            <p>The dueties they muſt do by themſelues, muſt haue two properties:
<list>
                  <item>They muſt bee done with wiſedom, fit for thoſe duties.</item>
                  <item>Patiencie fit.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Wiſedom is, that the cauſes may be thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſifted, &amp; ſoundly reproued out of the worde of God. According vnto this wiſedome alſo, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a fitter occaſion, this duetie may bee lette paſſe, and with keeping the authoritie of the chiefe of the familie, bee winked at for a time.

For alſo, many times thy minde is priuie that thou haſt curſed others. Prou. 20.21. Hee which bringeth vp his ſervants delicatlie, ſhall in the end be depriued of his Children.]</p>
            <p>Patience fit for it is, with keeping the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the chiefe of the familie, to heare what can be alledged, and by equitie alſo, to allowe or diſſallowe the ſame. Contrary to which is,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2076:18"/>
haſtines without diſcretion, &amp; making the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plaine, that the conſcience may be touched for the fault. Alſo pride not to heare any excuſe or defence deliuered in duetie, ſubmiſsion and obedience of child or ſervaunt. Finallie bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which may provoke wrath rather then cauſe amendement [Colloſ. 3.21. Fathers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke not your children to wrath, leaſt they bee diſcouraged. Iob. 31.13. If I contemned the cauſe of my ſeruaunt or mine handmaid when they pleaded with me. 14.

            <p>And theſe are the properties of thoſe duties.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2076:18"/>
The divers ſortes are,

            <p>Rebuke is a ſharp, admonition to take heed of the euill reprooued aright, as is gathered out of that before.</p>

            <p>And hitherto of the firſt ſort of duties concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning Chriſtian holineſſe in the familie.</p>
            <p>The other, concerning the thinges of this life, is, convenientlie to provide the neceſſarie things of this life, as that they haue convenient clothing, food, reſt, &amp; (if on certain cauſes need be) recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> [1.

            <p>Contrarie to this, is the neglect of their life to come, to make matches, only for carnall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſuffering them to liue wantonlie and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cleanly, &amp; not ſeeking the remedie appointed,</p>

            <p>Contrarie to this is, deferring of that work, for trifles or vnmeet cauſes, a giving of a name in another tongue, a prophane name. [Gen. 25 25. And the firſte came foorth roughe, being all over, as an hairy gowne, and they called his name Eſau. 26. Afterwards, his brother came forth, whoſe hand held the heele of Eſau; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore everie one called his name Iacob. Luke. 1.59. And it was ſo on the eight day, they came to circumciſe the babe, and called him Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, after the name of his father. 62. Then they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2076:30"/>
made ſignes to his father, how hee would haue him called. 63. So he asked for writing tables, and wrote, ſaying: His name is Iohn: and they marveiled all. Gen. 4.25. And after Adam knew his wife, which brought foorth a ſon, and called his name Sheth: For ſaid ſhe: God hath laid vp for mee another ſeede for Abel, whome Kain ſlew. Gen. 19.11. Furthermore, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord ſaid vnto her: Behold, thou art with child, and thou ſhalt ſhortly bear a ſonne, therfore call his name Iſmael, becauſe the Lord conſidereth thine affliction. 15. Therfore Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar brought foorth vnto Abraham a ſonne, &amp; Abraham called the name of the ſonne which Agar brought foorth vnto him, Iſmael.]</p>
            <p>So the Greekes in Greek, as Timothie, The feare of God, [Act. 16. Then came he to Derbe, and to Liſtra, and behold, a certain Diſciple was there, named Timotheus, a womans ſon which was a Ieweſſe, but his father was a Grecian.]</p>
            <p>And the Latines in Latine, as Tertius, [Rom. 16.22. I Tertius which wrote out this Epiſtle, ſalute you in the Lord.]</p>
            <p>The proper dutie of the mother is, to nouriſh it vp, if ſhe be able, with her owne milke, and to waine it, and performe all ſuch motherly care and dutie. [1. Tim. 5.10. If ſhe haue nouriſhed her children, if ſhe haue lodged ſtrangers, &amp;c. Gen. 21.7. Furthermore, ſhe ſaid: Who would haue ſaid vnto Abraham, Surely Sarah ſhal giue children ſucke: but I haue borne a ſonne in his

old age. 8 And the babe grew and was wayned, &amp; Abraham made a great feaſt, what day Iſaac was wained. 1. Sam. 1.29. So the woman abode that ſhee might nurſe her ſonne vntill ſhee had brought him vp. Luc. 2.12. And this ſhall bee a ſigne vnto you: you ſhal finde the child ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and laid in a cratch.]</p>
            <p>Contrarie to this is, the tenderneſſe of many mothers, that bring on them the threatning of the Prophet willinglie, of barren breaſts, which ſhould go only with a barren womb.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of their duties, as they be parents.</p>
            <p>Now followeth their duties as they bee mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and maiſtreſſes, where beſides theſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to children and ſervants, this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in regard of ſervants; that not onely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to juſtice they pay them their due wages, but alſo otherwiſe helpe them, comfort them, liberally reward them, as far as chriſtianitie, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie in equalitie ſhall binde them.</p>
            <p>Contrary to this is, to retain their wages, to exact of them, to oppreſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or onely reward them ſtrictly, according to the exact deſerving. Coloſſ. 4.1. <hi>Ye maiſters, doe vnto your ſeruauntes that which is iuſt and equal, knowing that ye alſo haue a maiſter in heauen.</hi> And theſe are the duties which they muſt performe in their life time. Al which muſt be ſhut vp with ſetting order for al things at their death, with eſpeciall exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and praiers for religion, for vprightnes in their callings, for peace &amp; order after them.

            </p>
            <p>The proper obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is that which ſpringeth from a cheerfull, naturall, continuall, &amp; child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like loue and reverence.</p>
            <p>Contrarie to this is, diſobedience, vnnaturall behaviours or affections, &amp;c. [2. Tim. 3.2. For men ſhall bee lovers of themſelues, covetous, boaſters, proud, evill ſpeakers, diſobedient to parents, vnthankfull, prophane. Colloſ. 3.20. Children, harken vnto your pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in al things, for this is acceptable vnto the Lord. Ephe. 6.1.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2076:34"/>
Children, giue eare vnto your parentes in the Lord, for that is juſt.]</p>
            <p>This obedience muſt ſhewe it ſelf, eſpeciallie in being governed by them in the matter of calling, &amp; mariage, according to the rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the word of God, &amp; all ſuch matters of waight and moment. Chiefly vntill by the fathers authority and conſent, more full power be geven to their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe of their yeers and diſcretion. [Nomb. 30.4. When a woman hath vowed a vow vnto the Lord, or bound her ſelf by a bond at her fathers hous in her youth, 5. If when her father heareth her vowe, or the bond wherewith ſhe hath bound her ſelfe, and her father hold his peace concerning her, let it be eſtabliſhed. 6. But if her father ſhall make her to breake it, in what day he ſhal heare it, let none of her vowes or bandes wherewith ſhee hath bound her ſelfe be eſtabliſhed, &amp; the Lord ſhal forgiue her, becauſe her father hath made that ſhe ſhould breake it. 1. Cor. 7.36. But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man thinke hee haue committed ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely thing againſt his virgin, if ſhe paſſe the flower of her age, and that it ought to be done, let him doe what he wil, he ſinneth not. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be joyned in mariage. 37. But hee which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firme in heart, neither is driven by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, but hath his owne will in his power, and hath decreed this in his heart, that he may keep his virgine, he doth well. 38. Therefore he that giveth her in mariage doth wel, but he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2076:34"/>
her not in mariage, doth better. Gen. 24.51. Behold, Ribkah is before thee, take her and go thy way, that ſhe may be a wife vnto the ſon of thy Lord, as the Lord hath ſpoken.]</p>
            <p>Laban the ſonne, having the goverment of his father being olde, was the chiefe in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe. Gen. 24.55. <hi>And the brother of Ribkah, &amp; her mother ſaid, let this maid tary with vs a few daies, at the leaſt ten, afterward goe thy wayes.</hi> 57. <hi>Then they ſaid, let vs call the maide, &amp; aske of her mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their eſpeciall recompence is, to relieue and maintain them, or any other, which is knit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in any eſpeciall care and dutie, as farre as their ability or duty towardes the wife, and care of the familie will ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Contrarie to this is, contempt of your pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, grieving of them, neglecting to help &amp; ſuccour them, &amp;c. [1. Tim. 5.4. But if any widow haue children or Nephewes, let them learne, firſt to ſhew godlines towards their own houſe, and to recompence their owne kindred, for that is an honeſt thing, and acceptable before God. Mat. 15.4. For God hath commanded ſaying: Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy father and thy mother: and hee that curſeth father or mother, let him die the death 5. But ye ſay, whoſoever ſhall ſay to father and mother, by the gift that is offered by me, thou maiſt haue profite. 6. Though hee honour not his father or his mother, ſhall be free; thus haue you made the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God of none authority by your traditions. Gen. 47.12. And

            <p>The eſpeciall dutie of ſervantes is, to doe all thinges which their maiſter ſhal, according to Gods wil, giue them in charge. [Col. 3.22. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, be obedient to them that are your mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, according to the fleſh, in all thinges; not with eie-ſervice, as men-pleaſers, but in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, fearing God. Luk. 17.7. Who is it alſo of you, that hauing a ſervant plowing, or feeding cattell, would ſay vnto him by and by, when he were come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> field, goe and ſit down at the table. 8. And would not rather ſay vnto him, Dreſſe wherwith I may ſupp, and gird thy ſelfe, and ſerue mee till I haue eaten and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and after eat thou, &amp; drink thou. 9. Doth he thank that ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe he did that which was commanded him? I trowe not.]</p>
            <p>Contrarie to which is, that ſome will do one thing only at this time, and which pleaſeth him.</p>
            <p>The manner of dooing this, hath two partes,

                  <item>Diligence.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Tit. 2.9. <hi>Let ſeruants be ſubiect to their maiſters, and pleaſe them in al things, not anſwering again: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pickers, but that they ſhew all good faithfulneſſe, that they may adorne the doctrine of God our Saviour in all thinges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their diligence is in a ſingle heart, as to the Lord, not only by labour and travel, but praier,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2076:35"/>
religious care, and all good means to perform the things laid on them.</p>
            <p>Contrarie to this is, eie-ſervice. [Col. 3.22. Servants be obedient to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are your mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers according to the fleſh in all thinges, not with eie-ſervice, as men-pleaſers, but with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes of heart, fearing God. 23. And whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ye doe, do it hartily, as to the Lord, and not vnto men. Ephe. 6.5. Servants, be obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them which are your maiſters, according to the fleſh, with feare and trembling, in ſinglenes of your hearts, as vnto Chriſt. 6. Not with ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the eie, as men-pleaſers, but as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, doing the wil of God from the hart. 7. With good wil, ſerving the Lord &amp; not men. Gen. 24.9. Therefore, the ſervant putting his hand vnder his thigh, ſware vnto him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter. 10. Afterward, the ſervant tooke ten Camels, of the Camels of his maiſter, that he might goe on his journey: (for hee had al the goods of his maiſter in his hand) And ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he went vnto Syria between the rivers, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the citie of Nachor. 11. Where, cauſing the Camels to reſt without the citie, beſide a wel of water, in the evening, at what time the woman came foorth to draw. 12. And he ſaid: O Lord God of my maiſter Abraham, bring to paſſe I pray thee, that it may come to paſſe vnto mee this day, and ſhew this mercie vnto my maiſter Abraham. 26. And he inclined his face to the ground, &amp; bowed himſelfe to the Lord, ſaying:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2076:36"/>
Bleſſed bee the Lorde of my maiſter Abraham, which hath not left his mercy and faithfulneſſe towards my maiſter.]</p>
            <p>His diligence alſo appeared greatly, when he ſaid: <hi>I wil not eat til I haue ſpoken my words, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ver. 33. <hi>&amp; in making ſpeed he ſaid: Stay me not, ſeeing the Lord hath proſpered my way.

            </p>
            <p>Faithfulnes in their labor &amp; charges, to ſeeke the vttermoſt they can, the commodity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of their maiſters. Contrary to which, is, picking, turning another way, in banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, feaſting, riot. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This appeareth moſt liuely in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Iacob doth make of his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Laban. <hi>This is the twentith yeare ſince I haue bene with you, thy ſheep &amp; thy goats haue not left their young, and the rammes of thy flocke haue I not eaten. The torne I brought vnto thee, but made it good my ſelfe, at my hand thou diddeſt require it. Likewiſe, the ſtolen by day, and the ſtolen by night.

So that whenſoever we want any office of Paſtor, Teacher, Elder, Deacons, or the right calling or execution of it, in exhortation, doctrin, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, Eccleſiaſticall cenſure, or the order of

them, or the gifts fit for them, and the power of them, wee muſt beg them according to the firſt head. Mat. 6.33. 1. Cor. 12.6. &amp; 5.4. &amp; 12.28. Rom. 2.6. Ephe. 4.11. Tit. 1.2. 2. Cor. 10.5.6. Mat. 9.36. &amp;c. In the ſecond head we ask, that all thinges being perfourmed, and all enemies overcome, Chriſt, the reſurrection, &amp; his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may come quickly. Math. 24.32. and 25. 1. Cor. 15. Apo. 22.20. The next is alſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in an Axiome ſimple of the adjoint &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that the will; that is, the revealed will of God in his word, may be fulfilled. Deut. 29. Which hath a declaration drawen from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This muſt be praied, when we feele any repugnancy to Gods will, in the deed or manner of doing. For here we requeſt by one, all the fruits of the kingdom; righteouſnes, joy, peace, &amp;c. Rom. 14.</p>
            <p>The other ſorts of requeſt haue this general, that we pray in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the whole Church, as members of one body, having one life and happines in Chriſt. Ephe. 4.2.3. &amp;c. Therefore in every one we ſay, <hi>Giue vs, forgiue vs, lead vs. &amp;c</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:2076:39"/>
They are of two ſorts,

                  <item>The firſt, concerning the things of this life, firſt diſperſed after the maner of the ſcripture; as the ſhorteſt; wherin as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we clime vnto higher things.</item>
                  <item>The other two, of things of the life to come.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſte is diſpoſed in an axiome ſimple of the ſubject, and the adjoint, Gods giving, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in providing bread, ſaying thus: Giue vs that which is not in our power, and wherof we are vnworthy. Deut. 8.18. even breade, that is, by a Synechdoche, all the commodities of this life, both for neceſsitie and Chriſtian delight. Eſa. 3. 1. Pſal. 104. Where the conſequent is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by two arguments. Firſt, the ſubject <hi>ours</hi>; that is, ſuch as we in Chriſt be heires of, to vſe, being ſanctified by word and prayer. 1. Timoth. 4. 1. Cor. 3.22. The ſecond by the adjoint, ſuch as is both apt, and able by his bleſsing to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh vs; ſeeing wee may haue money, and put it in a bottomleſſe purſe; and eat, and not be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and drinke, &amp; yet not be refreſhed. Hag. 2. For the word ſignified bread to our ſubſtance, <hi>dayly,</hi> ſuch as may giue dailie nouriſhment. The Antecedent is declared by the adjoint of the time, <hi>this day</hi>; that is, one kinde of time being put generally for that time wherein we are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods promiſe to aske it, as Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith, <hi>The thing of the day in the day</hi>: that is, everie thing in his time, as S. Luke expoundeth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>to the day,</hi> that is, as time requireth. For in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2076:39"/>
joy, the time requireth one bleſsing, in afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, that wee might hang on God every moment. 1. Tim. 6.6. &amp;c. Mat. 6.31. &amp;c. To the other two, this is general, that ther is a Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, where one kind is put for al of that ſort, and the meanes of them; as faith, and all other good graces, and the inſtrumentes begetting, nouriſhing, relieving them, as preaching, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, Sacraments, corrections, &amp;c. as they tend vnto this.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe, is diſpoſed in an axiome ſimple of the ſubject &amp; adjoint, <hi>Father, remit vs our debts.</hi> Where is an allegorie of a Metaphor, the ſimilitude being borowed of debtes, which is drawne from the obligation of works, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to continue, to do all the law, vnleſſe we would be accurſed. Col. 2.14. Gal. 3.10. Now, by <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes</hi> is meant, juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peace of conſcience, joy in the holy Ghoſt deliverance from the wrath to come, &amp; all ſuch of that kind. Rom. 5. And this petition is, when wee are troubled, terrified in conſcience, and through dulnes haue not feeling of theſe. This is confirmed by a reaſon drawen from compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the leaſte, and is concluded in a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme connexiue or knitting, in the firſt kind, both parts being contained in one, the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the propoſition. <hi>Seeing euen wee forgiue our debters,</hi> which haue not a drop of thy infinit mercie in vs, Doe thou much more forgiue vs: For ſo S. Luke ſheweth, it ſhould be interpreted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2076:40"/>
in expreſſe wordes, and I ſee not why it ſhould not ſo be tranſlated, for the Greek phraſe doth well beare it. So this is for our comfort, if wee feele this readines in vs, otherwiſe we can haue no aſſurance. Luk. 11.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is diſpoſed in the like ſimple ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome, adorned with a Metaphor taken from warre, where men are led captiue: <hi>Lead vs not?</hi> that is, though wee daylie deſerue it, yet ſeeing we haue begged the forgiuenes of ſinnes, giue vs not ſo over vnto the temptation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, the world, or our owne corruption, as that with the temptation thou giue not an iſſue. 1. Cor. 10.13. 2. Cor. 12.7.8.9. This is declared by the contrarie, <hi>but looſe vs:</hi> that is, by a metaphor taken from the water pent vp, ſet vs free more and more from all that whereunto concerning the fleſh, we are captiue. Rom. 7.13.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the requeſts, is drawen from the efficient cauſe, which may mooue God to yeeld to our petitions, becauſe we giue it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him. The reaſon may bee concluded in a connexiue of the firſt kind. <hi>Seeing wee giue it all vnto thee, grant our requeſt.</hi> But the firſt we doe, Therefore, &amp;c. The propoſition is wanting, the aſſumption is contained in an axiome copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, which numbreth vp the parts; wher again as aboue, the couple is left out, to note our joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fervent feeling &amp; melodie of the heart, in heaping vp praiſe vnto God. Ephe. 5.18.19. Col. 3.16. The parts are; firſt, that the kingdom;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2076:40"/>
that is, the ordering of all things in heaven and earth appertaineth to him. Secondly, the whole power whereby they are done. Thirdly, the praiſe and glorie, as in the Chronicles, from whence our Saviour Chriſt tooke it, 1. Chron. 29.11. and in Iudg. where it is ſo interpreted. Iud. 25. And thus much for the partes, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the whol is noted out by <hi>Amen,</hi> which is the force and certaintie of our faith, in the whole work, as in a thing vnmoueable. 2. Cor. 1.20.</p>

            <p>The firſt diverſe is declared by the moouing cauſe, [That in ſteed of thee, he might miniſter vnto me in the bandes of the Goſpell,] that is,

Whereby thou maiſt ſee with what an excellent ſpirite he was indued, even in his tender yeares.

            <p>By the firſt, <note n="a" rend="inter">Rom. 7.5. to the 15.

            <p>The Law is a doctrine <note n="a" rend="inter">Deut. 5.28.</note> given of God, <note n="b" rend="inter">Rom. 10.5.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <note n="c" rend="inter">ſoule &amp; body, &amp;c.

            <p n="1">1 <hi>Geuen</hi>] And therfore euerie thing taught out of the Law, rightly interpreted, is to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Rom. 7.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Commanding to doe</hi>] One difference between the Law and the Goſpell, which to apprehend Chriſt, and ſo juſtification, &amp;c. asketh but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. Rom. 10.15. Galat. 3.10.11.12.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Whole man</hi>] Therfore in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements not the body onlie, but the judgment, wil, and affections, in the ſoule, muſt be taught what to doe, and leaue vndone.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Perfect obedience</hi>] A ſecond difference of the Law &amp; Goſpell is gathered: for the Goſpell aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth but a true faith, not perfect. Mark. 9.24. 1. Theſ. 3.10. Alſo by this, not only the thing, but the neceſſarie meanes to the thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and forbiden. Pro. 31.5. &amp; 8.</p>

death. Galat. 3.10. Rom. 6.23. &amp; 5.12.13. Deut. 27.26. Gene. 2.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſing, or reward,</hi> which is the ſecond, giving to the perfect obedience of all, the favour of God to be felt with all bleſsing in ſoule &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for euer; called life. Deut. 6.24.25. Levit. 18.5. Deut. 30.19.20.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the Lawe, with the properties and vſe of it. Now followeth the interpretation of it: where is declared what is commanded &amp; forbiden.</p>
            <p>In the interpretation of the Law, muſt be ſeen what is commanded &amp; forbidden. Pro. 2.9.

            </p>
            <p>In the whole body of the Law jointly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, two things are commanded: Knowledg and practiſe. Col. 1.10.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, is commanded the true knowledg of good &amp; evil, which is for the age of everie man. Col. 1.9.10. Phil. 1.9. Heb. 5.14. Luke. 2.52. To <note n="a" rend="inter">Pro. 2.3.4. &amp; 4.10.</note> deſire it, <note n="b" rend="inter">Pro. 2.10. Pſa. 119.24.</note> delight in it, loue it, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, is forbidden generall ignorance of good and evill. Hoſ. 4.6. Ephe. 4.17. To loue it, deſire it, delight in it. Pro. 1.22.</p>
            <p>Practiſe is the following or flying of the thing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2076:47"/>
known to be commanded or forbidden.</p>
            <p>It hath,
<list>
                  <item>Inward feeling. Phil. 1.9. &amp; 2.13.</item>
                  <item>Outward works. Ephe. 5.10.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By feeling of the heart, we chooſe, loue, deſire delight, are zealous in the good thing it ſelfe, that it may be done; to refuſe, hate, abhorre, &amp; are zealous againſt the known evil. Amos. 5.14 Phil. 1, 9. 1. Theſſ. 2.1. Amongſt theſe, zeale is an earneſt affection of the mind, whereby we doe follow the good, or flee the evil, ſo much as we are vehemently grieved with that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth it. 2. Cor. 7, 11. Mat. 3, 7. 1. King. 19, 10. Act. 18, 25. Num. 25.13. Here is forbidden the contrarie, as no feeling. Ephe. 4, 17. Zeph. 1, 12. In zeale forbidden, want of true zeale. Apoc. 3 15. Zeale for evil. Mat. 10, 21. Zeale for good beyond knowledge. Luke. 9, 53.</p>
            <p>In feeling, the affections muſt be ſo ordered, as that they may bee equally more ſlacke or ſtrong, as the good or evill ſhall be greater or leſſer. The order of the Law confirmeth this, when God is provided for firſt, then man: firſt, particular boundes, then generall. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth father and mother more than me. Mat. 10 37. So wee muſt deſire more the preſence of God in the life to come, than his favour in this life. 1. Cor. 1, 7. And loue, and reverence more the teaching Elders, than governing onely. 1. Tim. 5.17. &amp;c. For the better doing of this, is required

                  <item>Pefection,</item>
                  <item>Sobrietie.</item>

Mat. 12, 37. &amp; 27.5</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:2076:47"/>Perfection is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the afections in doing, are both ſtrong ynogh, and alſo ſyncere or vpright. 1. Chro. 29, 9. Strength is, when according as the good or evill is, there lacketh no earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of affection. Deut. 6, 5. Mat. 22, 37. Here is forbidden the leaſt remiſsion or weaknes. Rev. 2, 4. Vprightneſſe is, when the affection loveth, deſireth, &amp;c. In a ſingle hart, only becauſe God commandeth, and for that end, <note place="margin">VVhich he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all things, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge foorth of his glorie. 1. Cor. 10.32. &amp; 6.20.</note> this is called ſimplicitie, trueth, a ſingle heart, Deut. 18, 13 Ioh. 1, 17. Ephe. 6.14. &amp; 6, 6, 1. Chro. 29, 5. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden hypocriſie, vain glorie, &amp;c. Mat. 6, 5. 1. Cor. 13, 3. Phil. 1, 16, &amp; 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Sobrietie in affection, is to holde them in, ſo that they paſſe not meaſure. 2. Tim. 1, 6. Tit. 1, 8 Thus much of feeling.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing in practiſe, is the outward worke, when from the inwarde feeling, the members of the bodie execute. Rom. 6, 12, 13. Rom. 12, 1. The want of this forbidden. Iam. 1 26. To all this is commanded, Perſeverance &amp; watchfulneſſe. Ephe. 6, 10.</p>
            <p>Peſeverance is, alwaies to continue and goe forward in doing good, and flying evill. Ezech. 18, 25. Coloſſ. 1, 10. To this is contrarie, a ſtay, or going backward. Gal. 5.</p>
            <p>Watchfulnes is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual care with our ſelues, that we be readily prepared as we ought, to pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctiſe good, &amp; reſiſt evil, which is ſet forth, Eph. 6, 10, 18. 1. Cor. 16, 13. 1. Theſ. 5, 6. Mark. 13, 35 In this is forbidden no continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, no care, to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2076:48"/>
litle, too ſlack, &amp;c. Gen. 3. Eue. David 2. Sam. 11.1.2.3. 1. Theſſ. 5.3.6.</p>
            <p>The remedie of our ſinnes in theſe, is Chriſt his death; with his knowledge. Luk. 2.52. With his feeling, Ioh. 4.34. With his zeale. Ioh. 2.17. His continuance in obedience throughout his life. Ioh. 17.4. His watchfulnes. Mat. 4.4.10. <note n="a" rend="inter">1. Cor. 5.21,</note> as wel to take away the guiltines and puniſhment of the ſinne, &amp; to impute freely the obedience and bleſsing: <note n="b" rend="inter">Rom. 6.2.3.4. &amp;c.</note> as to giue power to kill the ſin, and to quicken vs to obedience.</p>
            <p>Thus much of that which is generally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the body of the Law. Now followeth what is generally, in the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on generall of the Lawe.</p>
            <p>The whole Law is devided by the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into two Tables.</p>
            <p>The firſt, doth containe thoſe duties which wee owe directlie in his ſeruice. Deut. 4.13. and Exod. 34.1.2.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, which we owe vnto our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mat. 22.36. Rom. 13.8.9.</p>
            <p>In this diviſion we are charged two things: Firſt, that to perfect obedience of the Law, we ſhould bring theſe two ſorts of duties ſound &amp; whole, as thoſe which then onely are pleaſing vnto God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are found together. Mich. 6.7.8. 1. Ioh. 5.2. and 4.20.21. Here then is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, the ſevering of them, as ſome will ſo delight in exerciſe of Religion, as they wil neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2076:48"/>
other duties towards men, as Maiſters, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Magiſtrates, &amp;c. And ſome ſeeke ſo to pleaſe theſe in ſeverall duties, as they neglect too much the other, as reading of the law of God, hearing the word preached, and calling it to minde being heard, &amp;c. Both which are condemned as vngodlie and vnjuſt. Rom. 24.26. Tit. 1.4. The forgiuenes of this ſin is had in Chriſt, who was condemned as a blaſphemer: This righteouſnes is imputed to vs from him. Ioh. 17.1, 34, 5, 6, &amp;c. Heb. 5, 7, 8. And with this grace, the other, to bee godly &amp; iuſt, is alwaies given. Tit. 2, 13. and 12, 13. Hence we are taught that feeling ſome readines vnto Godlineſſe, we ſhould turn our ſelues alſo to indevor to work juſtice: and contrary, the ſecond thing comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this diviſion, is, we ſhould prefer loue, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>light, &amp;c. The duties we owe to God, before thoſe we owe to men. Mat. 22.36. 1. Sam, 13.11, 12. The remedie in Chriſt accuſed as a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, yet ſought the glorie of his Father, not his. Ioh. 2, 17, 18. This mercie maketh vs come to this dutie. Actes. 4, 18, 19. Here wee muſt often marke, how by ſtealth we ſhall bee drawne to the ouer-loving, over-fearing, &amp;c. of men, and in time reſiſt it. Hitherto, what is commanded and forbidden generallie in the Law. Now followeth the particulars in the firſt Table.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the firſt commandement, Exo. 20, 2, 3. wee muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, firſt the reaſon, then the precept. <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> I take this to bee a reaſon of the next verſe; for if it wer a precept, it ſhuld redound, ſeeing the contrarie being forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that which followeth; this is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo. 2. It is not like the other 3. having rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons annexed, this the firſt &amp; the chiefeſt ſhulde want. 3. A general authoriſing of the Law went before. We may note the reaſons are added, to ſhew vs our ſin the better, when we ſhall ſee we haue broken not a bare precept, but a precept perſwaded by ſuch aunſwerable reaſons. Alſo that when we riſe by Chriſt, we might not only be taught what to doe, but be allured to it. <hi>Thy Lord.</hi> This word <hi>Iehouah,</hi> noteth out his being eternall, infinite, beginning and ending of all thinges. Exod. 3, 14. Revel. 1, 8.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth, this Lawe appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to all, becauſe hee is the Lord of all. <hi>Thy God</hi>: that is, one which doth vouchſafe thee a particular favour, when in thy creation he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued thee with corporall and ſpirituall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, and dooth inriche thee vnto eternall life. Pſal. 144, 15. Heb. 8, 10. Ezech. 36, 26, 32.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2076:49"/>
Luk. 37, 38. Heb. 11, 16. By this appeareth, that neither we nor the Iewes had promiſes of this life onely: Laſtlie, that the true fountaine of ſubjection vnto God, is this aſſurance, Hee is our God. Ioſua. 24, 16. Rom. 12, 1. 1. Pet. 2, 1 <hi>Which brought.</hi> By this we are taught the better to nouriſh the former root of obedience, to cal often to remembrance the particular benefites of God. By this appeareth that the Lawe was giuen to the Iewes, and vs, not onely to bring vs vnto Chriſt, but alſo to allure and inſtruct vs to obedience when Chriſt is received. Thus much of the reaſon. Nowe followeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no ſtraunge, or other Gods before me.</hi> To haue an other God, is to ſet vp another, whom we will acknowledge to be of power, of goodneſſe, juſtice, of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent nature, and therefore feare, loue, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, hang on him, in all eſtates. Deut. 26, 17 18. As they looke for him to be their God, as aboue, ſo that where this is wanting, either on the part of God, or the people, they are called without God. Ephe. 2, 12. Not his people. Oſe, 1, 9. This the Lord forbiddeth to be attributed vnto any but his own Majeſtie, becauſe he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Lord our God, &amp; by this forbidding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth the contrary, that he only ſhuld be acknowledged God, he alone ſo loved, feared, &amp;c. In this commandement therefore, we are firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the true knowledge of one true God, then the confidence, &amp; loue, &amp; feare, &amp;c.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2076:50"/>
which is to be giuen to his perſon. The true knowledge of the true God,<note n="a" rend="inter">Iere. 24.7. Ephe. 4.13.</note> is to knowe his <note n="b" rend="inter">Ioh. 4.24.

Here is forbidden, firſt Atheiſme, to perſwade our heart there is no ſuch true God in heauen, Pſal. 14.1. Exod. 5.2. Mockers of him and his works, 2. Pet. 3.4.5. &amp;c. 3. Thoſe that oppone themſelues to the true knowledg of God. Mat. 12.21. Actes. 6. Not to acknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the loue, grace, power, &amp;c. of God, Mal. 1.2. pſal. 82.6. To deny his juſtice, Malac. 3.13. The forgiueneſſe of this ſinne, was bought by the ſlaunder of ignorance, and blaſphemie laid on Chriſt, and the anguiſh of his ſoule, which he felt for our errors laid on him; by which alſo we die vnto this ſinne, and raiſe this part of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Ephe. 4.13. After this true acknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Lord out of his word, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: firſt a ſure confidence in the Lorde, with the fruites of the ſame, Pſal. 100.3. Then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affections of loue, reverence, feare of the

Lorde: Alſo a ſure confidence in the Lorde, is from the aſſurance of his favour, to be aſſured from him onlie, for continuall defence, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuccour, in ſoule and bodie, Pſal. 27.1 3. and 3.7.9. Prou. 14.26. From this confidence, ſpringes truſt or hope, which is to waite and looke for the help, which in confidence wee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelues of from the Lord, Pſal. 33.18.19 20.21. Yea, although meanes be wanting, wee giue glorie vnto God, Rom. 4.10. 2. Kings 6.16. From hence commeth it, that we feare not in greateſt dangers, 2. Kin. 6, 16, Pſa. 3, 7, and 27.3.

The name of God is his memoriall amongſt men, which beeing in his titles, moſt properlie is given to them, whether drawen from his nature, as <hi>Iehovah</hi> the Lord, or his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perties, juſt, holy, merciful. &amp;c.

the Lorde in excellencie is remembred in his workes, by likenes they are called his name. Pſal. 8.2. 2. Chro. 6.32. Much more his Goſpel. Act. 9.15. His Sacraments. Mat. 5.6. Alſo true praier is the honouring of his name, and euill the prophaning of the ſame. Gen. 4.26. Mal. 1.11.12.

Wherto appertained the ceremonie of lifting vp their handes vnto the Lord, which called them to mind with whome they had in this cauſe to deale. Gen. 14.22. So ſometimes they added, or put in ſteade of the creatures of life, heauen, earth, afflictions, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferings, not to giue the honor of an oath vnto them, which were abhominable. Deut. 6.13. Eſa. 18.18. 1. King. 8.31. Heb. 16.17. But to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their heartes the more, with reverence of him, his glorie, or power, or mercie, or juſtice, which were moſt ſenſible in thoſe things. 1.

The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is proper in the diligent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them, is great reverence and ſweet feeling of the glorie of God, which any manner of way is found in them. Pſal. 64.9.10, &amp; 104.34. We contrariewiſe, either wholly neglect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Eſai. 6.12. or els in lightnes, &amp;c. in which ſort we ſpeak ſomtime of women, ſometime of holy matrimony, yea, ſometime of the joyes of heaven, and paines of hell, making fooliſh and vaine plaies of theſe thinges. The vſe or end of al the work of the Lord towards him, to preach and ſet forth the power and glorie of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall kingdome of God. Pſal. 145.11.12. To vs, that we and our poſteritie may better knowe, truſt, loue, and feare the Lord. Pſal. 78.7. Deut. 4.9. But contrariwiſe, we neuer make any ſuch vſe, but harden our hearts againſt al his works, both of juſtice and mercie, thereby declaring our palpable blindnes in ſuch light, Pſal. 111.2. &amp; 92.6.7. &amp; 10.5. And thus much for the true ſanctifying of the name of God, in thoſe things which are directlie attributed vnto him. Now followeth the other, in the private exerciſe of his word, in reading, conferring, &amp;c. Wee muſt be prepared in our hearts, by a great reverence of the moſt heavenlie, moſt conſtant and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wiſedome of the Lord for vs, contained therein, Pſal. 119.129.

               <p>Of the firſt ſort are, rejoycing in the word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and profiting by that. Alſo meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, conference, &amp;c. on the works of God, that ſo we might not onely by doctrine, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2076:62"/>
be taught, and ſo be brought to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feeling, as is commanded, Deu. 5.20. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded duties of loue, in relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting the nedy, aſwel bodily by our help, as ſpiritually by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; conference out of the word, edifying one another in our moſt holy faith. 1. Cor. 14.2. Mat. 12. In theſe things our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt &amp; neglect, both of the mercy of the Lord, who hath ordained ſo many good means to increaſe our knowledge, our feeling in the faith &amp; good works: his wiſdome, who hauing regard to our weaknes, hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs ſuch great variety, that alwayes being weary of the one, we may breath our ſelues in the other. In this as in the reſt, and the commaundement going before, we muſt haue the ſinnes forgiven in the ſonne of God his obedience; here, Luk. 13.10. to the 18. verſ, Luk. 13.4.5. In him alſo, we muſt receiue power with this former grace, to die vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to this ſin, and riſe vnto this part of obedience.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the reaſon, whereby he doth both make plaine the obedience, and allure vs vnto it. He allureth, becauſe he giueth this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie perpetuall, that ſeeing in ſixe daies, we may doe all our worke, which is neceſſarie for the maintenance of this life, and proviſion of our families, which is declared by theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in the 9. and 10. verſes. Sixe daies thou ſhalt worke, but the ſeuenth day is the reſt, or Saboth of the Lord thy God. In ſixe daies doe all thy worke, in the ſeventh doe no worke, but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2076:63"/>
of the Saboth. Math. 12.5. <hi>The Saboth vnto the Lord,</hi> Here, as in that afore, are the Papiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, who ordained Saboths to Saintes &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, a worſhip due to the Lord onlie, who alſo tooke away this libertie of ſixe daies wholie, &amp; too often. <hi>No maner of worke,</hi> except for frugall neceſsitie, of putting on of apparell, of meate, drinke, &amp;c. which muſt be as meanes to helpe and ſuccour the weakneſſe of tender and olde age, the ſtrength of ſtrong men in this exerciſe; who if they ſhould ordinarilie abſtaine on that day from theſe thinges, it would make them much vnable to accompliſh that worke of the Lorde, and ſo it is expounded, Luke. 13.15. Wherefore that of Exod. 35.3. was a rudiment ceremoniall, whereby they were inſtructed to the reverence of the ſame, when as otherwiſe they might doe great things. This is further de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared by a diſtribution of the efficient cauſes. <hi>Thou, nor thy Sonne, nor thy Daughter, nor thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> By which wee ſee, we doe not rightlie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the Saboth, except all within our gates, that is, our authoritie, (ſo called, becauſe they bound the proper place of everie man, where he exerciſeth anie authoritie) doe likewiſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the ſame. The ſeconde reaſon, is drawne from the example of the Lorde himſelfe, the more to allure vs and mooue vs, who contende to come neere the excellent: So Chriſt gaue an example for vs to follow. <hi>For the Lord made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth in ſixe daies, but the ſeventh he reſted.</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:2076:63"/>
By that ſeventh day, he pointeth out the Iewes Saboth, the ſeventh from the creation, to the which day they were never preciſelie tyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being the ſeventh, it caried a note of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſo did ſhadow out the excellencie of our reſt vnder Chriſt, Heb. 4.20. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe that was ceremonial, that proper day was pointed out to Adam. Gen 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if this had not bene ceremoniall, he had not needed, becauſe the morall equity of one in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was written in his heart, as aboue hath bin noted. And thus, as it was a figure of our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and adoption, it was not a peece of the firſt Table, but rather generall to the whole Law, and therefore in that reſpect is aboliſhed.

                  <hi>A Sacrament of the eternal couenant, is a publike &amp; faithfull worke of the whole Church, wherein by the Miniſters putting apart by the word and praier, to an holy vſe, a viſible ſigne, ordained of God in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſcribed, by his deliuerie, and their receiving of the ſame; the holie Ghoſt doth offer and repreſent liuelie vnto all; but more ſurely applie to the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver therof, the offering and giving of God in three perſons, and the Churches receiving of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; the covenant concerning iuſtification, &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification vnto eternall life, fullie ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in him.</hi>

               <p>[<hi>A Sacrament of the eternall covenant</hi>] ſo called,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2076:64"/>
to put a difference between other ſignes, as the <hi>Rain-bow, laying on of hands in ordination,</hi> &amp; other ſuch ſignes, ſo called of old, Gen. 17.10. &amp; doth ſeale vp the ſame, Rom. 4.11. 1. Cor. 11.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Is a publike</hi>] that is, to ſhew the nature &amp; true reverence of thoſe works, becauſe theſe are not at any time for one, by one, or concerning the dignity of one, as appereth by this that is ſaid here, <hi>All haue bene baptized into one bodie, all made to drinke into one cup.</hi> Which ſheweth, that it is a worke of a publike nature, of publike fruit and priviledges to all, of publike profeſsion of the ſame, and therefore in regard of the dignitie &amp; reverence of it, to be publikely miniſtred with the prayers of all, and for the profite of all: ſo for this ende Circumciſion was miniſtred pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and they came together to it. Luk. 1.59. &amp; in the Supper they continued together, Act. 2.42. It ſhould be in the Church, not at home in the houſe, 1. Cor. 11. Therefore, there were convocations in the Paſſeover, Exod. 12.6.47 Act. 2.42.20. Chap.</p>
               <p>[<hi>And faithfull</hi>] This is gathered, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>by one ſpirite we are baptized into one bodie, and made to drinke into one ſpiritual drinke,</hi> all which is done by faith, <hi>by which he doth dwell in our heartes,</hi> Ephe. 3.17. Iohn. 6.36. So in Baptiſme. Gal. 3. <hi>As manie as are baptized, haue put on Chriſt: by faith we are the ſons of God.</hi> This is plaine in thoſe who receiue, being of diſcretion, that make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their faith, Act. 8.36.37. &amp; Mark. 16.16
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2076:65"/>
Now in the baptiſme of infants, the Miniſters ought to haue faith in this worke, the parentes who offer the children, in regarde of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God <hi>made to them and their ſeed,</hi> Gen. 17 7. Act. 20.29. the Church euen with their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, &amp; witneſsing, do work with faith: and laſt of all, the child, when hee commeth to diſcretion, ſhal haue comfort by it: onely, if he die, the ſpirite of God doth work the effectual knitting of him to the bodie of Chriſt, by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret working, as it pleaſeth him, in ſteed of that faith which commeth by hearing. Therfore he ſaith, <hi>that by one ſpirit all the members of the Church are baptized into one bodie, &amp;c.</hi> which is ſo general as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth infants, who haue not faith. Of the Supper of the Lorde there is no doubt. This doth teach vs, firſt, that faith is not ſecure, but carefull to nouriſh and vpholde it ſelfe by theſe means, when infidelitie neglecteth it. Act. 8.36. Rom. 4.11. Eſa. 7.13.14. Secondlie, that it is not the outward worke that wil help, vnles faith and the holy Ghoſt worke inwardlie, not the waſhing away of the filth of the fleſh, but in that a good conſcience maketh requeſt vnto God, through the reſurrection of Chriſt. 1. Pet. 3. &amp; ſo the Papiſtes are confuted, that ſay, that the worke wrought outwardly in it ſelfe, doth giue grace: for as the word profiteth nothing, vnles it be mixt with faith. Hebr. 4.2. ſo it is with the viſible word, which ſpeaketh to all the ſences, as it were.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:2076:65"/>[<hi>worke</hi>] So it is called, becauſe it is not only a ſigne, as a Rain-bow, but a worke, wherin the Miniſter hath his parte, in declaring or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, praying, &amp;c. &amp; the people theirs, in joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with him: not water onely, but waſhing: not bread only, but giving, taking, eating, &amp;c. Which is, becauſe the Lord would haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man more effectually moved, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the eare, but the eies, hand, feeling, and ſuch like inſtruments of the outward man, are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual inſtruments of the holy Ghoſt to woorke withall.</p>
               <p>[<hi>The whole Church</hi>] This is added, to ſhew that this appertaineth not to all, but to the Church onely, none ro bee baptized, but thoſe that are holie, 1. Cor. 7.14. and which are in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: none meete for the Supper, but which know and beleeue according to Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, 1. Cor. 5.11. and to ſuch belongeth that ſaying onlie, <hi>Which are Citizens, and not ſtrangers from God.</hi> Epheſ. 4.11.12. and therefore, theſe holie things muſt not be given to Papiſts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and wicked perſons. 2. Chro. 35.6. Act. 8 36. Not to dogs, Mat. 7.6. Secondly, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew, that not the Miniſters alone muſt work here, but the Church with him, in wineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his worke, in approouing the ſame by one ſpirit of grace; by conſenting in praier &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, for which they are ſaid to do the works of the Sacramentes, Luke. 1.59. 1. Cor. 11.5. In Baptiſme, they receiue not only comfort by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2076:66"/>
of the ſame work in themſelues, but alſo as no member is cut off by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the preſence of all, with praiers and conſent of Chriſts ſpirit in all. 1. Cor. 5.4.5. ſo it behoveth, that by the proper conſent of the ſpirit of God in al, the partie to be baptized, be ſolemnly receiued, and the wholl Church to be aſſured by that work, that he is a fellow heir, to be partaker with them in the communion of Saints, and to whom they ought to render the ſame; ſo that this is alſo one good &amp; ſure grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for which they ought to be preſent. In the Sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per likewiſe, when God calleth al to a banquet why ſhould any bee abſent which haue faith &amp; repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Act. 2.38? Why ſhuld they not ſhew that they are one body, becauſe they eat all of one bread? 1. Cor. 10.17. Wherefore the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body of the Congregation, if they may, or as manye as maye, ought to be preſent, and in the Lords ſupper to be pertakers.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Wherein by</hi>] In the whole Sacrament there are two partes: the one the outward worke, ſet out by it ſelfe, the other the inward and ſpirituall work ſet out by it ſelf: &amp; both theſe, as they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere one to another, ſo are they ſet downe in this place; in both there is the perſon autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſed, to put apart to that vſe, to offer, to giue &amp; to receiue. In both, there is the thing rightly put apart, offered, given, received, &amp; applied to his proper vſe. The perſons without, is firſt, God his miniſter, authoriſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by his Church;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2076:66"/>
his works are to put apart, conſecrate, or dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to that holie vſe, by opening the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, by praying for his bleſsing promiſed to theſe creatures, by giving tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed work of that action. Alſo to offer &amp; deliver aright the creatures, the water to waſh with it, the bread to be eaten, the wine to be drunke. Secondly, the perſons without, are the whole Church, joining with the Miniſter in prayer, in quickning their faith by the covenant of God, beholding the former works of the Miniſter, &amp; ratifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their hearts: And laſt of all, by receiving and applying, or having applyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right the viſible ſignes. The perſons which are inward, is the giver, one God in three perſons; who by this viſible worde in the Sacramente doe offer, giue and apply the inwarde matter ſet foorth: And alſo the ſaide Church, being inwardlie ſtrong by knowledge, faith and repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, do with joy receiue that which is offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, applying it vnto that fruit for which it was giuen. The outward matters are the crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures ordained of God, ſanctified by the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial word &amp; prayer, and ſo ordered in outward maner, as water to waſh, bread to be broken, wine to be drunken, as is preſcribed: their fruit is to repreſent to the eie, eare, feeling, &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to ſeal vp &amp; be an inſtrument, more cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainly to apply, for although it doeth apply no more than the word preached doth, neither by other inward gifts tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the working of the holy
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2076:67"/>
Ghoſt by faith, yet becauſe the inſtruments are more, &amp; in the work God hath ſanctified more inſtruments in his creatures to our ſeeing, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, receiuing, &amp;c. they do more prouoke faith kindle faith, ſtrengthen faith, to the receiving of Chriſt. The inward matter is Ieſus Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cified, who was ſealed vp &amp; conſecrated by the father himſelfe, and the holy Ghoſt: yea, by his own praier to the work of our mediation, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he here barely offered, but offered, give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and received, as the ratifier of the whole cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God by his death; eſpecially to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp; ſo full redemption for ever: He muſt therefore be ſo ſeene here, ſo received here by faith: being received, ſo applied, as we may feel theſe fruits conveighed to vs from him, &amp; this is the whole ſubſtantiall order of Sacraments, ſet foorth at large, and nowe followeth to bee prooved and applied to vſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, that ther are theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and ſubſtantiall things in the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacraments, it is moſt plaine, when he ſaith, <hi>Yee haue bene baptized into one bodie, you haue bene made to drinke vnto one ſpirituall drinke</hi>: Lo then, not water, but waſhing: <hi>you haue bin wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> and then, ſo as ye came to be one bodie in Chriſt, to communicate in all his benefits, and ſo you haue bene made to drinke outwardlie, but therewithall and thereby, as by an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſpirituall drinke is deliuered out of Chriſt. Now to come to the particulars, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2076:67"/>
the Miniſters of God muſt be the firſt outward perſon, here it is plain: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very nature of waſhing or giving drink, doth require a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to waſh, and to giue drink: a holie waſhing doth require a holie perſon, to put a difference betweene this waſhing and all other waſhings, and giving drink. By <hi>holie,</hi> we mean that which is in a peculiar maner, authoriſed &amp; bleſſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, (though the Miniſter peradventure be of an evill life.) Mat. 23.25. Secondly, when as the being of this work dependeth vpon the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the word from God, hauing his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is ſolemne, as Paule ſaith, Ephe. 5.6. by the waſhing of water through the word, the Miniſter being onely called of God, to bee his Ambaſſador, to be in ſteed of Chriſt, to beſeech vs to bee reconciled vnto God. 2. Cor. 5.20. It remaineth that he of neceſsitie bee required. Thirdly, ſeeing they onely are the diſpoſers of God his miſteries, they only can preach &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments. Fourthly, as the firmnes of the ſeale ſtandeth not onelie in the print or forme it maketh, but eſpeciallie, that it bee ſet on, by one that hath authority thereunto: It is therfore much more in this caſe. Laſtly, as ther is inwardly conſidered, not onelie the thing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and received, Chriſt, but alſo faith, that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it given, and doth receiue from him (vnto whom this honor properlie belongeth,) even one God in three perſons, eſpeciallie, in Ieſus Chriſt God and man, and to take this as offred
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2076:68"/>
from another, is to denie God: ſo in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work, which muſt fullie anſwer to this, is required, he who beareth Gods perſon in this work, and therfore can onlie conſecrate, offer, and deliuer with authoritie, the outward thing which anſwereth to the inward matter: So that to receiue it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, is to denie Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, and to giue the glorie of it there, wher he hath not given it, and to depriue our ſelues of this comfort, that our heart may ſay, Gods ſolemne voice ſpeaketh, his ſolemne hand offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and giveth, which is here the liuely ſtay of our faith. And this is that that S. Iohn Baptiſt vrgeth, Mat. 3.11. <hi>I</hi> (Gods miniſter) <hi>baptize you with water, but he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth after me, ſhal baptize you with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Where we ſee, he plainelie layeth together, and compareth ſacramentally himſelf as Gods Miniſter, repreſenting Chriſt with the Father, the Son, and the holie Ghoſt, who do inwardlie waſh and baptize: &amp; his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward waſhing with Chriſts inward waſhing.</p>
               <p>Now, that his works are to put apart or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, by declaring Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by praying for his bleſsing, &amp; by giving thankes, is plaine, not only becauſe that is required of everie one who giueth ordinarie food to his, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, becauſe theſe creatures, having no naturall properties given of God in them, to work ſuch an heavenly worke of repreſenting &amp; offering vnto all trulie, &amp; applying vnto the faithful Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: it muſt needes haue this propertie
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2076:68"/>
from the word of God, it muſt bee received by praier, acknowledged with tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſgiuing: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how ſhoulde it come, if the worde gaue it not? and how given by the word, if by him not asked and conveighed? &amp; how can the aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this be witneſſed to the glorie of God, but with thankſgiving? &amp; who is here the common mouth of God and the Church, but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Therefore he ſaith, the waſhing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the word, Eph. 5.6. Therfore the breade of bleſsing which we break, &amp; the cup of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, which is it thus bleſſed, is the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, 1. Cor. 10. and not he that eateth <hi>that</hi> bread, but hee that eateth <hi>this</hi> bread: that is, thus bleſſed and made holie, &amp;c. eateth and drinketh his owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And here we muſt learn againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that it is no magical witchcraft, which by the vertue of one word murmured in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, cleane aboliſheth the naturall ſubſtance of things, but it is the plaine &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful declaration of the promiſe of God, and his inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which (with their praiers) doth giue theſe creatures another propertie tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had although they keep their former properties &amp; ſubſtance ſtill, even that they might be ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as haue bene ſpoken of before: So we doe not (as they belie vs) put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe creatures, thus dedicate to Gods ſeruice, &amp; others: We doe not denie a change, onlie, we allow that change which is according
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2076:69"/>
to Gods word, &amp; hath fruite and commoditie with it, that is, that it doth not onlie now nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or waſh the body, but is an effectual inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of farther and more excellent things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule. Here alſo wee muſt further note, that although this dedicating of the creatures to their vſe, only be required of the miniſter, as that being of ſuch neceſsitie, as if it bee omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it deſtroieth the Sacrament, yet the Lorde requireth a further thing of him in regarde of the greater glorie, beautie, power, &amp;c. of this whole worke, which is the liuely preaching of his worde. For when the right order of the Lord hath bene kept, the Church hath not bin wont to ſhut vp her ſolemne prayers, without this worke: So that Salomon ſaith of his time, <hi>When thou goeſt into the Temple, looke vnto both thy feet, &amp; be more ready to heare, than to offer the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of fools.</hi> Pro. 15. We ſee it hath bin a cuſtom from old generations, that every Sabboth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they praied, and Moſes was read, there ſhould be preaching in their Sinagogues: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtles haue obſerved this. Act. 2.42.46. We muſt not mervaile then, if in this ſolemn work, when the outward things are more effectuall, by the vnderſtanding of the worde, this bee required very ſtraightly. As I ſaid before, it hath ben the continual order of Gods Church: therefore in the Paſſeover, the firſt day, &amp; ſeventh day, were daies of holy convocation or aſſemblies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we haue ſhewed this worke was obſerved, &amp;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2076:69"/>
may further appeare by Nehem. 8.14.15.16. Therefore, when the Apoſtles celebrated Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, Act. 8.12.38. &amp; Act. 9.17. &amp; 10.16.15.32 And when they celebrated the Supper inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt. Act. 20. this order was obſerved. And S. Paule expreſlie noteth it in <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> that he firſt preached, that they ſhould beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt that was to come, and they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, were baptized, &amp;c. Act. 19.4. Where we may note alſo the dutie of the Church, which ought to giue eſpecial good ear &amp; heed, to hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger and thirſt for it, and to be quickened by it. And this plainlie meeteth with a common errour, that many deſire often to come to the Lordes Table, but care litle for the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the worde of God; which is as greate madnes, as if one ſhould looke much vpon the ſealer of certaine writinges, but neuer care to know the conveigha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of eſtate, the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and ſeverall bondes, conteined in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the way how to come to the poſſeſsion, ratified and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp by thoſe ſeales.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters other works are, that hee muſt offer, deliver, and apply, according as is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed, the outward creatures; ſo that the water he muſt apply to waſhing, the bread he muſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be eaten, not to be worſhipped, kneeled vnto, &amp;c. So that herein they muſt keep the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they haue receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles, as they received it from Chriſt: Therefore wee ſee the Apoſtle 1. Cor. 11. ſhutteth out all abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2076:70"/>
in the Church of the Corinthes, with this reaſon, <hi>that which I received, I deliuered</hi>: and that which is grounded on our Savior his comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Do this, teach them to obſerue whatſoeuer I haue commanded,</hi> Mat. 28. in the end. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, here al additions of new ſignes, eſpecially of croſsing, ſpitle, milk, ſalt, oile, of new actions as lifting vp, adoring, ſacrificing, &amp;c. doe al ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominablie pollute theſe holie ſacramentes of God, whoſe whole honour is, that they remain vnto the Church of God, in that ſimplicitie he left them. And when no action here is worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but by reaſon of Gods word, which is ſanctified to a profitable vſe, and made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the working of the holie Ghoſt: it followeth, that to bring in ſuch additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with their ſignifications &amp; vſes of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward partes of the Sacraments, is to command the holy Ghoſt to be at our beck, to bleſſe our inſtruments, &amp;c. which is to make our ſelues, at the leaſt equall to him in wiſdom, clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that in Nomb. 9. <hi>We ſhould not follow our own waies &amp; eies, after which we goe a whoring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other outward perſons are, the Miniſters and the whole Church, who muſt joine in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, quicken their faith by conſideration of the covenant of God. For God hath not preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the former works of the Miniſter, that the Church in them ſhould be idle: which we may vnderſtand even by this, that the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the worke of prayer, prophecying, ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2076:70"/>
and ſo now of adminiſtring of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto the Church, becauſe in the prayer their heartes joine, in the opening of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and covenant they are taught, and in remembrance they are confirmed, their hearts allow the worke. In the action about the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they make their vſe: in the putting apart the water, they behold the blood of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cified, yea himſelf, &amp; al his deſerving put apart, as for a fellow member, ſo for themſelues and their baptiſme receiued long ago, nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth freſh, &amp; quickneth a freſh; for as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs, the fruite of that worke is not to be for a time, but daylie, Rom. 6.1.2.3. So no doubt, when our hearts joine in this worke, one for another, it ſhal be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very fruitful vnto our ſelues. In the parents this is yet more, who receiue after a ſort the covenant of God, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerning one part, ratified in the fleſh of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the ſupper al this is more liuely to all, they ought to haue their faith ſtirred vp, provoked, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, &amp;c. by the putting apart of the creatures, by the breaking, noting out the bruiſing (as Eſai ſaith) of chriſt for our ſins. The vſe of the deliuering, receiving, &amp;c. hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bin ſpoken of, and ſhal be further hereafter.</p>
               <p>Here therefore, eſpecially we muſt take heed, that we account not our ſelues free, to lean our mindes to other matters than are done of the Church, till it come to vs. And thus wee haue ſeen the outward perſons, with the inward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2076:71"/>
to them, as hath bene touched in the particulars: God to his miniſter, &amp; the inward matter to the outwarde in the Church: their works alſo haue bin conſidered in part. Nowe the matter followeth, which are the creatures of God, put apart for that work which he hath ordained: as water put apart to waſh, breade &amp; wine put apart to nouriſh, refreſh, &amp; make glad the heart of man. Theſe having fitnes in them to that work, can even provoke vs to the right vſe of them, as in the Euneuch, to deſire to bee baptized as ſoone as he came to the water: in thoſe to whom Salomon ſpeaketh, Pro. 7. who ought to be provoked, <hi>when wiſdome hath made ready her wine, and furniſhed her table.</hi> Nowe theſe inſtruments are outward ſignes, being ſo ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by the Miniſter, as is afore declared, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared, offred, deliuered, &amp; receiued, doe liuely repreſent and offer to al, and ſeale vp the true beleever by faith; God offering &amp; giuing, &amp; the Church receiuing of Chriſt crucified, &amp; the covenant of God, &amp; all the promiſes of the ſame ratified in him vnto eternall life. Here firſt we muſt conſider, the proportion and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the outward matter, &amp; the application of the ſame. The ſignes or outward things haue relation vnto Chriſt crucified, and the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God ratified in him: ſo the water, which is a matter apt to waſh vs, doeth hold proportion with Chriſt, who is apt to waſh and cleanſe vs, 1. Cor. 6.11. So the bread and wine being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2076:71"/>
fit to nouriſh vs, haue reſpect to the fleſh &amp; blood of Chriſt crucified, ſpiritually &amp; fully to nouriſh vs, as the wordes of the inſtitution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: <hi>This is my bodie, this is my blood, and the bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the bodie of Chriſt? We are made to be baptized into one body, &amp; made to drink into one ſpiritual drink.</hi> Then the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; delivering of theſe ſignes, hath reſpecte to the offring and delivering of the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and noted before, by one God in three perſons. For as wee are in baptiſme baptized vnto the name o the Father, Son, &amp; holy ghoſt, ſo to bee (as ſhall appeare) in and by Chriſt the ſpouſe, children, &amp; houſhold ſervantes of God: ſo this one God in three perſons, muſt offer &amp; giue Ieſus Chriſt, God and man vnto vs, which is ſet forth by the Miniſter, who beareth their authoritie, and doth performe this outwarde worke, which hath relation to the inward. So the Sonne is ſaid. Math. 3. <hi>to baptize with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> when he by the holy Ghoſt, doeth apply himſelf as he is God &amp; man crucified, to waſh, &amp;c. Neither can the Father poſsiblie be ſhutte out, who by the Sonn through the holy Ghoſt worketh, as they are one, &amp; as his work is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie noted, Col. 2. &amp; al three jointly. Tit. 3. are comprehended for that work in baptiſme: the like is to be ſaid of the Supper of the Lord: for the Father hath ſealed vp the Sonne, the true bread from heaven, and doth teach vs, draw vs, and giue vs it, and power to receiue it, both in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2076:72"/>
the word and Sacraments. And the Son alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his fleſh to be meat in deed, and his blood to be drink in deed, both in the word alone, &amp; alſo in the Sacraments, Ioh. 6.27.32.37.40.45 46.57. Which place is not proper to that given of Chriſt in the worde alone, or in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo, but common and general to both. Now as the outward offering and giving, hath relation to his inward, ſo alſo the outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or having applied, hath relation vnto the inward. So in being baptized, we are ſaid to put on Chriſt, to be waſhed with him, Gal. 3.27 So in taking and eating the bread, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and turne to ſpirituall nouriſhment Ieſus Chriſt, and therfore it is here ſaid, <hi>that we are all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> that is, into ſpirituall nouriſhment out of Chriſt. And this is the true relation between the inward &amp; outward mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the applying of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Nowe wee muſt conſider the effectes or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the holy Ghoſt, by outward ſignes, in regarde of the inwarde matter, to which they haue relation. Where firſt it is to be noted, wee ſpeake of the holie Ghoſt, to declare that God hath not given the effectes and workings fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to theſe inſtrumentes, as faculties or properties, which are naturallie in them, as that water ſhould aſwel by force inherent in it, waſh our conſciences fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dead workes to ſerue the living God, as it hath vertue to waſh our bodily filth away, and to cleanſe vs; but onely
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2076:72"/>
that God hath choſen them as his inſtruments to worke by, not by any propertie in them, but by vertue which the holy Ghoſt doth work by them, ſo that as Paule ſaith of the miniſtery of man generallie, <hi>Paule is nothing in planting, nor Apollo in watering, but God which giueth the increaſe</hi> The ſame muſt likewiſe be vnderſtood, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Sacraments. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>We are baptized into one body by one Spirit</hi>: So that indeed the whole cauſe, that in Baptiſme wee are ſet in the bodie of Chriſt, is from the holie Ghoſt. Therefore it is ſaid, Iohn doeth baptize as the Miniſter with water, but Chriſt as the Lord with the holy Ghoſt. Mat. 3. Therfore, all this working of the inward graces, is giuen to the holie Ghoſt. 1. Cor. 6. Tit. 5.5.6. And ſo Paule ſheweth, he was exhorted to waſh away his ſins in Baptiſme, with calling on the name of God, who only ſhould work that worke. This being learned againſt the Papiſts, we may know that the work of the Sacraments, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not from the very worke wrought, but from Gods Spirit working in and by the ſame, and that working, is by the worke of faith in Gods children.</p>
               <p>Now the effects of working, as they are ſeals: both which are diſtinctly noted of the Apoſtle as ſignes. Rom. 4.12. in that by their relation with the ſpirituall matter, they doe liuely ſet forth to the vnderſtanding by many ſenſes, as feeling, ſeeing, &amp;c. the inward ſpiritual matter,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2076:73"/>
to which they haue relation, the doctrin of the word of God being annexed: So the Paſſeouer was a ſigne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hands, a frontlet between their eies, that the doctrine of God might bee in their mouth. Exod. 13.9. Whereby we ſee it is become a Schoolmaiſter by the worde, more excellent than the worde alone, that even the doctrin of God may be more liuelie ſpoken of. Now, it is not a ſigne only, to ſet forth &amp; liuelie repreſent vnto vs theſe thinges by outwarde means, but alſo to offer from God in trueth, all thoſe benefits in Chriſt which are repreſented: for God doth not dally, but doeth trulie offer in his Sacraments, to all that are admitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, all that which is there ſignified. And therefore it is ſaid of S. Paule, <hi>That al did eate of that ſpiritual meat, &amp; all did drinke of that spirituall Rocke, which was Chriſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.23. &amp;c. Becauſe al did eat that ſpirituall meate, which did offer vnto them the ſpiritual Manna: al did drink of that Rocke which did follow them, and was in ſhew and repreſentation, a true and very offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring indeed of Chriſt. But ſome of them recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only the outward ſigns, did neglect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſpirituall grace ſo liuelie repreſented, and trulie offered them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond effect and working, which is only in the children of God, and thoſe which are of diſcretion, by faith alone, doth ſeale vp, that is, more ſurely, firmly, certainlie, &amp; comfortablie apply Chriſt vnto vs, and al his gifts neceſsarie
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2076:73"/>
for vs, according to the covenant and promiſe of God in him. So that this vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is plaine, that although Chriſt be bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſent, yet he is trulie &amp; indeed by faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with all his benefits trulie receiued, and ſo his communion &amp; fellowſhip applied vnto the true receiuers. Only this is the difference, that in the word and by the word alone, our faith is wrought, we trulie receiue Chriſt by faith; but in theſe Sacraments our faith is quickned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and increaſed, &amp; ſo doeth more fullie, liuely, and comfortablie applie Chriſt and his benefites. Both theſe are verie manifeſt in the Scripture. The firſt, that indeed Chriſt with his benefits, is in and by theſe ſignes, as by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments receiued. For we are ſaid to be baptized here into one bodie, that is, by baptiſme to be ingrafted into one body: and haue bin made to drinke into one Spirite: that is, one ſpiritual drinke of the blood of Chriſt: ſo trulie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Chriſt is put on, we are truly planted into him, his death, reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. Gal. 3.27. Rom. 6.3. We are waſhed, wee are ſaved, not by the outward work done, as the Papiſts imagin, not by putting away of the filthineſſe of the fleſh, but by the anſwer of a good conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, throgh the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt. 1. Pet. 3.21. So in the Supper it is moſt apparant, <hi>the breade which wee breake, is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the bodie of Chriſt,</hi> ſo that we which receiue, communicate Chriſt in &amp; by theſe ſignes, as the whole order and inſtitution
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2076:74"/>
ſhall make this more manifeſt afterward.</p>
               <p>Now the other pointes, that theſe are ſeales, not firſt to giue, but more firmlie, ſurely, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortablie, to giue and to applie, is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in thoſe of diſcretion, in baptiſme faith to apprehend Chriſt and all his benefits, is firſt required, as appeareth by the Eunuche: onely in children remaineth ſome ſhew of doubt, but ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, they are holy; that is, within the covenant of God, <hi>I am thy God, &amp; the God of thy ſeed.</hi> Chriſt &amp; his benefits in this cove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant of grace doth belong vnto them, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by faith it may be applied, or dying, the Spirit of the grace of God may worke in them, as he knoweth how, and hath not revealed.</p>
               <p>And this they haue before Baptiſme, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliue, but not by any vertue of birth, which bringeth death, and that only in reſpect of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption: but by the grace of Gods covenant, that if the tree be holy, ſo ſhould the branches alſo. So then this is the proper work of the Sacraments, more ſurely, and ſtronglie, and comfortablie to apply, and ſeale vp Chriſt crucified, and the covenant of God ratified in him to ſaluation. And thus much generally of a Sacrament: now followeth that which is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of this generall, which euery one muſt do concerning the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, before this work is required, examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the feeling of ſin, Act. 8.37. Act. 19.4. 1. Cor. 11. Then our acceptable knowledge of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2076:74"/>
God in three perſons, as of Chriſt his perſon, perfect God, and perfect man; his office to ſaue his people, to be their Prieſt by his ſacrifice, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectly to reconcile &amp; juſtify, to make alſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall interceſsion, that our obedience, praiers, &amp;c. may bee accepted: to be their King by the government of his Church, to kil ſin in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſanctify them, and to apply the whole matter of ſalvation, wrought in his Prieſthoode.</p>
               <p>After, of a true faith &amp; repentance, that being in one body with him, hee come aright to the Sacraments, &amp; the imperfections, weakneſſes, &amp;c. may be ſupplied. In the worke it ſelfe, by a right knowledge of the doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, faith muſt work in everie point, as hath bene declared aboue.</p>
               <p>The vſe &amp; end muſt finally be applied, that all the doctrine of Gods good will, here in Chriſt ſealed vp, may bee in our heartes, and ſo in our mouthes, to confirm &amp; ſtrengthen our ſelues &amp; others, in al temptatations, both againſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſanctification.

               <p>THat theſe two only are the Sacraments of the couenant of God, appeareth by the declaration of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, gathered out of this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2076:75"/>
place, with which, none of the other fiue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined of the Papiſts, can ſtand: for they cannot ſhew vs, that <hi>Matrimony</hi> is an inſtrument, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God doth applie Chriſt and his benefits, &amp; this is not a common inſtrument of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſalvation, and benefits which al haue in Chriſt. <hi>Orders</hi> only are proper to Miniſters, and is not an inſtrument to apply any common grace of the Church, but to ſignifie that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Miniſter. And <hi>Penance</hi> hath not anie viſible ſigne ordeined of God, but is only one fruit and benefit of Chriſt, which is ſealed vp in both theſe Sacraments, as ſhall more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare afterward. <hi>Confirmation</hi> is an invention of their own braine, taken from an apiſh imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the laying on of handes in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, or thoſe who receiued the gifte of miracles, and therefore was proper to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For Philip the Evangeliſt was aboue all Biſhops, &amp; yet could not adminiſter it, But the Apoſtles, S. Peter and Iohn, Act. 8. &amp; this whollie to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiſme, as ſhall appear after. Neither doth there any <hi>Oyling</hi> agree to this definition, which was not a publicke worke, but a private: which was not for ever, but for a time whileſt the gift of healing laſted in the Church, which was not of the couenant of God to ſaluation, but a temporall bleſsing, or at the fartheſt, if the partie had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted any ſpeciall ſin, which was the cauſe of that correction, by being reſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to health, he ſhuld receiue aſſurance of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2076:75"/>
forgiuenes of that ſin: all which laſt of al, doth not apply to the worthy receiuer, the benefite of health there promiſed, no not with them: &amp; therefore by the former declaration, can be no Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we gather this diuiſion out of this place, becaus the Apoſtle plainly maketh it: for being about to ſhew, how that many are in one bodie of Chriſt, he proveth it by a full diuiſion of thoſe pledges, both our being ſet into the bodie of Chriſt, &amp; our nouriſhing in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now, if there had bene any other pledges, he would never haue omitted them.</p>
               <p>Laſt of al, the effect or vſe of both theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here doth prooue it; for when as we can haue no more inwarde grace applied vnto vs than Chriſt, &amp; that is firſt to be born in him, &amp; to haue all priviledges of eternall life, and then after to be nouriſhed in the ſame continuallie in him: both theſe being fullie repreſented and ſealed vp vnto vs in theſe two, it followeth that Chriſt (who would haue the feweſt, but the beſt Sacraments that might bee vnder the Goſpell) would, nor did ordeine no more. 1.

                  <hi>THE firſt Sacrament</hi>] this appearth plainlie, both out of the diviſion going before, and alſo now by the doctrine of Chriſt, willing his Apoſtles to teach al nations: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they beleeue, he will haue them ſtraight way baptized, ſo we ſee the practiſe of the Church touching the ſame thing. Act. 2.38. Act. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the ende. The hiſtorie of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> &amp;c. And it is plaine by the effect or vertue of it.</p>
               <p>[<hi>By the Miniſters once waſhing</hi>] That it ſhuld be the Miniſters work, is proued generallie in the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2076:76"/>
Sacraments, and is plaine here by the words of our Sauior, who ſpeaketh to his Apoſtles, &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them the charge of this worke, as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or hanging vppon their preaching. This word <hi>once</hi> is added, as that which is gathered out of the inſtitution of Chriſte, who willeth them to miniſter to every beleeuer, baptiſme, not baptiſmes: who ſaith not of this as of the Supper, <hi>as often as you do this.</hi> Alſo according to the plaine example of the Apoſtles, who would not haue the members of the Church baptized the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d time, as appeareth by this, that thoſe who <hi>beleeued, continued in the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in communication, breaking of bread, and praier, but not in beeing baptized. Act.</hi> 2. And alſo, that Paule finding thoſe that wer baptized of Iohn, &amp; had not receiued the gifts of the holy Ghoſt doth inſtruct them of the doctrine of Chriſt, &amp; the baptiſme anſwering the ſame, &amp; doeth not baptize them againe, but laying on handes on them, they received viſible giftes of the holie Ghoſt, Act. 19.4.5. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe it ſealeth vp our waſhing in Chriſt, our once being borne againe, our once ſetling into the body of Chriſt, our once ſpirituall mariage with him, as ſhal after more plainly appeare.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Waſhing or baptizing</hi>] Both are added, becauſe waſhing is neceſſarie to the Sacrament, and yet there may be waſhing without baptizing, as it doth ſignifie in his narrow and ſtraight ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that is, a waſhing with a whole plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2076:77"/>
of them in water. So then we muſt knowe, that waſhing is of neceſsitie, becauſe ſo S. Paule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the nature of Baptiſme, Eph. 5.26. <hi>The waſhing of water through the word</hi>: and that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> vſed of our Saviour, which doth ſignifie a plunging, to make cleane and waſh away the filth, and therefore, this is neceſsarie, becauſe of the proportion and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it muſt haue, with our ſpiritual waſhing of our newe birth: Tit. 3.5. For the purpoſe of Chriſt is to ſet down before our eies liuely, in this outward bare applying of water, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Chriſt vnto vs in our new birth: that as we knowe in waſhing, there is a being vnder the water, a ſoking vp of the filth, and leaving it behind: ſo this might be liuely ſet foorth in three things anſwering the ſame, in our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſanctification, as ſhal after appeare: which was alſo moſt liuelie noted in that plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before. Now in that it is added <hi>with water,</hi> that muſt needes be vnderſtood in the wordes of our Savior Chriſt, as appeareth by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>The waſhing of water, &amp;c.</hi> and in the words of Iohn Baptiſt, <hi>I baptize you with water.</hi> And in Act. 10. in the end. He called for water, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to be baptized: and by the ſtorie of the Euneuch.</p>
               <p>And indeed, becauſe nothing is apt to ſette forth the blood of Chriſt &amp; his merits, which is apt to cleanſe and waſh vs, but water which leaveth no filth: herein therefore wee learne
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2076:77"/>
plainly, that Chriſt would liuely teach vs, and make vs ſee and feel in his outward worke, that ſame which is inward. That which is further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined [<hi>Into the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt</hi>] is that which pertaineth to the forme of this Sacrament, that ſo we ſhould bee waſhed, that thereby it might be noted, we are ſegregated from the world, to haue fellowſhip with one God in three perſons, as a wife with an husbande, which is noted by this, [<hi>into the name</hi>] that is, to beare the name, in being one with theſe three perſons by faith, and by han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on them for all gouernment, bleſsing, &amp;c. Whereof it commeth, that as the wife is called by the name of the husband, and to beare the mans name, or to haue his name called on a woman, is to bee a wife, Eſai. 4.1. ſo to be into the name of God, to bear his name, is to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated and dedicated to him as his ſpouſe, to obey him and receiue protection and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him alone in Chriſt, as Dan. 9.18. And Paule alſo ſaith, <hi>Into whoſe name were ye bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? into the name of Paule? Was Paul crucified for you? &amp; I baptized none into mine own name.</hi> 1. Cor. 1 For none was by baptiſme waſhed to beare Paules name, to come as a wife in the Church to him, to haue ſpirituall fellowſhip, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and government from him. And ſo this interpretation ſtandeth the worde (for it is the word <hi>vnto,</hi> as 1. Cor. 10.) with the circumſtance &amp; conference of Scriptures; as alſo the Fathers
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2076:78"/>
their interpretation, to prooue the Trinitie of perſons in one God, becauſe euery one is God, becauſe we beare his name, look for our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, life, government, &amp;c. as a wife from an husband. From theſe three perſons, which are one God, and ſo we learn in this former maner of baptiſme, we are called from the fellowſhip of the world, of Sathan, ſin, &amp;c. to haue fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God. Thus we ſee the outward part of this Sacrament plainly prooved out of this place: Nowe it followeth that we come to the ſecond, or inward part; that which is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and offered to all, and applied to the true beleever &amp; receiver by the the outward work, as an inſtrument, as hath bin declared before. The inward matter is, firſt, our once ſetting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body of Chriſt for euer: then the end &amp; fruite of the ſame, applied in this Sacrament. Concerning the firſt, although it bee not here expreſſed, yet it is to be gathered hence, by the diligent conſideration of the laſt words, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Scripture: For when this word doth clearly ſay, Wee are joyned with one God in three perſons, to haue all neceſſary benefites from him. And further, that wee cannot knowe God, or come to him but by Ieſus Chriſt, Ioh. 17.2. That we cannot be his ſons, but by him, Rom. 8.9.17. Gal. 3.26. That we cannot beare any fruit, except we be in him, who is the Vine, as Iohn ſaith, chap. 15. That we cannot bee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſanctified but in the name of Ieſus
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2076:78"/>
Chriſt and the Spirit of our God. 1. Cor. 6.13. that the waſhing of our new birth cannot bee ſhedde on vs aboundantlie, but through Ieſus Chriſt our Savior: therfore this is to bee joined (once to God for euer) which muſt needes be, to bee for euer once ſet into Chriſte: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other in baptiſme muſt needes bee by the effectuall applying of his benefits to vs, we muſt needs be firſt in him, and therefore Saint Paule ſaith, <hi>Chriſt gaue himſelf for his Church, that he might purge it, cleanſe it, and might preſent it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, perfit, without blame, ſpot, or wrinckle, by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of water through the word.</hi> Ephe. 5. Therefore we are ſaid in Baptiſme to bee engrafted into Ieſus Chriſt, Roman. 6.3. To be ingrafted with him into the ſimilitude of his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Rom. 6.5.6. Col. 2.11.12. We are ſaid in Baptiſme to put on Chriſt. Gal. 3.27.</p>
               <p>Now it is ſaid further, that we are ſet in him once for ever, becauſe he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to Chriſt once, he caſteth him not away, Iohn. 6.37. he ſhall never hunger. 35. he ſhal not be loſt, 39. he ſhal liue for euer, 50. And Iohn ſaith of thoſe that came outwardly to Chriſt, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Church: <hi>If they had bene of vs, they had not gone from vs.</hi> And this, as it is true of our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into Chriſt, that it is but once in Chriſt for ever, by the immortall ſeede of God that dieth not, 1. Pet. 2. and by the eternal working of the Spirit of God, which nothing can breake: for what ſhal ſeperate vs from Chriſt, when we are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2076:79"/>
by his working adjoyned vnto him? Rom. 8. in the end: As this is true, and doth rightlie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the ſign, ſo is it in all the other reſpects of Chriſtes application vnto vs in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This outwarde waſhing being but once, doeth ſeale vp our once joyning to God in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall mariage, that God finding vs deade in our own blood, hath made an eternal covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with vs, that he wil never turn from vs, to do vs good, but we ſhall be his people, and he will be our God: he wil giue vs one heart and one way that we may feare him for ever; that it may be well with vs and our children: and hee will ſo put his feare in our heart,<note place="margin">Eze. 16.8 Ier. 32. Hoſ, 2.</note> that we ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him: we haue therefore the ſum of Mariage once for ever, never to depart: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is the ſeale of our new birth, by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and water; that is, the holie Ghoſt; which as water cleanſeth vs and begetteth vs againe. Now we being born of God cannot ſinne; that is, be given over vnto ſinne againe. Whoſoever is borne of God ſinneth not, becauſe the ſeede of God is in him, he cannot ſinne, 1. Ioh. 3. So Baptiſme, doeth ſeale vp therein our once bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring again in Chriſt by his H. Spirit, which ſhal remain for ever. And if we could clean fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grace of God again, we ſhuld haue another bearing again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; another ſeal on the ſame: but becauſe we are but once borne, and after nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed ſtill: therefore we are once baptized, and daily receiue the Lords ſupper. And this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2076:79"/>
by Dauid, Pſal, 51. who in his fall, thought much grace was hidden from him, ſo that hee deſired his hart might be created clean within him: yet hee prayed God not to take his holie Spirit from him. Therefore by declaring plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was within him, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his feling.</p>
               <p>So we ſee in the inceſtuous perſon, excommu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicated, and delivered to Sathan, the end was, that the fleſh might be deſtroyed, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit might be ſafe in the day of the Lord. 1. Cor. 6. So that, as everie one who is of the Church, is thought to be regenerate, ſo euen in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, he is thought to haue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and fleſh within him, though the fleſh ſeeme to haue gotten the vpper hand. Wherfore, this is a full comfort, which is ſealed vp vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Sacrament, which maketh them take comfort in all temptations, and to aſſure them againſt the terrours and feare of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to keep and ſtrengthen them, that they haue receiued the ſpirit to beare immortality: ſo that Gods glorie ſhal not die, but they haue his power and his grace ready to defend them. And this confuteth the Papiſts their fantaſie in their imagined Sacrament of <hi>Pennance</hi>: who i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined a clean falling from grace, ſo that we haue no comfort by baptiſme, ſeek a reſtoring in Pennance: whereas (although everie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an riſen from his fall, repenteth vnfeignedly, &amp; ſheweth forth the fruits) he did never fall from grace, neither needeth an outwarde ſeale, that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2076:80"/>
he pertayneth to Gods favour and loue, &amp; his mercifull Couenant, becauſe that hath bin ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp ſo in baptiſme, that it cannot depart, &amp; the fruit and comfort of it doth remaine after: for the Lord Chriſt Ieſus, doth extend it aſwell to the time to come, as alſo the time paſt: <hi>hee that beleeueth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Mark. 16. And Peter ſaith, The baptiſme which nowe ſaueth vs: ſpeaking of thoſe who wer baptized. And Paul, 1. Cor. 6.2.3.4. doth plainlie extend the fruite continuallie, to continue al dying to ſinne, and riſing to righteouſnes. Their deuiſe therfore is wicked, deſtroyeth the true vſe and nature of baptiſme: it maketh one to judge the grace of God and his favour is cleane gone, &amp; that a new birth (as it were) muſt be had, which diſcomforteth a man: whereas, if after a greate ſinne, he ſee the filthines and weaknes of the fleſh, with the horror of the ſame: he knowing that the grace of God is in him, will comfort him, ſtrengthen him in repentance, hatred of ſin, bringing foorth the contrarie fruites, &amp;c. Neither this aſſurance, the roote of all courage in temptations and will, to fight manfullie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne, doeth pull away from vs care to pleaſe God, and bring vs to ſecurity, but doth ſtrengthen vs, and will make vs nouriſh good works, as the fruits whereby we feel and are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that Gods ſeed is in vs. Neyther can any haue a feeling of Gods grace, when he ſhal bee by this means encouraged vnto evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:2076:80"/>Thus wee ſee the firſt point of being ſet into Chriſt: Now the fruits follow. Firſt, that to the glorie of one God in three perſons, we ſeek to haue fellowſhip with one God in three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and that is the point which is given vs to vnderſtand plainly in theſe words: <hi>We are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> For (as wee haue expounded afore) this doth teach vs, that we are conſecrated, dedicated, and joyned to God, that we may carie his name, as his wife, that we may haue fellowſhip, as S. Iohn ſaith, with the Father and the Sonne. 1. John. 1.2.3. That this one God in three perſons may holde as his own, to be glorified in vs for ever: which offreth ſuch ſtrong conſolation, ſuch great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie to a Chriſtian man, as cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: hereby our profeſsion is ſanctified to God, that it may be acceptable. The next end is, that we may from this fellowſhip with God, haue fellowſhip with the Church, in the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites that God doth beſtow vpon the Sonne, &amp; are ſealed vp in baptiſme. Firſt therefore, let vs behold this fellowſhip, &amp; then the benefites.</p>
               <p>This fellowſhip is fitlie expreſſed of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, when he ſaith: <hi>We are built vpon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, Ieſus Chriſt being the corner ſtone, in whom all the building is coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and groweth to an holie temple in the Lord, in whom alſo we are built together, to bee the habitation of God by the Spirit:</hi> So that as we come by Chriſt vnto God, ſo to his Church, that we may haue
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2076:81"/>
fellowſhip with it, and in it, in which alone all we haue ſalvation, for none is ſaved out of the Church, but in Sion the citie of the liuing God we are partakers of all bleſſednes. Therefore this is a pledge of our being one body, though many members, 1. Cor. 12.13. and this is the ſigne that wee are begotten of one God &amp; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, haue one clothing by faith, of Chriſt his righteouſnes: one life, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his life, in vs al. Eph. 4.1.2.3.4.5.6. And therefore this is a firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into publike ſocietie, and as it were, our ſolemn invecting into the Church &amp; houſe of God. The benefits and priviledges that are here, is the waſhing of our new birth, (which is ſo called of the Apoſtle in that place of Titus) which doth ſpread it ſelf into two eſpecial bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, juſtification, and ſanctification, according to that ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>But you are waſhed, you are ſanctified in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, and the ſpirit of our God.</hi> 1. Cor. 6. Which waſhing in general, hath the liuely proportion with the outward work, but in ſpeciall, we muſt ſee theſe benefits and their ſpeciall proportion, which is to be ſeen in this, that as in waſhing, the water doeth cover the filth, doth ſoke it vp, and leaue all cleane, pure, &amp; vnſpotted: ſo the merit of the death of chriſt who ſatisfied the wrath of God for our ſins, by giuing himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, doth not only cover (as the Prophete ſaith) our ſinnes, &amp; hide them from God, but ſo drinke vp the guiltines of the ſame, that God imputeth no ſin, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2076:81"/>
to the ſaying of the Pſal. <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whoſe wickednes is forgiuen, &amp; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God imputeth no ſin.</hi> Neither onlie is he made ſin for vs; that is, by imputation of ſin to him, but alſo an offring on the croſſe for ſin, and this is, that wee might haue the righteouſneſſe of God in him. That when as no fleſh can be juſtified in the ſight of God, wee might obtaine the righteouſnes of faith, which is free without al reſpect of works, even the righteouſnes of God, which he doeth giue vs, inherent not in vs, but in Chriſt, that in him we may be holy and without blame: here therefore, by faith commeth juſtification, from whence peace of conſcience, ſtanding in the grace of God, deliverance from the wrath to come, and full certainty of eternal life procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. And this (as it carieth full proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the waſhing and order of it, ſo it is ſaid to ſeale vp the full remiſsion of our ſinnes. <hi>Bee baptized</hi> (ſaith Peter) <hi>into the name of Ieſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> Act. 38. Act. 10.43.48. So ſaith A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias: Be baptized and waſh away thy ſinnes, in calling on the name of the Lorde Ieſus. Act. 22.16. Which alſo is contained vnder the other point; ſeeing the forgiuenes of ſins was to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for it ſealeth vnto vs the forgiuenes of all treſpaſſes, originall and other, and hath put away the hand writing againſt vs. The other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo concerning ſanctification, is vrged in many places of Paule, but proſecuted eſpecially in Rom. 6.2. where we are ſaid <hi>to be baptized to the <pb n="154" facs="tcp:2076:82"/>
ſimilitude of Chriſtes death,</hi> being drowned, as it wer, vnder the water, our ſin being made clean by Chriſts death. And we are baptiſed to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of his buriall, as lying rotting in the water, in the tarying of the water, till it dooth ſoke vp the filth and carie it with it. So that we haue not onely the power of Chriſt his death to kill ſinne, but to burie it, and more &amp; more to rot it: and not onely that, but as he died for our ſinne, and roſe for our juſtification, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this, that all ſinne was anſwered for vs, ſeeing he roſe againe: ſo likewiſe we doe by his reſurrection riſe to righteouſnes &amp; holines of life, which is alſo ſignified by the waſhing, which doth leaue vs cleane and white. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true indeed, that this holines can never be perfect, &amp; in that ful meaſure it ought to be, in this life, according to the Law, &amp; that it be as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>as a filthy cloth, and the fleſh rebell againſt the ſpirite, and that in nothing wee can doe the good we would</hi>: ſo that if God enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgment with this holines of ours, we can neuer ſtande before him: yet this worthineſſe wanting in it ſelfe, is accepted of God through Ieſus Chriſt, 1. Pet. 2.5. ſo that being waſhed in his blood, we be Kings &amp; Prieſts vnto God, and our works are acceptable: and this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſealed vp in this Sacrament, as is plain, Rom. 6.5.7.8. And ſo we ſee that in this Sacrament we are ſet into the bodie of Chriſt, into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of God and his Church, and in all the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2076:82"/>
priuiledges of the ſame, and that here is ſtrong comfort againſt all temptations, our ſinnes be forgiuen for ever, Gods wrath appeaſed, &amp; we abſolved before Gods judgment ſeat: that wee haue here grace to forſake our ſinne, to die vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, and to burie it continuallie: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits when they are ſealed vp here to bee with vs forever, howe wicked is that diſtinction of the Papiſts, that baptiſme is for remiſsion of ſinnes, life, and ſanctification: but confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for corroboration and ſtrength to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſpiritual enemies: as though there were any ſanctification without ſtrength to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſpirituall enemies, and as though when we haue hence comfort againſt terrours and temptations, 1. Pet. 4. we are not ſtrengthened againſt them: when Paule ſheweth, that by the power of Chriſt ſealed vp in baptiſme, wee are made able to kil ſinne, to burie ſin, yea in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes to cleaue vnto God: Is it not moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable boldnes, to ſay, We haue ſtrength in ſanctification to fight againſt ſin, we kill it, yea burie it: yea riſe vp to all newneſſe of life? Doth not Saint Peter make it a peece of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when hee ſaith, Sanctifie the Lorde God in your harts, and be ready alwaies to giue an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you. 1. Pet. 3.15. And if this be a peece of ſanctification, how can they ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpirituall corroboration &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening? and can they denie this to bee ſealed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2076:83"/>
vp in baptiſme, where wee are conſecrated to confeſſe one God in three perſons, the religion and ſervice of the ſame God, and to haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe for ever with him? Let vs caſt away therefore theſe fantaſies, and let vs know, that we are by faith in Chriſt, for ever put into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of all his merits and benefits, which is ſealed vp in baptiſme, &amp; alſo we ſhall ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be nouriſhed and kept by the ſame faith, &amp; that which is ſealed vp in the next Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
               <p>Thus much of Baptiſme: Nowe of the right vſe of the ſame, according as it is proper to it: in which, as ther is diverſitie in thoſe who muſt vſe it, ſo there is diverſitie of rules preſcribed vnto them, in the word of God. The perſons therfore are of 2. ſortes,

of all benefits with them: and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration S. Peter being asked, teacheth, Act. 2.38.39.40. and ſo the nature of this Sacrament requireth. In the work it ſelfe, they are by faith liuely to behold, and applie in the outwarde &amp; inward relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of waſhing, Chriſt given to waſh them in their new byrth for euer, vnto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſanctification, as is commanded to Paule, Act. 22.16. In the vſe they are alwaies afterward to be ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthened, that they are one with God for ever, that in their temptations they ſhall not fall away: that they ſhall ſtand, that their ſeruice to God is acceptable, &amp;c. and this Paule vrgeth to the baptized, Rom. 6.2.3. &amp;c. and 2.2.11.12.13.14. This therefore muſt alwaies be before vs to comfort vs.</p>
               <p>The Parents of the infants before they bring their children to be baptized, muſt cal to mind the mercifull covenant of God towardes them and their ſeed, &amp; by their experience they muſt aſſure themſelues of their child: and they muſt alſo remember the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, who (they having brought their children in his covenant &amp; holie ſeed by grace) wil haue it alſo ſealed vp in their fleſh: for which cauſe they muſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly deſire it, &amp; with al ſpeed that may ſtand with order and publike aſſemblie of the Church to haſten it, Gen. 17.10.11.12. And the wrath of God againſt Moſes for deferring it, doth ſhew this dutie. Exod. 4.24.25.26. In the worke it ſelfe, they are reverentlie to offer it to God his

Church and by his Miniſter, with the publike praiers of Gods church receiue that ſeal in the fleſh of their child, as is preſcribed, and in the mother tongue giue ſuch a name as may ſtand with the reverent worke of baptiſme, and the ſolemne inuecting of the child into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Church. Luk. 1.59.60.61. &amp;c. After, they are to apply this worke vnto themſelues, to make them diligent in catechiſing and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing vp their children in diſcipline fit for children, and admonition of the Lord, becauſe they haue once receiued that ſeale, which doth ſeale vp that God will circumciſe the hearts of their children as well as theirs, Gen. 17.13. Deut. 30. The whole bodie of the Churche ought with knowledge of Gods couenant, and joy of a member to be added to the Church, addreſſe themſelues to this worke, Luke. 1.59 In the worke it ſelfe, they muſt with attention to the worke, joyning alſo earneſtlie in praier, receiue aſſurance of a fellow member, ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him with one conſent and heart, in which reſpect they were ſaid to circumciſe, and may be now to baptize.

               <p>The Supper of the Lorde is a Sacrament of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, wherein by the Miniſters bleſſing, breaking, and deliuering of breade, with ſaying, this is the body of Chriſt, &amp;c. by his bleſſing &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering a cup of wine, ſaying: This is the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in Chriſtes blood, vnto the members of the Church, which are able to examine themſelues, by their receiuing, eating and drinking of the ſame: is liuelie repreſented and offred to all, but truely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the receiuer with faith, the giuing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by faith the verie bodie and blood of Chriſt crucified, &amp; ſo who!

               <head>THE FVRTHER CONFIRMATION AND opening of this Declaration.</head>
               <p>HEre we ſee, firſt the outward work is to be conſidered, then the inward. The outward work in his parts, firſt of the bread, then of the cup. Yet this is generall to both, that they are bleſſed; that is, expounding the inſtitution of God, and the vſe of the ſame: by prayer and thankſgiving are put apart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their common vſes, to that which is holy by Gods ordinance, receiue a propertie they had not afore, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our ſoules, as is at large declared aboue. Now that this is ſet downe in the firſt place, it is the order that Chriſt hath obſerved, and wee are to follow, &amp; that which is fit for the workes following. For when as the breaking, powring forth, giving, &amp;c. of the bread and wine are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal works, that is, ſuch parts of this work as haue relation with the inward, do offer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, and ſeale vp, it may not bee that theſe or any of them ſhould be firſt done, &amp; then this working of bleſsing come after, becauſe they haue their forme and force to be ſacramentall works fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence. In the firſt part, the breaking of the bread commeth to be conſidered, which is ſo plainlie ſet forth as a worke, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the tormentes of Chriſt on the croſſe for vs: for, in that bread is broken, that it may be eaten, it doth liuely ſet before vs, that Chriſt was tormented for vs and for our nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and as the Apoſtle ſaith from Chriſt, <hi>my bodie,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:2076:86"/>
which was broken for you; although it be true, that not a bone of Chriſt was broken: and ſo breaking is not here taken properlie, but by a ſimilitude, for weeping, tormenting, &amp;c. as he was pierced, crucified, and on the croſſe made a curſe for vs, and as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Hee was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, hee was broken for our infirmities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was vppon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Eſay. 57.5. So then this is to be done plainelie in the ſight of all, and all ought to giue diligent heede and waighty conſideration of theſe things with vs.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Giuing of bread</hi>] This is gathered, becauſe hee ſaith, <hi>take, eate, &amp;c.</hi> And it is plainly expreſſed of 3. Evangeliſts, as that which may not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe being the Miniſters worke to vs, it doth repreſent the perſon of God in 3. perſons, giuing chriſt his body &amp; blood to noriſh vs. For they are the diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſers of Gods myſteries, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto vs the ſpiritual nouriſhment in theſe things [<hi>Saying</hi>] This is added alſo plainly, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt, who willed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do this, the Miniſters that which Chriſt did, the people that which the Diſciples did: &amp; S. Paule ſheweth that which Chriſt did, is to be done of the church in this heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet, the miniſters doing that which appertaineth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the people that which belongeth to them, &amp; this is neceſſary; for it is not meet for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in delivering to be dumbe, but he ſheweth vs our duty; &amp; he ſheweth what is offred &amp; give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:2076:86"/>
by the outward ſigns, &amp; what we are to receiue by faith, as well as bodilie. Now although the words here in Paul &amp; ſome other Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts do differ, yet this ſence commeth to one, and the holie Ghoſt doth giue vs liberty to take which we will for edification, &amp; to ſhew that the force lieth not in the wordes, but in the matter ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them: and yet therewithall, to giue vs a certaine rule which we might follow. Onelie this is to noted in all that, which our Saviour Chriſt Ieſus preſcribeth, that the words be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken generallie to all, and not ſpeciallie to one: both becauſe that is the fitteſt to note out the fellowſhip and communion of the Church in this work, the perſon of Chriſt by the Miniſter, bidding all his gueſts with one loue, as from him to be merie, and eate with faith one ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meat together, which alſo doeth plainlie confute the Papiſts privat communions of the Prieſt and his boy: which as it hath bin confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted generallie, ſo here it ſheweth that they goe directlie contrarie to Chriſts inſtitution, &amp; the Apoſtles practiſe, who wold haue it a banquet for all that were fit to receiue. Neither is there profite in this order of Chriſt in this reſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: but herein our faith is further ſuccoured, when we may together, and with one heart ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie our ſelues to the meditation and fruit of this ſpeach of Chriſt by the Miniſter, which in the particular ſpeaking doth both loſe that our working together, and maketh the minds of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2076:87"/>
Chriſtians hang the longer in the waiting for this ſentence, and the comfort of it, and their minds are offred vnto greater occaſion of ſlips and withdrawings by humain infirmitie, when theſe things are prolonged, which may more effectuallie be done together &amp; ſpeedily: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this alſo is to bee kept, and wee to vſe it for our comfort, for although this be not that, which if it bee done otherwiſe than it ought, doeth take away the vertue of the Sacrament, neither is anie to abſtaine from it, becauſe it is a blemiſh, not a plaine deforming and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worke, yet it is to bee kept from the former occaſion. The meaning of the other words, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> ſhal vpon more fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be farther opened afterwarde. In the Cup the ſame order is to be obſerved, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the outward worke in giving, &amp;c. as in the bread, according as S. Paul doth expreſſe he did likewiſe in the cup: onely here is to bee conſidered, that ſame analogie which the work hath in both theſe partes, that bread is giuen apart, &amp; the wine apart: which, as it doth ſhew a ful nouriſhment, a feaſt which is neither meat alone, nor drink alone, ſo hath it an excellent analogie with Chriſt crucified, whome wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue as one that hath bene ſlaine for vs, whoſe fleſh we haue for meat indeed, &amp; his blood for drink indeed, that we might haue full &amp; pefect nouriſhment in him, as our Saviour Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth. Iohn. 6.54.55. &amp;c. which both are
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2076:87"/>
liuelie repreſentation and ſealing vppe, not of Chriſt alone, but Chriſt crucified and giuen vp to be a ful and perfect nouriſhment, even meat and drinke vnto vs. This the Papiſts deſtroy &amp; cleane take away from the people, to maintain their tranſubſtantiation, &amp; they teach, that the bread being turned into the bodie, hath blood in it, and as well might they make another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to giue the cup alone, wherein alſo is the bodie: for in Chriſt, the one is no more the blood with the bodie, than the bodie with the blood. They alleadg indeed, that it is ſaid, Act. 2 <hi>&amp; they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in breaking of bread.</hi> &amp; Act. 20. <hi>They came together to break bread</hi>: Whereby they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was miniſtred vnder one kinde. But this is groſſe blindnes of theirs, that they cannot ſee, that as in the Hebrew phraſe, to eat breade by a part for the whole, is to receiue whole no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: ſo in this manner of ſpeach is noted the whole Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as on the other ſide, in the former place of the Corinths, that to be made to drinke into one ſpiritual drinke, doeth note out the whole Supper: and none ever imagined yet, that the cup might bee adminiſtred alone: And why may they not imagine as well, that they bleſſed not the bread as the cup. 1. Cor. 10 26. becauſe Paule ſaith, <hi>The bread which we break</hi> and nameth not bleſsing? This is therfore but a wicked ſhift, to diſplace the plaine ordinance of Chriſt, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> verſ. 25. They doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the cuſtom of the Church
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2076:88"/>
when as they receiued from the Apoſtles, that Chriſt did ſo, ſo they practiſed it, as is plaine by this chapt. 25.26. And againe, they deſtroy the doctrine of S. Paule concerning the one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall vſe of the Sacrament, which is, to ſhewe forth the death of Chriſt, which is liuelie done, when both are delivered, the one for fleſh, the other for blood, but not otherwiſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>As often as yee eat this breade, and drinke this cup, you ſhew forth the Lords death till hee come.</hi> Alſo they doe therby deſtroy the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all nouriſhment, mentioned before. Let vs therefore hold faſt and rejoice in the perfect and moſt full ordinance of Chriſt, and let vs not forgoe the comfort we haue in this point. There followeth, that this muſt be deliuered, &amp; this is ſpoken to thoſe which are able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues, which thing is proper &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to this Sacrament: and that which Paule vrgeth after in this place, approueth the ſame: <hi>A man muſt examine himſelf, and ſo come to this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c.</hi> And in the Paſſeover their children were not admitted, but ſuch as could inquire and be inſtructed of their fathers, that the ſame might be a frontlet before their eies, and a ſigne vpon their handes, that the doctrine of God might be in their mouthes. Exod. 13.8.9.10. &amp; 12.26 27. Indeede if we marke and way the matter well, the difference of the outward worke here, from that in baptiſme, doth by proportion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this: For although thoſe that are of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2076:88"/>
and are to be baptized, muſt make pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſsion of their faith and repentance, becauſe otherwiſe we cannot know they are within the covenant of God, and it is meet that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcretion to vſe the ſeale of God aright, ſhould ſhew they are ſo prepared to doe it, yet for all that wee ſee, the verie waſhing of water doeth not require diſcretion in him who is to be waſhed, becauſe we can waſh and cleanſe wel thoſe things, which haue not onely no vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but not anie ſence. But where there is required a reverent giuing, hearing of that which is ſpoken, and vnderſtanding, a reverent receiving and eating, that wee ſo cannot be in the outward worke, even with one diſcretion, to conſider of whome to take, to vnderſtande what is ſaid, &amp; what to be done, which diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if God will haue in the outward work, what doth he thereby but plainly declare, that there is required vnderſtanding of what Gods ſpirit doth ſpeak, who giveth the true bodie of Chriſt what we ſhal receiue by faith, what it is to eate it ſpirituallie, and be nouriſhed by it.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore hold alſo this faſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none preſume to come hither, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſlie examining himſelfe. Let not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours preſume to prophane the holie thinges of God, by admitting anie, they havuing not prepared and tried. Zopho. 3.4. 2. Chron. 35.6. The outward worke of the Miniſter wee haue ſeene: there followeth the outward workes of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2076:89"/>
the Church, which are beſides the hearing and beholding of the former, as hath bene noted: the eſpeciall receiuing, eating, and drinking, &amp; theſe are commanded of Chriſt, haue bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies perfourmed of the Church, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might bee partakers of the Table of the Lord. 1. Cor. 9. and all might eate as the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did, one ſpirituall meat and drinke in this Sacrament: wherein is confuted the madneſſe of the Papiſtes, who doe ſhut out manie of the people from this work, and therefore deſtroy the Sacrament, which without this is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, do take away the forme of it, and vſe for comfort, which is that they might eat, drinke, receiue, &amp;c. according as they are conſecrated, broken, and deliuered to this end, as wee haue ſeene before. They, I ſay, wickedly take away this, bid them fall downe, worſhip it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it the verie ſacrificing of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: non of al which, they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of Chriſt, and therfore ſhould not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it in his name, but the cleane contrarie, for to eate, and worſhip with not teaching are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, &amp; to offer to another as a ſacrifice, which muſt be geuen to vs to eat: for when they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to offer, they doe cleane contrarie. Thus the ſpirite of Babel hath confuted all, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned light into darknes. But let vs remember theſe actions are of the ſubſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, commanded of Chriſt preciſelie, and for the which al the other actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are, as appeareth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2076:89"/>
plainelie by the inſtitution of Chriſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not bee omitted, vnleſſe we will loſe the whole comfort of the ſame. The worke of receiving, hath his proportion with the true receiuing of Chriſtes bodie &amp; blood crucified, which is done by faith: for as he dwelleth in vs onelie, and is vnited to vs onlie by faith, Ephe. 4.37. Galat. 3.25. ſo the receiuing which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and hath proportion with the outward, muſt be by theſe means alone. And ſo is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking, nothing but that worke of faith, whereby Chriſt is ſo applied, as wee feele our ſelues to drawe one ſpirituall nouriſhment by faith from him, as ſhall be after declared. So then we doe ſee, howe excellent this outwarde worke is, if we conſider aright the partes of the ſame, and the proportion they haue with this inward, whereunto now let vs come, and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie touch the ſame.</p>
               <p>The worke which is here repreſented and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to all, and ſealed vp to the faithful, is, God giving in Chriſt, and our receiving of the body and blood of Chriſt crucified, and ſo of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. When we ſay, that Chriſt his bodie and blood is not onlie offred and giuen, but of the faithful receiuers therof is ſealed vp, therby we ſaid, that we acknowledged and helde Chriſt to be preſent in deed, even as in baptiſme; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his body and blood, becauſe it is received and is our meat indeed, as we ſhal ſee afterward But we doe not holde that he is bodily preſent
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2076:90"/>
in and with the bread, or that the bread is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his bodie: for as we haue grounde of the former, becauſe Paule ſaith, <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Chriſt? The cup that we bleſſe, is it not the cummunion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> That is, an inſtrument whereby truely is communicated, by the working of the holie Ghoſt to our faith, the very bodie and blood of Chriſt: ſo the wordes, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> that is, an inſtrument which offereth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth to all, one bodie, and ſealeth vp the true receiving of his verie bodie and blood, as ſhall be prooved by and by in the confuting of the adverſaries the Papiſts, which holde, that the breade is turned into the body of Chriſt, becauſe <hi>(this is my body)</hi> muſt be properlie take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The <hi>Lutherians</hi> ſay alſo, that the bodie is bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and locallie with, or in, or vnder the bread, becauſe this word (<hi>is</hi>) muſt be taken properlie. Now their reaſon why it muſt be taken proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, is, becauſe in the Sacramentes the ſpeach muſt be proper &amp; fit: which is a falſ &amp; vain opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what ſpech is more fit &amp; effectual, wher the bodily things are inſtruments of ſpirituall &amp; heavenlie things (ſignes are to deliuer more effectuall thinges ſignified) then theſe figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, which haue more grace and effectualnes in them. And when one receiueth libertie and ſeaſon of lande, or an houſe, or a citie by a ſign, who doeth not knowe this ſpeach is more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, I giue this my land, this key of my houſe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2076:90"/>
then if he had ſaid, this is a ſign or token of my land, and my houſe deliuered. And they are confuted by the Scriptures, which doth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Sacramentes, choſe to vſe this ſpeech, My couenant ſhall be in your fleſh, ſpeaking of Circumciſion, which yet is but a ſigne, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his couenant, as hee interpreteth there. Gen. 13.11.13. When they are ſaide to kill the Paſſeouer, that is, the Lamb, which was a ſigne, ſeale, and remembrance of the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Exod. 13.21.11.13. &amp;c. So the Arke is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called the Lorde: So the Altar of Moſes, Exod. 17.15. So the ſonne of Iaakob Bethel, Gen. 28.22. And to goe no further, this place of the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>This is the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in my blood,</hi> wil they haue it here proper, and not as we interprete it? Will the Papiſt ſay, Wine is tranſubſtantiated into the covenant of God? which is not a ſubſtance, but a trueth of promiſe onelie? And ſhal we haue two tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiations, one into blood, another into the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? The <hi>Lutherians</hi> likewiſe, wil they haue the covenant to be there bodilie remaining, as remaining locallie, which cannot be in a place? ſo then, here the foundation is cleane ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. And yet they ſtand not to their rule: for let them tell vs, is this a proper ſpeach, <hi>this bread is my bodie,</hi> that is, hath with it, or vnder it, or in it, or in it my body? Do they not finde vs out a ſtrange and newe ſignification of this word; That it hath in it, with it, or vnder it,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2076:91"/>
which was neuer heard of before? And as for the Papiſts, we ſay alſo, howe can they ſay, this is a proper ſpeach, breade is my bodie, that is, breade is tranſubſtantiated into my body? that the proper ſignification of it is, that is, tranſubſtantiated? If they ſay, the bread is not vnderſtood in this word <hi>this,</hi> but the bodie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make Chriſt to ſay, This body is my body, which beſides the vnfitnes, it hath with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, what ſhal become of the expreſſe text for tranſubſtantiation, for here is no worde where it is expreſlie ſaid, The bread is tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into my bodie: ſo that they muſt be driven to their woodden collections, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and proper words, which they cleaue ſo much to.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this point is a ground for many arguments, let vs make the trueth of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant: Firſt, we ſee the plaine following of the text in ſpeach and reaſon, doth plainely ſhewe, that this word <hi>this,</hi> is referred to the bread, for when he ſaith, <hi>He tooke bread, he brake it, and gaue it to them,</hi> we aske, whether he gaue not bread, and that it be here to be vnderſtood? If not, he gaue not that he brake, and he brake in vaine.</p>
               <p>Again, when there is a plaine word <hi>bread</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, which is neceſſarilie to be referred to breake and giue out, howe can they referre <hi>this,</hi> to that went not afore, and leaue out that which did?</p>
               <p>2. This word <hi>eating,</hi> which noteth the worke
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2076:91"/>
of the mouth, in grinding and preparing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, howe can it bee referred, except they change the proper ſignification to another then bread?</p>
               <p>3 When as in the ſecond part, this is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to blood, but to the Cup which he took and bleſſed, plain by S. Luke and Paule. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew how it can be otherwiſe in the bread? If they ſay, the Cup is put for that in it, which is blood; that is to beg the queſtion: and when as the adjoints of colour, taſte, ſtrength is there, as in a Subject, will they ſay, that alſo is turned into the blood of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>4 When Paul calleth it bread, after it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſaying: <hi>He that eateth this bread; and drinketh this cup</hi>: Is it not here plaine, that this is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bread? I know their ſlip, that he called it bread by a figuratiue ſpeech, for ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as in Iohn 6. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the bread which came down from heauen, &amp;c.</hi> To this I anſwer They are blinde if they can make no diuerſitie betwixt that ſpeech which is in Iohn, wher the circumſtance is of Chriſt, when hee ſaith, <hi>I am the bread of life,</hi> and then that hee ſaith not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply bread, but <hi>bread of life, the bread which came downe from heaven, &amp;c.</hi> and betweene this of S. Paule, who hauing made mention of breade, bleſſed, &amp; conſecrated, ſaith, <hi>Hee that eateth this bread,</hi> ſimplie, that is, this bread ſo bleſſed, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp;c. Secondly we ſay, when he ſaith, <hi>He that eateth,</hi> ſeeing hee joyneth the proper ſubjecte
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2076:92"/>
                  <hi>bread,</hi> to eating, the proper worke of it, and the bodie of Chriſt cannot be properlie eaten, as is ſhewed before. It remaineth that we muſt cal it properlie bread, and ſo chap. 10. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the bodie of Chriſt?</hi> Where note, that bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſecration, cannot be the communion of the body of Chriſt by your owne judgment. Secondly, that metaphoricall bread cannot be broken, Chriſts bodie cannot be broken: there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore verie breade muſt here bee vnderſtoode. Wherfore we conclude, that bread remaineth, &amp; this word, <hi>this,</hi> muſt be referred to the bread and therefore they cannot ſtand to proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of words, they (I ſay) who vrge it ſo much. Now we wil come to the reaſons which proue, that theſe words (<hi>this is my body</hi>) muſt be figuratiuely take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in that inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; figure, which we haue ſhewed to be proper: neither yet will wee (for ſhortnes ſake) bring al the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that might be brought, but theſe which are plainly gathered out of the text</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is ſaid to giue that which he ſaith was his body: now if <hi>this is my body,</hi> be properly vnderſtoode, Chriſt had one body which gaue, &amp; another which was giuen. But that is abſurd therfore it muſt not properly be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>2 If the ſpeech be proper, they are not diuers things, as bread may be ſaid properlie of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as of a bodie: but that cannot be, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 If that be properly vnderſtood, then Chriſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2076:92"/>
may be ſaid to be bread, as wel as bread chriſt, but that is falſe, <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 If that be proper, then that which is true of bread, that it is of wheat, is true of Chriſt: and that which is true of chriſt, muſt alſo be true of the bread; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo the bread ſhal be vnited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally vnto Chriſt as his bodie, which is falſ &amp; wicked, therfore it muſt not be ſo vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>5 If bread be the body, then ther are meant two ſubſtances; one for a ſign, the other for the ſpiritual matter, and the accidentes, as colour, taſte, &amp;c. muſt ſignifie and ſeale into the bodie of Chriſt, which is falſe.</p>
               <p>6 If bread indeed be turned into the body, &amp; wine into the blood; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be ſeperated tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or els the bread is blood, &amp; the wine is his body, which is falſe: if they be ſeperated truly, then it was not ſeperated truly in his death vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe, which is falſe: if Sacramentallie, then it is his body &amp; blood only ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally, that which doeth aptly ſeale vp the bodie and blood of Chriſt, which is that we holde.</p>
               <p>7 If the bread be his bodie in deed, and the wine his blood in deed, then Chriſt every time the ſupper is adminiſtred, being aliue in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trulie, is dead in earth trulie &amp; bodily indeed, which is blaſphemous: therfore it muſt not be vnderſtood properlie.</p>
               <p>8 If bread be turned into his bodie indeed, or his body indeed be locally with it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chriſt his body, which alwais hath his parts, is viſible,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2076:93"/>
&amp;c. hath a hand, a foot, &amp;c. differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelf, it ſhall the ſame time be inviſible, yea no hand, differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foot, &amp;c. and ther ſhalbe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his bodies viſible, &amp; his bodies not viſible &amp; ſo the truth ſhal ly; al which is abhominable.</p>
               <p>9 It is ſaid, the bread broken, is his body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the powring out of his blood, which is a ſigne, ſeale, &amp;c. of it, ſo muſt the bread &amp; wine be his body &amp; his blood, as it repreſenteth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>10 If the wine bee his blood indeede, then blood is ſtil poured out, which is falſe.</p>
               <p>11 As the wine or cup, is the new Teſtament, in his blood, ſo the bread is his bodie, and the wine is blood, but that is a Sacrament, which repreſenteth and ſealeth the new Teſtament in his blood: Ergo, it is not proper.</p>
               <p>12 Here is a plain difference betwixt that in the cup, which is ſaid to be the new Teſtament, and betweene that wherein the Teſtament is, that is, his blood: for theſe are diſtinguiſhed, therefore it is not properlie ſaid his blood.</p>
               <p>13 He ſaith, Do this in remembrance of me, therefore he is not here eaten.</p>
               <p>14 We are ſaid to ſhew forth his death til he come, therefore bodily he is not come, nor is not there, nor cannot be properly ſaid, to be ſo only, by theſe manifeſt and plain reaſons out of the text, agreeing with the proportion of faith we haue prooved our judgment.</p>
               <p>Now then hauing ſhewed how Ieſus Chriſt his fleſh &amp; blood is here indeed, not bodily, how it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2076:93"/>
is receiued in deed, not bodily but ſpiritually by fleſh: we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of that we ſay, that we receiue his fleſh &amp; blood; yea, &amp; ſo whol Chriſt, which is indeed true, &amp; muſt neceſſarily be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as a ground &amp; foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our whol comfort here, &amp; indeed it cannot be otherwiſe; for if we receiue him fleſh and blood, wee muſt thereby needs receiue him God &amp; man, which is not ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; whole Chriſt doth dwel in vs, Ep. 3. neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fleſh of it ſelf ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify, fructifie, quicken, &amp;c. For theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more excellent than the firſt creation, are proper to the Godhed. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt doth only quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by his fleſh &amp; blood, as by a meane or matter, wherby he doth convey the vertue and power of his Godhead, in his ſacrifice and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, wherby he overcame death &amp; all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities &amp; powers, in his reſurrection, by which he roſe againe: ſo that wee muſt become one with Chriſt, &amp; he muſt be in vs, &amp; we in him, &amp; he dwel in vs: &amp; we in him, which is by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; power of his divine working, &amp; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vniting of his natural humanity to vs, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be knit. Therfore in Iohn 7. he ſaith, That not only his fleſh, but he was the breade of life. ver. 35. Wee muſt come to him, beleeue in him, that we may never hunger nor thirſt, &amp; 46.47.48. &amp;c. Then this foundation of ſtrong co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; conſolation being laid, let vs conſider the ends and fruites of the receiuing of Chriſt. Firſt, to Gods glorie, then our good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:2076:94"/>For Gods glorie, that this heavenly &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worke of the poſſeſsion of Chriſt, decreed &amp; brought to paſſe by one God in 3. perſons, might be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, according as it is ſaid, Do this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of me. And again, You ſhall ſhew forth the Lords death til he come, &amp; that to the glory of Gods wiſdom, power, mercy, &amp;c which in the ſame may alwaies be remembred, praiſed glorified, &amp;c. Which is with vnfeigned thankſgiving and praying to God, as wee haue ſeene the Evangeliſtes mention of our Saviour Chriſt, &amp; when God doth liberally preſerue &amp; defend vs, &amp;c. How can we be vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful, even at this preſent for his merits? The other end is, that we apply him to ſpiritual, mutuall, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual nouriſhment, &amp; growing in grace with the whole Church. For this is indeed that ſame which giveth a moſt liuely difference betweene baptiſme &amp; the Lords Supper. For in baptiſme we are ſet into the body of chriſt, &amp; are waſhed with the waſhing of our newe birth in him, and haue an aſſurance of al priviledges, are ſet into the right title of poſſeſsion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the reſt of the Church. But here Chriſt is ſo applied &amp; his benefits, as we doe grow, increaſe, and waxe ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, more &amp; more in the forgiuenes of al our ſins, as aſſured more &amp; more, we feel the righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouſnes of Chriſt ours, our conſciences more &amp; more appeaſed; our peace greater, alſo our kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; burying of ſin, our quickening &amp; refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in obedience greater, &amp; that not only in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2076:94"/>
our ſelues, but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion &amp; fellowſhip with the whole Church. Therefore Paule ſaith, As in Baptiſme we haue bin ſet into one body, ſo we haue bin made to drink into one ſpirit; that is, ſpiritual noriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. So he ſaith, We haue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Chriſt, &amp; of his blood; we are at his table, &amp; are fed together: we come one body togither, ſo many as ar par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of one bread. 1. Cor. 10.4.17. We come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in vnity of faith, joy, of obedience, as the houſhold ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of one maiſter, &amp; Citizens of one God &amp; Lord. So we daily increaſe &amp; growe againſt al our te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations &amp; daily wants. Where we ſee again the wickednes of the Papiſts, who as before, by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation they derogated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiſme, ſo hence more fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſeeing as ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth is there giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, nouriſhed, &amp; increaſed, as ſpiritually we grow fat &amp; in good liking. Therefore Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that this makes vs caſt away al ſhew of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, overcome all temptations, ſerue God ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, 1. Cor. 10.13. &amp;c. And this is that which anſwereth to the eating of the bread and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the wine, which is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiuing; for it is not only to take it into one, but being received, ſo to apply it, as it be digeſted &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into good noriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the body. So I do not here only receiue Chriſt by faith, but ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him &amp; his merits received by my faith, as I feel my ſelf to grow with the Church in all the former benefits vnto the aſſurance of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality

                  <head>4 What things are vnlawfull to be vſed in recreation.</head>
                  <p>BEcauſe recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be in indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things, neither ſimply commanded nor forbidden, therefore things ſanctified to ſome eſpeciall &amp; holy vſe, muſt not be made a recreation: as we muſt not pray, vſe the word, or ſuch like, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, but for neceſſarie dutie, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which God hath preſcribed. Vpon this it commeth, that I think with diuers godlie and learned men, that the vſe of a Lot for recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is vnlawful, becauſe a Lot is an eſpecial meane,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2076:99"/>
wherby God hath ordained by himſelfe from heaven, to end ſuch controverſies, as otherwiſe cannot conveniently be ended, as Pro. 16.23. <hi>The Lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſition of it, is of the Lord.</hi> So the nature of a Lot lyeth wholy in this, that although the thing be of vs, yet the diſpoſition is wholly of God, that is, hee vſeth not here our meanes of cunning, practiſe, ſtrength, ſtedines of hand, or ſuch like; but taketh it wholly to himſelf. And this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nature of the Lot: ſo Prov. 18.18. The holy Ghoſt ſheweth the onelie lawful vſe of it: ſaying, <hi>The Lot remooveth contentions, and maketh partitions amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the mightie.</hi> So ſhewing the only lawfull vſe of it, is to end controverſies, which otherwiſe cannot convenientlie be ended, for each contender without the Lot, is too migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to yeeld.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe as it is meant of an oath, Heb, 6 16. when he ſaith, for men verily ſweare by him that is greater than themſelues, &amp; an oath for confirmation, is amongſt them an ende of all ſtrife, that he wold by theſe words, not ſo much teach vs that men vſe an oath to ende contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies (which everie one knoweth) but that God hath dedicated, &amp; made an oath holie &amp; ſure, only for that vſe of neceſſarie deciding of doubts of importance amongſt men: ſo in the like words in this place of the Proverbes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Lot, muſt be vnderſtoode in the ſame ſence, not ſo much to teach vs, that a Lot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2076:100"/>
ſuch controverſies amongſt men (which all knowe) but that God hath ordained it only for that vſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, wee ſee that the Scripture maketh a Lot, ſo the ſentence of God, as in the moſt waightie matters of God and man, of life and death, it is the verie. Oracle and declaration of God his will, wherein man muſt reſt without any contradiction or motion to the contrarie. So Act. 1.24.26. Numb. 26.55. Levit. 16.8. for matters of God. So Ioſua 14. for the matters of life: yea, the Gentiles themſelues knew it to be the verie Oracle of God. Ionas. 1.7. Nowe ſuch Oracles of God, muſt not be vſed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation: ſeeing they are his name, and muſt not be vainelie vſed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, all Lottes vſed in recreation, doe either neceſſarilie drawe or tempt the verie beſt, to horrible prophaning of Gods name, as to thinke or ſay, What lucke is this! how croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? Which in plaine wordes, (vnleſſe wee will brutiſhly giue God his glorie vnto Fortune) is, What a God? what perverſe &amp; crooked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is this? Neither is the caſe here as in other paſtimes, where our owne infirmity or want of skill may be blamed for all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, becauſe in a Lot nothing can be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but Gods immediate direction. From all this I gather, that Dice, dealing of Cardes, or ſuch like, where the matter is laide on hazard (as they call it) or rather God his prouidence,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2076:100"/>
without vſing any cunning of ours to diſpoſe it, is vpon the ſame reaſon of a lot vnlawfull. Neither is it any reaſon to ſay, Wee vſe it not now, to end controverſies, or to ſo a waighty vſe, but only for an honeſt recreation: for the end for which wee vſe it, is not of the nature of the lotte, but onelie of the vſe or abuſe of it. For when the Iewes caſt lottes for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt his garmentes, it was ſtill in the nature of a Lotte, though the good end of a Lotte was laide aſide. And ſeeing in al theſe, the whole diſpoſition of it to trie the matter (which is, what caſt wee ſhall haue, or what cardes we ſhall haue towardes a good game) is whollie in the Lorde, and not in anie cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (vnleſſe we cogge, cheate, and play falſe play, which thing the verie Roiſters condemn) it is manifeſt, that it remaineth in the nature of a lot, to what end ſoeuer we vſe it. It is manifeſt (I ſay) not by my collection, but by the expreſſe declarion of Salomon: yea by the common graunt of all, who ſay in the lighteſt matters, Let vs put it to lot, chance hazard. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtlie, my hartie deſire is in the Lord, that if theſe reaſons cannot perſwade my good bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren, to thinke this vnlawfull, (which in my judgement is evidentlie prooued to be ſo) that they woulde (as I hope thay will) be perſwaded vpon the reaſons of the holy Ghoſt following, to abſtaine from that which although it were lawfull, yet they may exchange with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2076:101"/>
recreations, as pleſant &amp; of greater praiſe, as Cheſſe, Muſick, &amp;c. Firſt, becauſe we ſhall by it offend the church of God, which the Apoſtle expreſly forbiddeth to bee done in ane indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent matter. 1. Cor. 10. For the church of God, for the moſt part, both long ago and in theſe dayes, hath left it vpon theſe reaſons: and wee cannot be ignorant, that many godly perſons with greife will marueill to heare it vſed of vs. For maintenance of this reaſon, the Apoſtle ſaith in the 14. vnto the Romanes: <hi>If thy Brother be grieued for thy meate, thou walkeſt not according to Charitie.</hi> Secondly, becauſe we ſhall contrarie to the like Commandement of the Apoſtle, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe which are without. 1. Cor. 10. when they hearing we profeſſe ſo much zeale in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, good order, and other ſuch like, they will ſay. Yet they vſe theſe vaine paſtimes, as well as others: yea when they may haue better. Of which the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly in the 14. chap to the Romanes, <hi>Why ſhould your good be blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>? that is, euill ſpoken of. Thirdly, becauſe they ſhall confirme others, whoe cannot but greatly abuſe it, when by vſing others in ſteede of it, they may draw them to a right and lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of recreation.</p>
