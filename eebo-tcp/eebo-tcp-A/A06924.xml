            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is then to be vnderſtood, that it is the office of the clerke of the Kitchin (whoſe place our <hi>Houſe-wife</hi> muſt many times ſupply) to order the meate at the Dreſſer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it vnto the Sewer, who is to deliuer it to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Yeomen-waiters to beare to the table.

diſhes and Quelquechoſes, which relie on the inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cooke, they are to bee thruſt in into euery place that is emptie, and ſo ſprinkled ouer all the table: and this is the beſt method for the extraordinary great feaſts of Princes. But in caſe it be for much more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes, then leſſe care and fewer diſhes may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it: yet before I proceede to that lower rate, you ſhall vnderſtand, that in theſe great Feaſts of Princes, though I haue mentioned nothing but fleſh, yet is not fifh to be exempted; for it is a beauty and an honour vnto euery Feaſt, and is to be placed amongſt all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ſeruices, as thus; as amongſt your Sallets all ſorts of ſouſed-fiſh that liues in the freſh water; amongſt your Fricaſes all manner of fride-fiſh; amongſt your boyld-meates, all fiſh in broaths; amongſt your roſt-meates, all fiſh ſerued hot, but drie; amongſt the bak't meates, and ſea-fiſh that is ſouſt, as Sturgion and the like; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your Carbonados, fiſh that is broild. As for your ſecond courſe, to it belongeth all manner of ſhell fiſh, either in the ſhell, or without; the hot to goe vp with the hot meate, and the cold with the cold.</p>
               <p>And thus ſhall the Feaſt bee royall, and the ſeruice worthy.</p>
               <p>Now for a more humble Feaſt, or an ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which any good man may keepe in his family for the entertainment of his true and worthy friends, it muſt hold limitation with his prouiſion, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the yeere: for Summer affords what Winter wantes, &amp; Winter is maſter of that which Summer can but with difficulty haue: it is good then for him that intends to feaſt, to ſet downe the full number of his full diſhes, that is, diſhes of meate that are of ſubſtance, and not emptie or for ſhew; and of theſe ſixteene is a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10363:80"/>
good proportion for one courſe vnto one meſſe, as thus for example, Firſt, a ſhield of Brawne with muſtard: Secondly, a boyld capon; Thirdly, a boyld peece of Beefe: Fourthly, a chine of beefe roſted: Fiftly, a neates tongue roſted: Sixtly, a Pigge roſted: Seuenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, chewets back't; Eightly, a gooſe roſted: Ninethly, a ſwan roſted: Tenthly, a turkey roſted; the eleuenth, a haunch of veniſon roſted; the twelfth, a paſty of veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the thirteenth, a Kid with a pudding in the belly; the fourteenth, an oliue pye; the fifteenth, a couple of capons; the ſixteenth, a cuſtard or douſets. Now to theſe full diſhes may be added in ſallets, fricaſes, quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quechoſes, and deuiſed paſte, as many diſhes more, which make the full ſeruice no leſſe then two and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſhes, which is as much as can conueniently ſtand on one table, and in one meſſe: and after this manner you may proportion both your ſecond and third courſe, holding fulneſſe in one halfe of the diſhes, and ſhew in the other, which will be both frugall in the ſpendor, contentment to the gueſt, and much pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the beholders.

decayeth the ſubſtance. Bricke, becauſe it is layde with Lime, is altogether vnwholeſome, for the Lime being apt at change of weather to ſweate, moyſteneth the graine, and ſo tainteth it, and in the drieſt ſeaſons with the ſharpe hot taſte, doth fully as much offend it: thoſe which are made of Stone are much more noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, both in reſpect of the reaſons before rehearſed, as alſo in that all Stone of it ſelfe will ſweate, and ſo more and more corrupteth the graine which is harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it. Lime and haire being of the ſame nature, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the ſame offences, and is in the like ſort to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.

               <p>After theſe Garners, Hutches, or large Keepes for Corne are perfitted and made, and fitly adioyned to the Kilne, the next thing that our Maultſter hath to looke vnto, is the framing of the Fatts or Ceſternes, in which the Corne is to be ſteeped, and they are of two ſorts, that is, either of Coopers worke, being great Fatts of wood, or elſe of Maſons worke, beeing Ceſternes made of ſtone; but the Ceſterne of ſtone is much the better, for beſides that theſe great Fatts of Wood are very chargeable and coſtly (as a Fatte to containe foure quarters of graine, which is but two and thirty buſhels, cannot be affoorded vnder twenty ſhillings) ſo likewiſe they are very caſuall and apt to miſchaunce and ſpilling; for and beſides their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wearing, if in the heate of Summer they be neuer

ſo little neglected without water, and ſuffered to be ouer-drye, it is tenne to one but in the Winter they will bee ready to fall in peeces; and if they bee kept moyſt, yet if the water bee not oft ſhifted and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſweete, the Fatte will ſoone taynt, and beeing once growne faultie, it is not onely irrecouerable, but alſo whatſoeuer commeth to be ſteeped in it after, will be ſure to haue the ſame ſauour, beſides the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and breaking of Garthes and Plugges, the binding, clenſing, ſweetning, and a whole world of other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and charges doe ſo dayly attend them, that the benefite is a great deale ſhort of the incumbrance; whereas the Stone Ceſterne is euer ready and vſefull, without any vexation at all, and being once well and ſufficiently made, will not neede trouble or repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (more then ordinary waſhing) ſcarce in a hundred yeares.</p>
               <p>Now the beſt way of making theſe Mault-ceſternes, is to make the bottomes and ſides of good tyle-ſhreads, fixed together with the beſt Lime and Sand, and the bottome ſhall bee raiſed at leaſt a foote and a halfe higher then the ground, and at one corner in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome a fine artificiall round hole muſt be made, which being outwardly ſtopt, the maltſter may through it drayne the Ceſterne drye when ſhee pleaſeth, and the bottome muſt bee ſo artificially leueld and contriued, that the water may haue a true deſcent to that hole, and not any remaine behind when it is opened.</p>
               <p>Now when the modell is thus made of tile-ſhread, which you may do great or little at your pleaſure, then with Lime, Haire, and Beaſts blood mixed together, you ſhall couer the bottome at leaſt two inches thicke, laying it leuell and plaine, as is before ſhewed: which

            <p>To ſpeake then firſt of the vertues of Oates, as they accrew to Cattell and creatures without doore, and firſt to begin with the Horſe, there is not any food what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer that is ſo good, wholeſome, and agreeable with the nature of a Horſe, as Oates are, being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uendar in which he taketh ſuch delight, that with it he

            <p>In the ſame nature that Oates are for Horſes, ſo are they for the Aſſe, Mule, Camell, or any other Beaſt of burthen.</p>
            <p>If you will feede either Oxe, Bull, Cow, or any Neate, whatſoeuer to an extraordinary height of fatneſſe, there is no foode doth it ſo ſoone as Oates doth, whether you giue them in the ſtraw, or cleane threſht from the ſheafe, and well winnowed; but the winnowed Oate

            <p>Sheepe or Goates may likewiſe be fed with Oates, to as great price and profit as with Peaſe, and Swine are fed with Oates, either in taw Malt, or otherwiſe, to as great thickneſſe as with any graine whatſoeuer; onely they muſt haue a few Peaſe after the Oates to harden the fat, or elſe it will waſte, and conſume in boyling.
