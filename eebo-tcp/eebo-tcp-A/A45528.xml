            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PAPISTS New faſhion'd Allegiance:</head>
            <head type="sub">A LETTER Lately ſeiz'd in the Houſe of an Eminent <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> in <hi>Hereford-ſhire,</hi> and produced at the late ASSIZES there held:</head>
            <head type="sub">Written by Father <hi>HARCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RT</hi> the Jeſuit, lately Executed; Concerning taking the Oaths of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UPon a late ſearch in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> the enſuing Letter was found by a Juſtice of the Peace in a Papiſt's Houſe, very choicely laid up amongſt a parcel of Crucifixes, Reliques, and Popiſh Trinkets: It was written <hi>as from a Woman,</hi> as ſome Expreſſions would make one believe; But both the Matter, Style and Character, evidently ſhew'd it to be in Truth from ſome <hi>Jeſuit or Popiſh Prieſt,</hi> who now commonly maintain their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies in the Names, and by the Mediation of their <hi>Female-Diſciples.</hi> For as that Sex is by Nature ignorant, <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and pertinacious in their Opinions; ſo theſe crafty Seducers imitating their Father, the <hi>Original Deceiver,</hi> make ſpecial uſe of theſe <hi>weaker Veſſels,</hi> to imbibe and propagate their falſe Doctrines.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Epiſtle therefore, is generally reported, and on good grounds believ'd to be no other than that late Executed Traitor, <hi>Father W. Harcourt,</hi> the Jeſuit, as well becauſe the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Name ſubſcribed, agree with his, and that 'tis certain he was intimately Familiar in that Family, and at that time ſculking up and down the Countrey; as alſo, becauſe ſome acquainted with his Hand-writing conclude it to be of the ſame Character. And though the matter thereof ſeem to be good and commendable, as perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42071:2"/>
or if you pleaſe, giving leave to Papiſts, to do that which in it ſelf is moſt <hi>lawful,</hi> and no more than their <hi>Duty,</hi> yet the manner and grounds on which this is here adviſed, evidently demonſtrate, that 'tis done meerly to ſerve a preſent Turn, and elude the Law by Swearing in ſuch an abſtruſe Equivocating ſence, as renders the Government never the more ſecure: The neceſſary preſervation whereof, was the grand end for which theſe Oaths were originally enjoyn'd, and ſtill impos'd.—The Letter follows.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Am glad to hear you continue ſo well after your hard Bargain, for I was afraid all our Friends had been quite loſt, they have been ſo diſturbed and Letters are ſo uncertain, that one dares not truſt any but by a ſpecial Meſſenger, and ſcarce ſo. I might have been as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as you, but the ſudden Frights of Searchers, which I fear'd might have plunder'd in All, and hurried my good Gentleman to <hi>London,</hi> cauſed a <hi>Miſcarriage,</hi> which went harder with me than Child-bearing. The Times are ſad at preſent, but we ought not to deſpond, <hi>a little Patience may mend all.</hi> My privacy affords but little News, and how the <hi>Great Wheel</hi> turns, I am not certain, but hope and pray for the beſt. We are all well as yet, at our little <hi>Pathmos,</hi> and after ſerious Examination and Advice, which we think fit to communicate to you, and the reſt of our Friends, Approve of it <hi>as requiſite</hi> for a Catholick man to expreſs his true Loyalty in ſuch Circumſtances to his King by taking the <hi>Oaths,</hi> when neceſſitated thereunto. For though there be much <hi>harſhneſs</hi> in the words, as to exclude our Acknowledgment and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by Faith and Obedience unto our purely Spiritual Head; yet <hi>ſince we be admitted to make our own Sence,</hi> as indeed, whoever Swears cannot be hindred by any words impos'd from Swearing, in ſuch Sense as is agreeable to his own underſtanding; ſo that here we only ſwear within ſuch bounds as the Catholick Church and our Duty allows, that is, only acknowledging a Temporal Power over Spirituals, as in Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Courts due to the Temporal Sword, and not in <hi>Foro Conſcientiae,</hi> as by the Proviſo in the Statute <hi>Quinto Elizabethae</hi> may be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to take off this <hi>Ignominious Cenſure</hi> of denying our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and let the World know, that we may give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> what is his due, we may not refuſe the Oaths when legally tendered, eſpecially <hi>at ſuch a time</hi> when Catholicks lye under ſo many Suſpicions and Scandals, in point of Loyalty, which 'tis an indiſpenſable Duty, incumbent upon us all, to prevent to the utmoſt of our power, and this eſpecially when we are not compelled <hi>to the Rigour of the words, as formerly;</hi> but only to allow His Majeſty a Supream, Temporal Power in Spiritual things, and not a purely Spiritual Power, which is due only to the Supream Spiritual Paſtor of our Souls. Without denying God his Right, we may attribute in <hi>a ſound Sence</hi> to the King, that Spiritual Coercive Power, which he or his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors gave to the Church. Now he claims it to himſelf, and with more Juſtice than the firſt Framer of one of theſe Oaths that began it by Pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Church, and uſurping its Power: For he now quietly poſſeſſes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42071:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Church Livings, and had not he the Authority in the Spiritual Courts, upon every diſagreeing, the obſtinately Contentious or beſt monied <hi>Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants</hi> would Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> which would be as inconvenient to our Peace, as thoſe harſh words, which ſome devout Catholicks now ſcruple at, though without reaſon, when their ghoſtly Inſtructors have ſignified their Concurrence, &amp;c. For when the <hi>SWEET LENITIVE</hi> is admitted, by owning the King hath ſuch a Temporal Coercive Power over Spirituals, we do not deny the purely Spiritual Power of our Supream Paſtor. As for Example, The Pope creates a Biſhop, and gives him Power to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Sacraments; This was the Power of the Keys given to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by our Saviour: But 'twas <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gave St. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> his Temporal Command, and had <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his Son, reaſsum'd it again, he had but deſtroy'd his Father's gift. Now then when all the Lands be in the Crown, we may acknowledge the King the Supream Head, and as they be called <hi>Spiritual Livings,</hi> becauſe they belonged to the Church; ſo he may not improperly be ſtyled a <hi>Spiritual Head,</hi> that has Command of them; which at his Pleaſure he may again beſtow upon Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This is what I thought fit to ſignifie to you at preſent on this matter, wherein you deſired Directions, and might have been more plain, would the Times have born it. I ſhould be heartily glad to hear from you as often as you can, but you know the neceſſary Cautions. Pray preſent my Duty to my Aunt; And ſo with my Prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for you all, and moſt Cordial Love remembred, I ever am</p>

Though this Letter be written in ſo ſtrange and affected cloudy Style, and thoſe words, <hi>Miſcarriage, Child-bearing, Husband,</hi> &amp;c. caſt in to make it the better paſs for a Woman's Penning, which yet poſſibly may have ſome other determinate meaning, well known by Confederacy amongſt the Correſpondents; yet the main drift of it ſeems plain enough to be the ſignification of ſome Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lately granted to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, to take the Oaths; and this merely ſuited to the preſent Juncture of Affairs, to avoid the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Laws, prevent Scandal, and poſſeſs Proteſtants with a good opinion of their Loyalty: The better to diſpoſe zealous and ſcrupulous Roman Catholicks thereunto, here is the uſe of Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation recommended, and ſuch an unaccountable diſtinction framed about Temporal Power in Spirituals, and that ſo warily laid down, that the Jeſuits may at any time give a different or clean contrary Interpretation, whenever Opportunity and their Intereſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. By theſe, and the like dealings of theſe Men, we may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceive that they make uſe of Religion only as a Politick Engin, which they manage variouſly at their pleaſure, as it may be moſt ſerviceable to their Deſigns: And that there is no Oath, Teſt, or Obligation, which by the help of an Equivocation and a Diſtinction they cannot accept, and preſently evade or break through.</p>
