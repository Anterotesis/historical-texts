            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN Reader: These ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were by the godly, and learned Author of them fitted for the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to which he was to speake, &amp; no doubt intended onely for the benefit of hearers, not of readers. Neverthelesse it was the desire of many that they might bee published vpon hope of good that might be done to the Church of God by them. There is neede of plaine instructions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite men to holynes of life, as well as accurate trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises to discerne trueth from error. For which end I dare promise these Sermons will make much, where they finde an honest, and humble reader. It was the Authors greatest care <hi>to handle the word of God by manifestation of the truth commending himselfe to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the sight of God;</hi> as once S. Paul pleaded for himselfe.<note place="margin">Gell. noct. Attic. lib. 1. cap. 15.</note> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. And if that be the property (which they say) of an eloquent, and

Many excellencies there were in him for which his memory remaines: but this aboue all was his crowne that he vnfainedly sought Gods glory, and the good of mens soules. It remaines, that these sermons be read by thee with a care to profit, and thanksgiving to God for the benefit thou hast by them, sith they are such talents, as in the vse of which hee requires, and expects to bee glorified: Farewell.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O acquaint you briefly with the occasion of these words: their coherence with the foregoing and following verses standes thus. Vpon some confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and arguments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Saviour Christ and the Pharisees with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Iewes about the qualitie of his person, who and what manner of man he should be; Christ having plainely testified who he was, even the light of the world, that Messiah whom they had so long expected: it so comes to passe, that many of the people that were present hearing Christ defend his authoritie against the cavils of the Pharises, were thereby <hi>moved to belieue in him, ver.</hi> 30. Vnto
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14714:4"/> these believers Christ directs his speach, telling them that it was not enough for the present to seeme forward in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing &amp; yeelding assent vnto his doctrine. There is more in it then so, if they will proue themselues to be true beleivers and his Disciples they must persevere in the profession and practise of his Doctrine <hi>(if yee Continue in my word ye are verily my Disciples) vers.</hi> 31. Now whereas many things might discourage these young beginners from going on further, especially their ignorance of this heavenly Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and with all those manifold sinfull Corruptions from which they could not quickly shift themselues, Christ for their encouragement adds by way of promise, that if they will hold on they both <hi>(shall know the truth) vz:</hi> The Gospell and all the wayes of Gods grace in mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ, and further <hi>(the truth shall make them free) vers.</hi> 32. from the bondage of such inconveniences as might keepe them backe from the resolute profession of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as feare of the displeasure of the Pharises and rulers, feare of losse, disgrace and reproach in the world, loue of those sinnes and pleasures wherein they liued heretofore and which now they might be vnwilling to leaue. Those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, which caused many a one to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from following of Christ, our Saviour promiseth these beleivers, that if they will be Constant they shall haue no power nor Commande over them: But that the grace of God in the cleere knowledge of the Gospell should make them Freemen and set them at liberty from the feare or loue of all such things, as might pull them aside from an holy profession of the name of Christ <hi>vers.</hi> 32. This louing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of Christ is very ill taken by the Iewes. Christ had touched vpon that string that jarred, and they might not endure to be thus closely though iustly taxed for hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Counterfeites, such as were so farre from being true beleiuing Disciples vnto him, as that they still continued in bondage vnto their Corruption and would be ready vpon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14714:4"/> every occasion to flie of from Christs service. Wherefore when Christ tells them that the truth should make them freemen, out of a perverse mistake they turne this clause into occasion of quarrell and take great exceptions at Christ for calling them slaves and bondmen <hi>(wee be</hi> say they, in great stomack, <hi>Abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man; Why sayest thou then yee shall be made free vers. 33.)</hi> Those Commonly bragge most that may doe least, and yee haue few that stande more stiflie vpon termes of reputation, then those that haue least true worth in them selues. So it is with these worthlesse Iewes, who stand punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vpon points of honour to cleare themselues from that imputation of bodily slauery, which Christ layd on them (as they thought) when yet in the meane time they are of all slaues the basest, <hi>vz</hi> servants of sinne and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They said something that was true that <hi>they were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams Children</hi> borne of Sarah the Freewoman, and this Christ denied not. But whereas they had said <hi>they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in bondage to any man</hi> that was false euen in regarde of their Corporall bondage. For their bondage in Egipt of old, their Captivity for 70. yeeres in Assiria of latter times, and the present subiection of their whole state vnder the yoke of the Roman governement was witnes sufficient that it was no such strange matter for a Iew to be a bondman. But say they had beene alwayes free from such bodily sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, this was not that which Christ aimed at in that speech of his <hi>(the truth shall make you free)</hi> tw'as spirituall se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude vnder the power of sinne which he meant, and seeing they will not otherwise vnderstand him hee declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in plaine tearmes in this 34. <hi>verse. verily verily I say vnto you whosoever Committeth sinne is the servant of sinne)</hi> There are servants of sinne as well as servants of men, and the Condicions of those is as bad as of these yea worse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ makes the Comparison in two paticulars.</p>
            <p>1 Servants must haue no inheritance with the free borne
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14714:5"/> Children they may for a while enioy the common benefit of the familie: but at last they must be turned out and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren only divide the inheritance: so wicked men for a while liue together in Gods house the Church: but when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of inheritance shalbee bestowed on the children of God these are vtterly throwne out of all, and no part fals to their share. This is expressed, ver. 35. <hi>[And the servant abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in the house for ever but the sonne abideth for ever.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Servants must haue their freedome from a free man that hath power to set them at libertie. So must sinners from Christ the only sonne of God, who hath this power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given vnto him of bondslaues to Sathan and sinne to make them Gods freemen. He alone brings deliverance to captiues and prisoners, translating miserable sinners, from vnder the commande of the power of darknesse into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Gods adopted sonnes; who being himselfe made heire of all things as Gods naturall sonne admits vs the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted sonnes into the fellowship of a glorious inheritance. This is set downe, vers. 36. <hi>[If the sonne therefore shall make you free yee shalbe free indeede.]</hi> Thus the servants of sinne are in an ill case sure to be turned out of house and home, except the sonne of God Iesus Christ shall purchase their freedome and bestow an inheritance vpon them. But what? were these Iewes here such kinde of bondmen? Yea that they were: and Christ makes it good in the two verses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by vndeniable arguments. Their vngodly practise shewed plainely what master they serued, and by whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande they were ruled, <hi>[I know,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>yee are Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams seed] viz.</hi> according to the flesh, and so borne of free parents: but yet yee are not freemen so long as malice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the gospell, loue of the world, bloody desires of an innocent mans death with such like corruptions, tyrannize and beare rule over your hearts as they doe. For why? <hi>[but yee seeke to kill me.]</hi> A cruell master it must be that will commande, and very slaues they are that will be obedient
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14714:5"/> to do so ill an office as to murther Christ. But the reason followes ye doe it <hi>(because my words haue no place in you.)</hi> That most holy, pure, meeke and peaceable Doctrine of the Gospell, which Christ published vnto them could haue no command over their heartes to win them to subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; obedience therevnto: they were engaged to another master &amp; to his word they would obey, not Christs, not Gods, <hi>ve.</hi>
37. which in the next <hi>vers.</hi> 38. appeares yet more plainly.) I saith Christ <hi>speake vnto you that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye doe that which you haue seene with your Father)</hi>
(1) I speake vnto you the will of God and you obey the will of the Divel. Whence it is easie to judge vnto whom ye belong, and whether yee be the Children of God free subjects vnder his gracious government, or the children of the Divel and slavish vassalls vnder his mercilesse tyrainie. You see now the occasion and Coherence of these wordes I haue read vnto you. The scope wherof in breefe is this: To giue these Iewes right information of their present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what it was. They in great errour boasted themselues much vpon their outward liberty while yet they were the servants of vnrighteousnes. Wherefor our Saviour for their instruction and ours lets them vnderstand that they bee slaues that serue sinne as well as those that serue men: And for this purpose he pronounceth to them and vs this most certaine and vndeniable truth <hi>(Verily verily I say vnto you whosoever Committeth sinne is the servant of sinne.</hi> The meaning of the wordes is plaine if you obserue.</p>
            <p>1 What it is to Commit sinne 2 what to be a servant of sinne. To commit sinne is not simply to doe any act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law and will of God: for even the regenerate and most sanctified men in many thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s sin often, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse are not the servants of sinne but are <hi>free from</hi> sinne <hi>and made the servants of God</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. In this place therefore to commit sinne [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is to do evill willingly and ordinarily: When men make as it were a trade and common practise of breaking the lawe of God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14714:6"/> holding on in an vnusuall course of vngodly liuing without remorse &amp; reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of such Christ tels vs that they be the servants or slaues [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>A sinner is a bondslaue, &amp; to liue in sinne is to liue in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> For the more distinct explication of this point touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans spirituall bondage vnder sinne I desire you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue three particulars.</p>
            <p>1 The nature of this bondage wherein it consistes.</p>
            <p>2 The diverse degrees and kindes of it.</p>
            <p>3 The greatnes and grievousnes of it.</p>
            <p>For the first: the bondage of sinne standeth Chiefly in two things 1 <hi>In subiection to the power of sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 In subiection to the punishment of sinne.</p>
            <p>The power and authority that sinne hath over man is seene in two particulars.</p>
            <p>1 In restraining his liberty from doing of good.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>In Commanding his service in all bad emploiments.</hi> As a master over his servants canne both bid and forbid them: So the sinne that rules in mens mortall bodies hath power both to restraine them from good and to employ them in evill practises: you shall see both true in their order.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sinne hath power of restraint and hindering from the doeing of good.</hi> A slaue is not in his owne power but his masters, hee cannot goe whither he will nor doe what he lifts nor dispose of himselfe as he pleaseth, his service, his goods, his life are all ordered by his masters discretion. So is it with a sinner who is holden in the fetters and chaines of his corruption, he is not his owne man nor can he doe what many times he would. In men that are regenerate and sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in part experience yet witnesseth how much they are pestered and cumbred with this sinne that hangeth on so
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14714:6"/> fast about them. How ever the spirit be willing and faine they would doe much in the service of God; yet the flesh is weake and they are so shackled with it, that for their liues they can make but slow hast in the wayes of godlines, much a doe they haue to keepe jogging on, dulnesse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, hypocrisie, formality and a world of other corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions set vpon them in every spirituall duty, in every good resolution; so that when they do best, their work is yet done but to halues. Grace is yoked with Corruption, when that puts vs forward, this puls vs backeward, in so much that a regenerate man is but halfe a freeman, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in some sort molested by his Corruption in the whole course of his religious Conversation, according as the Apostle Paul in the person of euery regenerate man complaines very pittifully. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19. 20. 21. But now in those that are vnregenerate this power of sin is much more predominant, whose hearts, affections, vnderstandings, and all in them are fast locked and barred vp vnder impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, rebellion and blindnesse, so that they are <hi>holden prisoners of Sathan at his pleasure,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
26. Sinne hath dealt with those men as wee doe with wilde fowle, clipping their wings that they may not fly away; or as enemies doe with captiues disarme them of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons that they shall bee able to make no shift for their res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue. So hath sin vtterly disabled man to every good worke by putting out the eies of his knowledge, and stripping him naked of all those graces &amp; strength which he had by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beside this sinne hath taken away all desire of doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, haueing affected the soule of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n with the loue of all vnrighteousnes, where by it comes to passe that man is well contented to be the servant of sinne taking great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his owne shame and misery: Vnregenerat men are kept fast in durance, being neither able nor willing to come out of their bondage. In this respect is sinne compared to snares, and netts, and bonds wherein men are caught, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14714:7"/> kept fast for escaping, <hi>[I finde</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Eccles. 7.
28.] more bitter then death, the woman whose heart is as netts and snares, &amp; her hands as bounds.</hi> Thereby signifing the most intangling and inthralling nature of the sinne of adultery, whereinto few men fall that euer get out againe <hi>[I see that thou art in the gall of bitternesse, and in the bond of iniquity]</hi> saith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus Acts.</hi> 8. 23. Why because for all his seeming profession, he was still tyed to his couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; other vile affections, like a slaue bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to a post with a chaine. So <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> that he instruct his hearers to the end they might <hi>[Come to amendment and recouer out of the snare of the Divell, of whome they were taken prisoners at his will. 2. Tim. 2. 26.]</hi> And for this cause are sinners in the state of vnregeneration, compared to captiues and prisoners kept vp in restraint, <hi>Isaiah. 61. 1. Isai.</hi> 42. 7.</p>
            <p>But here you are to note that Satan and sinne doe not deale alike rigorously with all: they carry a straighter hand ouer some then ouer others. Some they keep <hi>in arcta custodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in close imprisonment. And that is when men by Satan and corruption are made so sure and so fast chained, that they cannot goe one step beyond prophanesse and impiety. Thus is it with men, that are kepr close prisoners in the darke dungeon of ignorance, or who stick fast in the dirt or mire of beastly, coveteous, and voluptuous affections: in a word those that are giuen over to all vngodly and lewd courses. Others there are who are indeed prisoners, but yet they are kept <hi>in libera custodia</hi> in a larger kind of restraint, or as we say, in free prison. And this is when Satan sporting himselfe in the sinne and misery of man holds him in a longer chaine, and lets him goe a good way onward in Christianity; but yet at last fetcheth him back againe when he pleaseth like birds in a larger Cage they flutter about, or like birds in a string they make a faire flight vp towards heauen; but Satan when he spies his advantage, that by their fall he may giue some notable foyle to Gods glory, and the credit of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14714:7"/> Gospell, then he twitcheth the string and downe they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto hell. Such are those of which <hi>Peter</hi> speaks 2. <hi>Peter
2. 18. 19. 20. who had escaped farre from the filthinesse of the world, but yet were intangled againe therein.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Demas</hi> whose coveteousnesse hookt him back from his profession of the Gospell to the world. And such was the young man in the Gospell, who was come neere to the kingdome of heauen, but he had one legge chained fast to the loue of riches, and that fett him quite back againe. All these haue a kind of liberty, but t'is only of the prison: They walke abroad but ti's in fetters, or as prisoners in <hi>Rome</hi> vsed to be dealt with, chained to a souldier their kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that doth accompany them to see them safe returned to their jayle. Now you knowe that a slaue who walkes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to do his masters businesse, is yet a slaue as well as he that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> chained in the Gallie. And so are these still servants and bondmen to their corruptions, how ever they seeme for the present to bee more favorablie vsed. Thus of the first point wherein the masterlie power of sinne stands, <hi>viz.</hi> the restraint from doing the good we should, and sometimes would. Now in the next place, Sinne hath also.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>A power of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding all bad services whatsoeuer:</hi> A slaue you knowe must ride and runne, drudg and trudg, carry and draw, hew in quarries, digg in the mines, tugge at the oare, labour like horses in a mill, and be put to all the base offices that are to be done. Honourable seruices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there be that a freeman, a sonne may bee imployed in: but servants and slaues indure the basest and painfullest drudgeries. So is it with a sinner; he is at the command of his sinne, as the Asse of his driuer, or as the Centurions servants were at their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters beck. Looke how Satan inspires him and his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on suggests vnto him, so he studies and plotts, so he invents and practises. Be it but one sinne that raignes over him, you shall see him euer attendant on that master, as bee it lust, pleasures, coveteousnesse, ambition, he is wholy taken vp in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14714:8"/> their imployments. He hath nothing to spare from them: no thoughts, no words, no time: weeke day and Sabbath day, their businesse still goes on; nay the day is not enough for the doing of its command. He deviseth mischiefe vpon his bedd, and he cannot sleepe till he haue lay'd a plott how hee may compasse one of his vngodly desires. He will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, crafty, and diligent in contriving and dispatching the affaires, which the Divell and his corrupt heart haue giuen him in command. For this cause is sinne compared vnto a law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. because it commands and rules ouer men by powerful suggestions, provoking them to evill. A law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse law it is, but fitt for lawlesse men, it prohibiteth all that good is, and enioynes the practise of every euill thing. And hence also is Satan stiled the prince of this world, because he hath noe meane company at his devotion ouer whome hee rules as vassals and slaues, most ready to obey his will and pleasure. But will you see what imployment sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan set men about. Are they honorable services? no: the most vile, base, absurd, and vnreasonable offices that can be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, what will not they command, or what will not one of their servants do against religion, conscience, justice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honesty, yea and nature it selfe? Let coveteousnes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize ouer him: how basely, niggardly, scraping, pinching and sparing will he be? How most vnconscionably and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully will he oppresse, exact, cozen and deceiue all the world, strangers, acquaintance, rich, poore, friends or foes, Brother, Father and all that may challenge faire and honest dealing? If lust rule him he will damne his soule, destroy his body, disgrace his name, ouerthrow his estate, vndoe all his posterity for the loue of some base whore. The like may be said of Pride, Gluttony and Voluptuousnes or any such like swaggering lust. Yea to goe farther, the godly many times are here besotted, who to satifie some one vnmasterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, will hazard the peace and comfort of their soules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace themselues and their profession, vexe the spirite
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14714:8"/> and cast themselues vpon Gods sore displeasure. So vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and tyrannicall are these commands of sinne and Satan, and so base and servile are we growne in our obedience to them, that we will not stick to do that which in the practise or event of it tends to our owne vtter vndoing. Now who would not be ashamed of such a master, and such a service? Nay who is not ashamed of it? But here is the power of darknesse and the invisible tyrannie of Sathan, that whom wee hate yet we feare, and serue: of whom we are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to him yet we shew our selues obedient. Thus much touching a sinners subiection vnto the power of sinne.</p>
            <p>Next follows <hi>his subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the punishment of it,</hi> which is the sorest part of this bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage which yet a sinner must sure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly beare. He is in this respect of al slaues the most miserable: for let him looke which way he will he can see nothing but scourges and Scorpions provided for his backe; the whip, the Crosse, the forke aud such like punishments of slaues in old time are nothing to the torments he stands in feare of. No sober houre passeth over a sinners head wherein his heart is not full of slavish and dreadfull terrors, arising from a threefold cause.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>From Conscience,</hi> the horrible clamors whereof terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his very soule and gripe him to the heart with vnsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble panges, while it stil cryes in his eare in this ruefull voice <hi>[yet know that for this God shall bring thee to Iudgment]</hi> oh this makes him quake and grow pale he is afraide to looke God or men in the face, he shifts &amp; faine would if he could hide his sinnes from the knowledge of his Conscience, and both from Gods eie.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>From Sathan,</hi> who though he now seeme as his Master yet he knowes and trembles to thinke of it that hereafter he must be his everlasting tormentor.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>From God himselfe,</hi> whose most furious wrath and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voideable vengeance he knows is prepared for him and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die every moment to swallow him for his rebellion. Now
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14714:9"/> who coulde eate his meate merrily that must pay such a shot? What comforts of this life, what pleasures of sin can be sweete which are every moment imbittered with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woes? It helpes not a iot that they be for a time defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for he is no freeman who though he be not clapt vp in prison, yet cannot walke abroad without feare of the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, the prison, the gallowes, when the country is laide for him, and executions out for him in every place. Certainely it is a hell to liue in feare of hell, and as bad as death to liue in <hi>bondage for feare thereof all the daies of a mans life.</hi> Heb.
2. 13.</p>
            <p>Yet such is the miserable thraldome of a wicked man, he is everie way in the bryers, being on the one side fast chained to his sinnefull and vngodlie courses; on the other as surely and certainelie bound to his everlasting punishment. And so much for the first part of the nature of this spirituall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage wherein it standeth.</p>
            <p>2 I goe forwarde to the next point which I proposed to your consideration, <hi>viz. The diverse degrees of this bondage:</hi> where you are to note that there are two kindes of it. 1. wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
2, vnwilfull slaverie.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Wilfull bondage,</hi> is when a free ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is content to be made a slaue, or being by force or fraud made one, is willing to continue one still. Such a one was <hi>Ahab</hi> who <hi>sold himselfe</hi> for a slaue <hi>to doe wickedly. 1. King.</hi> 21. 20. I will giue the worth of it, said he to <hi>Naboth</hi> when he sought after his vine yard; true, he gaue the full worth of it, that sold himselfe for a few acres of land. Such are all those that commit sinne with greedinesse, who take pleasure in all vnrighteousnesse, who loue the wages of iniquitie, who obey sinne in the lust thereof, who take thought to fulfill the desires of the flesh, with full consent and heartie good will, giving vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be ruled by the counsels of Satan, and their wicked hearts. In which condition of a wretched sinner, you may obserue two things remarkeable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:14714:9"/>
1 How strangely base and degenerat mans nature is growne, who being a most noble Creature, made for the most honourable purposes and services in the world, is now growne so vile and extreamly base, so farre forgetfull of his duty and the dignity of his creation, as to be willing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of the free and happy service of God and goodnes, to put himselfe into a most ignominious slaverie vnto Divels and vile affections. Naturally we all loue libertie &amp; choose rather the losse of life, then of it, and only violence &amp; fraude can bring vs or keepe vs in bondage: But sinne hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with vs against nature and so taken off from vs the edge of all vertuous and manly resolution, that of our owne accorde we offer our selues vnto it, being put in fetters and manicles by our owne corruptions, yea this slaverie men count their only liberty in somuch that when they be called vnto freedome, haue their ransome offered them, and all meanes of escape laid before them, yet they choose to be slaues still.</p>
            <p>2 How Difficult a matter ti's for a man to come out of this bondage, surely he that loues the prison better then his enlargement its pitty there should be any meanes of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, and ti's hazard if they be sought he wil not accept of them. That servant who in the seventh yeere of his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage did so loue his master that he would not goe out free, he was by the law to serue his maister for ever afterwarde <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 5. Hee that would not be free when he might should not afterwards when happily he would. And so it is with the servants of sinne when once they beare a good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their Master and are so far bewitched as to hold themselues well apayd with his service. Then are their eares nayled fast to the postes and gates of Hell, or rather with Siser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a nayle is stricken through their temples and at one stroke they loose both life and liberty for ever. So that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that strong man make a forecible rescue of them out of the hands of these tyrants they doe never escape from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14714:10"/> this miserable thraldome.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Vnwilling bondage:</hi> as when a man is taken prisoner by the sword in battle, or circumvented by some stratagem or fraudulent guile. Such is the Condition of Godly men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times who by some furious, and vehement assault of temptation are wounded, overthrowne, taken, led away captiue and clapt vp in irons vnder the guard of some strong vnruly lust, or other, or else by some subtle sleight and snare privily laid for their soules haue their heels intrapped in the ginne, and for a while are caught as a prey for Sathan. But now during this straightnesse, what sighes and sorrowes doe possese the Godly heart? How tedious aud irksom is this bondage? How doeth he long till his heart bee againe enlarged, that hee may run the race of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Life it selfe is vnpleasant till this liberty be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe. Wherfore many a harty prayer is sent vp to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayly to intreate God for his enlargement, willingly doth he embrace all meanes of freedome, gladly doeth he run and rest in him that onely bringeth deliverance vnto captiue prisoners, with the Israelites in Aegipt he is even weary of his life for the oppression and cruell tyrannie vnder which he is holden, which makes him in the bitternes of his soule cry out vnto God for deliverance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his heavy bondage. Often taking vp that Complaint of the Apostle <hi>Rom. 7. 24. [O Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death]</hi> These are the severall degrees of this bondage which was the second part proposed to be handled.</p>
            <p>3 I come in the third place to consider <hi>the greatnesse and grieuousnes of this spirituall bondage:</hi> which will appeare by comparing it with outward bodily slavery. Now spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all slavery is worse then corporall in three respects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1 In regard of multitude of masters:</hi> In corporall seruitude
1 master may haue many serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but for 1 servant to haue two or more masters is a thing vnreasonable and vnpossible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:14714:10"/> suppose they were both good; much more if they bee bad. Miserable therefore is the estate of a sinfull man, who when he serues fewest serues three at once, 1 his lusts, 2 Satan working powerfully in his sinfull corruption, 3 God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. For the first: it may be some one wicked affection is his master, and yet there is worke enough to please that, but when many lusts at once beare sway ouer a man like many tyrants in one Citty, Lord what combats, broyles, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults be there in that mans heart: when pride co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands one thing, covetousnes another: when vncleane lusts draw one way, ambition another, voluptuousnesse a third, a man had need then to study and take thought for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof, and all litle enough to please these hard and cruell taskmasters. Againe he hath another master, and that is Satan, who inspires these corrupt affections of mans heart, with much rage and hellish fiercenesse, and is that gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Pharoah who setteth al those inferior officers a work, who therefore is called the <hi>[spirit that worketh in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of disobedience] Ephe.</hi> 2. 2. Ouer whom although he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may seeme to challenge all power and authority as ouer the only subjects of his kingdome, yet wee knowe that besides both these they haue another supreame and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Lord (1) God himselfe, against whose governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment although they do rebell, yet can they not withdraw themselues from vnder his power and jurisdiction. <hi>God is king let the earth be neuer so vnquiet, and the haters of the Lord shall be subiect vnto him.</hi> He will haue to do with them in spight of their hearts. They feare him as slaues against their wills, both to do his will whilst he vseth them to effect by them his owne most holy purposes, and also to suffer his will in their iustly deserued punishment. Thus wicked men are mastered on all hands, and no way free either from sin or punishment.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>In regard of the meanes of escape:</hi> a servant hardly vsed may find meanes to shift himselfe of his master; It is not so
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14714:11"/> with a sinner; runne away from his master he cannot: for he beares him alwayes about with him in his bosome, his sinne still keeps him company, and goe he whither he will Satan doggs him, stands at his right hand, nay possesseth his very heart, so plying him with temptations and ill suggestions, that he cannot goe a foote from his service. Tis true the case is so sometimes with a wicked man that he changeth his master, but seldome comes a better. If he escape the tyranny of one sinfull affection, he falls vnder the command and power of another as bad. So you shall haue a very spend-thrift turne a miserable niggard: but this is only like a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner that remoues his bolt from one legg to another, and such exchange is only done vpon compact: He leaues one vice that he may the more freely giue himselfe to another; so that he changes his master but not his servile condition. Some raigning sinne or other will alwayes cleaue to his soule, lie downe with him in his graue, and sinke him downe to Hell. And as for the eye of Gods revenging justice he sees it open vpon him, to take notice of his doings, and his hand alwayes lifted vp to smite him, trembling alwayes to thinke that he hath no meanes to hide his sinne from Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, no power to prevent, no strength to beare the heauy stroke of his wrath when it shall light vpon him.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>In respect of the reward,</hi> the world hath scarce afforded masters so without all humanity, Tyrannicall and cruell, as not to be pleased with the faithful seruice of a slaue, or not to reward him in some degree of courtesie for his seruice. A sinner is miserable both wayes as he cannot please his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, so he cannot hope for a reward. For take a man that hath quite spent himselfe in the seruice of some one of these imperiall and cruell Lords, who hath done all that he can in giving full content and satisfaction vnto them, yet they rest not, there are yet new commands and further injunctions, so that when it seemed, villany was come to the height, and that mens witts and strengths did faile them for further
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14714:11"/> plots and practises, there's yet a powder plott behind, some new, strange, vnthought of piece of bad seruice to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Sinne and Satan are restlesse and mercylesse, tyrants neuer contented, still exacting, crying, craving, compelling to new tributes and homages. And now when a man hath worne out himselfe in their seruice, spent his yeares and strength, his wealth and good name, and body and soule, and al vpon them, what is then his reward for this his trusty and true seruice? A courtesy thinke you? Nay a very Hell of vnkindnesse, shame, reproach, misery, and many other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments euen in this life, but for that other Hell damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fire, snares, and brimstone, and stormy tempests of Gods furious indignation: this is their portion and the guerdon of their obedience. Satan did for a while promise faire and performe little, helping them to enjoy some pleasures of sin for a reason; but this seeming kindnesse was but coloured cruelty, all being nothing but a sweet sauce to make him swallow downe those morsels of poyson, the fierie venome whereof shall afterwards drinke vp his spirit, and inflame his soule with euerlasting burning,</p>
            <p>Foolish men and vnwise that take such paines to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable; But how should it be otherwise, when men are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Satan? But rebels against God. In vaine do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any other reward for their seruice, then the severest pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their rebellion.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue opened vnto you according as I haue bin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the nature, degrees, &amp; quality of this spirituall bondage of sinne. It remaineth now to make some vse and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which hath benne deliuered.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>1</label> The <hi>first vse</hi> shallbe for the discouery of a great error in the world committed by men, in iudging their owne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens conditions. It is the common opinion of most, that if a man liue out of danger of law, and haue wherewith to pay euery man and keepe him out of debt and feare of the prison, if he can liue vpon his owne and be beholding to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14714:12"/> no man, if he can set his foote to the best mans in the parish, and be able to make his part good in any suit or quarrell, caring as little for such a great man, as the great man cares for him, if he can ouer-beare his enemies, and trample vpon any that he takes against; If he can go whether he lists &amp; do what he pleaseth, liuing idlely in pleasures vpon other mens labours; if he be able to sin boldly, to satisfie any disordered affection without controule, hauing power in his hand to overcome a poore Minister, that he shal not dare to reproue him, or money enough in his purse to out-bribe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, &amp; seuerity of the law, such a man as this that liues with out feare or care, he is esteemed the only man that leads a free life, and liues at his own command. Thus men iudge of others and of themselues, whil'st they looke no farther then that which is outward, appearing to sense: But they must knowe that every freeman in a civill estate, is not a free sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Gods kingdome; No: there be that feed dainty, lie soft, goe richly cladd, liue lazily, and who take their fill of worldly pleasures in all licentiousnesse, who yet are as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant slaues as any that serue in a Gally. Do but turne their inside outward, and you shall see ever whole legions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels domineering ouer them, pride, covetousnesse, ambition, envie, malice, vncleane desires, with a number of such like black and hellish lusts raigning in their soules, vnder the command whereof they are haled this way and that, in all seruile obedience euen like slaues bought and solde in a market. A vaine thing t'is for these men to bragg of their nobility, gentrie, of the freedome and ingeniousnesse of their education or living. For let them know that a mans honour is his honestie and sanctitie; his perfect freedome is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, service of his God. He is truly free, gentle, and noble, thats truly gracious. Swearing, lying, gaming, whoring, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteousnesse, gaping after a few pounds of gold and siluer, foolish loue of gay apparell, restlesse pursute after two or three words and titles of honour, with the like are these the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14714:12"/> imployments of a braue, free, generous, and noble spirit? Farre be it from any man to thinke so, seruile and base dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, they be that subiect themselues, to such wicked and vnworthy affections, nor can any be honest, or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable who hath such masters. This the Apostle concludes, <hi>Rom. 6. 20. [When yee were the servants of sinne, yee were free from righteousnesse.]</hi> And it must needs be a base and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest seruice wherein t'is free to be, and to do any thinge sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that which is honest and righteous. Wherefore let no man fall into the error of the Iewes here noted in this text, boasting much of their freedome and dignitie, because they were borne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; liued not in bodily servitude, lest they heare also that which Christ here replied vpon these Iewes <hi>[who so committeth sinne is the servant of sinne]</hi> and againe <hi>[if yee were Abrahams Children, yee would doe the works of Abraham] vers.</hi> 39. But now <hi>[yee are of your Father the Divell because the lusts of your Father yee will doe] vers.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> 2 The second vse of this point shalbe for admonition, that each one do make triall of his estate, whether he be the seruant of sinne yea or no? For which purpose the Apostle hath set vs downe a golden rule, <hi>Rom. 6. 16. [knowe yee not that to whomsoeuer yee giue your selues as servants to obey, his servants yee are to whome yee obey, whether it be of sinne vnto death, or of obedience vnto righteousnesse.]</hi> T'is not the Liverie or Cognizance of Baptisme, t'is not the name of Christian, t'is not the outward profession of religion that makes a distinction betweene the seruants of God, and of sinne. We haue a fairer marke to know them by, and that is Obedience. This tels vs certainly to whom they belong. He that obeys God he is Gods servant, he that obeys sinne, let him protest or professe neuer so much devotion to Gods service, yet he is for all that the seruant of sinne and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Well then the triall is now easie, and requires no more but this, that you bring your thoughts home to your selues,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14714:13"/> duely considering whom you do vsually seruice vnto, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God in obeying his holy commandements, or your owne sinfull flesh and Satan in following their counsels.</p>
            <p>Doest thou in thy heart serue the law of God, consenting to all the commands thereof as most good and holy, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring as much as possibly thou art able to do whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it biddeth thee, holding a constant resolution to please God in all things whatsoeuer. If thy conscience can truly say yea, then maist thou rejoyce in the honourable title of being the servant of God. On the other side doest thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt sinne as our sauiour speaks here, that is, doest thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and ordinarily, make a practise of breaking Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law, following euery lewd course that Satan leads thee to, and giving scope to thy vngodly desires? yea is there any one particular sinne that raignes ouer thee, wherein thou liuest wittingly and wilfully howeuer thou forsake others? If thy conscience say yea, then know that as yet thou art a miserable bondman and seruant vnto corruption, hearken therefore in the last place to</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>3</label> 3 The third vse wherewith I will conclude this point, and that is an exhortation to perswade those that find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in bondage vnto sinne to endeuour by all meanes to gett themselues at libertie. To men in prison or bodily ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, this exhortation were needlesse; but vnto the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of sinne, t'is most necessary to vse all perswasions to make themselues freemen. Two motiues there are that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily prevaile with all men, to seeke for a change of their present condition, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. the 'euill of the present estate in which they are. 2 The good of another whereto they may come: both are seriouslie to be thought on in this businesse, forasmuch as there is no estate worse then the slauery of sin and punishment: nor any better then the libertie of grace and glorie. Wherefore let me earnestlie entreat you to bend your meditations vpon these two points. First thinke with your selues how miserable a thing it is, for a man to liue all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14714:13"/> daies of his life, like a slaue and die like a villaine, how wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the case of that poore creature, which is at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of euery base affection led and driuen hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according as euery wicked desire and hellish inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall provoke it, wearying it selfe in the wayes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and taking a great deale of paines to worke out its owne everlasting miserie. Thinke what strange folly it is for a man to content himselfe with a few poore commodities &amp; pleasures, that sinne can afford for a day or two, the very enjoyning whereof do but make him more vnhappy: No man that is wise would buy the greatest of such conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for one of the panges of an ill conscience, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie them. The time comes on when he must part with all his delights, and be turn'd out of the world naked of all comfort, grace and favour. This is it that cutts him to the heart, and one serious thought of it quite dasheth all his jollity and contentment, Feares are vpon him on euery side, making him to liue vncomfortable because he knowes he shall die vnhappily. But now turne our thoughts on the other side, and consider how happie and glorious the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Saints is, whom God by his grace hath set at libertie, from the service of sinne. Whether you looke vpon them here in this life in the estate of grace, or hereafter in the estate of glorie, their freedome is euery way blessed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable. Free they are from the commanding power of sin, being now led by the spirit of Christ, and not by the spirit of the Diuell: free from the terrors of an euil conscience: free from the terrors of death, hell, and iudgment: free vnto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noble imployment in Gods seruice, apt to pray much, readie to here much, able to meditate much, delighting in sanctifying the Sabboth, chearefull, forward and willing hearted to every good worke. A blessed estate if we haue either grace or witt to iudge aright of it. I confesse grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse fooles haue another esteeme of it: Tell them of praying, reading the word of God, singing of Psalmes, hearing and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14714:14"/> repeating of Sermons, and keeping of the Sabbath ye kill them dead, &amp; rather they had, you should set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any the painfullest drudgerie in the world: Counsell them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine gaming, drinking and ill companie, to bridle their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and naughty affections, to converse with such and such men of godlie and religious liues, and to be coutent to be ruled by reason and Gods word. All this is euen as much as if you should put them in the stockes, or clap a paire of fetters on their heeles. Let them liue in a familie where all exercises of religion are stricklie obserued, and no libertie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any lewd practise, they are as wearie of it as a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Iayle, or one that is in little ease, and they thinke it seauen yeares till they be gone to some other place, where they may liue as they list. Thus men of perverse minds, and corrupt judgments censure Gods seruice to be no better then a sad, dull, wearisome, and slauish drudgerie. Vngodlie men, that thinke theirs no mirth but in madnesse; no sport but in doing mischife; no contentment but in pleasing the Diuell and wicked lusts, no libertie at all but in licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of liuing. Be (I beseech you) better informed, and knowe that a subiect is a free man though he serues his Prince and obey his lawes: A Sonne is a freeman although he liue in feare and awe of his Parents: A servant is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man though he liue in conformity to the lawes of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an master, and the orders of a Christian familie. And so a Christian man is then free, yea most free when hee submits himselfe to the lawes of God, as an obedient subiect of his kingdome. This freedome he enjoyes in part in this life, but fully in the world to come, when he shall be perfectly freed from all sinne and miserie, when there shall be no feare of being vnhappy, because no possibilitie of being sinfull. Certainly my Brethren, if there be in vs any sense of our present miserie, or expectation of the future happinesse of the Saints, we cannot choose but sigh within our selues with many prayers, wishes, and longing desires, that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14714:14"/> may <hi>be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into this glorious liberty of the sonnes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If now (for conclusion of all) you aske me by what meanes this freedome may be obtained: I answere briefly, there is no meanes but one, and that is Iesus Christ. All the libertie we haue is his purchase and from his gift, for as you haue heard, we are bondslaues vnto sin, partly in regard of the punishment of it, partly in regard of the ouer-ruling power thereof. Now t'is Christ that sets vs at libertie from both. Christ by his blood purgeth vs from all our sinnes, by taking the guilt and punishment thereof from vs. Christ by his spirit delivers vs from the power and dominion of sinne, that it raigns not in our mortall bodies, hauing sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vs by sending the holy Ghost into our hearts. For <hi>[where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty]</hi> as the Apostle speakes, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. So that euery way Christ is he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes on vs our manu-mission, according as he himselfe here speaketh <hi>[if that sonne shall make you free, then are you free indeed]</hi> wherefore this only remaines that we should goe vnto Christ, seeke and sue vnto him for our enlargment, intreat him to here the crie of a prisoner and captiue, and in compassion of thee to afford his helping hand for thy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Pray him to put himselfe betweene Gods wrath and thy soule, making peace for thee in heauen, by his bloody and meritorious sacrifice, pray him to send forth into thine heart, the spirit of sanctification, to regenerate and renew all the powers of soule &amp; body, freeing them from that law of sinne which naturally is in thy members, that by the power of that inward grace, thou maiest be able thenceforth to giue vp thy soule and bodie vnto God, as seruants of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and holinesse. Confesse to him and say: <hi>O Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords besides thee haue ruled over me,</hi> who haue robbed me of all grace, peace, comfort, happinesse, honour and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, long haue I liued in greuious thraldome, miserably oppressed and streightned on every side, Satan, the world,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14714:15"/> the affections of sin haue plaid the vnmercyfull tyrants ouer me, I haue binwholy at their command, thinking speaking and doing every wicked thinge they haue suggested vnto me, when I would do any good, euill is present with me and aboue me, and I am hedged with such a world of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, that I cannot tell which way to get out. Now Lord helpe me, breake these my bonds, vnloose these cords wherewith I am tyed, free me from this streightnesse, and bring my soule out into a large place. Vndoe the works of of the Divell, restraine his power, destroy his kingdome, and vtterly overthrow the dominion of sinne within me, be thou my Lord and King, and do thou rule over me: let thy word command me, thy Spirit lead me, thy power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me to all subiection vnto thee. Bid me doe what thou pleasest, and make me doe it, forbid me what thou dislikest, and keepe me from doing it, perswade me by faire meanes, and if stubborne force me by fowle, exercise ouer me all the authoritie of a Father, of a Master, of a King, of a God. I submitt me to all and am content by any meanes to be ouer ruled, so I may become a faithfull seruant in thy house, and an obedient subiect of thy kingdome. This my seruice is my freedome, this freedome is my happinesse, and for mee to bee thus free and happie is thine honour. Nowe therefore take vnto thee the glorie of all, and except of my service who hast purchased my libertie: vnto thee O Christ I owe my soule, much more my obedience, I yeeld thee both and all that I haue or can doe, take all, command all, protect, sanctifie, and saue all.</p>

            <p>2 The sinnes and punishment of the Priests who are in the next place particularly questioned as chiefe authors of that ignorance which was among the people: their sinne is, that: <hi>They reiected knowledge and forgot the law of their God:</hi> The latter clause giues vs the meaning of the former: The law that was prescribed vnto the Priests the sonnes of <hi>Levi</hi> is expressed Deut. 33. 10. <hi>[They shall teach Iacob thy iudgements and Israell thy Law]</hi> &amp; yet more fully, Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

To haue the knowledge of Gods will for themselues, that the law of God might be sought at their mouth and knowledge preserved in their lips. 2.

               </hi> i. e. broken <hi>the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Levi;</hi> and transgressed the commaundement which God of old had given to the Priesthood: being guilty of a double fault.</p>
            <p>1. Ignorance that they were not themselues men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, such as were skilful and learned in the vnderstanding of the law able to informe others: but were as the Pharises and Scribes in after times, <hi>Blinde leaders of the blinde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Negligence that they tooke no care in teaching the poore ignorant people according as they were bound by their office: Both these faults are signified vnto vs when the Prophet saith [That <hi>the Priests had reiected knowledge,]</hi> meaning that they were ignorant themselues, and negligent towards others: They had no knowledge for their owne part, or if any, yet they despised to teach it to others. A fault

            </list>
            <p>1. For the nature of it you must knowe that ignorance is a foule blemish of mans nature; a want of that perfection which should be in vs, if matters were now with vs, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God created vs, we were made after gods Image, and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular part of that Image was our knowledge, and the most
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14714:17"/> excellent part of our knowledge was the vnderstanding of all divine matters touching God and goodnes, so farre forth as it was needfull for vs to vnderstand them. Now nature it selfe that hath planted in every one an vnmesurable desire of knowing much, leades vs also to iudge how incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an ornament it is, where it may be attained.</p>
            <p>When wee thinke vpon the infinite knowledge of God, or vpon that excellent measure of knowledge in the Angels and blessed Saints departed, or in <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie, none is so stupid, and dull as not to admire it in them and to wish for the like in himselfe, so farre as he might be cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of it. In which case when we looke backe from them to our selues, who can choose, but hang downe his head for very shame and griefe to see God, and these blessed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inhabiting in so glorious a brightnes and light somnes whilest himselfe dwels in darkenes compassed about with a blacke night of ignorance, errour, and obscuritie: He seeth as much difference betweene himselfe and them, as between him that travailes by the cleare sunne-shine and one that walkes by a candle. Knowledge is like the sunne in the world, or the eie in a mans face: nothing would be more ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and dismall then the world without the light of the sun, nor is any deformity in the face more notable then the want of an eie: And certainely there is nothing more vglie to behold, then that soule which is darkned in its vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through blindnes and ignorance, being destitute of the knowledge of God, of Christ, of grace, of Religion; the knowledge whereof is both light, and life vnto the soule.</p>
            <p>2 In the next place let vs consider the causes of mans ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and they are two, both very bad according as the effect.</p>
            <p>1 The first is <hi>Adams</hi> sinne from whose fall this naturall corruption and weaknes is derived vnto vs. Hee sinned, and we in him: both are punished among other great losses; with the losse of those glorious abilities of our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14714:17"/> part. It had once a power and large capacity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all things both naturall &amp; divine: but at this time a very great weakenes and dimnesse of sight is fallen vpon it in discerning naturall things: and for the knowledge of God and spirituall things it is growne even starke blinde. Hence then is that first bond of ignorance which wee may call <hi>naturall and invincible. Naturall,</hi> because every sonne of <hi>Adam</hi> brings it with him into the world by the course of his generation and birth: forasmuch as every one is borne weake-sighted with this infirmity and disabilitie in his vnderstanding. Therefore in infants there is more then <hi>ignorantia purae negationis:</hi> for being sinnefull, ignorance is a part of their originall corruption, and so tis also, <hi>pravae dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positionis,</hi> they not only know not by reason of age; but are ill disposed to know by reason of the disability of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nature. Againe this ignorance is tearmed <hi>invincible</hi> or vnavoidable, because the naturall man alwaies continues in it, and cannot by his owne strength ever get out of it: but only by the helpe of Gods spirit outwardly affording the the meanes of holy knowledge &amp; inwardly inlightning the minde to vnderstand them aright as the Apostle sheweth.

Our owne sinne <hi>viz:</hi> wilfull rebellion in neglecting and despising all holy meanes of knowledge: when meanes are not they seek not after them, when they be offered, they refuse them, or vse them with al carelesnesse and disrespect: when men winke against the light, closing vp their eies that it may not shine id their hearts: when they will none of wisdomes instructions,<note place="margin">Iob. 21. 14.</note> but stubbornely say to God, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from vs, for we desire not the knowledge of thy waies.</hi> Hence is that other kinde of ignorance which we call, <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> a fouler fault by farre then the former: when men know nothing and yet scorne to learne anie thing: they will not heare, nor conferre, nor read, nor pray, nor vse any meanes to get knowledge, but are content to sit still in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14714:18"/> as the Egyptians were sometimes forced to doe, not stirring one way or other. A miserable condition, but I shall tel you the reason of it: they abide in darknes, because they are loth to see and to be seene. Should they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the light, their manifold deformities and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble corruptions would be discovered by the light of the word to their shame and griefe: they should meete with many reproofes of their lewd courses, many perswasions to piety and obedience: all which they can by no meanes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, it is death to them to heare of their faults, when they are resolved not to amend them: and they will be wilfullie ignorant of that, which being once knowne would often trouble their consciences. This reason of mans wilful affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ignorance, Christ giues, <hi>Ioh. 3. 19. 20. [Light came into the world, and men loved darknes rather then light, because their deedes were evill: for every man that evill doth, hates the light, neither commeth to the light lest his deeds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.]</hi> These are the causes of this ignorance, originall corruption disabling vs to know, actuall stubbornesse and frowardnesse, making vs vnwilling to know: wherefore ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance must needes be ill, that hath so ill causes, where the roote is rottennesse, you can looke for no fruit but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>3. Come we in the third place to the effects of it &amp; you shall see it is evill and hurtfull in that regard also. The fruits of ignorance are two. 1. sinne. 2. punishment.
1. sinne. Ignorance is a sinne it selfe and it is a cause of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinnes: There be mother sinnes and this is one of them, a fruitfull mother not of devotion, as blinde Papists would haue vs belieue, but of iniquitie and impietie. An ignorant man is a wicked man; an ignorant Priest is a wicked Priest, an ignorant people a sinnefull people. Tis plaine by this very chapter. <hi>[There is no truth, nor mercy nor knowledge of God in the land]</hi> saith the prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.

Againe, <hi>[Israell doth not know, my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled th not consider,]</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah. Chapt. 1. v.</hi> 3. what of that they might yet be devout, and holy might they not? No: read the complaint that followes therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ver. 3.

Now an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant person is devoide of grace. So saith the Apostle touching the Gentiles, that they were <hi>[strangers from the life of God through the ignorance that was in them, because of the blindnesse of their harts, Eph. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8.)</hi> that is, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all sauing and quickning power of Gods spirit, they had no grace, no faith, no feare; no loue, no true affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God or any spirituall goodnes; they had neither care nor desire of that they knew not: whence <hi>ver.</hi> 19. followes immediatly their lewd liues in that <hi>[being without sense</hi> (of goodnes) <hi>they gaue themselues vnto wantonnesse, to worke all vncleannes even with greedines.]</hi> For what will not a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ignorant man doe, who knowes not, but he may doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing? He is blinde and cannot choose but stumble at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very blocke, dash himselfe against every post, tumble into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ditch: he is a ship without a Master that runnes at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture with any winde, vpon any rocke or shelfe. It is Christs comparison, <hi>Ioh. 12. 35. [He that walketh, in the darke knoweth not whether he goeth]</hi> and so is an ignorant man, he travels in the night: hee cannot see his way before him, he misseth at every turning, hee must leape hedge and ditch, and yet stil the farther he goeth, the more he wanders.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14714:19"/> No good worke he takes in hand but hee failes strangely in the performance, in everie course of his life hee goeth astraie through his great folly, and before he is aware runnes vpon a thousand snares and temptations, the Divel hath set for to take him. You see then ignorance is an occasion of manie sinnes: but in particular let me giue you warning of two speciall faults that ignorant men vsually runne into. 1 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie in religion whether it be in opinion or practise, for when men take vpon them the profession of religion believing; and practising many things, but are not able to giue an account of their faith, nor tell any sound reason why, vpon what grounds, to what end they do such and such things: can it be expected, but that if these bee strongly sett vpon and put to it indeed, they will be drawne without much adoe to change their minds? We knowe what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of <hi>those silly women, who were alwayes learning, and yet neuer came to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> they were the fittest to become a prey vnto false teachers and decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who <hi>creeping into their houses</hi> &amp; hearts, by cunning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations deluded them, and <hi>led them captiue</hi> to any erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinion or practise. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. 7. Among vs, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in these times wee haue to blame men as well as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for this fault. The intolerable ignorance of most is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient witnesse to all the worlde, that there are not a few whose religion is yet to choose, and for ought they knowe to the contrary, another may be as good as that which they professe for the present, they be Protestants in shew, but they knowe as little what belongs to true religion as they doe of Popery: They bee no more able to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene true religion and false, then an infant betweene the right hand and the left. And therefore if at any time a Priest, or Iesuit, or other cunning Papist set vpon them, they are straight way puzzled and staggered: they haue nothing to answere in defence of their religion, but you shall see them presently fetch't ouer with fine words, and halfe perswaded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14714:19"/> to be of another opinion: yea did not ciuill respects &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniences beate them off from poperie more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knowledge or hatred of such errors as papists main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, there is nothing could keepe them in that case from revolting vnto their side.</p>
            <p>It is a needfull point, my brethren, to be thought on by vs, &amp; that seriously, especially in these evill daies, wherin Satan and his complices doe on all hands assault the Church of God, seeking to swallow her vp. Our brethren abroad are in sore affliction, yet they forsake not their God, lets pitty them, and pray for them, that they may continue faithfull even to the death, for our selues at home, God he knows we are as sinfull a people and haue deserued as sharp a triall as our neighbour: let vs pray still for the life and safetie of our King, the peace of our Church, the welfare of our state, and let each one looke to his owne particular walking in the light, whilst we haue the light getting knowledg and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; faith, &amp; zeale, that we may sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fast in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whatsoeuer danger may betide vs. This of the first fault of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The second followes.</p>
            <p>2 Securitie or senslesnesse in regard of sinne or punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t An ignorant person knowes not what it is to sinne, and therefore dares commit it, hee apprehends not what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments belonge to sinne, and therfore he makes no scruple of them: hee sees no danger before it comes: &amp; so he feares it not: when punishment comes vpon him he knowes not why or from whome it comes, tis with him as with Ephraim, Hos. 7. 9. <hi>[Strangers haue devoured his strength and he knowes it not: yea gray haires are here &amp; there vpon him, yet he knowes not]</hi> many markes of Gods anger are vpon him, yet he knowes &amp; apprehends not by whome, or wherefore he is smitten. You shall haue many a man pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in his estate, vnblest and vnthriuing in all his businesses crost with vngratious and disobedient Children, vext with evill servants and vnfaithfull, troubled with an vnquiet &amp; discontented familie, tormented with vniust suites in law,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14714:20"/> slandered in his good name by false reports raised of him, yea disquieted in his soule with griefes and feares: yet mark this man in all his vexations, &amp; you see him sensible of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but present paines: he thinkes of nothing lesse then of Gods hand and his owne sinne in all this: God smites him for his covetousnesse, vncleanesse, prophanesse, vnbeliefe, Atheisme; with the like notorious sinnes he liues in: but the ignorant wretch never considers of this, nor doth he any iot the more either turne to God that punisheth him, or from his sinnes for which he is punished: he toiles &amp; moiles, rides and runnes vp and downe, tries now this way, then that, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates one, bribes another, after all complaints of his hard fortune and ill successe in all his affaires. And yet see in the middle of all this trouble he sinnes as much as euer he did, he sweares, he drinkes, and consens his neighbour as much as euer, he is as irreligeous as he was before, not any dutie of religion performed by himselfe or with his familie more then at another time? No; he keeps his old wont &amp; ventures on still in his evill courses, hoping that times may change &amp; matters amend one day. If he can but make any shift to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the present smart; that is all that he lookes after. Thus is the condition of many soules, who doe evill, and are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued yet doe evill still: because they be besotted, &amp; haue not the wisedome to see their sinne, or feare their punishment.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the first effect of ignorance <hi>viz</hi> sinne, the second followes.</p>
            <p>2. Punishment: <hi>[my people perish]</hi> which is partly in this life, partly in that which is to come. In this life God often plagues them, and puts them to shame. This was one cause of the captiuitie of the Iewes as it is <hi>Esay. 5. 13. [therefore my people is gone into captiuiy, because they had no knowledge]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They seldome escape here: but hereafter they are sure to smart for it. Ignorance is the highway to hell: and ignorant men, though they cannot choose but wander, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe so farre wide as to misse hell. It is the Apostles sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14714:20"/>
2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 8. Christ shall shew himselfe <hi>[in flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto them who doe not know God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.]</hi> God will be strange to them in that day, who are now strangers vnto him. He will not know them then, who will none of his acquaintance now: they say to him, <hi>depart from vs we will not know thee,</hi> he shall then say to them, <hi>depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, I know you not,</hi> they that know not Gods waies, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into his rest, they liue and die without his feare &amp; out of his fauour. Those that are blind will certainly fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch, as it is <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 14. except God doe in time open their eies, to see the danger and preuent it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These things thus explained, before we come to make application of the point; it will not be amisse in our passage, to touch briefly vpon two questions needfull to be resolved. The first is. </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1 Whether ignorance of a mans dutie, doe in any sort excuse his not doing of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answere in briefe: Ignorance in those things we are bound to know doth not excuse a fault committed by reason of it. The reason is manifest, because one sinne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuse another. Now in this case it is first a sinne not to know our duty, because we were bound to know it: and then it is a sinne not to doe our duty, because we also ought to haue done it. And though wee are so farre from being excused, that we are in a double fault, and deserue double blame, for being ignorant &amp; disobedient; neverthelesse this must be observed; that a sinne committed through simple ignorance is not so great a fault as that which is committed through wilfull ignorance or against knowledge. He that sinnes against his knowledge is a notorious and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offender and deserues severest punishment according to that of Christ. Luk. 12. 47. <hi>[That servant that knew his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters will and prepared not himselfe neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes]</hi> and also that of S. Iames <hi>c. 4. 16. 17. [To him that knoweth how to doe well, and doth it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14714:21"/> not, to him it is sinne</hi>] with a witnesse, a great sinne greatly to be punished. Againe he that sinnes out of willfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, because carelesly and stubbornly he neglects &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes all meanes of knowledg that are afforded him, this mans fault is not a iot lessened but aggrauated by his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor, hath he any excuse in the world for his ill doing, who might if it had pleased him haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way how to haue done better. But now he that sinnes out of simple ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, where there is no froward, scornefull, careles neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of meanes of knowledg, this mans sinne is somewhat lesse then the others, yet tis a sinne still. This is manifest by that of our saviour <hi>Luke. 12. 48. [he that knew it not, yet did commit things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with few stripes]</hi> he shallbe beaten though he did it out of pure igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet but with few stripes, &amp; that because he did it ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly. Soe Paul some what excuseth his pesecution of the Church, because 'twas done out of an ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t zeale: but yet foral that he accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of himselfe as he was, even at that time a very great sinner. <hi>(I was saith he a blasphemer, and a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, and an oppressor: but I was receiued to mercie because I did it ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly through vnbeliefe) 1. Tim.</hi> 13. And in like sort doth the Apostle Peter somewhat qualifie that great sinne of crucifying Christ the Lord of life: wherevnto the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people and many of the rulers ignorantly consented, being misled and ill advised by the priests, Pharisees, &amp; other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious enemies of Christ. <hi>[And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance yee did it, as did also your gouernours]</hi> saith Peter to the Iewes. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 17. Soe much also our Saviour implies in that speech of his to the Pharises, who proudly arrogated to themselues all knowledg <hi>(If yee were blind yee should not haue sinne)</hi> had they indeed been simple and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, their sinne in persecuting Christ, &amp; opposing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, had been much lesse hainous. <hi>(But now yee say, we see, therefore your sinne remaineth)</hi> vnexcusable, vnpardonable whilst against their knowledge, they malitiously despise
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14714:21"/> and his doctrine. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. 41. This of the first question; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening whereof confutes the sillinesse of many ignorant me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who think verily because they haue no knowledg, that God will hold them excused for their good meaning sake.</p>
            <p>The second question is.</p>
            <p>2 What measure of holy knowledg is required of each one?</p>
            <p>For answere herevnto, you must put a difference between mens Abilities, and gifts of nature or grace: &amp; also between mens callings and diverse imployments. For the first, al men are not alike qualified with inward abilities; There is not the same fastnesse of memorie, quicknesse of apprehension, soundnesse of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in one, that is in another, nor haue all the like benefit of outward helps in their education, for the perfecting of such good parts, as nature hath lent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now God deales equally, where he bestows much there he looks for much againe; where he giues little, there he requires but little. He that naturally is slow of witt, dull of conceipte, short of memorie, weake in iudgment, such a one would bee pittied and louingly helped forward so farre in knowledg as his weaknesse will giue leaue. And men shall doe ill to lay heauie burdens on those, to whome God hath giuen but weake shoulders to beare them. But when men can shew witt enough in other matters, and haue all abilities of minde to serue their turne in inferior imployments, to apprehend, discourse, plott and contrriue matters as they list, and yet the same men, be dunses in all religious knowledge, they are inexcu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able, and must answere for their vnthankfulnesse, &amp; misimployment of that talent, he hath giuen vnto them. Thus there is a difference in regard of mens abilities: there is also a difference in respect of mens diverse callings. God doth not require the same measure of honour or knowledg of a lay man, which he doth of a minister, of a plaine man, &amp; of a scholler, of a privat person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of a publike gouernour. Here the rule is <hi>That God requires of every one so much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he may know how in his place to carrie himselfe in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14714:22"/> all wisedome and vnblameablenesse.</hi> He may not come short, nor yet goe beyond his bounds, but duly considering what belonges to his place, he must studie to be throughly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereof, moreouer this must be obserued in generall touching all men, of whatsoever calling or gift: that no man can attaine to any such degree of knowledge, that he should therewith rest himselfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, &amp; seeke no farther; the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest know but in part, &amp; they may know more perfection is to be sought for, but it wil neuer be had in this life, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be stil striuing in the knowledg of God: schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers must studie still, Ministers preach, people must heare still, all must grow richer in this treasure of spirituall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. In a word no man must cease learning, till God giue ouer teaching. And know this that the man, who bewailes his ignorance, &amp; daily searches after knowledge, in the vse of good meanes, he shall gaine this advantage, first the little knowledg which he hath shall doe him much good, &amp; then in due time, his stock shall encrease according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <hi>[to him that hath</hi> (&amp; vseth it well) <hi>shall be giuen</hi> (more) <hi>&amp; he shall haue abundance]</hi> Let thus much suffice to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the vnfolding of the nature of this sinne, Come wee in the last place to make application of all vnto our owne vse.</p>
            <p>1 The first vse shall be for reprehension of ignorant persons, whose fault is here declared to be great, and their condition miserable: which notwithstanding, there are in the world many patrons of this sin, who both in opinion and practise defend this sinne and approue it. I shall name vnto you two sorts of them.</p>
            <p>1 Papists, who make a direct profession of this shamefull sinne: with them the best way for a man to doe his duty is not to know it at all: and no devotion is comparable to that which is blind, nor any service like that which is beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vnreasonable. Let an ignorant Catholike that canne reade never a letter, nor vnderstand scarce a fillable in the Creede, Lords prayer, Ten commandements, or other part
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14714:22"/> of his catechisme, let him yet hold fast by his ghostly fathers sleaue, doe as he bids him, come to Church, and heare Latine service, reade latine prayers, doe he knows not what, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing the Priest commands him, and then they'le warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him cocksure, from falling into the ditch, be he neuer so blind. Let Paul finde fault with zeale without knowledge. <hi>Rom. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2. 3. Tis no matter what he saith, the'ile contradict him to his teeth, and tell vs as they teach their people, that ignorance is the best mother of true Catholike devotion. In which impudencie some haue gone so farre of late daies, as to erect a new order of Friers, whose very rule, &amp; professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ignorance of all things except Christ, and the virgin Mary. It is not possible that all things, should haue come to this passe amongst them, were there not knaverie in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse. But the truth is this, Poperie is one great part of the kingdome of darknesse, and for the support hereof, it was needfull to shutte out the light, for feare of discovering their secret abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. If their deeds were good why doe they hate the light? If their opinions were sound, why are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Scripture? 'Tis selfe guiltinesse breeds those feares and iealousies, and that Atheisticall slander of Gods word, that the Scriptures are obscure, that the reading of the bible will make men hereticks. In short, the best construction we can make of their practises in this kinde is, that they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust Poperie would downe, if people had but knowledge to see their villanies &amp; errors: they see the credite of Priests &amp; Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers would downe, who now be the only admired o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of knowledge among their ignorant people, &amp; which is more, <hi>those slow bellies, and evill beasts,</hi> see 'twould cost them much paines, and toile to bring their people to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, after so long neglect of that course, wherefore they sit still, grow lazie and fat, whilst their people is well enough content to be vntaught, &amp; so to perish in their Ignorance, Idolatry, and Superstition.</p>
            <p>2 Protestants amongst whom we haue a number which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14714:23"/> are papists in their practises, what ever they be in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Among vs many there be that <hi>haue left off to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and doe good</hi> as it is <hi>psal,</hi> 36. 3. men of ill liues, of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant minds, that out of carelesnesse or contempt profit not one iot, either in knowledg or obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Gospel. This is a raigning sinne that spreads farre and wide ouer all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the land, a killing sin that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And if any such heare mee, let them be entreated in the bowels of Christ Iesus, to haue more pittie and compassion on the poore soules, which goe astray, as sheepe which haue no sheepheard. But, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you must know, that this excuse will not serue the turne, neither if ministers wil not teach, we need not learne; No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they will not, seeke where thou maist, and doe not thou throw away thy selfe, because another is careles of thy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14714:23"/> safety. But of all what excuse will they haue, who haue beene borne and bread vp in parishes that haue had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost time out of mind. Here one woulde thinke in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of time &amp; meanes, men might be teachers rather then learners: but 'tis nothing so. Here also shall you meete with hundreds that had need be taught their very <hi>A. B. C.</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion: 'tis no marvaile to see children or young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ignorant, when you shall haue old men 50. 60. yea 80 years old, whose gray haires shew that they haue had time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to learne more witt, yet in case to be set to schoole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for their admirable simplcitie in the knowledg of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They'le scorne to be questioned, but doe but get them in a good moode and talke with them about religion, aske them the meaning of the articles of faith, of the petitions in the Lords prayer, or of other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon points in Catechisme, and marke their answers, you shall see them so shuffle and fumble, speake halfe words, and halfe sentences, so hack and hew at it, that you may almost sweare they speake they know not what of matters out of their eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: though they be the wisest and craftiest headed men in a parish, take them in other matters; yet in these things, you would thinke veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were borne starke naturals and Idiots: they will sometimes shape you such strange, absurd, and vnexpected answers to your questions that when a man cannot choose but pitty them, he hath much a doe to forbeare laughing at them. Let me tell a story that I haue heard from a reverend man out of the pulpit, a place where none should dare to tell a lie; of an old man aboue sixty, who liued and died in a parish, where there had beene preaching almost all his time, &amp; for the greatest part twice on the Lordes day, besides at extraordinarie times. This man was a constant hearer as any might be, &amp; seemed forward in the loue of the word; on his death bed being questioned by a minister, touching his faith and hope in God: you will wonder to heare what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere he made: being demanded, what he thought of God,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14714:24"/> he answeres that he was a good old man: &amp; what of Christ, that he was a towardly young youth: and of his soule, that it was a great bone in his bodie, &amp; what should become of his soule after he was dead, that if he had done wel he should bee put into a pleasant greene meddow. These answeres astonished those that were present to thinke how it were possible, for a man of good vnderstanding, and one that in his daies, had heard by the least two or three thousand ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, yet on his death bed in serious manner thus to deliuer his opinion in such maine points of religion, which infants and sucklings should not be ignorant of. But, my brethren, be assured this man is not alone, there be many hundreds in his case, who come to Church and heare much, happily a hundred sermons and a halfe in a yeare: yet at yeares end, are as much the better for al, as the pillers of the Church against which they leane, or the pewes wherein they sit. A matter greatly to be lamented, and sharpely reproued, that wise men, politicke men, graue men, great men, rich men, men that carrie the name of Christians, should yet be such very children in all godly knowledg. Wherefore in the next place let this be for exhortation.</p>

But happily I speake to them that heare me not: wherefore the next exhortation is.</p>
            <p>2 To people, that they would take notice in themselues of this foule sinne to amend it. Some men are ignorant of this like men in the dark, thinking themselues faire, because they see not their owne deformities; Come now then into the light; looke on thy selfe, see what an ignorant wretch thou art, bewaile it, repent of it, amend it. Be ashamed in your selues, of that which you are ashamed of, when any man takes notice of it, blush at your ignorance, and heare what the spirit of God saith to you, <hi>Pro. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

(How long ye simple ones will ye loue simplicitie &amp;c.)</hi> If a man cal you fooles and simple persons, you'le be angry with him, now God calls you so, be angry with your selues, be ashamed of your selues that God should stil call you simple, scornful, foolish, because ignorant, disobedient men. Say now in thine owne heart, how foolish, how brutish haue I beene? how like a beast, nay how much worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a beast haue I liued? <hi>The oxe knoweth his owner, the asse his masters crib, but I haue not knowne or considered ought;</hi> surely I haue not in mee the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of man: what folly and simplicitie is this in me, to know any thing, but what I should know, God and his goodnesse, my selfe and my dutie? How many sermons haue I heard in vaine? how often haue I discouraged my minister making him weepe and sigh in secret to see so little fruit of his ministerie. Ignorant I was when he first came to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, &amp; now after many yeares am ignorant still. I see young men yea little Children can giue a better reason, yea answer more soundly to points of Catechisme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I can. Think thus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14714:25"/> with thy selfe, and then grow into resolution to take a new course, begin to doe that which is never too late to be done, to know God, and which waies thou maist worship and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, resolue to take all opportunities, to spare as many houres as thou canst for the purchasing of this heavenly wisedome. And least that here also thou shouldst plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: that thou wouldst get knowledge if thou knewest which way, hearken a little to some directions. The meanes whereby knowledge will be gotten are these.</p>
            <p>1 Hearing the word of God preached: this is the chiefe meanes wherevnto you must giue all diligent heede, God hath appointed it for this end, to the instruction of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and it goes accompanied with his speciall blessings to that purpose. Wherefore sit not at home, lie not a bed, when thou shouldst be at Church: Come and come often, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the Lords day, and in the weeke too when occasion serues; spare an houre for a sermon as wel as two for a play, or a feast, idle chatting, or doing nothing. When thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest to Church, come with a mind to learne, set thy selfe in good earnest to heede the Preacher, marke what doctrine he delivers, how he proues, how he applies it. Keepe the point he speakes of in thy memorie as he goes along, and if thou be short witted, helpe thy selfe with thy pen; gaze not, sleep not, talke not, thinke not of this and that businesse, fixe thy eies vpon the Preacher, and thy thoughts vpon his words, and be sure so to carrie the matter that something may bee gotten by an houres discourse. But there is another thing to be thought on in the second place and that is.</p>
            <p>2 Meditation, a duty every way necessary after hearing: men thinke they haue done enough, if they sit out the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and hearken attentiuely whilst the preacher is in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: but as soone as the preacher hath done, they haue done too: they neither thinke, nor speake more of it, every man sortes himselfe with his friend and companion, and then in Church or Church-yard, or as they goe home, an hundred
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14714:25"/> idle questions be asked and answered about this man, and that, this busines, and that, this bargaine, or that, but not a worde touching any thing they heard at Church: so that by the time they come home, the soules of the aire haue picked vp all the seede, that laye scattered, and carelesly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the Sermon is quite fled and gone from their minds. Come to them and clappe them on the shoulders, and saie now for a wager where was the Preachers text, what remember you of the points hee discoursed of; they can tell you no more what hee saide, then the man in the moone. My brethren, I beseech you take notice of this fault, and thinke of it, as that maine cause, why there is soe much preaching and hearing, and yet People doe still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as ignorant, as wicked as euer. Here's the cause, the Preacher doth his part, they wil not do theirs, they heare the Sermon at Church and there they leaue it, but never carrie home any thing to make it their owne by often meditating on it. Wherfore remember henceforth that a Sermon is but halfe heard, that is only heard from the preachers mouth. The greatest part is yet behinde to be performed by thy selfe at home. Goe home then, thinke of it as thou art in the way, thinke of it when thou art in thine house: take time to recall things to minde, do it with thy familie, do it with thy selfe; in thy closet, vpon thy bed, say such a sin was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to day, am I, haue I bene guiltie of it? Such a dutie was vrged vpon me, doe I practise it or no? such a grace was commended vnto me, haue I such a grace? such a rule was prescribed me, doe I follow it or not? If men would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to make triall of this course, thus to digest what they heare, they should finde (as others haue done) a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full increase of sauing knowledge in a shorte time, whereas now they thriue not a iot, by their daily hearing many yeares together.</p>
            <p>3. Conference with those that are able to giue vs resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in difficult cases: or with those that desire it from vs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14714:26"/> A point wherein men are generally defectiue. Obserue all the discourse of men when they meete together, not the hundred parte is touching religion: you shall haue a table sometimes furnished with as choice men as meates, men of learning, iudgment, and experience in all kinds, able much to benefit others that are present, by seasonable and fitting discourse. Yet tis strange to see two or three howers eaten vp, and nothing spoken to any purpose, for which a man may say when he is gone, that he hath bene the better for their company. As for ordinarie meetings, 'tis so that it is scarce good manners, to moue a question of divinitie, for feare of marring all the mirth, if you doe, you are like to answer your selfe to your owne question, they are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mute as fishes, and haue not a word to say. A great dinn there was before and much chat: but such a question is like a stone hurld in among a companie of frogs, that make a fowle noise, but vpon the fall thereof they are straight as still as may be. This is a fault, but not the greatest in this kinde: we will not restraine conference to tables; there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, that are happily more fit, the ministers house, the learned mans studie, hither people should resort to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and be resolued in points of knowledge, and practises that doe concerne them. But how long shall a Minister sit in his studie, before any of his parish wil trouble him about any such matters. Lawyers &amp; Phisitians are thronged with clients and patients at all houres, day and night, for aduise about matters of body and estate: but who knockes at the ministers doores calling for his helpe for their soules; S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> tell me how shall I vnderstand such a place of Scripture, make me to conceiue such a point of Diuinitie, advise me how shall I get such a grace, avoyde such a sinne; such a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what were I best to doe in such a case of conscience. Ministers I am sure complaine much of the backwardnesse of people in this point, not that they loue to be sought to, or look for a fee, but because they seeke their peoples good,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14714:26"/> and would gladly take all opportunities, to encrease know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in them, whose ignorance they cannot but pittie and commiserate. Wherfore my brethren, learne a point of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to take notice of all doubts, and when in reading or hearing thou meetest with any thing thou vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lest not, keepe it in minde till thou mayst haue a fit occasion to get a resolution. Where ever thou commest be not ashamed to minister occasion of good discourses, that others may be the better for thee, and thou for them before yee part.</p>
            <p>4 Priuate reading of the Scriptures, and other bookes tending to Godly instructions. A course if duelie obserued that would bring a great deale of knowledge, especially in this our age, where the presse is as fruitfull in good bookes as the pulpit is of good Sermons. No booke of Scripture but you haue the exposition of some learned man vpon it, no point of divinity, but you shall finde it largely &amp; plainly handled in some treatise or other. A great blessing to this age, if men would be wise to make vse of it, but the trueth is, men haue as little regard of printing as they haue of preaching. Looke to the ordinarie sort of people; they doe not reade scarce one Chapter of the bible in a weeke, I may say in a yeare, so ignorant, that they can hardly finde the booke whence the preacher takes his text, or how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish betweene Apocrypha and Canonicall Scripture. How many are there of good sort &amp; fashion that haue read much, and many great volumes, which yet cannot say at eighty years old, that in al their life they haue read ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the Bible. A booke that is none of the biggest, but is of all the best. What can we pretend for this monstrous negligence? canst thou not reade? blame thy freinds and parents for the time thou wast a Childe; since that blame thy owne folly. Any one may learne to reade, that hath wit to learne any thing. But thou hast no money to buy bookes: what? hast thou mony to spend in a taverne, to play away at Cardes &amp; Dice, to buy lace and needlesse superfluities of apparell, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14714:27"/> hast thou not monie to buy a Bible; or any other good Booke? for shame say not so. But I haue no time to read; for any thing else time enough, to doe nothing, to lie a bed till noone, to sit two or three houres at dinner or supper, to goe to such a friend and there spend halfe a day, to such a freind and there spend another, to doe any chare that comes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily. Away with those excuses; 'tis certaine, my brethren, there is no calling be it of never so much employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of twenty foure hours, they may if they list spare two at the least for religious imployments: yea more if they bee wise and thriftie of their time. But I cannot buy all bookes, nor read all; nor would any man haue thee doe so: but buy some, read some, canst thou not tell which are best and most profitable? then aske counsell of the skilfull, that are able to advise thee. But learning is a hard matter, and 'tis not for plaine folke to vnderstand the Bible. No; is it not? Then God is too blame that hath written a word for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all, which yet none but schollers should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand: but know this is nothing but an excuse for thy sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, learning is hard, because thou art vnwilling to learn: otherwise the spirit of God hath testified that knowledge is plaine, and easie to him that will vnderstand. And doe but trie, taking but that paines in the studie of religion, which thou doest in many needlesse imployments: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shall tell thee, that wisedome is to be found of all that doe seeke her. And yet my brethren because the well is deepe, and you may plead, that you haue not wherewith to draw: let mee tell you in the last place of one meanes more to get knowledge, which blesseth all the forenamed helpes, and that is.</p>
            <p>5 Prayers vnto God, that he would giue thee an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing heart, to know the mysteries of salvation, that he would open thine eies, to see the wonders of his law. That light which is in thee must come downe from the father of lights, and vnlesse still thou meane to sit in darknesse, thou
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14714:27"/> must haue recourse vnto God, praying him that he would <hi>shine into thy hart to giue thee the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ.</hi> And remember this that he who seeks for the knowledge of matters of religion, by the strength of his owne wit and other naturall parts, without humble and faithfull supplications for Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this behalfe; such a man is in danger to be misled into manie erroneous and hereticall opinions: for if in any thing, much more in the matters of religion is that most true: he that is a scholler vnto his owne reason, hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelie a foole to his master. Wherefore we are to put on an humble and sober minde, intreating his direction, &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our reason to his wisedome.</p>
            <p>Now my brethren doe these things and prosper, haue an eare open to heare the word, a heart readie to meditate on it, a tongue seasonablie to talke of it, an eie diligent to read it, and with all these ioine heartie praier, that thou maiest vnderstand it aright; and then be thriving and succesfull in holie knowledge: though thy tallent be as yet but small; yet follow this course, and after a verie little paines and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, thou shalt see for certaine, that this traffique will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thee ten for one, even a large increase of all spirituall knowledge. The gaine whereof shall bring much glorie, to that thy heavenlie master that set thee on worke, and to thee his good and faithfull servant, a bountifull rewarde for thy labour.</p>

               </gap>cution of their office: but they differ, in that <hi>Moses</hi> is but a seruant in the house of God, Christ is the sonne, <hi>Moses</hi> gouerned as a delegated officer, Christ rules as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord of the Church, the house which himselfe hath built, hauing purchased it with his blood, rear'd it vp with his spirit, preseruing it by his power, therefore he is justly Lord of it as of his owne, and so he hath the preheminence aboue Moses. The Church vnder Moses and vnder Christ, what ever difference there be in other matters, yet in this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14714:29"/> they are in one, and the same condition, that as there reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was required vnto Moses, so now obedience is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto Christ. It was to no purpose for the Iewes to plead they were Moses disciples, the peculiar people of God, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen of him, graced by him with so many favours, if yet in the meane time they hardened their heartes, and would not heare Gods voice; but provoked him by their Idolatries, murmurings, &amp; other disobediences, tempted him through Infidelitie, and despised his word, and marveilous wonders wrought among them. In this case no priuiledge coulde helpe them, they shall surelie smart for their disobedience, and if God may bee believed vpon his oath they haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased him so much, that they shal never enter into his rest. The verie same thing the Apostle applies vnto Christians, they are the Church of Christ, members of the bodie of Christ, partakers of his benefits, and graces, but it is vpon this condition that they shew themselues faithfull in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the gospell of Christ, <hi>[His house we are (saith the Apostle, ver. 6.) if we hold fast the confidence of reioycing of the hope firme vnto the end]</hi> perseverance and faithfulnesse is that which makes men true members of the Church of Christ, whether Iewish, or Christian: If the Iewes be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and rebellious, they come shorte of the land of Canaan in the type and substance too; If the Christians be like them in their sin, their punishment is the same, &amp; they are excluded also from the heavenly rest of the people of God. Wherefore the Apostle in the next Chapter presseth this exhortation vehemently. That these Hebrews to whom hee writes should carefullie looke to themselues, that they were not as their Fathers of old, vnfaithfull and disobedient in their profession thereof, least they become also like to their Fathers deprived of all benefit from promise in Christ. <hi>Take heede therefore Brethren</hi> (saith he) <hi>that there be not, &amp;c.</hi> This is the occasion.</p>

            <p>Infidelitie is that which keepes men from entring into the Church of God, and it is that which throwes them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine when they are entred. The Iewes to whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle writes, some of them had resisted the Gospell, and put it from them by vnbeliefe, others had embraced it, whom the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14714:30"/> Apostle here calls brethren, and before, <hi>ver. 1. Holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling</hi> in charitie, so stiling them, who in visible profession had received and followed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the gospell. These the Apostle exhorts to sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and faithfulnesse, warning them to take heede, that there be not a Canker at the roote, that would in time destroy the whole tree with his fruits, namelie, an vnbelieving heart that woulde in time destroy the whole tree with his fruits, that would in time make them Apostataes from the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, which for the present they professed.</p>
            <p>The doctrine then is plainely afforded by the text; wee shall endeavour to make it plaine vnto you, 1. by expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tearmes of it. 2. by shewing the reason why one followes of another.</p>
            <p>1 By Apostasie [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] for the worde is meant a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting or going away from that which we formerly stood to, and followed: for the matter, we vnderstand hereby in short, the forsaking of true religion in the doctrine of it, or in the practise: for it must be noted that men become back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders from religion two waies.</p>
            <p>1 By leaving the trueth of doctrine and giving heede to lies, contrarie to what is revealed in the word: when men fall into Atheisme, and make a jest of religion: or runne to Iudaisme from the Gospell to the Law; a point, wherein the Hebrewes were apt to be seduced by false teachers zealous of the Law, or when men slip into any Heresie overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faith, or those that cannot rellish the water of life, but drinke deepe of the wine of fornication the impoysoned doctrine of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> such forsake the fellowship of the Saints, goe from God and his Church, leape out of the Arke into perdition.</p>
            <p>2 By leaving the practise of religion, and godlines, when men professe their assent vnto the trueth of the Articles of Faith, and so retaine the forme of godlinesse, but denie the power of it, being disobedient and wicked in their liues,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14714:30"/> when men keepe their faith and haue lost their conscience; They could sometimes haue saide and haue done too, but now they can talke, heare &amp; study about religion: But while their eares, tongues, and braines are busied, their hearts and their hands are idle. Both these are Apostates from God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually &amp; alike, there is not the dust of the ballance to boot betweene the worth of a true belieuer, and a false belieuer if both be wicked liuers. An honest Infidell will hold weight with a wicked Christian. And a sober Papist is as good as a drunken Protestant; nay better, Inasmuch as it is better to glorifie God what way soeuer though in a false faith, then to dishonour his holy name wherewith we are called by an vnholy conversation, yea so foule a corruption of so holy a profession must needs much more shame his life, making it ten times more odious to others and damnable in it selfe. Wherefore Heresie in opinions and wickednesse in practise, both fall vnder this tearme of Apostasie from religion. And as he hath no religion at all that denieth the verity of divine Doctrine, so, he hath no religion to any purpose that holds the truth, but denieth obedience to it. For what saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iames <hi>[If any among you seemeth to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his owne heart this mans religion is in vaine.</hi> Iam. 1. 26.] Hee reades vs a lesson in the next words, which men in his time, and likewise now will hardly learne, <hi>viz.</hi> That true religion stands in the practise of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, as well as profession of divine trueths <hi>[pure religion and vndefiled before God and the Father is this, to visite the fatherlesse &amp; widdow in their afflictions, and to keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world ver. 27.]</hi> Wherfore they are Apostates from religion that relinquish either the doctrine or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of religion.</p>
            <p>This of the first tearme, in the next place by Infidelity or vnbeliefe, we meane a withdrawing of our hearts from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting wholly vpon the trueth of Gods worde; nowe in the worde two thinges are proposed vnto vs to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:14714:31"/>
1 All manner of doctrines or Articles of religion to bee firmely believed and mainetained, against all Heresies and false doctrines.</p>
            <p>2 All sorts of Commandements, threatnings, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses tending to the direction of our practise, which we are to belieue and embrace against all counsels, terrors, or allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes whatsoever, tending to draw vs from obedience in our liues. Both these are the obiects of true faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men yeeld assent vnto all doctrines, commandements, threatnings, promises of God, not only as true and good in themselues, but as better and truer then any thing in the world that can be set against them, whence in all perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto errour, in al temptation vnto vice, true faith resting it selfe on the word of God winnes the victorie, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the world: But where this is wanting, an easie way is left to all Heresies, and impietie, &amp;c. Thus for the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the tearmes of this proposition: let vs see</p>
            <p>2 The connexion of them together, how Apostasie springs from Infidelity: The reason is, because there is no other grace, that hath the proper office and power, to vphold a man in the constant embracing of all holy dueties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practise of all good workes, but only faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where that is not, men must needes fall away from both.</p>
            <p>That such is the force and vse of true faith, you shall see by considering the obiects of it.</p>
            <p>1 All divine trueths to be held and professed in matter of Religion, which are aboue our naturall and corrupt reason; and therefore vnlesse our vnderstanding bee by a true faith captivated vnto the obedience of Christ, that we can resigne vp our owne wits to be ruled by Gods wisedome, and rest our selues only vpon the true word of God, it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ever we should finde sure footing, where, and in what certaine trueth to rest our selues, but shall alwaies bee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14714:31"/> as those Children spoken of, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14. of weake and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled mindes, easily perswaded to belieue any thing, being like small barkes without sufficient balance, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>tossed vp and downe</hi> vpon the waues like a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>driven this way and that way with every winde of false Doctrine,</hi> raised vp by our owne foolish fancies, or by the device and <hi>craftinesse of men lying in wait to delude vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 All commaundements of God touching our holy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, together with all the threatnings, if we doe not obey, and promises if we doe. Now these things are partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our corrupt nature and vile affections, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subiect themselues to Gods law, partly they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach and desire of our sensual and worldly minds which see no great matter to be loved and feared, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God threatneth or promiseth. Gods law is holy but we are not so, Gods promises are spirituall, but we are carnall, led by sensuality, placing our affections on things that are in present view, and therefore naturally everie man from the wombe is adverse, and backeward from doing that which God commandeth, or believing what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth or threatneth. Now then what can vphold a man in his obedience to Gods law, and dependance vpon Gods promises? It is only a true faith, which apprehending true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the authority and high soveraignety which God hath in commanding vs, and together therewith beholding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent holynesse and goodnesse of his commandements, makes the heart stoope vnto obedience, be it neuer so irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vnto it selfe. Againe when faith apprehendes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutablenesse of God in his word, when it seeth the pretious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the promises of mercie with their certainety, when it seeth the terriblenesse of its threates togither with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoideable accomplishment of them vpon obstinate men. Here nowe the heart rests it selfe as on an anchor sure and stedfast: it is filled with a constant feare to offend, because it knowes punishment is not to be escaped, it is filled with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14714:32"/> continuall ioye in its obedience, because it abides assured of the rewarde. But where this support of faith is wanting, all obedience presently falls to pieces, then if God command or forbid vs any thing, we beginne to take advise whether it be good to obey yea, or no, we fall to aske councell of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, of our selues, of other men as bad as our selues. If they say no, there is our resolution too, God must looke him out other servants; we are not for his turne. If Sathan tempt vs strongly, if our affections rage when they are crossed, if men frowne or fawne vpon vs, we are quickely turned out of the way, and our purposes of obedience, are all dasht in a moment. Let God and his Ministers threaten never so much, we then thinke within our selues that threatned men liue longest, &amp; such angrie words breake no bones, let God promise neuer so faire, we can beginne to smile secretly in our hearts, and thinke they are but faire words, that make none but fooles faine. Indeede if the worlde threaten or promise, wee thinke there is something in an arme of flesh that may doe vs hurt or good; but when faith is fled cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine close Atheisticall imaginations beginne to fasten vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the minde concerning God and religion, as if religion were but a pretty politicke complement, &amp; that God is one who will doe neither good nor evill, and that we haue no great cause to feare or trust him. We see then my brethren, how plaine a downfall there is from Infidelity to Apostasie, from God and all goodnes: when men want faith by the light whereof their blinde reason might be guided, by the power whereof their disordered hearts might bee kept in compasse, they straight runne madly into all wicked opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and mischievous practises. Most true is that of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 1. ver. 8. <hi>[A double minded man is vnstable in all his waies.]</hi> A double minded man, that is, an vnbelieving person, whose faith and opinion stands vpon tearmes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie &amp; probabilitie, hee is in <hi>vtram<expan>

               </gap>) like a man that standes vpon one legge, easily overturned, like a bowle on a smooth table, that's pushed aside with the least touch of a finger; whereas the true believer founded and stablished in the faith is <hi>one of those living stones,</hi> which <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> speaketh of, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. which are squared and surely placed vpon the foundation, therevpon resting vnmoueable.</p>

My trust is this exhortation will not be sleighted by you, if you will a little consider seriously
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14714:33"/> of these motiues, that may stirre you vp to this diligent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will name but two things, which the Apostle also in this place giues vs notice of.</p>
            <p>1 The easinesse to fall into this evill of vnbeliefe and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie: the Apostle in this and the next chapter is very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in admonishing the hebrews of this danger. And good reason, seeing it is a matter not easily heeded without good forewarning. Wee easilie deceiue our selues in this matter through the wickednesse and guile of our owne hearts, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times vainely imagining our hearts to be good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when indeede they be evill hearts of vnbeliefe. This is a peece of cunning which they are not to learne: <hi>viz.</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile vs with counterfeit graces insteede of currant. But that which deceiues men chiefly in this businesse, is this; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we liue in one common societie of the church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee dreame of a communitie of faith and salvation. What meane else those carelesse thoughts and speeches of many? I thanke God I haue a strong faith and haue had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; I am a Christian, a Protestant baptized, and bred vp in the true faith of Christ Iesus, I frequent good exercises, I liue as most men doe, &amp;c: whence they thinke this is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and that now there is no danger of miscarrying. Men take vp their religion as they doe fashions, what most men haue they must haue also; most men speake well of religion, great men countenance it, a religious King loues &amp; defends it, and it is the fashion to be a Protestant, and therefore they will be so, lest they be singular: As vertues be not disliked when they grow common (which is seldome) men will seeme at least to loue them. My Brethren, wee abhorr Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and yet can be content to doe as Papists doe; <hi>viz:</hi> to take vp our religion vpon trust. If it be not so, whence then is the ignorance, the vngodlinesse of so many in our Churches; multitudes there be of men, who knowe not but that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religion may be as good as that which they professe, and for ought themselues or any body else can tell, be as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14714:33"/> ready to leaue as to keepe what they haue. Our adversaryes see this, and stick not to triumph at this our weaknesse, that wee may haue Churches full of people, but empty of sound Protestants: They will tell vs in their bookes, that a great part that are on our sides, haue no other motiues to hold them here, but only because they haue bin so borne and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edd, and receiued their religion as they do their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by descent and custome of the Country; men whom decrees of Parliament and feare of lawes keepe with vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any certaine knowledge of the truth of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the Scripture. It is a shame that wee are not able to confute such shamefull imputations. To say it is worse, with our adversaries, whose chiefe policy to keepe simple soules within the pale of their Church is ignorance, and feare of the Inquisition, this may stop their mouthes, but it helps not vs, we may see and pitty the miserable estate of most, who if they be examined by a Minister touching their faith, will make him blush and blesse himselfe to see their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; But if such fall into the hand of a Priest or Iesuite to try them a litle, they will soone streine at their religion. Is it not strange that they should be men that professe it, and that forwardly too sometimes, who yet are not able to maintaine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? How soone thinke you will such blasts as these be shaken, with every blast and torne vp out of our Church, when they haue taken no deeper roote in the faith; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if temporall respects should meete together with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall arguments, and turne them aside from the puritie of the Gospell. But these are not all that deceiue themselues: not onely ignorant persons, but those that haue knowledge and liue vngodly, runne into the same errors, and danger, men that are lyars, swearers, adulterers, oppressors, volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous persons, yea scoffers at true piety will be accounted men that loue religion, and such as will stand to defend it if neede be. But they are not aware that there is in them an evill heart that wil deceiue them: may we thinke that such
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14714:34"/> men whose end is to liue loosely will much deliberate in what religion to doe it? vn lesse they thinke the name of a Protestant will be enough to saue a libertine, what availes it whether they beleiue well or ill, when they are resolued to liue wickedly. Such ignorant and vitious persons as these
(and these take vp a great parte of our Companyes) such as these they be that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unne vpon religion at all adventures taking that which is next before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, never labouring after that faith &amp; knowledg which should be able to endure the tryall. So easy a matter is it for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liue in a true Church to fall into the errors of the Iewes <hi>Luk 3. 8. (wee haue Abraham to our father)</hi> and therefore we must needs doe well, and God must even doe miracles, and make men of stones if any be saued but they; so now wee liue in a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, purged with doctrine and discipline, blest with religious Princes, with faithfull Ministers, with peace in the dayes of others troubles, and with miraculous deliverances: And be these priviledges enough to winne our loue to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and our constancy in the defending of it? Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> truly they be, if well vsed, and let them perish for euer that would seeke to rob vs of so great blessings by any malitious forces or crafts.</p>
            <p>But my Brethren, externall priviledges must not deceiue vs, wee must looke euery one to himselfe that we be not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed persons in a reformed Church, ignorant in so great light of doctrine, disordered vnder goodnes of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, men disobedient to Prince and Priest, luxurious in our peace, secure and vnthankfull after our deliuerances. If wee be so, all is not well with vs, whatsoeuer we may boast and imagine: there is a roote of bitternesse within our vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiuing hearts, which in time will spring vp into the gall and wormewood of Apostasy from God and his Gospell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the first motiue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2 motiue to make vs heedfull, is the great evill and danger of Apostasy and infidelity. An vnbeleiuing heart is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14714:34"/> an evill heart, a sinfull and wicked heart, a heart vnteachable and vntractable, the word works not on it, mercy cannot perswade it, judgements cannot breake it, all meanes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour are in vaine applyed to make it yeeld: as we haue a sufficient example of the Iewes alleadged in this Chapter, with whom Gods word, and great works prevayled no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because of their vnbeleife. Thus it is evill in it selfe, it is evill also in its effects, because it breeds a forsaking of God, the very worst of all evills in the world which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e amplifies calling it <hi>Apostasy, a departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the living God.</hi> This attribute compriseth all the rest, &amp; more to vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the rest, not only what God is in himselfe, but what he is vnto the creatures, namely the author of their life &amp; being, &amp; so the fountain of their happynesse and welfare. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that forsakes God, leaues the wellspring of liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to drinke puddle out of a broken Cisterne, he leaues the Sunne to warme himselfe at a candle, and departs from life, to goe into death: God is truth and light, and they that goe from him runne into darkenesse and error, in him only is peace and happinesse, without him there's nothing but woe and misery: <hi>[They forsake their owne mercy, that trust in lying vanities] Ionah.</hi> 3. 8. being taught by his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; he that flyes away from Gods presence to goe to Tharsis, thinking there to be in safety he shalbe deceiued in his expectation, the windes will not blow fauorably vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a runagate, the seas will not brooke the shippe that beares him, safety he finds none, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we least looked for it in the belly of a fish, and that neither vntil he had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto God, whom he had forsaken, by prayer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of obedience. Men and Angels and all creatures are but lying vanityes deceiuing the hope of them that seeke vnto them for helpe, when their ayde is only sought after and God forsaken, they then leade vs into sinne and misery, and there leaue vs. Wherefore miserable is the case of Apostates, who turne their backes to religion and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14714:35"/> of life, in as much as these things cannot be left, but God must be forsaken too. There is indeede an imagination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that God will be a friend vnto them in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and in all practises whatsoeuer. But this is but a Turkish dreame; No, he that departs from faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, departs also from the liuing God. And whosoeuer so forsakes God, let him also be sure God will forsake him, then which no greater miserie can betide a creature.</p>
            <p>You see, <hi>Beloued,</hi> what iust cause we haue to enforce this exhortation vpon our selues. <hi>Take heede &amp;c.</hi> It is easie yet most dangerous to be deceiued herein, wherefore now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke your selues, try your hearts in an vnpartiall exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them, whether they be sound in the faith yea, or no; now that yee may not wander in this search, fasten your meditations vpon these two particulars. 1. Looke to thy knowledge, see vpon what grounds thy faith in God and profession in religion is built. Stands thy faith in the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of men, &amp; beleiuest thou because of their saying? is it founded vpon the custome of the countrie, &amp; of thine owne education, vpon the authoritie of lawes and good liking of men that establish and maintaine the religion thou profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest: if this be the ground worke of thy faith, thou buildest vpon the sand. Hast thou no sound knowledge of religion thy selfe? Art thou vnable to iustifie thy faith by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Is not thy conscience convinced by sure proofe that the religion which thou professest is the very truth of God? If so, know then for a certaine that there is an euill heart within thee, that will betray thee to Apostasie in the time of trouble. Shall a man thinke thou wilt stand to that which thou knowest not throughly: when arguments, threatnings, persuasions, and faire promises shall assault thee? Will such sleight imaginations as these endure the stake when all that thou canst say for thy selfe is, I thinke so, men say so, I haue beene taught so, by such and such Ministers, other men are of that opinion, I neuer heard to the contrarie? And wil such
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14714:35"/> slender, and ill grounded conceites as these in matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion vphold thy heart in a constant resolution to stand for the maintenance of the faith? will these arme thee with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage against the point of the sword, the heate of the fire, the teeth of the beast, the force of torments, losse of friends, of country, of life for Christs sake? Be assured that if thy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rest vpon such propps as these, that it will fall vpon the dust, when peace, credit, and other temporall respects which are now the maine vndersetters of it, shalbe remoued, and the whole weight of it shall leane vpon such a broken reede.</p>
            <p>2 Looke to thy practice, whereby thou shalt best disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what thy heart is. Is the practice of thy religion entire, faire, vniuersal, equally respecting all the commandements, so that thou studiest to thy power to walke before God in vprightnesse, and to please him in all things? Art thou the same man in priuate, that thou art in publike, in thy closet and in thy parlour, in the Church, and in the market, in thy life and in the pulpit? Is thy carriage even and smooth, doe thy holines towards God, thy righteousnesse towards men, thy sobrietie towards thy selfe keepe pace together, &amp; goe hand in hand? Art thou a faithfull Minister, a iust Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, an honest tradesman as well as thou pretendest to be a Christian? If thou canst say yea, &amp; that truly, there's hope of such a one, that what ever may befall him, he will not start back nor deale vnfaithfully in the covenant he hath made with God, but that his faithfulnesse and vprightnesse shal preserue him from backsliding. But, Beloued, if ye serue God with reservations and secret dispensations, picking and choosing according as it fits your owne humonrs, doing this thing, disobeying that; If ye trust God in some promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, mistrust him in others, feare him in some threatnings, despise him in others, then know, all is not well within; for there is within an evill heart of vnbeleife, and religion will gaine but litle credit, by your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie in the professing of it.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14714:36"/> He that shuffles and cutts and choakes his conscience by shifts of wit, stifles in him the good motions of grace, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth in him some wicked affection or other, and liues in the practice of some secret abomination: He that can stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at a straw, and leape ouer a block, straine at a ceremony and neglect the substance of righteousnesse, and iudgment, and the feare of God, he that is forward in such maters as gaine applause, making the shew of his religion his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the meane time where there's no notice taken of him, he liues loosely, intemperatly, and vnconscionably: Let not such a one deceiue himselfe, it is certaine his heart is naught and vnfaithfull, and when God &amp; his religion haue most neede of him such a false friend will faile them both. He that hath already denied the power of Godlinesse, will it be any wonder if afterwards he deny the forme of it? one sinne liued in without repentance is enough to pull a man to hell, and will it not be enough to poperie, or any other heresie? He that will not leaue his sin for his religions sake, will easily be perswaded to leaue his religion for his sinnes sake; he that will not at Gods commande or intreaty be brought in any hand to put to death the body of sinne, to relinquish any of his pleasing and profitable lusts, &amp; lewd practices, is this man in case to put to death himselfe in the defence of Gods truth, for loue thereof to forsake the world and himselfe too, to part with so much that could not part with so little? He that is already a secret enemy to religion and devotion, will in time proue an open pesecutor of both. He that can despise and in heart deride a protestant minister is in faire forwardnesse to like well of a Popish Priest. In a word he that hath bid farewell to pietie to day, it is an even lay but he may bee driuen to take leaue of his religion to morrow. When once the conscience can swallow downe wicked practises, it will soone digest wicked opinions: when once the ship leakes, the lading is in danger both to sinke or swimme together, neither is it possible that a pure
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14714:36"/> faith can be preserued in an impure conscience.</p>
            <p>Now (my Brethren) let every one of vs cause our hearts to passe vnder this triall &amp; censure, and so we shall see what we haue to trust to, &amp; what religion hath to trust to vs. Let vs goe vpon sure grounds, care we that our knowledge of religion be distinct, and certaine, that our practice of it bee sincere, free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hypocrisie, &amp; so we shal giue good proofe of our faithfulnesse for the present, and our perseuerance for the time to come. Be not slack to goe about this search, and be sure to doe it throughly, delaies are dangerous when the the disease is mortall, and to cure by halfes is not to cure at al. Secret infidelity is like hereditary diseases, or like bruises taken in youth if they be not looked to in time, &amp; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured they will certainely kill at last.</p>
            <p>A gangrene kils when it gets to the heart, and what will that doe that is bred in the heart? Inward diseases are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dangerous; but when they haue seized vpon the heart the fountaine of life they proue deadly.</p>
            <p>Take then heed of an evill heart poysoned with vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe; and as you loue the credit of religion, the favour of God, the happinesse of your soules, looke to it betimes to purge forth of you such a venemous humour.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these words we haue two parts to be observed. 1. A Precept. 2. A Promise. The precept is a Leviticall injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction touching certaine times of Solemne worshippe to bee performed to God by the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitish nation, in the 23. <hi>ve.</hi> More distinctly we haue in it three circumstances to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</p>
            <p>1 The time when this service was to be performed, that was <hi>[thrice in the yeare]</hi> namely at 3. very solemne Feasts, which were these.</p>
            <p>1 The Feast of the Passeouer or vnleavenedbread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause during the Feast for seven dayes they might haue no leavenedbread in all their dwellings. This Feast the whole Nation was to keepe at the Tabernacle where euer it should be set vp: where after they had Sacrificed the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14714:38"/> Lambe in the Evening, they were to returne on the morrow to their habitations as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 7. This Feast was kept on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the first moneth, in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their deliverance out of Aegypt, &amp; in Aegypt from the slaying Angell, and in type of Christ <hi>that saues vs from the wrath to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The Feast of Pentecost, or of weekes, which was kept seuen compleat weekes after the Passeouer; or beginning the accompt at ripe Haruest when they put the sickle to the Corne; fiftie dayes after they were to appeare before God with an oblation of the first fruits, as it is <hi>Deut. 16. 9. Lev. 23. 15. &amp;c.</hi> This Feast was kept in memory of the Law giuen at Mount Sinai, fifty daies after the departure of the Children of Israel out of Aegypt.</p>
            <p>3 The Feast of the Tabernacles, kept on the fifteenth day of the seaventh Moneth, for seuen dayes together after the gathering in of Haruest and Vintage, <hi>Lev. 23. 33. &amp;c.</hi> At which time the Children of Israel that were Israelites borne were to dwell in Boothes made of the boughes of thicke and broad leaved trees, leaving their houses; In memory that they dwelt in Tents or Boothes for many yeares in the wildernesse, as it is <hi>verse</hi> 42. 43. of that place. These were the three solemne Feasts of the yeare wherein all the Males were to appeare before the Lord, as we haue this precept explained by another precept, <hi>Deut. 16. 16. Exod. 23. 14. &amp;c.</hi> wherein these Feasts are mentioned. This is the first Circumstance of the time.</p>
            <p>2 The second is the persons that were at those times to performe this worship vnto God: these are <hi>[All your men Children]</hi> all the Males amonge the Israelites.</p>
            <p>3 The third Circumstance is, the person before whom they were to make their appearance, that is God who is here called the <hi>[Lord Iehouah]</hi> and the <hi>[God of Israel,]</hi> both titles implying that he had iust authority to commande the Israelites such solemne Services, both in regard of his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14714:38"/> Soveraignty over all, and also of his gracious mercy towards them his People.</p>
            <p>Now vnder this Circumstance of the person is implied the Place, where they should appeare, which was in that place which God should choose, wherein to reare vp the Tabernacle, or Sanctuary, for his solemne and standing worship. This was first at Shiloh, &amp; after that was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at Ierusalem, in the Temple built by Solomon; which place God chose <hi>to put his name there,</hi> that is to establish his worship and to manifest his Glorious presence in speciall manner in that place. In which respect those that appeared in those places dedicated to Gods worship, are sayd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before God himselfe, there present to require and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their faithfull Services.</p>
            <p>This then is the precept, that at three Solemne Feastes in the yeere, the Passeover, Pentecost and Tabernacles all the males of the Israelitish Nation, should repaire vnto the chiefe place of Gods Publike worship, there to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and performe such Services as were required of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next followes <hi>verse.</hi> 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The <hi>Promise</hi> which is added to the Precept by way of prevention, to take away such an objection as the People might make against the equitie and Reasonablenes of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named Precept; God had commanded three times in a yeere all should come vp to the Tabernacle or Temple. What will become of vs then might the people say? If all the men must go vp &amp; leaue their Houses, who shal in their absence defend their Wiues, Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Goods, Cattle, &amp;c. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spoile? we dwell amid'st Enemies round about vs, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites, Moabites, Syrians, Phenicians, Philistines, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites, Edomites &amp;c. who beare vs mortall hatred for the wrong they thinke wee haue done them invading their Territories; these wilbe mindfull of vs, they haue Policie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know the Custome of our Country, and they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be malitious enough, to watch their best opportunitie to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14714:39"/> doe vs mischiefe; the season fit for Invasion being the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest time. If the Land be thus as is were dispeopled thrice in the yeare they will soone provide Forces in a readines to set vpon vs, and when men are absent, wals &amp; women are but weake defences, when al shalbe at Ierusalem an hundred or moe miles from home and that for many dayes in their going and comming and abode there, what a spoile may there be committed vpon the borders in the meane time? Wherefore this Service of God cannot be performed but with apparent perill to the whole State.</p>
            <p>This is the obiection which the Israelits might make both in the wildernes, and after that from time to time when they dwelt in the promised Land.</p>
            <p>By way of answer vnto this doubt, God promiseth that no Danger should befall them for observing of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in this particular. Our Enemies will invade our Country if we doe it say they: nay, saith God, not so. I will so order matters that they shall doe you no hurt <hi>[nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall any desire thy Land when thou shalt go vp thrice in a yeere to appeare before the Lord thy God]</hi> wherein God promiseth that by an especiall providence he would so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the Hearts of the Enemies of his People, that they should not as much as intend them any mischief when they went about the Service of God. Though a faire opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should bee offered them, yet they should haue no Heart or desire to meddle with their Countrey. But because they might yet cast a farther doubt and bee scarse willing to take God vpon his word in a matter so vnlikely; therefore God to put them out of all feare strengthens this his promise by two other promises which should soone be effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; that by seeing his truth in the one, they may learne to trust to his truth in the other. These promises are 1. That God would driue out the inhabitants of the land of Canaan, and giue them a dwelling there, <hi>[for I will cast out the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before thee:]</hi> therefore hee coulde easilie keepe out their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14714:39"/> enemies from reentring that could throw them out, when they were in possession.</p>
            <p>2 That he would make their territories larger from time to time <hi>[and I will enlarge thy Coasts]</hi> their Territories assigned them should grow wider, not narrower; and they should gaine vpon their enemies, who were more like to winne vpon them. Now then hee that coulde giue them a Countrey when they had none, but wandered in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without house or home; he that could enlarge their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders when at the first they were but little (according as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience anone after this time did proue to be most true:) he also could preserue them from loosing any thing they had, especially when they hazzarded it for his owne service sake.</p>
            <p>This is the plaine resolution of this scripture. From hence now wee haue two instructions for our practice here to be learned. The first is,</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> 
               <hi>That no man shalbe a looser by his obedience to God.</hi> The inference is plaine. The Israelits might pleade that they could not obey this commaundement, because of apparent inconveniencies that woulde follow therevpon: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues this scruple by promising that no such danger should happen on them as they imagined; if they would obey they should not be damaged by it. Now forasmuch as the like obiections are made by vnbelieuers against every part of Gods Service, to the end to shift of from themselues a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Obedience; and also because God deales a like at all times towards his Faithfull Servants; which setting a side all by-respects readily obey his will, By the rule of Proportion, from this particular we deduce this Generall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God suffers not men to sustaine hurt and losse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Obedient Performance of such things as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them.</hi> The second is this.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> 
               <hi>Experience of the Trueth in some of Gods Promises, should confirme our faith in the beliefe of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deduction is also manifest, God commands the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14714:40"/> to belieue that hee will over-rule the hearts of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and keepe them from annoying of their countrey when they are busied about Gods worship: why? because he would cast out their enemies, because hee would enlarge the bounds of their countrey after their enioying it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now these promises they shoulde see manifestly accomplished shortlie after they came into the land of Canaan; for now they were in the wildernesse when this precept was given them, and therefore they had reason to belieue that God would bee as good as his word in this promise for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as he would be for their Plantation in that countrey. Hence the point is,</p>
            <p>Triall in one thing, should cause trust in God for all other matters. <hi>Of these in order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 That none shalbe a looser by his obedience to God. <hi>For confirmation of this trueth obserue these reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1 The first reason is drawne from the trueth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of God in as manie promises as hee hath made in the Scriptures, setting forth his aboundant rewarde of faithfull obedience. It were an endlesse thing to name vnto you all, or the most of these promises. I shall therefore only direct you to the serious meditation vpon these Scriptures, <hi>Deut.
28. Psal.</hi> 37, and 128. wherein whatsoeuer is good for the Soule, the Body, the Estate, the Name, the Posteritie of Man, all is promised to them that feare God and obey his commaundements; in all which God is faithfull and true to performe what hee promiseth, if we be carefull to obey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 2. The second is from his Mercie and Bountie, wherein he is rich vnto all, and aboue all to such as feare and obey him. By which meanes God provides as for his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, so for our singular inconragement in his seruice. He will not haue his seruants to complaine that they serue a hard Master, one that doth ill prouide for the aduancement and welfare of his seruants: that his seruice is of much hazard, full of trouble, molestation, and painefulnesse, but of little
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14714:40"/> profit and comfort. This were a dishonour to God: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will make it appeare that he commaundes not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vs for our hurt, nor makes vse of our seruice without a bountifull rewarde for our labour. If hee bid vs doe any thing 'tis that we maie gaine by it, as well as himselfe. His glorie and our happinesse go both together: nay, was there euer anie who sought to glorifie God by his obedience, but God made him happie in the reward of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 3. Thirdly, the last shalbe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able to giue euerie good thing to his feruants; and to shield them from all euill things. Whatsoeuer is worth the hauing, that God hath in his gift as Soueraigne Lord to distribute all the goodnesse which is in himselfe or in his Creatures, where and in what manner hee himselfe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. Againe, he hath vnder his commande the forces of all Creatures in Heauen and in Earth, which hee ruleth as he pleaseth to his owne purposes. He can at ease frustrate the harmefull intentions, and noisome qualities of the worst of them. Hee can at anie time turne their malice into mercie, yea he is able to bring forth glorie to himselfe, and profit to his seruants not onlie against, but even out of their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous designements. This shall suffice for proofe of this point, which needes not so much confirmation to conuince vs of the trueth of it, as perswasion to moue vs to applie it to our practice. I will therefore come to the application of it after I haue in few wordes cleared a doubt or twaine, the solution whereof will farther illustrate the point it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1 The first question is, <hi>what is to bee thought of those that suffer evill for the service of God?</hi> We see it is generallie the condition and lot of the godly to haue verie hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in this world, if any sit downe by the losse 'tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie they. <hi>He that refraineth himselfe from evill maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a prey;</hi> it was and wil be true to the worlds end: a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie man is a faire marke wherevpon to discharge all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and mischiefe of the world; and a goodly pleasant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14714:41"/> it is to the Diuell, and men to heape all iniuries that may be vpon the head of so hateful a person as is in their acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt a faithfull seruant of God: how then is it true that Gods seruice brings vs no dammage? I answere brieflie to this doubt three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1 That such evils as befall the good and godly come vpon them ordinarilie, not for their diligence, but negligence in the seruice of God. Even they haue their faults, their pride, their securitie, their vnbeliefe, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse in Gods worship, their covetousnes; and then no marvell if they smart for it. God lets loose the tongues of railers to scourge their name; he vnbindes the hands of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to spoile their goods; he giues Sathan libertie to afflict their soules; he himselfe hides his face from them, and in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plight they are, till in their affliction they turne to the Lord, and repent of their evill doings. Servants when they grow lazie, and wicked neede. Correction more then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and so it is betweene God and vs; if once we grow vnfaithful he hath a hand to smite vs, as wel as to defend vs, a rod as wel as a crooke, and he loues vs so wel that hee will not spare our iniquities, but lay it on vs, <hi>that being chastened by him we might not be condemned with the world<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 1. Cor.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2 God doth dispose of thinges thus in great wisedome when even the best fare many times worst, to try the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their zeale, their faith, their patience, &amp;c. God will know whether men that professe much loue of him will be contented to beare a little losse for his sake, or whether they will forsake his service, when peace, wealth, and credit in the world forsake them. God will also make the world know that he hath servants in the world which serue him not for ful baggs, high titles, large possessions, welfurnished tables, bodily ease and <hi>a whole skinne.</hi> (As Sathan most maliciouslie accused holy <hi>Iob. ch. 1.)</hi> but men that serue him out of loue &amp; faithfulnes, men that are resolued to follow him through
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14714:41"/> povertie, disgrace, hunger, nakednesse and perills, yea to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their breasts to the sword of the murtherers and to giue their bodies to the flames, if it may bee to doe God or his gospell credit. Now other things be but small losses, my brethren, when God and his grace in vs gaines so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>3 Those losses which at anie time happen for Gods cause, God at another time makes them good: they are not losses so much as layings out, which after a patient for bearing a while come home with interest, commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly in the same kind, or which is much better with aboundance of grace here, &amp; a greater weight of glorie in the life to come. This is plaine in that answere our Saviour makes to his Disciples, <hi>Math.

[Behold,</hi> saith <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of all the rest, <hi>wee haue forsaken all and followed thee; what therefore shall wee haue? ver. 27.]</hi> Christ answeres, neither they nor any others should be loosers by him, he would make them also suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent amends, whosoever should sustaine dammage and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his sake, <hi>[verily I say vnto you</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that when the sonne of man shall sit on the Throne of his maiestie, ye which follow me in the regeneration, shall sit also vpon twelue Thrones and iudge the twelue Tribes of Israel.]</hi> A large recompence if we marke it. Poore Fisher-men that had forsaken a few Boats, and Nets, and Cabbins, and other such meane tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their trade and liuelyhood, to attend vpon Christ in his busines, to be thus rewarded with Thrones and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seats, when Christ shall come in his glorie. But this is the disciples priviledge; there followes a promise for alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>[And whosoever shall forsake houses, or brethren, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, or father or mother, or wife or children, or lands, for my names sake and the gospell, he shall receiue a hundred fold more, now at this present; houses, and brethren, and sisters, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and children, &amp; lands with persecution</hi> (marke that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) <hi>with perseeution:) and in the world to come shall inherite everlasting life. Mark. 10. 20.]</hi> Lo then nothing is lost, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14714:42"/> is neglected for Gods cause: he wilbe accomptable to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for all troubles, losses, inconveniences whatsoever that we shall runne into by reason of our faithful obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his commandements. Thus much of the first question; the next is,</p>
            <p>Q. 2 Whether we may neglect the busines of our calling to imploy our selues in the service of God?</p>
            <p>For if Gods seruice bee so full of gaine and advantage it seemes we haue a faire warrant to leaue much of the imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our severall vocations, that so we might spend the more time in Gods service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Whereto I answere, that we may not doe so, because that our generall callings to be Christians, and our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar callings in a civill life doe not crosse one another, but are subordinate and serviceable one to another.</p>
            <p>Religion is that which brings a blessing vpon our civill vocation, and this againe is the ordinarie meanes of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that blessing. Our civil vocation is the standing where in we are to shew forth the fruits of our Religion and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our selues to be indeed good Christians, by being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Tradesmen, iust Magistrates, painefull Ministers, &amp;c. so that we may not neglect one calling for another, seeing God is served &amp; glorified by our faithful discharge of both alike, and therefore <hi>we must abide,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> commaundes vs, <hi>in that vocation wherein we are called,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 20.</note> not shifting from one to another, not taking libertie to be idle in our particular lawfull imployments, that so wee may be diligent in Gods seruice. Wherefore they are iustlie to be reproved not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, who vtterlie forsake all imployments of this life, to the end they may wholie consecrate themselues to spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but such also who though they forsake not vtterlie, yet neglect more then is fit, their civill vocations. It is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waie a misguided zeale either to withdraw ones selfe from humane society, neglecting al service to our neighbour vnder a pretence of more devout seruice to God, as Popish
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14714:42"/> Votaries vse to doe, or as manie doe, who grow carelesse of their lawful affaires, whiles they busie themselues about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of religion. I would be loath to discourage anie man for his forwardnes in matters of religion; I know well wee shall finde everie where ten monstrouslie prophane, to one indiscreetlie zealous: yea a hundred that neglect Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to follow their owne busines, for one that doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Yet giue me leaue to tell you that there is a fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong some in the world, who suffer dammage not so much by Gods service, as by their owne indiscretion, whiles by vnnecessarie iournies. conferences, entertainements, and such like occasions touching matters of religion, they put al their necessarie businesse out of order. If such men suffer decaie in their estates, they must blame themselues. Religion is not in the fault, which where it is truelie taught teacheth man prudence, how to order his estate with iudgement. The want whereof giues occasion to most to imagine that the greatest part of such mens religion lies in their eares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they loue to heare much but not to doe. This fault should be amended where it is to be found, to the end that religion be not scandalized as a profession that doth impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish men. I confesse it is not an easie matter to giue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rules that may befit all callings and conditions of life, to proportion out the times of Gods service, and our owne imployments, yet these things I shall commende to your considerations.</p>
            <p>1 That in parting our time betweene religious and civill affaires, we shall doe best to follow Gods owne directions, who hath allotted a larger proportion to our owne tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall businesses then to his spirituall service; sixe daies for those; one day for this. Not but that he must haue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of some time, and all the businesses of everie daie; but on the seaventh day he requires we should more immediatlie and wholly intende his service. And know this for a truth, that could reason or Gods commande perswade people to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14714:43"/> harken to Gods counsell, diligentlie and seriouslie to attend all the dueties of Gods worship vpon the Lords daie, they should finde a larger increase of grace and better successe in their affaires by that one meanes wel vsed, then now by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie neglected.</p>
            <p>2 You may obserue a diuersitie in mens callings: some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford more leasure, some lesse. Where more may be spared it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be better bestowed then vpon God to glorifie him, and vpon a mans owne soule to saue it; but where lesse may be spared, something yet may be set apart for religion. This is certaine, there is no calling of neuer so busie imployment, but enough time may be spared for some good duties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hindering the world, and enough preserved for the world without robbing of God, were we wise to doe well, did not covetousnes, voluptuousnes and other vilde affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons befoole vs, and make vs vnthankefull vnthrifts of this shortnesse of life and grace, were our eies cleared vp, that we could looke perfectlie into the end of all things, reason and religion would teach vs, that much of our time would bee spent better then it is. Surelie men will say hereafter how much better had it beene, had I spent such an howre in praier which I wasted in idlenes; such a night in examining my heart vpon my bed, and watering my couch with my teares of repentance, which I spent in revelling, gaming, and other vngodlie practises; how much better had it beene if I had gone to the house of God, when at such a time I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout needlesse disports; that such a daie had beene spent in praier and fasting, which was passed awaie in complements of visitation, and entertainements. But we trifle awaie our time, and then complaine we want time for Gods service; and service of our callings. The service of our lusts haue eaten vp that which was to be bestowen vpon God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder the world must haue that. Wherefore let vs learne wisedome, and seeing wee can almost at any time finde an houre, halfe a daie, a whole daie, or more to spare from our
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14714:43"/> businesses for by matters. Let vs doe as much for God as we will doe for the world, and besides the seaventh day which is his owne let vs giue him somewhat of the sixe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an houre to heare a Sermon as well as twaine to our selues to sit idle lie or ill imployed; to spend halfe an houre in praier, reading, meditation, as well as three houres at a feast; to spare once a quarter a daie for the humiliation of thy soule in fasting praier and examination of thy sinnefull hart as wel as thou sparest odde daies enough for thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. This were wisedome and spirituall thriftines; and be bold on it, my brethren, that things being thus ordered with moderation and godlie discretion, much time will be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Gods service without crossing or hindering of our worldlie affaires. Thus much of these questions; now let vs come to make some application of the point to our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>

Such is still the sottish iudgment of the world, that it is a thankeles office to obey God almighty: they cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t no time so vnprofitably spent as that which is bestowed vpon his service, even the godlie in a fit of discontent are apt to thinke so. <hi>David, Ps. 73. 13.

[should I attend on God anie longer:]</hi> perswade men all that you can to a religious observation of reading the word, instructing their servants and children as is to bee done in Christian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; shew them Gods commaundements, tell them of his promises that in doing these things God will blesse both soule and body, goods and good name: and marke their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres. Alas they are but poore men, it is one day in a weeke losse to them, they must worke, or else wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren wilbe ill provided for: they cannot liue by hearing of sermons; religion will not buy food or raiment, they haue their hands full of businesse, and should they spend halfe an houre in a morning and so much at evening for prayer and devotion, all would runne to wracke, their worke would want their servants, and their servants would want their sleepe; they haue some speciall busines which cannot bee compassed in the weeke, wherefore they must make bolde with God, and borrow what they neuer meane to pay, it must and shalbe done on the Lordes day, else they should wrong themselues and set all out of square. Tell men that God abhorres falshood, that a little with equitie is better then bagges full of cosenage and deceipt; they'le answere you, that is not the way to thriue, they wote well that plaine

Thus God may promise or commande what he will, but most of vs are at a point with him, we will doe but what we list, thinking with our selues it is no booty to belieue what he promiseth, or obey what he commands. The ground of this pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mens opinions and practises touching our obedience to God is, that infidelity which is rooted in our Natures and growen vp with vs even from the wombe; that poison which the Serpent powred forth into the minds of our first Parents, <hi>viz:</hi> that God did not meane fairly towards them hath ever since deeply infected our natures making vs stil to haue God in a jealousie &amp; suspition, that he wil not do what he saith; when he bids vs obey &amp; makes promise vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that al shalbe wel with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feare him, much a doe we haue to take God vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his word, we forecast a thousand perils: if we do so there is danger, if so yet there we are not safe neither: we begin to argue how this or that can be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; which way I shalbe blessed as God saith I shall.

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14714:45"/> we see him. We may every one read his own thoughts in the practises of men recorded for our observation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Take a few Examples, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 25. we read that Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah hauing hired 100000 men of Israel to go with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Edomits he was forbiden by the Prophet of God to let the Army of Israel go with him to battle, for if he did he should surely loose the victory; if he obeyed he should conquer. Here now Amaziah is in a straight whether hee should follow the counsell of the man of God or his owne; <hi>[but what shall we doe</hi> (saith he) <hi>for the hundred Talents which I haue given to the Armie of Israell? ver. 9.]</hi> yea this stucke in his stomacke, he could willingly doe as God bids him, but he shall loose an hundred Talents by the bargaine, and that is a great matter; wherefore the King could finde in heart to adde obstinacie to his follie, &amp; as at first he had hired them against Gods good liking, so now to retaine them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his expresse commande, and to hazard &amp; loose Gods favour and aide in that iournie rather then the losse of one hundred Talents; and doubtlesse so he had done, had not the Prophet beene earnest with him, and confirmed him by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him to trust to Gods power and rest himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; <hi>[the Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall giue to thee much more then this]</hi> in the same verse. Againe in the 25. of <hi>Levit.</hi> we read that God gaue this law to the Israelits, that sixe yeeres they should sow their land &amp; dresse their vinyards, but euery sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth yeere the land should rest; they should not sow their corne, nor reape that which growed of it selfe, they should not cut their vines, nor gather their grapes that grew that yeere, as it is from ver. 2. to the 8. of that Cha. Doubt ye not but this seemeth a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand to this distrustful people, and that they were very hardly brought to obey it, even as many of vs would do in the like case.

7 yeare? why this is the direct way to starue vs all? what if harvest &amp; vintage proue bad in the sixe yeeres what

Wherfore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent such cavils as the Israelites might make against the a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forenamed Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement touching the rest of the 7 yeere God himselfe in the aforesaid <hi>Ch. v.</hi> 18. 19. 20. 21. 22.

Could now these coveteous and vnbelieuing people spare so much time or cost vpon God Almightie? Heare what God saith of them concerning the one <hi>Amos, 8. 5.
(when will the new moone be gone that we may sell Corne?</hi> &amp; <hi>the Sabboth that we may set forth wheat, making the Ephah small and the shekel great, and falsifying the ballances by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14714:46"/> These were their Thoughts if not their wordes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time alotted to Gods Service. Iust as men now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes. These Sundayes thinke they, is time clearely lost; we might haue gained thus many pence or pounds had it not that Sunday came in and hindred our busines, wee wish it gone that wee were at our Trading againe. Likewise for the other to wit the Charges they were put to in Sacrifice and offerings; heare what God reports of their Practtices in that matter <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. See the covetousnes and Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that wretched People who think any thing is good enough for God: faire and far Lambs, and sheepe &amp; Oxen, &amp; Calues without spot, &amp; blemish (as was required in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices) oh this was too much Charges; was it not pitty to burne such good Cattle, and part with them for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Sell them rather and make mony of them; as for the Altar and the Priest; any leane, starueling, that's nought worth shall serue the turne well enough. Iust as many men doe in setting their Children to several Professions, choose out the fairest and most hopefull, and bestow one vpon the Law, another vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Physick, another vpon Merchandize, or some other course wherby they may speedily rise to wealth and greatnes in the world.

            <p>For to end this vse, let vs a little obserue the instance here in our Text touching their repairing to the place of his worship three times a yeere: It is evident that the Precept in this kind was very ill observed at all times by the Iewes. Happily at their first plantarion in Canaanwhen the great workes of God were yet fresh in their memories, their Faith in the Promises kept them some what from the neglect of the Precept: How be it after the setting vp of the Tadernacle

For preventing of which mischiefe that wicked king (not trusting Gods word) who by <hi>Ahiiah</hi> had promised if hee would be obedient as was <hi>David,</hi> God would build him a sure house like vnto <hi>Davids. 1.

Which is plaine by that which is recorded touching the Passeover kept in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time. 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 30. where the Passeover was proclaimed throughout all Israell to be kept at Ierusalem, for saith the Text, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14714:47"/> This is a thing very remarkeable that notwithstanding so expresse a promise in this place, that yet so great negligence should creepe into so principall a part of the worshippe of God as the observation of the Passeover. But, my brethren, in this and those other examples we see that which daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shewes to be true, that it is a matter passing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to obey God when carnall reason suggests that there is apparent likelyhood of gaine by not doing, or of losse by doing what he commaundes vs.</p>

            <p>1 First in this life shee hath grace and protection, grace from his spirit, protection from his power, both from his Loue.

               </gap>e: he hath all those that God hath giuen him in his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and none shall plucke them from him, all are kept safe to that everlasting kingdome. In peace he is the glorie of his Church, in trouble the safetie of it: if shee be in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, he is the Angel that goes before her to giue her rest, if shee be persecuted he hath a wildernesse whereto she may flee, there be cleft; and holes in the rocke wherein shee shall be hid, and if the Dragon cast forth whole flowds of malice to overwhelme her, the earth shall open her mouth, &amp; swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp the flowds, if shee be invaded with Armadoes he can blow with his breath, and they shall sinke into the bottome of the deepe like lead; if vnder-mined by a Powder-plot, he can bring to light the deedes of darknesse, and saue his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed and his people, by a deliverance as wonderfull as the act intended. In a word his heart is vpon his Church, and faithful people, their sorrowes he thinkes vpon, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, his afflictions, he is pained when they are persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in every distresse he is neere at hand to afforde succour: in health to saue them from sicknesse; in sicknesse to saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from death: in trouble of estate and paine of body, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them from a disquiet minde, in anguish of soule to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from fainting by despaire. In life to saue them from a thousand deaths, in death it selfe to deliver them from that death, which is to come. Thus is Christ beneficiall to vs in this life.</p>
            <p>But in the life to come he bestowes glory on the Church: the Saints shalbe made perfectly righteous, perfectly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous like vnto himselfe: where he is, there they shall be for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14714:52"/> ever to behold his glory, to be partakers of his ioie.</p>
            <p>You see then that Christ every way deserues all our loue, seeing he is not only most excellent in himselfe, <label type="milestone">

               <hi>[They made me keeper of the vines but I kept not mine owne vine,]</hi> shee attended on the fancies and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of others, but not on her owne welfare, this we may apply vnto the profanenesse of most men, who haue Vines, enough to keepe and dresse where about Sathan and their owne lusts haue set them on worke, but for that true Vine which is Christ Iesus, they take no pleasure at all, in resting themselues vnder his shadow, or tasting his pleasant fruit. Men haue many things to busie their affections about, but while they tend other things they are vtterly carelesse of this one thing that is the chiefest. One man hath set vp prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and greatnes in the World for the idoll which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and all his time, meanes and thoughts are taken vp in prosecution of some plot wherevpon he hath contrived his farther advancement. Another wallowes in all base plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and so long as hee can content the beastly part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his sensuall desires; he thinkes himselfe well-apaid, hee enioies what he loues, and what needes he more. Another loues nothing but mony and cattle, and trees, and earth, it is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14714:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> his happynes to say all this is mine, and when he is amidst those things he is amidst all his contentments. In short, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath his welbeloved in some kinde or other; but it is not the beloued here spoken of. No (my brethren) these men loue not Christ say they what they will, they make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reckoning of him. Come to the triall of it and you shall see it so. The old saying's true, <hi>Vbi Amor, ibi Oculus,</hi> where we like, there we looke; or as Christ saith, <hi>where our treasure is there will our hearts be also,</hi>

               <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21. Consider then your selues, in your thoughts what is it you most thinke of? Is it of Christ, of his excellencies, of his benefits? Can you take pleasure in describing to your soules the glorious and gracious qualities of his person, musing attentiuely vpon such admirable excellencies, so farre surpassing all that in this world can be called either gracious or glorious? Are our hearts often warmed with heauenly ioie, when in our private meditations we recount with our selues what great things he hath done and will doe for our soules? To thinke how mightelie he hath wrought in vs by his spirit, to make vs aliue, and keepe vs aliue, when we were once dead in sins; how sweetly he perswades our will and stubborne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to yeeld obedience, how forcible hee assists vs against most powerfull temptations? Can we reioice to thinke what happynes we haue in his favour, that he is a faithfull friend to vs in all our necessities, to whom wee may repaire for counsell and comfort? Doe his consolations refresh our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that when sinne wounds vs, his stripes heale vs, When Sathan accuses vs, he is our advocate to plead for vs; when sorrowes and paines are vpon vs, he speakes peace vnto our Soules, that in all wants &amp; troubles we can surely pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and poure out our soules into his bosome who only giues them rest? Doe we often meditate on that happynes he will one day bring vs vnto, when hee shall make vs like himselfe, most glorious in our bodies, most righteous in our soules, most blisfull in all, and that for ever? Be our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14714:53"/> thoughts (my brethren) on these things? Run our desires and wishes this way? Oh what strangers are such meditations from most mens hearts! they thinke what they shall eate, what they shall put on, how they shall bring the yeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how they shall pay this debt, purchase that field, that house, provide to raise such a sonne, to marry such a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to grow rich, to get high places, titles, and offices, how to follow their pleasures and liue at hearts ease, how they may effect their wicked designes, oppresse a man, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, revenge such wrongs as haue beene done them by their neighbours, and watch them an ill turne to be even with them, yea these be the great and mighty imployments of mens thoughts, where about they busie themselues, and often breake their sleepe, day and night, the whole weeke, the whole yeare, their mindes run vpon these things, when they be at Church at praier, in hearing, at any good exercise the heart still wanders about such matters, euen at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Is it not euen so my bretheren, which of vs can excuse our selues, and say my heart is innocent? Consider we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the practises of men, whether they will stand with the loue they professe to Christ: we will doe much for one that wee loue, especially if it be one that can doe much for vs. Now what saith our Saviour.<note place="margin">14.

Surely we cannot though they should sweare it. What? loue Christ, yet not know him, except it be by his name; loue him? And yet despise his seruants, his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, his Ministers, make a iest at his word, and put off with a scoffe the counsels and rebukes which out of it are brought to them. Loue Christ? Yet set thy mouth against heauen, and in thy rage and hellish surie discharge thy blasphemies vpon his soule, his body, his blood, his wounds, his name, vpon all that is pretious in him, and not to be named but with devotion. Wilt thou say thou louest Christ, when thou hast no heart to thinke on him, to talke of him, to be in his presence, in the assemblies of Gods people in publike, at sermon, at sacraments, at private praiers? Is he thy friend? And yet art though loath to haue any thing to doe with him, in such places, in such exercises? In fine wher's thy loue to Christ, whilst I see thy vngodly life, whereby thou disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourest Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shamest the name of a Christian? If by these practises we shall know thy loue of him, whereby I mervaile shall we know thy hatred of him. But, brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not deceiued, God will not so be mocked, delude thy

If any will crosse thee in these thy courses, admonish thee, rebuke thee, perswade thee, thou canst not brooke them, thou countest them thine enemies, that thus trouble thee; when thou art entreated by thy loue to God, thy loue to Christ, thy loue to his word, by thy loue to his Ministers, by thy loue to thine own soule, by all things that are louely, &amp; by all loues to deny vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and worldly lusts, and to liue righteously, soberly, and godly.
