            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But hÃ©ere shall be a good lesson for vs
<pb facs="tcp:2033:10"/>
to learne, that not onelie in fayre wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we must looke for a storme, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praye vnto God before it be throwne downe vppon vs, but also at the tyme of our affliction, wee must flie onelie vnto Christe, and crie vnto him, Helpe, helpe Maister, for vnlesse thou helpe we perish: The councell of man is windie to sÃ©eke, and all our labour is nothing woorth: <hi>Peter</hi> is hÃ©ere, and cannot saue vs: <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> haue no skyll to helpe vs: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe</hi> is in as great feare as wee: And therfore helpe Maister, helpe vs O Christ, thou canst helpe, thou wilt heare. The Saints in Heauen (we know) doo loue vs, but theyr arme is too short to send vs suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Or if there were hope in them, as there is none, yet better flie to the head, then to the foote, especiallie, the head being so ready, so willing, so wel able, so gentle: At the head of the Spring, fayre water is swÃ©etest, and at the fountayne of mercie, mercie is receyued with moste pleasure. Doubt nothing, it is better to trust in the Lord, then to put any confidence in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2033:11"/>An other note may you learne by these Disciples, that those whome GOD dooth most entyrelie loue, them dooth he exercise in most troubles and feares, tossing them from rocke to rocke, and from daunger to daunger, knowing that tribulation brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth patience, and patience experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, because the loue of God is shedde abroade in our hearts by the holie Ghost, and knowing that the man is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, whome the Lorde dooth chastice: for though he be sore thrust at, yet falleth he not, because the Lorde is his helpe: In two perrils shall he delyuer vs, and in the thirde, shall he quite set vs frÃ©e: heauines may endure for a night, but ioye commeth in the morning: Blessed be the Lorde that suffereth no man to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his strength. And therefore (my brethren) if it please God to laye the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his Crosse vppon any, eyther through sicknesse, or shypwracke, or pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or broken detters, or otherwayes, let him not therefore dispayre of Gods loue, but rather let him be glad, that it pleaseth
<pb facs="tcp:2033:11"/>
him to picke him out as one from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in whome the might of his Maiestie might be glorified. For you may reade in the former Chapters, that so long as Christe was among the multitude, there fell no daunger or temptation, but all was quiet and peaceable, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without feare: but so soone as hÃ©e meant to make a tryall of theyr faith, hÃ©e calleth onelie the Captaines, euen his dÃ©erest Disciples<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and suffereth none else to come with him in the Shippe, that they alone might be brought into feare. This is to vs no small comfort, that those he so well loued, he was content to haue them so much endaungered, but yet all for the best. Syluer is not Syluer, tyll it bee blowne and purged in the fyre: Golde commeth to no honour, tyll by long ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering and chasing, it be forged into a vessell mÃ©ete for the Kinges seruice: The corne is grounde on a rough myll, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in an hoate ouen, before it become good bread.

               <hi>Amen.</hi> And thus much of the fyrst conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which is the personne of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>Next, commeth the consideration of Christes owne person, of whome we may reade, that for this cause was he borne, and for this cause came be into the world, to saue sinners. And because those that had long laboured without relÃ©efe, vnder the burthen of the Lawe, not finding therein any saluation, might sette theyr eyes on him, which is the Lawe of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and well perceyue that he was the true <hi>Messias</hi>: he therefore dyd not onely preach vnto them a newe Doctrine of the Gospell, and gaue them a newe commaundement of loue, but also to their great comfort, and no lesse woonder, hÃ©e confyrmed all his doctrine by Myracles, healing all diseases, bothe of body and minde, euer applying the Myracle to make proofe of that which hee then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them. As when hee woulde shewe that mans sinnes were so fowlie enfected with the contagion of leprosie, as
<pb facs="tcp:2033:12"/>
that no workes of the Lawe could cleanse the same, but that it must be purified by his Merites, he letteth them hÃ©ereof sÃ©e an outwarde signe, by healing that leaprous body with a touch of his finger, whome no Phisicke before could cure. When hee would haue vs to vnderstande howe shrewdlie we are all shaken with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning feauer, that distempereth the liuelie blood of our soules<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and maketh our taste so bitter, that we cannot sauour the swÃ©et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his doctrine in our selues without him, nor serue to minister in any necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vse: hÃ©e dooth hÃ©ereof make euident demonstration, by curing of <hi>Peters</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe that was sicke of an Ague. And hÃ©ere lykewise because hee woulde haue vs to consider, that in our selues there is no habilitie to resist the stormes and tempestes of this worlde, the rage of the fleshe, and the deuill, without his helpe: hÃ©e therefore bringeth his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into this perrill, and then delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them when they call vppon him, that they may knowe where to sÃ©eke helpe for theyr soules in tyme of affliction, by fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:2033:13"/>
such ready helpe for theyr bodies in tyme of distresse.</p>
            <p>Yea, but Christe was a slÃ©epe at the stearne, yea, but let Christe be awaked: if he heare not at the fyrst, call to him the second tyme: if not the second tyme, crie vppon him the thyrde tyme: yea, call and ceasse not, tyll ye haue awaked him: be sure, he wyll both heare and helpe at the last. Christe is not lyke one of these testie squiers, or those nice Dames that can abyde no noyse in the house, for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theyr morning sleepe: no, Christe would be awaked with our early prayer, yea, with our earlie and earnest calling vpon him. Would he be glad to be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? Yea surely, and more glad to be kept waking styll. But howe shall we kÃ©epe him waking that he slÃ©epe not? Giue him leaue to talke vnto vs, and let vs dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie hearken and lysten vnto him: for hee is willing to talke and tell vs of our saluation. But howe shall we set him a worke to talke? I will tell you. When wee praye (sayth <hi>Augustin</hi>) then doo wÃ©e talke with God: but when wee heare the
<pb facs="tcp:2033:13"/>
Scripture read, then GOD talketh vnto vs: for the Scripture is the voyce and the woordes of GOD pearcing the eares of our heartes by the vertue of the holie Ghoste. If therefore you wyll heare Christe, talke and so kÃ©epe him awake: Let the Bible be read vnto you, whether it bÃ©e on Shipboorde or on shoare, so oft as you can, hearken vnto it, and kÃ©epe Christ waking: for it is daunger to let him fall a slÃ©epe, because whyle he slept, the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were in ieopardie to bÃ©e drowned: Whyle the good man of the house slepte, the enuious man sowed tares among his wheate: whyle <hi>Ionas</hi> slepte vnder hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the tempest and storme with raging encreased. Let vs watche him well to kÃ©epe him awake, naye, let vs set him to watch, and wake, and kÃ©epe vs, and then will he not once so much as nodde: <hi>For he that keepeth Israell, shall neyther sleepe nor slumber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another good note in the consideration of the person of Christ, is this, that Christ is a verie good Maister to gouerne the Helme, and take him into the Shippe
<pb facs="tcp:2033:14"/>
with you, and let him be Loades man, let him come who euer styres his course, whyle Christ is Maister, although the tide set on the weather bowe, yet the boate shall neuer by sincking to lÃ©ewarde, fall on a wrong coast. And whyle Christe is Pilote, it shall neyther runne vppon the flattes by mistaking of the channell, nor make in against the current by misrecko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the tydes, and therefore be sure to take Christ aboorde with you.</p>
            <p>But howe shall we be sure to haue him with vs? <hi>Surelie, where two or three be gathered togeather in my name, there will I be also,</hi> sayth Christe. If therefore you would haue him in your company, then gather your selues in his name, take your voiage in hand in his feare: let the cheefe purpose, be first his honour, and then a profitable seruice of your Countrey in your calling, and then no doubt God will be with you: Let your talke be of him and of his woonderfull workes, by telling of his saluation from daye to daye: Let the elder sort shewe vnto the younger, the corners of the world, the North and the
<pb facs="tcp:2033:14"/>
South, and prayse his name that layde the foundations thereof: Let them shew the pointes of the Compasse, and the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of the windes, and glorifie him which bringeth them in and out at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Let him take his Starre with the BallastÃ©elie, and shewe howe the howres of the night are descried by the guardes: Let him shewe, howe the current follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the fyrst mouing Heauen, and howe the tydes be attempered by the Epicicle of the Moone, and in euerie thing let him prayse the GOD of heauen, which hath created all this for the vse of man. To conclude, let no filthinesse, nor euyll spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, nor backbyting, nor blasphemie, nor corrupt communication procÃ©ede out of your mouthes, but that which is good to the vse of edifying, that it maye mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster grace vnto the hearers, and then be sure, Christe will be with you, as he was with the two Disciples that talked on him in theyr trauaile towarde <hi>E<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The last note that I promised, was a viewe and consideration of the Myracle, wherin I cal you my brethren to witnes, which haue bÃ©en in some desperate plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on the water, whether it be not a work only appropriate to God, that when the stormy winde ariseth, and lifteth vp the waues of the Sea, when they mount vp to heauen, and descend againe into the dÃ©epe, and heare the horrible rage and rushinges of the byllowes, when the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie of the flawe, renteth downe the tackle, and washeth awaye the labourers from the hatches, when they reele too and fro, and stagger lyke dronken men, and theyr cunning is windie to seeke. I report mÃ©e then to you, whether it bee not a worke bothe of mercie and might, to make glad on a suddayne the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Soule, by turning the storme vnto a caulme, and making the waues to bee still, by rebuking the winds and the Sea, to make all thinges so temperate and so quiet, that the Shippe shall slide towarde

            <p>Kinges maye boast in the multitude of theyr people, and Merchauntes reioyce in theyr ware and theyr money: hÃ©e thinkes himselfe some body that can commaunde a whole Cittie: and hÃ©e that hath but a boye to carrie his Swoord and Targette, would take skorne to be estÃ©emed of small reckoning. The Captaine in a Shippe of warre, is a iollie fellowe, and thinketh himselfe a lyttle God, because hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth prowdlie to the Souldiors, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them quayle at the shaking of his lockes: because at his woorde the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons rattle, and the wylde fyre flÃ©eeth through the stifeling smoake, the gunnes thunder and spewe out theyr pellettes, and the Souldiors muster themselues on the hatches: If any be vnrulie, hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth him ouerboorde, or if any be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hee bindes him to the Maste: if hÃ©e crie aloofe, the Helmes man dares not goe roomer: and if hÃ©e bidde shoote, the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dares not but giue fyre. But let the Prince or the Potentate, the King or the Captaine, the Merchaunt or the money

And therefore if our Sauiour Christe, haue doone, and can doo it, and dooth it daylie, what is hÃ©e that wyll grudge to follow so good a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: but take hÃ©ede, if wÃ©e will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe him, wee must fyght vnder him: for wÃ©e cannot serue bothe God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Edgar,</hi> a King of the Englishe <hi>Saxons,</hi> that walking on the stronde for his recreation at an ebbe, so soone as the floodde beganne, and he lothe to leave walking, hÃ©e setteth downe his foote by the water syde, and thus began to speake: I charge thÃ©e thou Sea, to staye thy selfe, and you byllowes, that ye

For had hÃ©e not saued himselfe by flight, the salte foome would haue washed his tynsell Gowne. Which when the King had well espied, turning to his Bishops and Nobles that stoode by, hÃ©e charged them all straightlie, not to flatter him thencefoorth, with any loftie tytle of power or puissaunce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was in him no might at all.</p>

            <p>But nowe to turne this Myracle vnto our profite. The Shippe maye well be resembled to a Cittie or common wealth: the Windes, be those whisperers that styrre vp stryfe, and spreade debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene man and man: the waues be such ambicious desyres, as doo trouble the peace of the Cittie, and make mennes mindes inordinatelie to swell in pride, in vaineglorie, in emulation, in debate: so wrastling and strugling togeather, as one byllowe dasheth against an other: which all doo fyll the Cittie with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theyr garreboyles, shaking it so sore, tyll it be readie to sincke againe: Surelie, where these things doo happen, eyther Christ is not at all in that Cittie, or else they haue let him fall a slÃ©epe: wake him for Gods sake, that hee maye styll the tempest, or else the whole towne will be in daunger to perishe. You knowe the Shyppe maye hull for a whyle in fowle weather, and brooke the
<pb facs="tcp:2033:17"/>
rough Sea for a season: but if the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest of rage continew without ceasing, what hope is there other, then either to be supped vp of the wide yeaning waues, or to bee carried against a Rocke, and so splÃ©eted in sunder. Dissention in a Towne is a sore tempest, take hÃ©ede, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Christe caulme it with loue, and styll it with agrÃ©ement, what hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth but a pittifull wracke. Yea, but why should the tyde yÃ©elde ought to the winde: or why should not the winds so long strogle for the preheminence, tyll the tytle of Soueraigntie be alotted to some one of them? God dooth knowe, and not I, which winde hath most right to blowe: and I coulde wishe, there were no more bickering, tyll that were honestlie tryed. I meane, I coulde so wishe, and so I request, euen in Christe, that the Shippe bÃ©e not troubled with surges of debate, whyle the Marriners striue, who shall sitte at the Helme. If other meanes cannot bÃ©e founde (which Iwis might, if men would bÃ©e men) yet let the lawe trie the right of the quarell:
<pb facs="tcp:2033:18"/>
and yet let the Gospell establish the quiet of your hearts. Let the controuersie in Gods name, be decided by the Lawe, but let your conuersation be approued by loue: and let that loue be without dissimulation. For I can tell you one thing, except wÃ©e loue one an other, wÃ©e cannot loue GOD: and if wÃ©e loue not him, howe shall wÃ©e looke, that he will loue vs.</p>
            <p>More yet I maye saye somewhat, and more particularlie. This body of ours is lyke vnto a Shippe, wherein the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable soule, lyke a marriner sayleth: this world is naught else but a sea of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and the prouokementes of the fleshe are tempestuous windes, which of our selues wee are not able to asswage: which if they be not in tyme appeased, will bring vs in daunger to be eaten vp of the Sea, and so to make a myserable shipwracke. Let vs therefore be sure, that Christe be in our shippes, yea, let his feare be euer before our eyes. If that through negligence wee haue let him slÃ©epe, yet in tyme I praye you heartelie
<pb facs="tcp:2033:18"/>
let vs awake him: naye, let vs awake him whyle tyme serueth, and that with fasting, with wÃ©eping, with praying, and he shall surelie heare vs: For he is our fortresse and delyuerer: our God shall make caulme all the vnrulie motions of the fleshe, that striue against the spirite, whether pride or couetousnesse, or lust, or enuie, or whatsoeuer, and shall supple vs with the Oyle of his loue and heauenlie grace, to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be prayse for euer and euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
