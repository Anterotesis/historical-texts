            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A PERSWASIVE TO AN Ingenuous TRYAL OF Opinions in Religion.</head>
         <div n="1" type="section">
            <head>§ 1.</head>
            <p>THE great reaſon why they are few in compariſon who come to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and a well-grounded Perſwaſion in matters of Religion, is becauſe they are not many who make a due inquiry into them. Were this done more generally, there would not be ſo much ignorance and errour in the world, nor ſo great a variety of Opinions and Sects, as there is, and for the moſt part hath been in the world.</p>
            <p>And there are three ſorts of men who fail of knowing the truth, for want of due endeavours to find it out. Some there are who want ability or opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; others, who wanting neither, do utterly neglect it, and will not apply their minds to it at all; a third ſort make but a very imperfect ſearch after truth. And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49019:3"/>
ſo all ignorance or miſtake in things of moment, that concern the ſalvation of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, or the peace of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be attributed either to want of power and means to inquire after truth, or to unwillingneſs and perfect negligence, where it may be ſought and attained to; or to lazineſs, inactivity, and partiality in ſeeking it.</p>
            <p>To the firſt ſort, we are not onely to reckon <hi>Ideots,</hi> who want a competent meaſure of Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding wherewith to judge, but thoſe alſo that having the ſame common natural gifts of the mind with others, are yet by reaſon of their outward circumſtances, kept almoſt invincibly ignorant, having very little or no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given them to inquire into things, that they might know them better. And thouſands who ſit in <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh</hi> darkneſs, are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in groſs errours and remedileſs ignorance, as the caſe at preſent ſtands with them. But bleſſed be God this is not our caſe, who live in ſuch a time and place as put no man under circumſtances of incurable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond ſort of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have plentiful means and fair opportunities of being better informed, but utterly neglect to uſe them, they are either ſuch who remain under the power of thoſe falſe Principles which were inſtilled into them in their Education, or who blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow erring Guides, whoſe perſons they have in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, reſolving never to trouble themſelves with a free and impartial uſe of their own reaſon concerning thoſe Doctrines which they have in their own opinion wiſely and ſafely taken upon truſt. It happens likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>that men are led away by lofty conceits of their own judgment; and the extravagant opinion they have of themſelves, will not ſuffer them to attempt ſuch an ingenuous examination of things, as implies a poſſibility of their being deceived. But I believe they are more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49019:3"/>
who take up Opinions and engage in Parties for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends and carnal intereſts; and theſe, of all others, are fartheſt from inquiring &amp; conviction, becauſe it is a great uneaſineſs to a mans mind, to find himſelf miſtaken in thoſe opinions which are for his profit or pleaſure in this world. And moſtly the power of cuſtom ſtrengthens all theſe cauſes of obſtinacy in neglecting to inquire. Men are not willing to quit the Perſwaſions they have for a long time entertained, but had rather keep where they are, without troubling themſelves to begin all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, and to inquire whether they have not been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long deceived. And where moſt of theſe obſtructions meet together, as they often do, in the ſame perſon, if he be not ſuccoured mightily by the grace of God, his mind is barred up for ever againſt the knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p>A third ſort miſs of the truth, not that they make no inquiry, but becauſe they do this very imperfectly and ſuperficially, and that either through ſloth and lazineſs, being not willing to take that pains and care which is requiſite for the diſcovery of truth; or through partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>whence it comes to paſs that they examine and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> onely or chieſly what is offered in favour of their own ſide, and make it the great end of their ſearch not to follow what ſhall appear to be true upon inquiry, but to be confirmed in their preſent Perſwaſion. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diligence and honeſty are very neceſſary diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in order to the right underſtanding of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in Religion, no wonder that they who inquire without theſe advantages, are rather hardned in Errour than convinced of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Now theſe being the common cauſes of ignorance and errour amongſt us at this day, and ſince they all center in want of due inquiry, I ſhall ſet my ſelf to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all ſorts of people, who are not made incapable by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49019:4"/>
natural weakneſs of underſtanding, to prove and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine things which concern their own Souls and the peace of Chriſtians, with that diligence and ingenuity which becomes reaſonable creatures. And though I know 'tis a hard task that I am undertaking, by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and corrupt intereſts of men which I muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; yet I am ſure no advice can be more rational than this, that we would be perſwaded to uſe our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which if we do not, we lay up the <hi>common Talent</hi> of our natures <hi>in a Napkin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God hath endued us with Faculties whereby we can diſcern between Truth and Errour; and moreover, with a natural deſire to know the truth: ſo that the uſe of theſe Faculties is inexcuſably neglected, and this deſire is foully corrupted and debaſed, if we are eaſily impoſed upon in things of great moment. God in our creation hath enabled and inclined us to ſeek the knowledge of Truth, and to inquire into the grounds of our Belief and Practice. And therefore to neglect this, is to abuſe the firſt Gifts of God, and to ſin againſt Nature.</p>
            <p>And it ſhould be every mans care to find out that truth which concerns Religion and another life, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this is every mans greateſt intereſt; we ſhould <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> moſt diligence there, where to be deceived is of moſt dangerous conſequence.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there are ſome plauſible Pretences againſt a due and impartial enquiry in matters of Religion, I ſhall prepare my way by endeavouring to remove thoſe Prejudices that lie againſt it; and in order hereunto, I ſhall conſider theſe three Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether it be <hi>dangerous</hi> to <hi>private</hi> men to leave them to uſe their own judgment, and to be led by it in matters of Faith and Religion?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether a general liberty of examining and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49019:4"/>
in thoſe things, doth miſchief in the Church, and be the cauſe of Schiſms and Hereſies?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether if every one have a juſt Right to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for himſelf, this be not a good reaſon for <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi> or the univerſal liberty of practiſing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> or Perſwaſion, after exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>§ 2.</head>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Whether it be dangerous to private men to allow them the uſe of their own judgment in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>Now to leave men wholly to themſelves in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without directing them to uſe the beſt helps they can to find out the truth, is very dangerous indeed; and no wiſe man will contend for this liberty of judgment in behalf of Chriſtian people, or of any ſort of men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: for this were not ſo much to adviſe them to <hi>judge</hi> for themſelves, as to <hi>conclude</hi> for themſelves before they had taken any pains to judge. For I do not ſee how men can be ſaid to judge, who refuſe the means without which they can make no tryal. Now the aſſiſtance of men of greater knowledge and ability than themſelves have, is one very neceſſary means by which private and unlearned perſons are to examine and judge in matters of Religion. And God hath not onely given us abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to find out ſome truths by our ſelves, but alſo to weigh and conſider what others offer to us: And therefore he hath appointed Governours and Guides of Souls, that are to <hi>feed the Flock,</hi> and to inſtruct Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people in the way to Heaven. And one part of their work is to enable them <hi>to give an anſwer to every one that asketh a reaſon of the hope that is in them,</hi> I Pet. 3. 15. which I conceive they cannot do, without informing and helping them to judge for themſelves. So that liberty of examining in order to private judgment, does by no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49019:5"/>
means exclude adviſing with and hearkening to men of greater skill and ability than our ſelves, eſpecially to the publick Guides of Souls, but rather makes it neceſſary ſo to do, this being one means of Gods appointment by which we are to inform our ſelves. And I grant that without very good and clear reaſon, we are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their Doctrine, but in all doubtful caſes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in favour of it.</p>
            <p>But that it ſhould be dangerous to private perſons to weigh and conſider, as well as they can, what their Guides teach them to believe or to do, this is that which I can by no means underſtand, unleſs it were a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing to follow our Guides like men that have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not like beaſts that have none. It is at any time as ſafe to follow a Guide with our eyes open, as to ſuffer our ſelves to be blindfolded, and then to follow him by a ſtring. God hath referred us to <hi>Guides,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. but yet he hath truſted us to our ſelves too, and we are to <hi>try the ſpirits whether they be of God:</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we may follow Guides that want Guides themſelves. And <hi>if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſay that inquiries after truth with the beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and means that we have in our power, is the way to be miſtaken, is to reproach our own Reaſon, and God the Author of it; ſince as it ſeems, the more we exerciſe and improve our Reaſon, the more likely we are to be in the wrong, and to deceive and abuſe our ſelves.</p>
            <p>At the great day of Accounts, Seducers ſhall anſwer for thoſe whom they have deceived. And therefore the Guides of the Church are ſtrongly obliged that they do not through wilfulneſs or negligence miſlead us. But if they miſlead us in things that touch our eternal ſtate, I do not ſind that all the blame will lie upon them, but rather that we alſo ſhall anſwer for it our ſelves: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe why ſhould our Saviour ſay, <hi>Why of your ſelves</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49019:5"/>
               <hi>do ye not judge that which is right?</hi> Luke 12. 57. and St. <hi>John, Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. and St. <hi>Paul, Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 21. and, <hi>Let no man deceive you,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 3. Again, if it be dangerous to permit men to judge for themſelves in that ſenſe wherein I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it, then theſe are not wholſom but very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Exhortations.</p>
            <p>And yet if a Church which pretends to be an <hi>Infallible</hi> Guide in Religion, could make it out clearly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſhe is ſo, I ſhould, without much examination of her particular Doctrines, receive them as the Oracles of God. But then I muſt have ſtronger Arguments to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me that ſhe is infallible, than thoſe which at preſent make me certain that ſhe is actually deceived. For to ſubmit to a pretended infallible Authority, without knowing why I do ſo, is to put it into the power of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for ought I know, to lead me into the moſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errours, and to call <hi>Virtue</hi> Vice, and <hi>Vice</hi> Virtue. Therefore they muſt be very convincing Reaſons upon which I am to believe that of my Guide, which being once admitted, I muſt take his bare word afterward for all things elſe. I think none of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion will deny this. And then it will follow, that for my own ſafety I am to uſe my own Reaſon and Judgment as ſeverely as I can, before I admit this fundamental Article of their Faith. And this will amount to what I ſay, that it is ſo far from being dangerous for men to uſe their own Judgment in matters of Religion, that it is very dangerous for them not to do ſo; ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are likely to follow men of the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as they for the moſt part are who have the leaſt reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if I am led into errour by the Authority of a Church that does not pretend to Infallibility, I may hope
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49019:6"/>
to recover the knowledge of the truth, eſpecially if it be a matter of great conſequence, more than if ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and I believed her infallible. For ſuch a Church will not ſo readily deny me the means of examining her Doctrine, and ſo I may be able to diſcover the errour my ſelf: If not, I have this comfort at leaſt, that my Guides being not engaged to contend that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, are themſelves in the way of detecting their own miſtake, and will more eaſily come off from it. But they that pretend to Infallibility, are ſtak'd down to their Opinions; and though their Cauſe be never ſo bad, they are engaged to ſerve it. And therefore this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is ſo far from diſcharging me of the pains of uſing my own Judgment and Reaſon in matters of Religion, that I make the moſt fooliſh venture in the world, if I do not uſe my Reaſon as ſtrictly as I can in examining that very Pretence before I admit it. And though a Churches claim to Infallibility were in it ſelf never ſo juſt and well-grounded, it is to me but a Pretence, till I underſtand the grounds of it.</p>
            <p>Nor can any man blame me, if before I am convinced of the Infallibility of that Church, I take thoſe particular Doctrines into conſideration which are to be believed upon this account, that I may this way alſo judge of the reaſonableneſs of that Pretence: for 'tis not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that men would be thought infallible. If I find the Doctrine they would put off with ſuch authority, to be indeed divine and heavenly, rational and ſcriptural, tending to the reformation and ſalvation of Mankind, this will incline me to yield more eaſily to the <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Arguments of the Infallibility of that Church. But if the Doctrine for which ſhe vouches this Authority does, upon the moſt impartial tryal that I can make, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be worldly, unſcriptural, or contrary to common ſence; then I am bound to examine the grounds of her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49019:6"/>
Pretence more ſeverely than in the former caſe. And there is no queſtion but ſuch Doctrines may be taught by men pretending to Inſpiration or Infallibility, which will juſtifie a man in rejecting that Pretence out of hand, and troubling himſelf no more about it. If a Phyſician of never ſo great name ſhould tell me that he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly cure my Diſeaſe, and then preſcribe a doſe of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> I think Reaſon would adviſe rather to queſtion his Infallibility, becauſe he goes thus madly to work, than to take his Poyſon becauſe he promiſes an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cure.</p>
            <p>Now if I am not to do violence to my own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in things that concern my bodily health, much leſs ſhould I do the ſame in things that regard my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſtate. And they are a ſtrange ſort of men, who will allow people the liberty of uſing their Reaſon as well as they can for the ſecurity of their worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, but will have them be led in the great affairs of Religion and Eternity, as if they had no reaſon at all. For to judge aright, and to know the truth in matters of Religion, which is our higheſt concernment, was the principal end for which we have Reaſon, and are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of judgment and choice. And they may as well ſay that 'tis dangerous for a man to walk abroad with his eyes open, as that 'tis dangerous for him to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf to judge as well as he can whether he be in the right way to Heaven or not.</p>

            <p>If we conſider what has been already ſaid, it will not be difficult to anſwer the ſecond Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether a liberty of examining and judging in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, doth miſchief in the Church, and be the cauſe of Hereſies and Schiſms? <hi>To which I anſwer, that</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To affirm this, is in effect to ſay, that it had been
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49019:7"/>
much better, in order to the peace of the Church, and the prevailing of Truth, that men had been nearer to ſtocks and ſtones, than endued with natural Abilities of judging, and natural propenſions to uſe thoſe Abilities; which I think would be to reflect upon the Wiſdom of our Maker. For certainly it had been better for men to have wanted the faculties of judging and proving, if it be ſo dangerous a thing to the Church to make uſe of them. Nor is it much for the credit of the Church, that it ſhould be againſt her intereſt for men to examine her Doctrine, and uſe their Reaſon about it as well as they can.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak to the thing: It is not the liberty of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and judgment in order to the knowledge of the Truth, that cauſeth Hereſies and Schiſms, but the not making a right uſe of this liberty, <hi>i. e.</hi> mens entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this work with Pride, and the prevalency of Luſt and Paſſion, and worldly intereſt, their want of care and diligence, and of proving things ſufficiently; their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Opinions without reaſonable examination, and then ſeeking for Pretences to colour their obſtinacy. The Luſts and Vices of men are againſt the peace of the Church and the intereſt of Truth, but not the uſe of that Reaſon which is the divine part of our Natures, and which God hath given us to reſtrain and govern our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Faculties.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that if few or none troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at all to judge in matters of Religion, there would be no Hereſies. But 'tis true too, that if they had no reaſon to judge of theſe things at all, there would have been no Hereſies; and 'tis as true, that if there had been no Religion at all, it were impoſſible that there ſhould be Hereſies in Religion. But will any men ſay, that Reaſon or Religion is therefore the cauſe of Hereſies? And yet there is as much reaſon to ſay this, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49019:7"/>
that the uſe of our own underſtandings in the things of God, is the cauſe of Hereſies. Theſe things are too groſs to need a Confutation.</p>
            <p>And yet this Pretence againſt the liberty of proving what is propounded to us in Religion, is intended chiefly againſt private and ordinary perſons, but not againſt the publick Guides and Officers of the Church; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth, if there be any thing in it, it holds more ſtrongly againſt theſe than againſt the other: And that becauſe the moſt pernicious Hereſies that ever came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, were brought in by men of Learning and Authority in the Church. And if this Pretence be good, they of all men ſhould be forbidden to inquire into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; becauſe if they fall into any dangerous miſtake, their Authority is likely to give reputation to it, and to make it go down more eaſily with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, than if it had been ſtarted by one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So that we muſt not lay the Hereſies that have been in the Church, to the liberty we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for, unleſs we will be content to exclude <hi>all</hi> from the duty of proving what they have been taught to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>But if every man hath a juſt liberty and right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine for himſelf, is not this a good reaſon for Toleration, or for the univerſal liberty of practiſing according to a mans Conſcience or Perſwaſion?</hi> For to what purpoſe is liberty of enquiry, if after all, I muſt be concluded by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of my Superiours, or elſe ſuffer under thoſe Laws by which they provide for Uniformity in Religion?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That every mans right and duty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49019:8"/>
to judge for himſelf in matters of Religion, is no good reaſon for Toleration, unleſs it were alſo apparent that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man uſed that Right as he ought to do, <hi>i. e.</hi> with induſtry, deliberation, and impartiality. If all men were ſincere, and would examine without prejudice, without that byaſs to one ſide which is made by luſt and paſſion, and worldly intereſt, if they all intended to know the truth, that they might do their duty, then doubtleſs it were very fit that all ſhould enjoy an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed liberty of practice according to their Judgment; for then no man would err in things plain and neceſſary to his own ſalvation and the peace of Church and State. For our Lord hath aſſured us, that <hi>if any man will do the will of God, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God.</hi> But ſo long as there is that Hypocriſie in the World whereof men are conſcious to themſelves, ſo long as all thoſe Vices alſo reign, which inſenſibly corrupt the Judgment, and make men diſloyal to the Truth, while they perceive it not; it is by no means reaſonable that the State under which we live, ſhould leave us lawleſs, and free from all obligation of temporal Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties what <hi>Religion</hi> we profeſs, and what <hi>Communion</hi> we obſerve. For the moſt dangerous Pretence for the <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rying on of ſeditious and rebellious deſignes againſt the Government, is that of Religion: And a few men that mean nothing but their own greatneſs and power, ſhall be able to manage the Zeal of a ſuperſtitious Multitude againſt the Government for their own private ends, while they ſcorn the ſuperſtition of their Followers, and perhaps all pretence to Religion in their own hearts. And therefore it concerns the Government to take care that the true Religion be protected by the Laws, and then to provide by the moſt prudent methods that no other be profeſſed in the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that the end of all liberty to inquire and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49019:8"/>
judge for our ſelves is deſtroyed, if at laſt we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Laws, or be puniſhed for our refuſal: The contrary will be eaſily ſhewn to any one who believes that we are infinitly more concerned what will become of us in the life to come, than in our preſent fortunes. For ſuppoſe that they are Errours which Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to profeſs, and that they are unlawful things which it requires us to do in Divine Service, and that by a due and diligent examination of things I come to know this; do I get nothing by my enquiry, but the ſeverity of thoſe humane Laws that are againſt me? Do not I obtain the comforts of a good Conſcience, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving honeſtly endeavoured to know the truth, and in doing what I thereupon knew to be my duty? If I do hereby obtain Gods Favour at preſent, and ſhall obtain Gods Rewards in a better life, is not this worth all my care and ſincerity, though I ſhould get nothing by it in this World but Trouble and Perſecution?</p>
            <p>So that it is worth the while to examine the Doctrine impoſed upon me by Authority, though I know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that be it right or wrong, I muſt be puniſhed by man if I receive it not.</p>
            <p>True Religion, and our obſervation to profeſs Gods Truth, and to do his Will, ſtands indeed upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, and the Evidence of divine Revelation; but nevertheleſs, the profeſſion thereof ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and protected by the Powers of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by conſequence all falſe Religions ſhould be diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, and the profeſſion of them made uneaſie by their Laws: Scripture and Reaſon teach us, that they no leſs than <hi>Parents,</hi> ſhould uſe that Authority <hi>for God,</hi> which they have received <hi>from him.</hi> But if they, for want of ſincere tryal and examination, do themſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Iniquity or <hi>Hereſie</hi> by a Law, and turn the edge of their Power againſt the true Religion, they muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49019:9"/>
it to God at the day of Judgment, who hath <hi>ſhewed them</hi> as well as others, <hi>what is good</hi> and what he required of them.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Perſecution diſtinguiſhes between the <hi>Sincere</hi> and the <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> and as the <hi>inſincere</hi> ſtudy how to perplex the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to avoid the convictions that are upon their minds, and to reconcile their Apoſtacy to their Credit and Conſciences; ſo the <hi>honeſt</hi> inquire into the grounds of their Faith more diligently, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to ſtrengthen themſelves under Sufferings by a full aſſurance that they ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake, they ſearch into all the grounds of their Perſwaſion more narrowly than if they had never come under this temptation: and by this means the true Doctrine comes to be propounded to the World, with the advantage of ſtronger Arguments, and thoſe better managed than if it had never met with oppoſition.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>true Faith and Worſhip</hi> be eſtabliſh'd by Law, and the Penalties of Nonconformity be ſtrictly required; this is ſo far from hindring men from <hi>enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> that it lays an obligation upon a great many to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things impartially, who otherwiſe would never have looked but upon one ſide of the Queſtion; I mean all thoſe whom either Wantonneſs and Self-conceit, or Faction and Worldly Intereſt, or the undue admiration of mens perſons, and the like, would have held under a conſtant prejudice againſt Reaſon and Truth. A <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Argument</hi> for a good Cauſe, is very often a wholſom means to remove a carnal prejudice againſt it: And the Authority of the Magiſtrate can hardly be better uſed <hi>in matters of Religion,</hi> than to make ſuch a difference between the <hi>Obſervers</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Laws, and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from them, that it ſhall be very hard for any man to lie under a Worldly Temptation, to diſſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to recompence the damage he muſt undergo.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49019:9"/>
This will make a great many impartial in weighing the Objections againſt Conformity, with the Arguments and Anſwers on the other ſide, and by degrees bring them to the knowledge of the Truth, and at length to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love of it. It is a falſe Maxime, That <hi>Force in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion makes Hypocrites, but not true Converts.</hi> For ſometimes it cures <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> very often <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Partiality;</hi> and that is a good degree towards Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: And yet this will not juſtifie the putting of men to death for mere difference in Religion. The leaſt degree of ſeverity which will do the buſineſs, is great enough. The Supreme Powers ſhould conſider their Subjects in theſe caſes, as a wiſe and good Father would conſider his own Children; who if he had power of life and death over them, would not kill his misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Son, and yet would try to reduce him by World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſcipline, and drive him to conſideration by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effects of his Diſpleaſure. The moderation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws for Uniformity, is viſible to all diſintereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons; and though the unevenneſs of their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath rendred them leſs effectual, yet there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral who have cauſe to bleſs God for being compelled to come to our Churches, and to conſider the Terms of our Communion with ſome impartiality; whereas if there had been an <hi>abſolute</hi> Toleration, their Ignorance and Prejudices might have led them they know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> cauſeth the Scriptures to be publickly read, and puts them into the Peoples hands, and deſires nothing more than that every one would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and impartially conſider the caſes between her and thoſe that ſeparate from her. And it is no abſurd thing to ſay, that this liberty of Judgment which ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, is conſiſtent with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws that require conformity of all; ſince if it had not been for thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49019:10"/>
Laws, ſome men had never attained to liberty of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but had ſtill been held in bondage to their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Errours. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they make the greateſt noiſe for <hi>liberty of practice,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Judgment, who have made little or no uſe of their Judgment in diſtinguiſhing between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, true</hi> and <hi>falſe.</hi> They demand one liberty, while they make no uſe of another; the liberty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>undiſturbed</hi> and <hi>licentious</hi> in a wrong way, while they never uſe that liberty of <hi>examining the grounds of their Perſwaſion,</hi> to which the Church ſo vehemently perſwades them by her Miniſters.</p>
            <p>If it be urged, that when a man ſets himſelf with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and diligence to examine the Caſe of Communion with the Chnrch, and doth all that he can to inform himſelf aright in this matter, but cannot be ſatisfied that he may lawfully conform, and this through mere weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of underſtanding; it is not reaſonable that he ſhould ſuffer any thing for that.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid on the other ſide, that there are many more who fail of underſtanding their duty in this kind, for want of examination and inquiry, and through the prevalency of Prejudice and paſſion, than there are of thoſe who continue erroneouſly perſwaded through mere weakneſs of underſtanding. But as for thoſe who in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect weakneſs remain unconvinced, if I may ſuppoſe any ſuch, I wiſh the Laws could diſtinguiſh them from the reſt, and that they could be known by ſome viſible characters, that they might be exempted from undergoing any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties. But ſince this cannot be, it muſt be endured that a few or none in compariſon, come to have hard meaſure, by means of that which is neceſſary for the common and publick good.</p>

            <p>Having premiſed thus much concerning this ſubject, I ſhall proceed in this method following.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To conſider in what caſes we are to enquire moſt of all into the Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew how or by what Rules or Teſts we are to try and examine Opinions in Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How we ought to be diſpoſed and qualified that our Inquiries may be profitable and ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To lay down ſome Motives whereby to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to ſuch Inquiry and examination.</p>
            <p n="5">V. To conſider what becomes us and is our duty, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſcovery and knowledge of the Truth.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I ſhall conſider in</hi> what caſes we ought to be moſt careful in making inquiries after the Truth, leſt we be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or miſtaken.</p>
            <p>All inquiries about Religion are either concerning the truth of Religion in the general; or ſuppoſing the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and providence of God, which is the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whether the <hi>Pagan,</hi> or the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> or the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> or the <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> or the truth of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being granted, what Communion of men profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſtianity, is to be choſen; for inſtance, whether the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Diſſenters who ſeparate from this Church.</p>
            <p>But now all things are not alike needful to be proved, or are equally proper matters of inqniry. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every man is not bound to know <hi>all the falſe ways</hi> of Religion that are in the World, and therefore not to try and examine every one of them. It is ſufficient for moſt men, that they well conſider the Faith and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49019:11"/>
to which they have been educated, that if it be the Truth, they may be well-grounded in it; if it be falſe, that they may upon good reaſon depart from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Things that are <hi>ſelf-evident,</hi> need not to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: for no Argument can make them plainer to us than they are already. We may without any heſitation aſſent to ſuch Principles as theſe: <hi>That God cannot lie; That men ought to obſerve fidelity and juſtice to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the like. If there were not ſome Principles that needed no proving, it were impoſſible to prove any thing; and the more plain any thing is in it ſelf, the leſs need there is to examine it. If I am told that <hi>white</hi> is <hi>black,</hi> I ſhall not go about to diſprove it, becauſe the thing is evidently falſe of it ſelf, and I can uſe no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can make the matter plainer than it was at firſt. In like manner, if any man pretends that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Vice and Virtue but in name, and that all things are equally lawful; this ſhall not put me to the trouble of examining the thing, becauſe 'tis contrary to the common ſenſe of mankind. And for this reaſon any man is to be excuſed that diſmiſſes the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> without taking much pains about it; becauſe upon a very little conſideration, there appears ſo many groſs contradictions and inconſiſtencies in it, that I can have no greater reaſon to believe any thing is true, than I have to believe that is falſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some things are hardly worth the examining, and it ſignifies little or nothing to underſtand the right ſide of the Queſtion. If the Doctrine of the <hi>immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Virgin Mary</hi> were true, yet it were not worth a quarter of the pains they have taken about it in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is by no means true, that an infallible living Judge is neceſſary upon Earth, and that for the deciding of all Controverſies in Religion; ſince all ſuch Controverſies are not neceſſary to be decided,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49019:11"/>
ſome of them being of ſo little concern to us, that it is no great matter if they remain Controverſies to the Worlds end.</p>
            <p>But we ought to uſe our Reaſon as well as we can to find out the truth in all thoſe caſes wherein it will be dangerous to be deceived; and therefore in theſe four:</p>
            <p>Firſt, When any man or company of men would gain us over to their way by lofty and extraordinary Pretences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When Doctrines are propounded to us with conſiderable Authority, which ſeem to encourage licentiouſneſs, and to render all care of living well needleſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When we are tempted to ſeparate from the Communion of the eſtabliſh'd Church where we live, or if we are in a ſtate of Separation from it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When Opinions in Religion are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us by thoſe that would get us to yield up our Judgments wholly unto them, and do what they can to keep us from examining them.</p>
            <p>A prudent man would examine in all theſe caſes;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>When men make extraordinary Pretences.</hi> The reaſonableneſs of which I have already ſhewn, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that Pretence of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. And the like is to be ſaid of thoſe that pretend to work <hi>Miracles,</hi> or that talk of <hi>immediate Revelations,</hi> of knowing the Truth by <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and of <hi>more than ordinary Illuminations.</hi> For it is not onely a childiſh thing to be frighted with big words from looking what is under them, but a very dangerous ſort of cowardize, to be afraid of calling thoſe things into queſtion which are ſet off with ſuch highflown Pretences. For from hence it has come to paſs, that <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49019:12"/>
               <hi>Enthuſiaſms</hi> and <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> have prevailed ſo much in the World. It is ſomewhat ſtrange that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve men the more, for that very reaſon upon which we ſhould believe them leſs, that is, for magnifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And yet if this had not been common, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> had not impoſed upon ſo great a part of the <hi>World,</hi> nor the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon ſo great a part of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> nor our <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> upon ſo many People in <hi>England</hi> as they have. I would not be backward to give that man a hearing, that pretends to great things in teaching Religion; but then I ſhould be ſomething forward to give him a tryal too: for otherwiſe I might encourage a very impudent Hypocrite to be more impudent ſtill, and to play upon my eaſineſs till I had ſwallowed all the fooliſh and damnable Opinions which he would have me believe for his own advantage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>When we meet with Doctrines that ſeem to ſtrike at the foundations of Morality and good living, we are to examine them too, before we yield our aſſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they be recommended by men of name and authority.</hi> For the end of divine truth is a good and holy life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould ſuſpect that to be falſe Doctrine, which in my judgment either takes away the neceſſity of Piety and Virtue, or diſcourages men from endeavouring to attain them. For inſtance, I find this Doctrine main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome men of great note, That God hath from all eternity abſolutely choſen ſome men to ſalvation, and reprobated the reſt, without reſpect to any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal qualifications. Now if this be true, I cannot ſee for my life how the obtaining of eternal happineſs, and the avoiding of damnation, depends upon any care of mine, or upon any thing that I can do, ſince every mans ſtate is abſolutely over-ruled by predeſtination and an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible decree; ſo that let me do what I pleaſe, all that I can do for another world will be but loſt labour, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49019:12"/>
might as well be ſpared. But if I am ſenſible of this, it is but reaſonable that I ſhould not rely upon the credit of the Author or of the Preacher for ſo perilous a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but becauſe it is pretended to be grounded upon the ninth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> I ſhould go to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle my ſelf, and carefully inquire into his meaning in that place, by the beſt Rules of interpretation that I can learn. And whoever goes thus impartially to work, will find that the Apoſtle in that place was diſcourſing of another Queſtion, and indeed upon a ſubject that has nothing to do with this Queſtion of abſolute Election or Reprobation of the perſons of men; and that though the words ſound that way to a man that is already prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, yet the meaning of them is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Suſpicion of Doctrines when it is grounded upon ſo good a reaſon as we are now ſpeaking of, ſhould cauſe inquiry, and then that inquiry will diſcover on which ſide the truth lies. He that would be a <hi>Libertine,</hi> and live as he liſts, may be pleaſed when he meets with any pretended Doctrine of Religion that will excuſe a wicked life, or diſcourage Virtue and holineſs; and therefore it is likely that he will reſt ſatisfied, and examine no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But an honeſt mind will not let a man deceive himſelf in this manner; but if it does not cauſe him to reject ſuch Opinions as ſoon as ever he has well ſatisfied himſelf of their conſequences, it will at leaſt keep him from admitting them, till he has tried them every way that he can.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>We ought alſo to be very well ſatisfied, and that upon much conſideration of the matter, before we ſeparate from the Communion of the Church where we live.</hi> For whatever ſome men may think of it, this is a buſineſs of ſo weighty a nature and conſequence, that it is not to be reſolved upon or continued in, till we are ſure we are in the right, and that upon moſt plain and evident reaſons.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49019:13"/>
And if there be any caſe in which a Chriſtian ought not to go raſhly to work, this is one. And therefore it is greatly to be lamented, that ſo many amongſt us preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the power of Godlineſs, ſhould make ſo light a matter as they plainly do of running into ſeparate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; it being very notorious, when one diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the point with them, that they never enquired why the Church-Aſſemblies were to be forſaken, and what it is in the eſtabliſh'd Forms of Worſhip, or in the Terms of our Communion, that makes it needful for an honeſt and wiſe Chriſtian to depart from it. And this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they take it to be a matter of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; for otherwiſe they would have applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with more diligence to weigh it in all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that belong to it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall offer ſome Reaſons in behalf of ſuch inconſiderate People, to convince them how bold and dangerous a thing it is to ſeparate from this Church of <hi>England,</hi> unleſs they were fully ſatisfied upon mature examination that there are juſt and neceſſary cauſes for ſeparation, ſuch namely as will make them ſinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, if they do not ſeparate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If without juſt cauſe I ſeparate from this Church, I do wilfully reject the great bleſſings and advantages of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, and muſt be anſwerable to God for ſlighting that merciful providence of his through which I happened to be born and bred in a place where I might enjoy the benefits of Church-Communion, without venturing at any diſorderly and ſinful practice for them.</hi> Surely it is no ſmall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, if my lot has been caſt where ſo great a bleſſing did, as it were, lie in wait for me, where the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine and way of Worſhip was recommended to me by publick Authority, and eſtabliſh'd by Law and Cuſtom, and defended to my hand by clear and ſtrong Arguments. If this be our Caſe in the Church
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49019:13"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> then my ſeparation from her (I ſay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) makes me guilty of a ſtupid and ungrateful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods exceeding mercies in diſpoſing my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this World ſo to my advantage, that I was <hi>born, baptized,</hi> and <hi>bred</hi> in a place where the Truth invited me, and was ready to receive me, before I made one ſtep towards a ſearch after her. Indeed to be baptized within the Communion of a particular Church, and to have been born and to live under that Authority which requires me to keep cloſe to it, is of it ſelf no ſufficient reaſon why we ſhould continue to be of it; but it is a mighty reaſon why we ſhould examine things carefully before we leave it, or take up a reſolution never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it, if we have left it already; becauſe if there be no juſt reaſon for ſeparation, we ſhall have the more to anſwer to God: For it is a great fault to neglect ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after the <hi>Truth</hi> in matters of this concern, even when it lies a <hi>great way off</hi> from a man; but it is much more inexcuſable to reject it when it lies <hi>at our doors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I had need be very careful and impartial in this caſe, ſince if the reaſons upon which I ſeparate be not really weighty and ſubſtantial, I am at once guilty of throwing off that ſubordination and ſubjection to the Paſtors and Guides of the Church, which the Chriſtian Profeſſion requires, and of contemning the lawful commands of my Superiours in the State, contrary to the Rule of the Goſpel which obliges me to ſubmit to their Ordinances. <hi>I ſhould not eaſily be led to a Practice where there is danger of ſuch a complicated ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I am to conſider, that <hi>differences in Religion and Worſhip, do dangerouſly affect the Peace of Kingdoms and all other Societies, eſpecially where the intereſts of Church and State are ſo mixed and interwoven together as they are in England.</hi> They that agree in Religion, are the moſt likely to be at peace, and to agree together in other
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49019:14"/>
things. But it ſeldom happens that they maintain hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty correſpondence in any thing, who are of oppoſite Communions in the ſervice of God. When the Unity of the Church is broken, there is a foundation laid of thoſe uncharitable cenſures and animoſities which for the moſt part end in violence and bloudſhed, very often to the diſſolation of Kingdoms and Nations. It were eaſie to put this out of queſtion by ſeveral inſtances of the ſad experience which Chriſtendom hath had of it. But the late and ſad Example hereof at home, is enough to make all others needleſs for our conviction. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion here was ſupported by nothing more than by difference about Religion. This was the principal cauſe that brought together ſo many People againſt the King, and that inſlamed them with anger and reſolution to venture all, till they had ſecured the King and enſlaved the Kingdom. I need not ſay (for ſure every body muſt be ſenſible of that) how diverſity of Religions weaken the Government, and render a People unable to do well for themſelves, to oppoſe foreign Enemies, and to uſe the moſt likely opportunities for the common ſafety and proſperity. Therefore in love to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and for the ſake of Peace at home, and of ſucceſs in all juſt Enterprizes abroad, we ſhould be very backward to violate the preſent Conſtitution of the Church, and to unſettle the ſtate of Religion, and never ſeparate from the eſtabliſh'd Communion, till we find our ſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it by Reaſons ſo plain and weighty, that there is no avoiding of it, if we would keep our ſelves honeſt men and good Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſetting of a bad example to others ſhould in this caſe be moſt conſidered.</hi> For if where a neceſſary Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in things of Religion is made by juſt Authority, or a lawful ſeparation made by private perſons from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion polluted with unlawful conditions; it is yet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49019:14"/>
very hard to keep the Example from being abuſed by others in reforming or ſeparating without any ſuch cauſe, and will ſtill be of worſe conſequence to ſet an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of wanton and unjuſtifiable ſeparation: for this is ſo plain a contempt of Authority, Order, and Unity, that others will be afraid to ſubdivide into more Parties, as Self-conceit, Ambition, or Revenge, or the like evil diſpoſitions ſhall prompt them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>If ſeparation ſhould not be made but with very great caution, for fear of incurring the guilt of Schiſm by a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unlawful departure from the Aſſemblies of the Church, and ſetting up other Aſſemblies in oppoſition to them.</hi> This in the judgment of the ancient Chriſtians was no leſs than for a man to cut himſelf off from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and if the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be but one, as the Scripture plainly tells us, he that divides himſelf from any particular Church that is a Member of this Body, divides himſelf from the whole Body. And therefore <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> were not accounted by the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> to be <hi>within the Church,</hi> although they retained the profeſſion of the <hi>Common Faith.</hi> And ſurely a man would well adviſe with himſelf about an action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be in danger of putting himſelf into that condition. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>one Body</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> was inſtituted by our Lord for very great and weighty reaſons, and particularly for the ſecuring of <hi>Brotherly kindneſs</hi> amongſt his Diſciples, who being Members of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould therefore love and care for one another more than other men are wont to do; and for the retaining of Profeſſors within the Rules of a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> life, from which if they ſhould break away by any ſcandalous practice, they were to be puniſhed for it by the ſhame of being turned out of the Communion of the Church, and by the loſs of the great advantages thereof. But it is evident, that they who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49019:15"/>
are guilty of dividing the Communion of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſetting up one Communion in oppoſition to another, without neceſſary cauſe, do what in them lies to render this proviſion for the <hi>maintenance of Charity</hi> and <hi>purity of Manners</hi> amongſt Believers, altogether ineffectual. And we ſee by experience that hatred and ill will, and looſeneſs of life, gains ground more by the <hi>Schiſms</hi> that are amongſt Chriſtians, than by any thing elſe; and no wonder, ſince men that are of different and oppoſite Communions do not uſe to love one another; and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons do not value the Communion of a true Church, nor care if for their ill manners they be turned out of it, when they can take Sanctuary in a pretended Church of another Communion, that makes as loud a claim to all the Priviledges of a Chruch-Society as that Church can do from which they have divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Which things being conſidered, we are not to wonder that in St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time <hi>Schiſm</hi> was accounted no leſs, but rather a greater fault than to ſacrifice to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols</hi> for the avoiding of perſecution. For though <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> ſimply conſidered be in it ſelf worſe, yet <hi>Schiſm</hi> in its conſequences is more pernicious. He that is the Head of a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> does more miſchief to the Church than if he turned a <hi>Pagan</hi> or a <hi>Mahometan.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from hence is this: That it concerns every man that ſeparates himſelf from an eſtabliſhed Church, it concerns him, I ſay, as much as his Soul is worth, to look to it that the cauſe of his ſeparation be juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſuch as will throw the guilt of <hi>Schiſm</hi> upon that Church from which he ſeparates.</p>
            <p>But alas, how few are they that examine the reaſons upon which they have broken away from the Church of <hi>England?</hi> How many, that when they are preſſed in good earneſt, can ſay no more for themſelves than that they have better preaching, and more ſpiritual praying
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49019:15"/>
elſewhere, than in our Pariſh-Churches? How will they abuſe our Prayers and call them <hi>Porridge,</hi> and ſuch other vile names, who never in all their lives ſo much as read them, and are not aſhamed to own that they have not? They call the Biſhops <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church <hi>Idolatrous</hi> or <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> who yet never well conſidered what <hi>Antichrist</hi> means, what is <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Superſtition;</hi> who have little or nothing to ſay, if they be asked what evil is in <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and in the <hi>Rites</hi> of our Worſhip. How many others are there who read the Books written to defend the ſeparation, but will not vouchſafe ſo much as to look upon any one that is publiſhed in behalf of the Communion of our Church? God of his mercy give a better Spirit to ſuch people, and Repentance to thoſe that have miſled them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We ſhould not eaſily believe thoſe men in matters of Religion, who would keep us from examining their Doctrines by fair ways of tryal, and would affright us into an implicit Faith, by pronouncing damnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that are not of their own way. If men uſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or ſubtlety to hinder us from judging for our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, there is great reaſon to ſuſpect that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to themſelves of a bad Cauſe which will not bear the tryal. I need not ſay how this reaches the Roman Church, which forbids the Laity to read the Scriptures, unleſs ſome one Lay-man has that ſpecial favour granted him of leave ſo to do from his Ordinary, who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is wiſe enough not to give this licenſe, but where he is ſure the party is faſt enough to the Cauſe of that Church.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the ſeparate Congregations beſt know what Arts are uſed to keep the people that go that way, from informing themſelves by reading our Books, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with our Miniſters about the matters in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49019:16"/>
between them and us. But we are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all of them, ſome of their Leaders teach them to pity our ignorance, and want of illumination; Alas, poor wretches that we are, <hi>we know not the things of the Spirit of God!</hi> we are ſtrangers to the life and <hi>power of Godlineſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they uſe to repreſent us. They take all the good names and promiſes of the Scripture to themſelves, and leave the threatnings of God, and the puniſhments inflicted upon his enemies, to us. Now this is but a cunning and indirect way to keep the People from heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any thing we can ſay to 'em, and to teach them how to conclude againſt us, without thinking it to any purpoſe to examine what is offered on both ſides. They that have a good Cauſe, need not uſe thoſe diſingenuous Arts; they will not fright men from conſidering what their adverſaries ſay, by denouncing damnation againſt them, nor forbid them to read their Books, but rather encourage them to do ſo, that they may ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Truth and Errour, between <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> with their own eyes. This is the effect of a well-grounded confidence in the Truth; and there is this ſigne of a good Cauſe apparently diſcernable in the Application of the Clergy of this Church both to their friends and enemies. They deſire both the one and the other to conſider impartially what is ſaid for us and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. And whatever Guides of a Party do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they give juſt cauſe to thoſe that follow them, to examine their Doctrines ſo much the more, by how much they are unwilling to have them examined. It is a bad ſigne when men are loath to have their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeen in the day, but <hi>love darkneſs rather than light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn in what caſes we are moſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to examine the Doctrines of thoſe that undertake to inftruct and guide us.</p>
         </div>

            <p n="2">II. Becauſe the duty of <hi>proving all things</hi> ſuppoſes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Teſts,</hi> by which Doctrines are to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and tryed, I proceed to ſhew what they are. Now it is very certain that the Rules by which we are to try Doctrines for our own ſatisfaction about them, are no other than thoſe want of Argument by which a wiſe man would prove the truth of his Perſwaſion to others for their ſatisfaction. And therefore it is plain that thoſe Rules muſt be common to me and to other men whom I would alſo guide ſo into the knowledge of that Truth to which I have attained. And they are theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is a common Rule to all men. 2. <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is a common Rule to all Chriſtians. 3. <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or the uniform Judgment and Practice of the Church in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity; which is a common Rule to thoſe who are verſt in the Hiſtories of the Primitive Church, and in the Writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The two former Rules are the principal and moſt neceſſary, and we are ſafe if our Perſwaſions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will bear the Teſt of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> and withal thoſe Rules are near at hand for every mans uſe amongſt us. But the laſt Rule is alſo of good uſe to thoſe that can uſe it, for their own confirmation in the truth, and ſtopping the mouths of gain-ſayers. But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Reaſon, I do not underſtand that <hi>Faculty</hi> by which we are men, and can compare one thing with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and argue and conclude, &amp;c. for this is that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power by which we uſe any kind of Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge of the truth or falſhood of Opinions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but I underſtand by it, thoſe <hi>common Truths</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49019:17"/>
which are natural to the minds of men, and to which we give a ready aſſent, without any need of having them proved by any thing elſe. For by theſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths we are to prove all things elſe; and if there were none ſuch, we could prove nothing. And they are ſuch as theſe, <hi>That nothing can make it ſelf; That the ſame thing cannot be and not be at the ſame time; That common ſence is to be truſted; That God is a being abſolutely perfect; That the Good is to be choſen, and the Evil to be refuſed;</hi> and that <hi>Contradictions cannot be true,</hi> and the like. Now whatever is by true conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence deduced from ſuch Principles, is thereby proved to be <hi>true;</hi> and whatſoever is repugnant to them, or can be diſproved by them, is <hi>falſe.</hi> They are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Propoſitions, with others as ſelf-evident as they; which make up that which we call the <hi>Light</hi> of Nature or of Reaſon. And I mention this Rule in the firſt place, becauſe it muſt be preſuppoſed to all other ways and means of enquiring after Truth, and without which nothing could be done in it; inſomuch that the belief of that Truth which is not to be deduced from mere natural Reaſon, but depends upon a divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is at laſt reſolved into a rational Act, and relies upon this natural Principle, that <hi>God cannot lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore they that cry down <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as if it were at no hand to be truſted in matters of Religion, and call it <hi>carnal, blind,</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> Reaſon, and ſuch-like vile names, if they are in good earneſt, they are incapable of ſearching after Truth themſelves, and of receiving any ſatisfaction from others. While they are in this humour, I may as well take a Beaſt to diſpute with, as go about to convince them. And if all men were thus ſenſeleſs, it were impoſſible that men ſhould be ſerviceable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct one another in the <hi>things of God.</hi> But to abandon the uſe of Reaſon in matters of Religion, and to ſcorn a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49019:17"/>
man when he ſpeaks conſiſtently, and argues clearly from common Principles of Truth, is ſuch a wretched ſort of unmanlineſs, that I cannot but think it is for the moſt part taken up in deſigne, by thoſe men that have brought Nonſence, and Contradictions, and abſurd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions into Religion; which no man can admit, without doing violence to his own underſtanding. For when Hypocrites have for their worldly intereſt debauched Religion in this manner, they know that the meaneſt people will never ſwallow their groſs abſurdities, unleſs they can firſt prevail with them to believe that 'tis a dangerous thing to truſt their own eyes, or to hearken to any diſcourſe from Principles of Reaſon, though it be never ſo clear and ſtrong; and that it is a kind of merit to believe things incredible, and to ſtick to a concluſion the faſter, the more impoſſible it ſeems to be true. But by the way, if Reaſon be one, and that the firſt means by which we are to judge for our ſelves in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as I ſhall make bold to ſay it is, I ſhould vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently ſuſpect, without farther examination, that they know their Opinions to be very fooliſh, who at firſt daſh renounce the moſt general and neceſſary Rule by which they are to be tried.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely adde, that becauſe the fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon are the ſame all the World over; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is therefore the moſt publick Rule and Teſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge between Truth and Errour. And therefore if a Council defines things in that manner, that I muſt forſake right Reaſon to follow its Definitions; when I make this plain, this is not oppoſing a <hi>private Spirit</hi> to a <hi>publick</hi> Judgment, but appealing from a leſs publick Judgment, to the moſt publick Sence and Judgment of mankind.</p>
         </div>

            <head>§ 6.</head>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Reaſon</hi> is a Rule to all men, ſo is <hi>Scripture</hi> a Rule to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> at leaſt it ought to be ſo; and all pretend to make it a Rule for their Judgment, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to it. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed allows it to be but <hi>part</hi> of the Rule of Faith; we ſay it is an <hi>intire</hi> and perfect Rule thereof. However, ſo long as ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the Scriptures to be a Rule, though ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends there is another Rule beſides that, ſhe is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the authority of the Scriptures; and ſo we are to be acquitted by her, in not believing her <hi>againſt the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now every body muſt grant that we do not judge rightly by the Scriptures, where we miſtake the meaning of the Text. And we ought to be ſure that the ſence wherein we take any place, is the true ſence, before we make our interpretation of it a Rule whereby to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine other things.</p>
            <p>Where the ſence is very plain, it requires nothing more than common ſence and common honeſty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; and it is very reaſonable to ſuppoſe that God hath revealed all points neceſſary to ſalvation ſo clearly and plainly, that it is not difficult for an honeſt man to underſtand what they are.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there are many obſcure places in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, we muſt be very careful not to ground any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon them, till we have well weighed and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the meaning of thoſe places; and the way to be ſecure from any dangerous miſtake in concluding from places of Scripture that are more or leſs hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is to obſerve ſuch cautions as theſe are, which I think all Chriſtians muſt allow to be reaſonable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we take no Text in a ſence which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49019:18"/>
to common Senſe and natural Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we put no ſence upon a place of Scripture that is repugnant to the general ſcope and deſigne of the whole Word of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we underſtand no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>difficult places in a ſence that is contrary to to thoſe places whoſe meaning is plain and manifeſt to all men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That we miſtake not thoſe places for plain, which are not ſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That we put no other ſence upon a Text than what agrees with the ſcope and deſigne of that particular Diſcourſe wherein we find it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Before we conclude upon the ſence of a Text, ſo as to prove any thing by it, we muſt be ſure that ſence is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to natural Reaſon.</hi> For if it be, it cannot be the true meaning of the Scripture. For God is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of natural Truth, as well as of that which comes by particular Revelation; and, as <hi>Hierocles</hi> ſaith, to <hi>believe and obey right Reaſon, and to follow God, are the ſame thing.</hi> And therefore no Propoſition that is repugnant to the fundamental Principles of Reaſon, can be the ſence of any part of Gods Book; and that which is falſe and contrary to Reaſon, can no more be true and agreeable to the revelations of Scripture, than God, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of one as well as the other, can contradict himſelf. From hence it is evident, that theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> are not to be underſtood in that ſence which makes for the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that contradictions ſhould be true; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more certain that any thing is true, than we are that that Doctrine is falſe. There are ſome other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines maintained by men of Name in the World, that they have no better grounds for, than obſcure Texts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted contrary to the Principles of natural Reaſon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49019:19"/>
and Religion. This caution therefore is to be minded in the firſt place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt put no ſence upon a difficult place, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the great end and drift of the whole Bible.</hi> Now that is, to work Faith in men, and thereby to bring them to repentance, and to a holy life. And therefore whatſoever Doctrine does naturally tend to take men off from the care of holy living, by nouriſhing them in fooliſh preſumption, or driving them to miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, cannot be the Doctrine of the Scriptures; and therefore ſuch a Doctrine cannot be proved from any obſcure Text of the Bible, and by conſequence that ſence of an obſure Text from which it may be proved, is not the true ſence, unleſs we can believe that ſome part of the holy Books teaches ſomething that undermines the great end of the whole. There are too many Opinions amongſt ſome Chriſtians that have no other colour for them, than Scripture interpreted without this neceſſary caution, which muſt therefore be added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt not underſtand a difficult place in a ſence that is contrary to thoſe places whoſe meaning is plain and manifeſt to all men.</hi> For the Scripture cannot teach one thing plainly in one place, and the quite contrary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely in another. It is but reaſonable therefore in trying to underſtand a difficult place, or in going about to prove any thing from it, that we ſhould compare Scripture with Scripture, and the obſcure places with thoſe that are plain; not to interpret the plain by the obſcure, which is contrary to all Rules of Diſcourſe, but the obſcure by the plain; eſpecially becauſe the plain places contain things that are moſt neceſſary to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and believed by us: and therefore we cannot without great danger forſake the Doctrine which they teach; as every man in effect does, who takes a difficult
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49019:19"/>
place in a ſence contrary to that Doctrine. In a word, the Scripture is our Rule principally where it is eaſieſt to be underſtood, and the meaning is moſt plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But this caution will be of greater uſe, if we take the next along with us; and that is this:</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> In trying Opinions by Scripture, we muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing careful leſt we miſtake thoſe places for plain, which indeed are not ſo, but more or leſs obſcure.</p>
            <p>And here I think it needful to ſhew what I mean by the plainneſs or by the difficulty of a Text. A Text is then plain, when that is the true and intended meaning of it which the firſt reading or hearing of the words doth ſuggeſt to a mans mind. And the Scripture is thus plain in neceſſary points, eſpecially in the Precepts and Exhortations thereof, which though in ſome places they are couched under more obſcure terms, yet in others they are delivered with this plainneſs.</p>
            <p>A Text may be ſaid to be difficult, when we do not hit of the true and intended ſence upon the firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or gather it from the bare ſurface of the words, but muſt ſearch and enquire farther to know it.</p>
            <p>And there are two ſorts of difficult Texts in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Some places are ſo hard to be underſtood, that upon the firſt reading of the words or phraſes, no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable or intelligible ſence can be put on them at all, without a great deal of farther ſtudy and enquiry; the difficult places of which ſort are more ſeldom perverted to maintain any ill Opinion: for no body goes about to make a Text a Scriptural proof of any thing, without he firſt determines with himſelf in what ſence to take it; and as for the hard places of this kind, it being not obvious at the firſt reading what ſence they can bear, a man cannot well offer to prove any thing by them. The other ſort of difficult Texts are thoſe which being taken by themſelves, do upon the firſt ſight or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49019:20"/>
ſound of the words, ſeem to have a plain ſence and meaning, which yet are not to be underſtood in that ſence the words will be upon the firſt reading of them; and theſe are the hard places in Gods Word which are moſt perverted, and taken in ſuch ſence as the Holy Ghoſt never intended: for then is an hard place like to be wreſted, when it ſeems plain to him who doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; and a difficult Text may ſeem plain to him who for want of ſtudying and conſidering, thinks he underſtands it, but doth not.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance in ſome difficult Texts of the latter ſort, which have been miſtaken for plain (that is) er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly taken to have ſuch a meaning as they appear to have upon the firſt reading.</p>
            <p>In the ninth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> we have theſe words, <hi>That it might not be of works, but of him that calleth:</hi> ſome take this for a plain place, and therefore think it a clear ſcriptural truth, that our <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is not at <hi>all of our works, but onely proceeds from an abſolute decree of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again we have it affirmed by the Apoſtle in the ſame Chapter, <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Hence ſome think it is plain in Scripture, that what we do ſignifies little, all is from an arbitrary favour of God.</p>
            <p>Again, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. we find theſe words, <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another?</hi> From the ſound of which words ſome gather that we are not free Agents in our own converſion; but that if we be better than our Neighbours, it is an Almighty Power hath made us ſo, and not any free choice or care of our own.</p>
            <p>Now certain it is, that we miſtake the meaning of a Text of Scripture, if we look upon it as plain when it is not ſo; and conſequently, in this caſe we cannot be able to judge what is orthodox or erroneous, by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to any Scriptures ſo miſapprehended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:49019:20"/>
But how can I know when a place is but ſeemingly plain, and not really ſo, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> when I am not to take that to be the meaning of the place, which I may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend upon the firſt running of the words and ſound of the phraſes?</p>
            <p>This is to be known by comparing places together, and going by this Rule. A place ſeems onely to be plain, but is not, when it's uppermoſt ſence, and what it offers to us, does not agree with the ſence of a place undoubtedly plain. For inſtance, the Texts now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned may ſeem plain to thoſe who would prove their erroneous Perſwaſions to be ſcriptural Truths by them; yet if we ſuppoſe them plain, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> if we think they are to be taken in that ſence which they will bear at the firſt reading, then they are Texts undeniably repugnant to ſuch places of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as all muſt believe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be plain.</p>
            <p>For whereas he ſays—That <hi>it might not be of works,</hi> &amp;c. in another place he gives us this plain Precept, <hi>Work out your ſalvation.</hi> Is not ſalvation of works, and<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> yet muſt we work it out? Either therefore it is not true in the ſence ſome take the words, that ſalvation is not of works, or it is not proper to bid us work it out; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this plain place <hi>[Work out your ſalvation]</hi> we muſt conclude that the other place <hi>[That it might not be of works]</hi> whatſoever the ſence of it may be, it cannot have this meaning, that our ſalvation doth not depend upon our works or doings.</p>
            <p>In like manner, whereas the Apoſtle ſays <hi>[It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,</hi> &amp;c.] doth he not in a plain practical diſcourſe, wherein he compares the Chriſtian life to a Race, exhort us <hi>ſo to run that we</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 24.</note> 
               <hi>may obtain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is it not of running that we obtain? and yet doth he bid us ſo run that we may obtain? Wherefore the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49019:21"/>
plain Precept <hi>to run,</hi> &amp;c. evidently ſhews that it cannot be the meaning of the other place, that it is not by <hi>running</hi> or by diligence in a Chriſtian life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we obtain ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor 4. 7.</note> Again, whereas he asketh in one place, <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another?</hi> he alſo exhorteth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Be not conformed to the world.</hi> And therefore the meaning of the former clauſe cannot be, that the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> man who is <hi>more excellent than his neighbour,</hi> doth nothing towards the making of that difference: for then it would be very improper to exhort a man to make that difference, by not <hi>conforming to the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, it is evident that theſe places of St. <hi>Paul</hi> which I have now compared, cannot be <hi>all</hi> of them plain, for then they are irreconcilably repugnant to one another; and if they are not all plain, then ſome of them muſt not be thought to have ſuch a meaning, as the firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words might make us think they have. And therefore in judging things by Scripture, we muſt be careful that we do not prove or diſprove them by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures miſtaken for plain when they are not ſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We muſt alſo ſee that the ſence wherein we take a paſſage of Scripture that belongeth to a Diſcourſe, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the deſigne and ſcope of that Diſcourſe to which it belongeth.</hi> This Rule, as it is neceſſary for all to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ſo it is eſpecially to be urged upon men that are apt to interpret places that are not of themſelves plain, by thoſe Opinions that they are already poſſeſſed with a belief of, but for which they have little ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the mere ſound of ſome Texts, which at firſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeem to be of their ſide, but which, if they were compared with the deſigne of the holy Writer in that Chapter or Book, would be found to mean quite another thing. All that I ſhall ſay beſides of this Rule is, that the difficulty of many places that are not of themſelves plain, will be removed by obſerving it. For inſtance,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49019:21"/>
by this way we ſhall eaſily be ſatisfied, that that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place of St. <hi>Paul, Who maketh thee to differ from another?</hi> was chiefly meant of thoſe extraordinary gifts which were diſtributed amongſt believers in the firſt Ages of the Church; and therefore (though in a qualified ſence this is true of all ſaving Graces) it is very conſiſtent with all thoſe Scriptures that ſuppoſe the difference between the righteous and the wicked, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon ſomething which is in the power of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. If we mangle coherent Diſcourſes, and take a ſhred or a phraſe of Scripture by it ſelf, without regard to the main ſcope of the place, and this to prove what what we would have; we do not try our Opinions by Scripture, but we interpret Scripture by our own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn what Cautions are to be obſerved in judging by Scripture. I doubt not but all will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be very reaſonable and equal; and if all men had obſerved them, who have a juſt venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Scriptures, the Word of God had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood and leſs wreſted; unſound Divinity had not eaſily paſſed for Scriptural Truth, and all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe unjuſt Reproaches had been taken away which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> throws upon us for allowing to all Chriſtians the free uſe of Gods Holy Book.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the Rules of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third I mentioned was <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Catholick Tradition.</hi> Now if this Rule, as I ſaid at firſt, be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe, then they are in the beſt way to find out what is the true Chriſtian Religion by it, who ſtick to the Holy Scriptures, though they are not capable of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it otherwiſe. For if that be true which was moſt anciently taught and believed in the Church, and which was received all along in the beſt Ages of the Church;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49019:22"/>
then he that can prove his Faith by Scripture, has the Argument of <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably on his ſide, becauſe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the moſt ancient Records of our Religion, and they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down to us as ſuch from the beginning through all Ages to our preſent times. But we acknowledge alſo the teſtimony of Antiquity of ſomething of a later date, that is, of the antient Fathers of the Church, to be of very good uſe for the clearing of ſome places in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for ſhewing what <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was left in the Church by the Apoſtles; for confirming us in points of Faith grounded upon the Scriptures, but which have been diſputed and oppoſed by <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for confuting thoſe groſs errours in Belief or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which of later days have been brought in amongſt Chriſtians, eſpecially thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But how things are to be examined by this Rule, I ſhall not<note place="margin">Diſcourſe about Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhewing, &amp;c.</note> here direct, becauſe this is the ſubject of an excellent Diſcourſe already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning Rules whereby to try O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in Religion.</p>

            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> wherewith we are to ſearch for the Truth by theſe means, are alſo of neceſſary conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: for whatever other advantages we have, if we be greatly defective in theſe, we ſhall very often loſe our labour, and fall into miſtakes of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>To qualifie a man for receiving Truth when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with ſufficient evidence, or to find it out by his own ſearch, there muſt be theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A prepared mind. 2. Competent Diligence. 3. Prayer to God for his bleſſing upon that Diligence.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49019:22"/>
1. <hi>A prepared mind,</hi> which our Saviour calls a <hi>good and honeſt heart.</hi> Now this conſiſts in <hi>Humility, Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humility</hi> is neceſſary, becauſe <hi>overweening</hi> and <hi>ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi> makes a man apt to deſpiſe what thoſe of a different Perſwaſion can ſay for themſelves, before their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are conſidered; and in general, to neglect that help which may be had by the advice and reaſoning of others. So likewiſe <hi>vain-glory</hi> fixeth a man in an errour he hath once defended; and while he is unwilling to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a miſtake, he ſtrains all his Wit to delude himſelf into a ſtronger belief of it, and of his ability to defend it. In Controverſies he is deſirous of <hi>victory,</hi> and would fain be thought <hi>ſome-body;</hi> and therefore he ſtudies more to expoſe an adverſary, than to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And if he be yet to chuſe his ſide of a Queſtion, he takes the wrong one, if it be more faſhionable than the right. Therefore ſays our Saviour, <hi>Whoſoever doth not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child,</hi> i. e. with a meek and pliable ſpirit, <hi>ſhall not enter therein.</hi> Again, ſays he, <hi>My ſheep hear my voice;</hi> intimating that they would be eaſily convinced who were of tractable and humble minds. And therefore he adds concerning the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that they rejected him, becauſe they <hi>were not of his Sheep,</hi> i. e. becauſe of their haughty and inflexible diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prejudice</hi> is apt to bar the mind againſt conviction as well as <hi>Pride,</hi> and therefore to <hi>Humility</hi> we muſt adde <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> by which a man is qualified to diſtinguiſh between the ſuggeſtions of Prejudice on the one ſide, and the force of good Reaſons on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ingenuity</hi> is oppoſed to thoſe Prejudices that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unavoidably contracted, or taken up through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49019:23"/>
Of the former ſort are the Prejudices of <hi>Education,</hi> or converſing altogether with our own Party. Men are generally prepoſſeſs'd with great favour to thoſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in which they have been all along trained up, and which have been inſtilled into them by all that they have converſed with. And therefore we cannot be meet Inquirers after Truth, if we want the ingenuity of ſuſpecting our ſelves on this ſide, and trying thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions in which we have been bred up, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impartiality and ſeverity.</p>
            <p>Some men are prejudiced by an unaccountable incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation toward an Opinion, or an antipathy againſt it; and theſe ought the more carefully to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the warmth of their imaginations on the one ſide, and the force of Arguments on the other; and not to take a paſſionate fondneſs for a concluſion, or an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it, to be a Reaſon one way or other. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incident to weak minds, to prejudg in favour of their Opinions whoſe perſons they admire, and moſtly to that degree, as not to hear with any patience an Argument againſt them. Such a <hi>Precious man</hi> ſaid this or that, and therefore no body muſt ſay otherwiſe. But it is at once diſingenuous and ſilly, to entertain ſuch an opinion of any man, as to take all that he ſays for Goſpel; for the beſt men are fallible, and 'tis eaſie for an Hypocrite to make himſelf paſs for a Saint in the opinion of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary people: and therefore men may be led into great errours, whoſe judgments are captivated in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>To this we may adde that Prejudice which ariſes from conceiving hard things of mens perſons; which an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous man will by no means yield to, but will conſider what another ſays, though he does not fancy the man. It is reaſon enough with ſome people to reject all that their Miniſter ſays to convince them of their miſtakes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49019:23"/>
if he be called a <hi>High Church-man,</hi> or goes for an <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian;</hi> and all this while they ſtand in their own light, and will not ſuffer themſelves to be inſtructed in many profitable Truths which they might learn. Thus the Jews, though they were aſtoniſhed at our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Works, yet believed not; and this becauſe they were offended at him for the meanneſs of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</p>
            <p>Some are ſo weak as to be prejudiced againſt Opinions and Practices, meerly becauſe they have heard them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten abuſed, nicknamed, and inveighed againſt in a rude and reproachful manner. And this goes a great way with ſome Diſſenters to make them deaf to all our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that when they are got together, they hear the Rites and Prayers of our Church ſcoffed at and called by vile names. But it ſtands not with the leaſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, to run away with prejudice againſt things that are abuſed and laugh'd at, without examining whether there be reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sincerity</hi> is oppoſed to thoſe Prejudices that ariſe from <hi>vicious affections</hi> and <hi>worldly intereſts;</hi> and it conſiſts in a firm reſolution to do the Will of God, and a vehement deſire to know it for that end. And this is a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preparation to know the Truth, becauſe nothing is more common than the perverting of mens judgments by the inordinacy of their luſts, and the ſerving of a corrupt intereſt.</p>
            <p>The love of any Vice makes a man partial and inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in examining the truth of that Doctrine by which he ſtands condemned. The belief of it is uneaſie to him; it is not for his intereſt that it ſhould be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is the reaſon why the <hi>fool ſaith in his heart, There is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The worldly intereſts of men do ſtrangely byaſs and faſhion their Judgments. It were a thing never enough
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49019:24"/>
to be admired, that ſo many men of Parts and Learning ſhould not be aſhamed of thoſe pitiful grounds upon which they maintain the <hi>Supremacy of the Pope,</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Purgatory,</hi> the <hi>Half Communion,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> and the like; but that thoſe things do notoriouſly ſerve the Wealth and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Roman Church. If it be needful to go to a Conventicle for the getting of a rich Fortune, or the bettering of a mans Trade, a little enquiry will for the moſt part ſerve his turn, and ſatisfie him that the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is lawful, and the Cauſes of it are juſt. A man ought to ſet aſide all conſideration of his worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and to propound eternal life to himſelf as the end of his inquiry, when he labours to know the Truth.</p>
            <p>The affectation of Popularity, and the love of Praiſe and Flattery, cannot conſiſt with a ſincere love of the Truth, and does very often hinder the attainment of it. It is hard to convince men of thoſe things that check their vainglorious ends and purpoſes. And therefore ſays our Saviour, <hi>How can ye believe in me, that receive honour one of another, and ſeek not that honour which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of God onely?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wiſe man exhorts us to <hi>buy the truth,</hi> intimating thereby that we muſt quit all our ſinful luſts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and our carnal intereſts in proſecuting of it. In a word, we muſt be in mind prepared to believe all truth, by being reſolved to do whatſoever appears to be the Will of God, let what will come of it in this World, having our hearts evermore fixed upon the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of eternal life. And this is more neceſſary for the beſt knowledge, than vaſtneſs of Parts and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Where the mind is thus prepared, there will be little need to preſs the two remaining Diſpoſitions; whereof the former is,</p>

2. <hi>Competent diligence.</hi> Errour is ſometimes made to look ſo like the Truth, that a ſuperficial examination will not ſerve to diſtinguiſh one from the other. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Truth muſt be had by laying a great many things together, and the proof does not lie in one, but in many Arguments pointing the ſame way. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo a concluſion is offered with the ſhew of many <hi>Motives of credibility,</hi> which neither ſingly nor joyntly prove what is intended. And here patience and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry commonly helpeth more than quickneſs of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour bad the Jews <hi>ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> thoſe very men who in all probability had read them, but as it ſeemeth, not with diligence enough. It were very well, if thoſe that begin to ſtudy Divinity would not preſume upon the diligence and honeſty of others, whoſe Books they ſee full of Citations of Scripture; but take ſome pains to judge whether that be the true ſence in which they are quoted. For want of this, ſeveral have miſcarried in their firſt entrance upon this work; and the errours of men of name and authority, have been propagated. It would alſo be very happy for this Church, and for themſelves too, if the diſſenting people would not preſently conclude that what they read in the Books of their own way is all agreeable to Gods Word, becauſe they ſee abundance of Scripture in them, but would uſe ſome diligence to judge whether that be the true meaning in which the Scripture is there underſtood. It was doubtleſs with deſigne to catch ſuch ſlothful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of <hi>H. T.</hi> was publiſhed in our Language, wherein<note place="margin">Abridgment of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine printed at <hi>Doway.</hi>
               </note> he pretends to prove all the lewd Doctrines of the Romiſh Religion, by Texts of Scripture. But if any man will take the pains to examine his pr<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oofs, he ſhall find ſuch miſerable
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49019:25"/>
wreſting and perverting of the Scripture, that he will never truſt a Book more merely for ſtore of Scripture-Phraſes and Citations; but go to the Fountain of Truth it ſelf, the pure Word of God, to ſee whether the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of men are indeed the unpolluted ſtreams of that Spring, from whence they are ſaid to come.</p>
            <p>We muſt be willing to ſift things to the bottom, if we would not be impoſed upon. A very little pains will ſerve to make a man confident; but 'tis not a little that will make him confident upon ſafe grounds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To Diligence we muſt adde <hi>Prayer</hi> for the divine Illumination. In ſearching for Truth we muſt implore his help who is the God of Truth, whoſe Word is the Word of Truth, and whoſe Spirit is the Guide into Truth, that he would free our minds from all prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and corrupt affections, and from every thing which obſtructs a right underſtanding. If we <hi>lack wiſdom,</hi> we <hi>muſt ask it of God,</hi> who <hi>giveth his holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I dare appeal to all that read theſe Papers, if it had not been to the unſpeakable advantage of Gods Church, and the Souls of men, if all that profeſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity had inquired into the Controverſies of Religion (ſo far as they are concerned in them) <hi>with theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> that I have recommended. And therefore I do the more earneſtly deſire them to lay their hands upon their breaſts, and in good earneſt to ask themſelves if they have in this manner ſought the knowledge of the Truth; with a mind thus prepared, with impartiality and diligence, and conſtant Prayer for Gods bleſſing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. My next buſineſs is to offer ſome Conſiderations to perſwade our people to an honeſt and impartial tryal of Opinions in Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49019:25"/>
This indeed cannot be done by all with equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, becauſe of the difference of mens abilities; but ſomething is to be done by all, and every one is to do what he can, and God expects no more.</p>
            <p>If we chuſe a way of Religion at random, or without honeſt care to know the Truth, we are in great danger of falling into deluſion, becauſe there are falſe Religions and damnable Errours in the World. Saith St. <hi>John, Try the Spirits whether they be of God,</hi> becauſe <hi>many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> There was danger of running into grievous errour in the beſt and pureſt Age of the Church, if Chriſtians were not careful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine things. And ſurely the danger is greater in this corrupt Age, and this extremely-divided State of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It often happens alſo, I doubt for the moſt part, that Seducers are more diligent and wiſe to propagate Errour, than good men are to gain Proſelytes to the Truth. The former are evermore too hard for the latter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, peremptorineſs, threatning of damnation, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and lofty pretences, and where the caſe calls for it, in artificial addreſſes and inſinuations. And this makes our danger the greater, if we are not reſolved to try before we truſt.</p>
            <p>Nay, if we were ſecure from Impoſtors, yet becauſe no man is infallible, we ſhould not ſurrender up our Belief wholly to the Authority of any man, but judge of his Doctrine as well as we can.</p>
            <p>Becauſe there cannot be a ſtronger ground for our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any thing, than that <hi>God has ſaid it,</hi> we are to be very careful how we receive an Opinion, for which Texts of Scripture are multiplied one upon another, <hi>i. e.</hi> we muſt ſee whether they do indeed prove the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: for otherwiſe we may by the pretence of ſo great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49019:26"/>
Authority, be the more faſtned in ſome dangerous errour. We are expoſed to manifeſt hazard, if we are apt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a man for bringing much Scripture to ſerve his purpoſe, but not to think it needful to ſee whether thoſe paſſages of Holy Writ be pertinently applied or not.</p>
            <p>To this I muſt adde, that the errours we may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for want of enquiry and examination, may for ought we know, be of dangerous conſequence to our own Souls. Some there are that <hi>wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruction;</hi> and if we are in their way, they may wreſt them to ours too. We may inconſiderately take up Principles that will by degrees debauch our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and reconcile us to wicked practices, and in many inſtances eat out the ſenſe of good and evil, ſin and duty.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, by conſidering things as impartially and judiciouſly as we can, we ſhall not onely be ſecure from running into great errours, but the Doctrines of true Religion <hi>will become more plain to us,</hi> and we ſhall have a <hi>more clear and diſtinct apprehenſion of them;</hi> which will reward our endeavours with <hi>great pleaſure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</hi> For next to the delight of a good Conſcience gained by doing what we know to be our duty, there is no pleaſure more pure and agreeable to the beſt part of our nature, than that which ariſes from an improved knowledge in the things of God.</p>
            <p>And having well weighed and conſidered the grounds of our Perſwaſion, we <hi>ſhall adhere more ſtedfaſtly to that truth which we have learn'd,</hi> and not be eaſily unſetled by the <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> or the <hi>Confidence</hi> of ill men, being prepared to ſhew that there is no ſound Reaſon in the former, and no juſt Cauſe for the latter. And when Seducers perceive that we have inquired too far into things, to be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49019:26"/>
born down with peremptorineſs, or to be deluded with colours; they will be diſcouraged from attempting to draw us into their Net.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>it will be no little ſatisfaction to us, when we are going out of the world,</hi> that we have all along taken due pains to inform our ſelves in things of the greateſt concernment to us, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which regard our everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſalvation; and that the errours into which we may have fallen, were not to be imputed to want of honeſt diligence in inquiring after the Truth, but onely to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>we cannot have the conſcience of ſincerity upon good grounds,</hi> if we do not with diligence apply our ſelves to know all our duty, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all that divine Truth which is the Rule of it, or which leads to the performance of it. One character of that <hi>good and honeſt heart</hi> which our Saviour compares to the good Ground, is to <hi>underſtand the Word.</hi> And the reaſon why the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did not underſtand, was becauſe they <hi>were not of God,</hi> but <hi>of their Father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil whoſe luſts they did.</hi> One reaſon why God in his wiſdom permits Impoſtures and Errours to go up and down in the World, is becauſe this ſerves to make a more evident difference between thoſe that are ſincere and honeſt, and thoſe that are not ſo. For in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances good men will take the more pains to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Errour, while the inſincere either take up that Profeſſion which ſerves beſt for their worldly ends, or take occaſion by the differences that are in the World about Religion, to throw off all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Religion it ſelf. <hi>There muſt be herefies among you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that they which are approved may be made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>To which we may adde, that by honeſt endeavours
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49019:27"/>
to be rightly informed in matters of Religion, <hi>we do in ſome meaſure qualifie our ſelves for the happineſs of another life,</hi> and ſhew that we are diſpoſed heavenwards, and deſirous of that infinitely-better ſtate of things, where Darkneſs and Errour ſhall be done away. For one great part of the Reward promiſed in a better life, is that we ſhall know divine things more perfectly there, than we can do in this World. But this can be no happineſs to any but to thoſe that are lovers of Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this point with one conſideration more, That at this time we have very confiderable advantages and opportunities towards the diſcovery of Truth in the preſent Controverſies among us. We of this Church are perſwaded that <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other <hi>Sectaries</hi> do cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly divide from our Communion, and grievouſly ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and endanger their own Souls, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the quiet of the Church, by their ſeparation from it, and their combinations againſt it. And therefore ſome pains has been taken, more than ordinary, to ſhew them the errour of their way, by going through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points upon which they pretend to juſtifie their doings. And it is plain, as I have ſhewn already, that in things of this nature they are mightily concerned to know the Truth. And therefore if they neglect ſo fair an opportunity of examining things as is now offered them, they will have the more to anſwer for another day. The ſeveral Controverſies between <hi>this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and the <hi>Recuſants</hi> on the other, are ſtated and argued in a plain and familiar way, and brought down for the moſt part to the capacity of ordinary Readers. And therefore let both the one and the other look to it, that they do not either in obſtinacy or in lazineſs, or for worldly intereſt, put away the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49019:27"/>
Truth from themſelves. We ſhould be very ſorry if our endeavours ſhould have no other effect than to make them more inexcuſable at laſt. It will be our grief, but it will be their condemnation.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="9" type="section">
            <head>§ 9.</head>
            <p n="5">V. When after due examination, we have ſetled our ſelves upon true grounds, whether in keeping our firſt Perſwaſions, or in changing them (if we found they were wrong) for better: we muſt remember that there are duties incumbent upon us growing from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have gained.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to be <hi>thankful to God</hi> for the Truth we have learn'd. When we ſee how miſerably ſome men are miſtaken and deluded in things that are both plain enough, and of great moment, we ſhould not inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them and grow into ſelf-conceit, but into humility and gratitude to God, acknowledging it to be of his grace and goodneſs, that we are not led away into the ſame deluſions. We are indeed to thank him for all things that contributed towards our eſcape or recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If we have a better natural apprehenſion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than ſome others, who was it that made the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? If we had a good Education, and were put into a right way at firſt, it was God that choſe thoſe happy circumſtances for us. If we have recovered from any way of dangerous errour in which we were bred up, the converſation, the friends, the books, and all other means by which we came to be better informed, were miniſtred unto us by the good providence of God. And that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a good mind which either prompted us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, or prepared us to do it with ſucceſs, was likewiſe from his Grace. Finally, it was his Bleſſing that crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all. For <hi>every good and perfect gift cometh from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49019:28"/>
from <hi>the Father of lights.</hi> So that in effect God is to have all the praiſe. And if we make it our buſineſs humbly and thankfully to acknowledge all his goodneſs in that knowledge of the Truth to which we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, we ſhall reap this great advantage and comfort thereby, that by his grace and providence he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to us more and more knowledge, if it be needful for us; or at leaſt that he will not ſuffer us to fall into any dangerous errour. For we are not ſafe from damnable errours merely becauſe we believe the Truth at preſent; our perſeverance in it depends upon the Grace of God, which is forfeited by nothing ſooner than by Pride and Ingratitude. For <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> And if by the impiety of neglecting to acknowledge God in thoſe Bleſſings we have received from him, we ſhould provoke him to leave us to our ſelves; our Judgments though they be ſet right at preſent, will eaſily be depraved and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by vicious affections, and by degrees we may fall from one deluſion to another, till we come to believe the ſame things with thoſe men whom we were once apt to ſcorn or to pity for their ſtupidity and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Now the ways are very plain by which we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our thankfulneſs to God for the knowledge we have gain'd.</p>
            <p>We muſt do this in our dayly Prayers, if we would ſhew our ſelves grateful in any proportion to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the benefit we have received. We are to thank God for the <hi>leaſt of his mercies,</hi> becauſe we are <hi>leſs than the leaſt;</hi> and therefore for all the Bleſſings of this life, and of the outward man; that we are not blind or lame, that we have not diſtorted limbs, or a deformed ſhape. But is it not a more valuable Bleſſing ſtill to have a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49019:28"/>
mind clear from all foul and monſtrous errour, endued with ſoundneſs of Judgment, and repleniſht with the knowledge of Divine Truth? Does not this therefore call for particular acknowledgments and thanks?</p>
            <p>We muſt be ſure to expreſs our thankfulneſs by better obedience, and by improving in all Virtue and Piety, as we have improved in Knowledge. Otherwiſe we <hi>receive this Grace of God in vain.</hi> Knowledge condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to a mans true happineſs by leading him to do well; but if he holds the Truth in unrighteouſneſs, by <hi>increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing knowledge</hi> he does but <hi>increaſe ſorrow,</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he increaſeth his guilt. But that which I chiefly intend here, is this: That God by inlightning our minds with a more full diſcovery of the Truth, has laid upon us a great obligation in general to love him more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and to perform his Will in all things more readily and cheerfully than we have done. And this is true thankfulneſs, if becauſe God hath led us to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſome things which we were ignorant of heretofore, we do more heartily perform thoſe plain Duties, and obey thoſe divine Rules of which we were not ignorant before.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is a principal expreſſion of our gratitude to God, for being enlightned and undeceived our ſelves, to be charitably helpful for the undeceiving of others, and leading them into the knowledge of that Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which God by his providence and grace hath led us. For God is never more pleaſed with us than when we do good one unto another: And therefore our charity to our miſtaken Brethren, is the moſt acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Praiſe that we can offer to him. But this is ſo conſiderable a thing, that it ought to go by it ſelf for one remarkable uſe we are to make of having gained the knowledge of the Truth. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49019:29"/>
2. Let us conſider how we are after this to behave our ſelves to others. I have already told you, that in gratitude to God we are to do what we can to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe to whom we have opportunities to do this good office; and that becauſe <hi>God would have all men to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> This was that which our Lord ſaid to <hi>Peter, When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren;</hi> and if thoſe who are not thoroughly confirmed in the Truth are to be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtructed, there is the ſame reaſon for endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to recover thoſe that are quite out of the way. Therefore if any of our Friends and Acquaintance, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom at any time we have a good opportunity of inſtructing, remain under thoſe errours that we have forſaken, and have diſcerned good cauſe to forſake; we muſt remember that though it was chiefly by the grace and diſpoſal of God that we came to a right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yet it was alſo by humane means, by converſing with others, or by reading their Books. And therefore we ſhould take our ſelves to be fit Inſtruments under God for the reducing of them, by deſiring them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly either to hear what we have learned from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to read thoſe Books by which we have been convinced. And we ſhould be the more earneſtly engaged in this charity, becauſe thoſe whom we may prevail withal, will thereby be engaged to help others alſo; and by this means our diligence and charity will be bleſſed with the good ſucceſs of propagating the knowledge of Truth ſo far, that we ſhall not be able to ſee to the end of it. If therefore thou art convinced that thy former Perſwaſions were erroneous, and thy Practices groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon them unjuſtifiable, be not aſhamed to confeſs thy miſtake, but ſhew thy ſelf glad that thou art now better informed; and go to thy Friend and tell him
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49019:29"/>
that thou art fully perſwaded thy was has been wrong all this while, and ſhew him theſe Arguments that have ſet thee right, that he, as well as thy ſelf, may rejoyce in the diſcovery of the Truth, and have the ſame reaſon to bleſs God that thou haſt.</p>
            <p>Now when we are thus reſolved, let us by no means forget in what manner we are to apply our ſelves to our miſtaken Brother for his information, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wiſdom,</hi> in <hi>the ſpirit of meekneſs,</hi> without railing and bitterneſs, though we ſhould meet with unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome oppoſition, remembring that we our ſelves not long ſince were under the ſame miſtakes, and had the like fondneſs for thoſe erroneous Opinions which we would now reſcue our Brother from. If he does not take information and receive inſtruction as faſt as we did, we muſt not preſently grow into paſſion; for ſome mens prejudices are greater and ſtronger than others, and all men have not the ſame capacity of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and quickneſs of apprehenſion; and therefore more time is to be allowed, and more patience is to be uſed for the recovery of one man, than may be needful in the caſe of another. And becauſe nothing puts a ſlow or a prejudiced man more backward than rough and bitter diſcourſe, therefore more meekneſs, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and patience is requiſite in dealing with him, than if we had to do with one of better wit or leſs prejudice. When we would bring a man to the Truth, we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all things that will be ſure to drive him at a farther diſtance from it, as clamour, fierceneſs, and railing will certainly do. For this carriage does but harden the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and confound the ſimple.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we are convinced of the Truth, as we muſt not be aſhamed, ſo neither muſt we be afraid to own it, but conſtantly adhere to it by profeſſing it, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49019:30"/>
according to it, whatever we loſe or ſuffer for ſo doing. For otherwiſe we are convinced to no other purpoſe than the increaſing of our guilt, for <hi>he that knows his Maſters will and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> If therefore thou haſt hitherto been a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> but art now convinced of the impious Doctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> but art now ſatisfied that there is no juſt ground for ſeparation from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> be not afraid of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Accuſations of thoſe whoſe errours thou haſt left, no, not though your dependance be in a great meaſure upon them, or your expectations of worldly advantage from them be never ſo great. Conſider that thy ſalvation lies at ſtake, and that the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods love is not to be preferred before their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and that you are now to ſhew that you do not <hi>love the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God.</hi> Tell them that you will be ſtill glad of their friendſhip, but that you cannot purchaſe it at ſo dear a rate, as to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God for it, either by renouncing that which you are throughly convinced is Gods Truth, or by going contrary to a Conſcience well informed of your duty. Let them know that you have been at a great deal of pains to diſcover the truth in theſe matters, and more than they have been at; that you value that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your duty to which the Grace and Providence of God hath led you, at a more juſt rate than to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it to every worldly intereſt; and that the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry you have uſed to inform your ſelf aright, would turn to a very evil account, if after all, you ſhould play the Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>When we have the Truth, <hi>our loins muſt be girt about with it;</hi> we muſt love it heartily, profeſs it ſincerely, and contend for it earneſtly, and practiſe it honeſtly.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49019:30"/>
When we have <hi>bought the Truth</hi> by diligent and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enquiry, we <hi>we muſt not ſell it</hi> for the gain of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wealth or Honour, or any other ſecular advantage, no not for the ſafety of our lives. The ſum of all, is this: <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
