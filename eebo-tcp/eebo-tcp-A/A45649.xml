            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE Sir John Walter, Bar.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UNder the present <hi>License of the Press,</hi> and <hi>Freedom of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> Two very fair Establish'd <hi>English</hi> Liberties; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I have the Umbrage even of a <hi>Law</hi> on my side, to Authorize my Presumption, in paying this publick Devotion, to so Worthy a Patron; and fixing so fair a Name, in the Frontispiece of so poor a Trifle.</p>
            <p>You must pardon me, Sir, if I lay hold of all occasions, and every Argument to warrant my Ambition: Besides, I have a stronger Charter than Poetick Priviledge, 'tis my Gratitude that dictates to my Pen; You have already vouchsaf'd to Honour me with your Smiles, (and where such Goodness descends, 'tis natural for our Pride to aspire) whil'st warm'd and animated by that only Encouragement, I am embolden'd to make you this Dedication; insomuch that my present <hi>Devoirs</hi> have more of the Thanksgiving, than the Prayer; a Duteous Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for Blessings already received. And here I must avow to the World, That in Addressing to a person Enrich'd with so many Generous Accomplishments, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> set not out a Discoverer, a <hi>Columbus</hi> to any unknown Golden Coast: No, Sir, Your
<pb facs="tcp:40531:3"/>
past Favours have swell'd my Sails, whil'st I am carried by a fair <hi>Levant</hi> to an open free Port, and a Hospitable Shoar.</p>
            <p>That Sweetness of Temper runs through all Your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, so free from any Allay of Pride, (that too common Taint of Prosperity,) that You have all the Sweets of the Rose, without the prickles. Your Goodness so Frank, and so diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and the Access to it so Easie, that those who have the more particular happiness of Your nearest Intimacay, and Friendship, find those Charms in Your Conversation, that they are scarce (pardon the seeming Contradiction,) to be enjoy'd: For the more they are possest, the more they are desir'd.</p>
            <p>HONOUR, and GALLANTRY are not only Born, but bred up with You. You Challenge not only all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a Fair and Generous Birth, but You have all the Improvements of a Generous and Sprightly Genius too, with so forward, so hopeful, and so growing a Merit (that ample Addition to your Hereditary Desert) that the Stem is a Grace to the Root.</p>
            <p>If Providence does ever <hi>Study</hi> for her Fair Creations, she <hi>Thinks</hi> when she makes a Compleat Gentleman. And Fortune in the Donations of her Golden Favours upon You, has not Showr'd them at Random; she found that WORTH, that challeng'd her Smiles, and her Graces are not her Gift, but her Reward.</p>
            <p>But to all Your other Felicities there's the chief one yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to compleat the Summ; the Charms of LOVE, that double Heaven of Joy, where You must give Blessings when You receive them. And here I must beg your leave, to wish You that truly fair and Virtuous Choice, That like the Famous Youth of <hi>Troy,</hi> You may have Rival Beauties all waiting when your kind Hand shall give the Prize, and bestow the <hi>Ball</hi> of <hi>Gold.</hi> And truly, the Generous and the Brave shou'd ever make <hi>Love,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40531:3"/>
their nearest Care. For indeed, Love is the only Foundation of Immortality. For though Noble Virtues, a Sweet Fame, and Fragrant Memory may keep a fair Name alive; yet to make Your self live for Ever, You only want a Lovely Feminine Partner, to draw Living Copies from so Excellent an Original.</p>
            <p>But I must not dwell too long upon this Subject, For as Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are by Custom, only the Panegyricks upon the Patron's Virtues, possibly to so much Modesty, (one of your most shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Perfections,) I may make but ungrateful Musick on that Theme. Yet why shou'd WORTH and HONOUR any more Blush to hear their own just Praises, then the Hero, or Monarch his <hi>Triumph,</hi> or <hi>Coronation</hi> Song. The Theme on this side may be as Copious, and as inspiring as that; Desert and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause are not confin'd only to Palaces and Thrones; the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet</hi> sometimes may Sparkle, as well as the <hi>Diadem.</hi> 'Tis true the Encomiums of Extraordinary Desert; are what my poorest of Quills shou'd not presume to attempt, as being a Province for the Elder Sons of <hi>Apollo</hi>; and yet when I consider, that the Ayres that are tuned but to an Oaten Pipe, may be as chearfully and heartily Sung, though not so sweetly and loud as to a Silver Trumpet; I have that only Plea for this Boldness, which gives me the Honour of Subscribing my self,</p>

            <l>THREE Ways there are, and all accounted fair,</l>
            <l>To gain your Favour: Begging, Borrowing, Prayer.</l>
            <l>If as a Beggar, I your Alms implore</l>
            <l>Methinks your Charity shou'd aid the Poor;</l>
            <l>Besides, I never beg'd of you before.</l>
            <l>If I address by Prayer, and loud Complaints</l>
            <l>I then oblige yee, for I make you Saints;</l>
            <l>And sure none here can think it Superstition,</l>
            <l>To pray to Saints that are of no Religion!</l>
            <l>If Invocation will not do my Work,</l>
            <l>A Man may borrow of a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Pray lend me Gentlemen your Applause and Praise,</l>
            <l>I'll take it for as good as Currant Bays;</l>
            <l>And if I ne're repay it, 'tis no more,</l>
            <l>Than many of you Sparks have done before:</l>
            <l>With this distinction, that you ran indebt</l>
            <l>For want of Money, we for want of Wit.</l>
            <l>In vain I plead! a Man as soon may get</l>
            <l>Mill'd Silver, as one favour from the Pit.</l>
            <l>—Hold then— now I think on't,</l>
            <l>I'll e'en turn Thief, and steal your kind Affection,</l>
            <l>And when I've got your Hearts, claim your protection:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:40531:4"/>You can't <hi>Gazette</hi> me sure for such a crime,</l>
            <l>Since neither Mare nor Lap-dog, I purloin:</l>
            <l>While you Rob Ladies Bosoms every day,</l>
            <l>And filch their pretious Maiden-heads away;</l>
            <l>I'll plead good nature for this Brat the Play:</l>
            <l>A Play that plagues no more the thread-bare Theme</l>
            <l>Of powder'd Beaux, or tricks o'th' Godly Dame,</l>
            <l>But in your humours let's ye all alone,</l>
            <l>And not so much as Fools themselves runs down.</l>
            <l>Our Author try'd his best, and Wisemen tell,</l>
            <l>'Tis half well doing to endeavour well:</l>
            <l>What tho' his poor Allay runs not so fine;</l>
            <l>Yet, let it pass as does our present Coin;</l>
            <l>For wanting fairer Ore, and riches mould</l>
            <l>He stamps in Brass, what others print in Gold:</l>
            <l>Smile on him but this time, the next perhaps,</l>
            <l>If he guess right he may deserve your Claps.</l>

                     <p>What a trembling Trade's this, when Conscience, that shou'd be our only Guide, flies and leaves us to our accusing Guilt. A Thief! the very Name and Thought chills my Blood, and makes me tremble like an Ague-fit. A Dog, nay every Bough that moves, puts us in fear of present Apprehension. Sure I shall never thrive on this Trade: Perhaps I need take no further Care, I may be now near to my Journey's End, or at least in a fair way to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the only Place that we poor Rogues can claim for an Inheritance. Trust a Woman, and with a Matter of such Importance, what a simple Dog am I? I cou'd find in my Heart to run away: And that were base to run from a Woman; I can lay claim to nothing but her Vows, and those the Women seldom or never mind.</p>

<stage>[embraces him]</stage>
When first my rigid Fate threw on me this Command to fight, I had recourse to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whom I always thought my Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when the Touchstone of my Danger try'd 'em, I found 'em like the cursed Fruit of <hi>Sodom,</hi> fair without, but rotten at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40531:14"/>
the Heart: But then I found out <hi>Bonvile,</hi> my only dearest Friend. <hi>Bonvile</hi> no sooner heard of my Engagement, but flew unto my Succour with as much Bravery, as a great General hastned by Alarms, marches to meet the Foe: You left your Nuptial Bed perhaps to meet your Death. O unheard-of Friendship! My Father gave me Life, 'tis true; but you, my Friend, support my Honour. All this for me, while I, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Man, thus seek your Life: For to my eternal Horror be it spoke, you are the Man whom I come here to kill.</p>

Scarce had we passed by <hi>Marget</hi> on our Course, when on a sudden, from the Top-mast head, a Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler cries, All hands Aloft, three Sails ahead: With that we rumidg and clear our Deck, our Gun-room arm'd, and all things now are ready for a Fight. The Ships before descried, with warlike Stems cut the resisting Waves, whilst from their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants fluttering in the Air, we found they were three <hi>Dunkirk</hi> Privateers; they having made our English Cross advanced, salute us with a Broad-side, to make us strike and yield: But we, who ne're knew as yet what 'twas so cowardly to yield, and not regarding their unequal Odds, fell boldly on, returning Fire for Fire. The Engagement then grew desperate, for they on either Side fired in amain, whilst we withstood their Force. At length they boldly grappled, and laid us close aboard, and we as bravely beat them off again.</p>

                  <p>Why the short and the long of the Business is this; I made a Purchase lately, and in that I did estate the Child (about which I'm sued) Joint-Purchaser with me in all the Land I bought.</p>

                  <p>Right Husband; and you know 'twas I that advised you to make the Purchase, and therefore I'll never give my Consent to have the Child brought up by such a stinking Tar-barrel as now sues for him; he'd only bring him up to be a Swab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; no, no, he was born a Merchant and a Gentleman, and he shall live and die so.</p>

                  <p>O, Sir, that's no Question to be ask'd in these Times: Women <hi>have found a way to make use of other Keys besides their Husbands: And no doubt but</hi> Summerfield <hi>has got a Key will open your Daughter's Lock as well as</hi> Bonvile<hi>'s.</hi>

                  <p>Sirrah you lie, you lie Sirrah; and I'le tell thee thou ly'st, again and again, so I will. Nay, and I were to pay a 100 Pounds for every Lie I give thee, as Men do Twelve-pence for every Oath they swear, I wou'd spend all the Thousands I am worth, in giving thee the Lie. 'Tis likely indeed, that such a brave Gentleman as <hi>Summerfield,</hi> that fought at Sea like a Dragon to save my Life, should shorten my Days on Land in ruining my Daughter; therefore once more I tell you you Lie.</p>

                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, aye, aye; that's all one: I understand your dumb Signs and your low Whispers, the French Mode all over, to smile and grin a Man in the Face, and at the same time privately cut his Throat. Therefore prithe be ruled by me, and don't fight him, for shou'd you kill him, my poor Girl wou'd break her Heart, quite break her Heart.

I grant that you are wrong'd, and so I dare swear is my dear Child: but he 's her Husband, and must be born with, ods bobs he must.</p>

But here comes one that has made all this Mischief; and him I'll fight my self for all I'm a Justice of the Peace. Come, come, Sir, Draw, draw; you'll belie my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again will you? Come, draw, I say, Draw.

                  <p>True, Sir, I am; For at his Return to Town from <hi>Barn-Elms,</hi> it was my Chance to meet him; and after a ceremonious Complement or two, I found him diving into my private Thoughts concerning the Bride your Daughter: I, not to be behind-hand with him, join'd Wit with Wit to sound his shallow Soul. I told him then, how her Jewels once were mine; but the manner of my obtaining them, I for my own sake did conceal from him; and now, if you're disposed, I'll here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it.</p>

                  <p>They being fast, I cou'd not get 'em off without some Harm and Pain to her: which for the <hi>Indies</hi> I'd not have done.

               <l>YOV met with good Intention to be witty,</l>
               <l>And rally the Grave Cuckolds of the City;</l>
               <l>But disappointed of your Recreation,</l>
               <l>I in your Looks can read the Play's Damnation.</l>
               <l>Lord! how ye stare to find an honest Bride,</l>
               <l>A thing you think a Monster in <hi>Cheapside.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whither you boast that you so often come,</l>
               <l>And leave your Footmen to perform at home.</l>
               <l>Yet 'tis no little Comfort t' us howe're,</l>
               <l>You oftner bring th' Estate than get the Heir.</l>

               <l>It gives <hi>Cheapside</hi> the Sins of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>:</l>
               <l>We must refine on Vice, and take new Measures,</l>

               <l>This Cuckolding to you's a losing Trade,</l>
