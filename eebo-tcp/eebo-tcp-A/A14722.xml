         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath violently broken downe the Pale of prosperity in
our Neighbouring Kingdomes; and would subtilly be
picking of the golden Locke of Tranquillity, the which
Omnipotencie (by your Royall Majesties goodnesse and
well-governing) hath been so tender in preserving. And
in regard neither Peace nor Warre can bud nor flourish,
but under the well-managed Sword: according to my
slender abilitie I have spent some few Moneths in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
upon the principall parts of the Body of War,
and that in two respects: First, that some one judicious,
learned, and wel-experienced Souldier, taking a survey of
my defects might be therby instigated to begin and finish
a more excellent worke tending to this Subject. And
secondly, that my fellow Subjects who have not beene
verst in these affaires, might gaine some profit, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:18615:3"/>
they might be inabled to doe your Majestie the better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
upon all sudden occasions, when your Highnesse
shall call them thereto. And although it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
whether Reading or Practice have the first place in
this Art, to be layed as a foundation to this Building;
I must with <hi>Marius</hi> answer this question, who envying
at the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> (saith) <hi>Qui postquam Consules
facti sunt, acta Majorum &amp; Graecorum Militaria praecepta
legere coeperunt. Homines praeposteri, nam legere quam fieri;
tempore posterius, re &amp; usu priùs est.</hi> For since that all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and action proceedeth from the Soule, and cannot
well be produced, untill the Idea thereof bee first imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the mind; according to which patterne the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Beeing and sensible resemblance is duly fashioned,
how is it possible that any action belonging to Warre,
can be well expressed, when the mind is not directed by
knowledge to dispose it in that sort as shall best agree
with the occurrents of such natures as are necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed
both in the meanes, and in the end therof? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Speculative knowledge, as the <hi>Gnomon</hi> or <hi>Tramon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi>
to direct the course of all practice, is first to be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
But withall no man can so well rest upon such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
through the Theorick of Knowledge, as hee that
hath also proved his learning verified by practice; And
in regard the habitude of Arts and Sciences cannot bee
said to be perfectly attained, unlesse their particular parts
are in such sort apprehended, that from the varietie of
that individuality; the Intellectuall power frameth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Notions and Maximes of Rule uniting tearmes of
the same nature in one head, and distinguishing diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by differences of properties, aptly dividing the whole
body into his greatest and smallest branches, and fitting
each part with his descriptions, duties, cautions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;
<pb facs="tcp:18615:3"/>
For unlesse the understanding of a Souldier be
in some kind qualified, and able by Logicall discourse, to
ascend by way of composition, from singularitie to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
conceptions, and returne againe the same way, to
the lowest order of his partitions, the mind cannot bee
said to have the perfection of that Art, or instructed in
true knowledge, but guided by some broken Precepts;
whereby it will follow that this Science of Warre being
divided into many branches, and consisting in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie
of divers members being all so materiall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Bulke, that a mayme of the smallest part,
causeth either debilitie, or deformity in the body, so that
every small and unrespected Circumstance, quite altereth

It cannot be denied, but he that is acquainted with most

the course of Warre, must needs be thought a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Souldier, and deserveth a Title of greater dignitie in

Coyne the picture of <hi>Mars</hi> was usually stampt with
a Iavelin in one hand, a scourge in the other, and the
Portraict of a Cocke standing by him; The Iavelin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
Prowesse, the scourge Authority, and the Cocke
Vigillancie and indefatigable care: What was but ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on that Coyne is vively expressed in all your Honours
and Worships actions, which doubtlesse moved that Royall
hand to conferre upon you the high charge of ordering
his martiall affaires in this County of <hi>Essex.</hi> Your high Authoritie and my service
under it hath moved me to present unto your viewes a <hi>Treatise of War;</hi> a subject in
these perilous times very requisite to be regarded, especially by men of this honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
profession, since we perceive all doubts in adjacent dominions are now decided
onely by dint of the Sword: <hi>Proximus ardetucalligon;</hi> our neighbours house is of a
light fire, their Townes and Towers burne like Beacons: We know not how soone their
flame may catch hold of our owne buildings (War being in a neighbour Province like
fire in the next dwellings which can hardly be kept off, but by good helpe) No helpe
better to divert a warre then a skilfull Souldiery; for that enemy which dares doe
much against a numerous people unskilfull in the feates of Armes, will consider well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he attempts any thing against those that be Warlike, though of far lesse numbers;
nothing makes a people warlike so soone as maintenance of Marshall discipline, nor doth
anything make the Common wealth more safe then that. This was one motive which
instigated me first to undertake this hard and difficult taske, and not out of any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to teach, since it is well knowne that your Honours and Worships are well
verst both in the Practicke and Speculative knowledge of Warre: And inregard your
Noble professions are adorned with the truest rules adherent to these actions, it is in
a manner superfluus for me to commend these unpollisht Lines to your viewes, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no strangers to this subject; Yet as <hi>Mela</hi> sayd once in his discription of <hi>Italy:
De Italia magis quia ordo exegit quam quia monstrari eget pauca dicentur,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18615:5"/>
                     <hi>nota sunt omnia;</hi> the like I may justly say concerning this discourse of <hi>Warlik
discipline,</hi> it is so obvious to your sight that you neede not the spectacles of Letters,
yet something I must say rather for methods sake unto your Lordships then necessitie,
and I hope it shall not seeme impertinent unto your Honours, since your golden Spirits
cannot admit of such effeminizing as the <hi>Pithagorians</hi> which inhabited <hi>Amicle</hi>
a Towne in <hi>Italy,</hi> who often being terrified with a vaine rumour of their enemies
approach, promulgated a Law, forbidding all such reports, by which meanes their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
comming unawares upon them tooke the Towne, from hence grew the Proverbe
<hi>Amiclas silentium perdidit;</hi> therefore with <hi>Lucillius</hi> who was commanded to

Amiclas silentio perijsse.</hi> It is not unknowne to your Honours and Worships who
are experienced, how farre both Officers and Souldiers are degenerated from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages, in which they made the use and practice of Armes their glory; but our age
makes it a burthen and a shame to use and beare that name which of all attributes and
titles is most honorable, if such would with <hi>Cicero</hi> consider to what end they were
borne, with him they would confesse <hi>Non nobis solum nati sumus sed etiam pro
Patria;</hi> Wherefore the noble profession of a Souldier is a thing of no small conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
when as true Religion cannot be maintained, the honour and safetie of our
gracious King cannot be safe, the possession and welfare of our kingdome cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
nor the subduing of our enemies cannot be atchieved but by and under the shadow
of the well managed Sword: For indeede the infinite chances, hazards and events
of <hi>War</hi> are so doubtfull and dangerous (that as <hi>Iason</hi> sayd to <hi>Epaminondas)</hi> hee
is not wise that doth not feare them, seeing as I have sayd before the whole world is
in combustion, we ought to fit our selves and provide for the hardest: for certainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
commanders can easily conquer those that are Novices; and a battell once lost hath
an ill tayle or consequence, as the great Souldier and Statesman <hi>Commineus</hi> saith,
<hi>un Battaille perdu a maunaise queúe,</hi> for it redoubleth the hope and courage of
the victors, and discourageth and astonisheth the vanquished; it shaketh the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of Subjects, it ministreth matter and opportunitie of conspiracie to Malecontents,
of revolts to Townes, and of Allienation to confederates, who commonly sway with
the good successe: And for this cause all Princes have beene very vigilant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to have their Commanders very expert and valiant, and their Subjects well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in the use of Armes; that no sudden danger should dismay them, nor no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
too subtill for them; for although a Nation be never so well verst in all <hi>Politick

they lost honour in that kind where as by their owne indeavours they might have
atchieved it, they had as a duemerit the basest of punishment inflicted; as whipping
in the head of the Troopes untill the blood followed; or manacled together with
Irons: And for leaving of their Generall or Commanders in time of fight, they were
spitted upon Stakes, and divers other rigorous torments executed upon delinquents
for the like offence. Therefore with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> I implore his ayde (who

of the Sunne, which hath both his Summer and
his Winter Solstice: The one ushering in the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Spring, The other pushing forwards the Crest falne
Autumne. The one of them spreads the fayre greene
Carpet on the Table of the Earth; the other (as if the
Banquet were ended) with-draws, and takes away again:
Thus fareth it betweene these two opposites, Peace, and
Warre. Peace, like the Summer Solstice (where shee
goes) makes all things looke bucksome, for shee her selfe (if you please to have her
described) is a pure and unspotted Virgin, in whose forehead never appeared any one
frowning wrinckle; shee is the Mother of learning, and the Nurse of Arts: A
Daughter of as royall a discent as any;<note place="margin">Pax Dei. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 13.</note> for she hath God for her Father, and she hath
a Royall Mother also, even true and unfeigned Love; a vertue beyond comparison.
Alacke, that this Royall Virgin, (whose presence makes all things prosper) is of
no longer durance amongst men: but it is decreed, all things below are subject to
mutability. The Winter Solstice must succeed the Summer, and Warre must follow
Peace; the Table must not alwaies bee covered, a time of with-drawing will come
at last. For proofe of which, lets take a survey of some of those Kingdomes which in
former ages have most flourished in this World; and by their mutability, judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee possible for any Kingdome, how strong and setled so ever, to perpetuate
Peace unto it selfe: And it will not bee amisse to begin at the golden head of that

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Kingdome of the <hi>Ayssrians,</hi> was without question the strongest
and best setled Kingdome that ever was before, or ever followed
after it, in succeeding Ages: And therefore prefigured by a head
of Gold. It is marvellous what Historians reporte of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
but because some in these times, doe doubt of the truth of
their reports, I will point you onely to that which the sacred O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of God avouch, which no man can doubt of. For the
King himselfe, he was every way renowned, <hi>Rex Regum,</hi> a King of Kings, and that
of the Lords owne establishing. For God had given him a Kingdome, power,
strength, and glory. <hi>Dan. 2. 37.</hi> For the amplitude of the Kingdome, it was not
bounded within lesser limits then the Confines of the then inhabited World, <hi>Dan. 2.
38.</hi> and wheresoever the Children of men dwell, the Beasts of the Field, and the
Foules of the Heaven hath hee given into thy hands. If you please to compare it
with that famous Monarchie of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> which succeeded it:
You shall finde, that as the <hi>Persians</hi> were after it in time, so also in Power, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
<hi>Dan. 2. 39. And after you shall arise another Kingdome inferiour to you.</hi>
Here now is a Monarchie, one would thinke so strongly seated, as that a face of
Warre should not dare to looke upon it: yet did it runne many hazzards, and endure
many changes by dint of the sword, and that at severall times also. And first in the
dayes of that lusty <hi>Virago, Semiramis.</hi> She not content to defend the limits of her
Kingdome left her by the conquest of her deceased Husband, was the first that ever
with sword in hand ventured into the <hi>Indies, quo praeter illam &amp; Alexandrum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
nemo itravit.</hi> And this happened in the dayes of <hi>Staurobates,</hi> who met her in
the confines of his Kingdome: and though hee suffered losse in the first shocke, yet
renuing his Forces, renewed also the Battell, fought with her hand to hand, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her sore; and at last, forced her over the River <hi>Indus:</hi> where multitude of her
Souldiers (the Bridge being broken) came to their ends.</p>
                        <p>But this wound was afterwards well healed up, and the Kingdome well setled again
in a long lasting Peace, which endured the Reignes of above Thirty Kings; untill
at last came <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> who was <hi>Vir muliere corruptior.</hi> Into whose presence,
when as <hi>Arbactus</hi> his Lieutenant in <hi>Media</hi> with much adoe was admitted; he found
him spinning (more like a good houswife, then a Royall King) amongst a company of
tender Ladies, himselfe in softnesse excelling them all: At which sight, the great
Captaine disdaining, and stomacking that so many valiant men should bee subject to
such an estiminate King; and that those who were used to handle swords and speares
should obey him, whose hands were inured to nothing but a distaffe; hee comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with shame, and makes report to his fellowes of that ignominious sight. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans

who is as some thinke called <hi>Pull</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> in the sacred Scriptures,
<hi>2. Kings 15. 19.</hi> In whose Posteritie the Scepter continued for some few generations
following, untill <hi>Senacherib</hi> his great Grand-child, who was betrayed and slaine by
two of his owne Sonnes,<note place="margin">2. Kings. 19. 37.</note> to wit by <hi>Adramalech,</hi> and <hi>Sharezer:</hi> But <hi>Esarhaddon</hi> his
Sonne, who governed the Kingdome in his Fathers absence, stept into the Chayre
of Estate, yet could hee not possesse it without much trouble. For first these two
Brethren that had slaine their Father, put themselves also in Armes against their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18615:13"/>
hoping by this meanes to share equally with him. This trouble amongst the
brethren, occasioned <hi>Merodath,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>Merodach Baladan,
Isa. 39. 1.</hi> Liuetenant of <hi>Babylon</hi> to rebell against <hi>Esarhaddon:</hi> and first drawing

overthrew him: and so joyned the Empire of the <hi>Assirians,</hi> unto the City of
<hi>Babylon.</hi> In the Posteritie of this <hi>Merodach,</hi> did the Monarchie continue for three

Battells; Commanding the hindmost, that if they did perceive any of the formost

of <hi>Lydia, Cujus opes et divitiae, insignes ea tempestate erant:</hi> so that if he had not beene a
Souldier, his Kingdome had beene dissolved before it had beene very well setled.
But through his prudence and valour, hee brake through all these difficulties, quieted
the Rebellion, subdued the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and overcame the <hi>Lydian</hi> their Auxiliarie,
who hee used with such Lenity, as that thereby hee politickly avoided a most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

and grounded. After the decease of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (or rather before) for when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was
gone against the <hi>Messagetes, Cambyces</hi> in his Fathers absence was declared King:
But for his cruelty, Almighty God, cut him short by a grievous wound in his thigh,
made by the falling of his owne sword out of the scabbard, as hee was mounting on
Horsebacke: Hee was no sooner dead, but one of the <hi>Magi,</hi> by name <hi>Comaris,</hi> or

that 20000 of the enemies had gotten the top of the hill, then hee exhorted his

with his <hi>Lacedemons,</hi> would try the fortune of that place: Whereupon all departed
save his owne <hi>300 Spartans, 400 Thebans,</hi> and a few of the <hi>Thespiences,</hi> a maniple in
respect of so great a multitude as did oppose them. Yet were they resolved to dye
with their King upon the place, or to eternise their names with an incomparable
victory. To these the King adresseth his speech on this wise: Noble Countrey-men,
our numbers are so unequall, that however wee fight, yet must wee fall, this I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is the resolution of you all: otherwise you would not have stayed the hazzard
of a Battell, where is such disparrity; see therefore that you shew not more valour
in your staying for the Battell, then in your fighting in it: for the ordering of which,
I am resolved not to expect, till wee bee inclosed by our enemies: but so soone as
the night approacheth, wee will fall resolutely within the bowels of their Campe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which rests without feare of our small numbers; for never can undaunted Souldiers
dye more bravely, then in the Tents of their daring Foes.</p>
                        <p>Which speech they tooke with great alacrity and cheerfulnesse, and in signe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
immediately addressed themselves to their Armes, and then did Sixe or Seven
Hundred men at most, breake into the Campe of 500000 of their enemies: and
having once got entrance, forthwith beate towards the Pavillion of King <hi>Xerxes:
Aut cum illo, aut si oppressi essent in ipsius potissimum sede morituri.</hi> A tumult is raised
in the Campe upon their entrance: and the <hi>Spartans</hi> missing of the King at his Tent,
ranne like lightning through every corner, beating and throwing downe every
thing that stood in their way, as if they knew they fought not for the victory, but to
revenge their owne deaths: The Battell lasted from the begining of the night, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the great part of the next day were spent, and at last, <hi>Non victi, sed vincendo fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati

                        <p>After their fall who were to keepe the Straights, a faire passage was opened for
the Army into <hi>Greece:</hi> but <hi>Themistocles</hi> with 378 Sayle of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Navie being
at Sea; <hi>Xerxes</hi> thought it was meet, first to try of what force they were, before hee
went any farther: wherefore hee addressed himselfe to his Sea forces. How great
they were I cannot certainely say, but take the number as <hi>Iustin</hi> gives them, <hi>Naves
quoque decies centum millia numero habuisse dicitur:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iustin. Lib. 2.</note> Here are now as great oddes at
Sea, as before at Land: wherefore it behoved <hi>Themistocles</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Admirall,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18615:15"/>
to bee both politicke and valourous, and truely hee was wanting to his Countrey-men
in neither: For so soone as hee perceived the <hi>Persians</hi> bent for a Sea-fight; he
does within him lay to worke their defeat: which hee does first, by getting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the place where they were to fight, which was in the Straites neere the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>Salamis,</hi> least they should bee encompassed with the multitude of their enemies.
Having gained the advantage of the place, next hee sought to weaken them, in that
thing wherein they had most advantage of him, which was in number. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
hee solicited the <hi>Ionians,</hi> who were now in ayde of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to come over to his
party, and those men were fit indeed to bee wrought upon. For when as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
came against them in a former Warre, the <hi>Athenians</hi> had sided with them against
this Kings Father; which thing alone wrought this displeasure against the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and the rest of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> wherefore <hi>Themistocles</hi> wrote to them in these
words. What fury possesseth you (oh ye <hi>Ionians)</hi> and what an odious crime doe
ye commit, in waging Battell against them, that have in times past, beene both your
friends and founders, and of late also the revenger of your wrongs? and was it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for this purpose that wee built your Walls that they might preserve you, who
strive to ruine and destroy ours? what cause I pray you had there been, for <hi>Darius</hi> first,
and now for <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to make Warre on us, but onely this; wee would not forsake you
Rebells, when hee desired to chastise you? but tis no matter, doe you but onely this,
come from them to us; or if that be too full of danger, then when the Battell is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
doe but recoyle, doe but slacken your Oares, and ye may safely depart away.</p>
                        <p>But while these things were a working at Sea, his Forces at Land sacked <hi>Plateae,</hi>
and <hi>Thespiae,</hi> two famous Cities of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> on the Sea-coast, but all of
them forsaken by their Inhabitants: and behold his spleene, <hi>quoniam ferro non pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
in homines, in aedificia igne grassatur:</hi> yea, which was more (as if hee had Warred
not onely with the <hi>Greekes,</hi> but their gods also) Hee destroyed the Temple of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>
at <hi>Delphos</hi> so famous through the World. These things startled the Princes of
those Cities which were joyned with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they knew not how soone
their Cities might runne the same hazzard: wherefore they began to consult of their
departure, for the defence of their owne Territories. Which thing so soone as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi>
perceived, least their forces should bee diminished by the departure of their
Associates: he gives <hi>Xerxes</hi> to understand, by a faithfull servant of his owne; that
now at this instant hee might easily intercept all the force and flower of <hi>Greece,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into one place, who if they were severed (as presently they were like to do)
it would bee to his greater labour and cost to hunt after them in severall places: and
by this deceit, hee necessitated the King to give the signall of Battell: and the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
busied with the approaches of the King, with their joynt forces entertayned
the Skirmish. While the Battell remained somewhat doubtfull, the <hi>Ionians</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the advice of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> withdrew themselves; and their flight dashed
the leaden courages of the <hi>Persians,</hi> so that presently they turned their backs and fled.
<hi>Xerxes</hi> being at his wits end at this overthrow, <hi>Mardonius</hi> his great Captaine and
Counsellour, adviseth him in his owne Person to hasten home, least the fame of this
unlucky battell move sedition there: and tells him, that if he will leave but 300000
of his choyce men, with them hee will either tame <hi>Greece</hi> to his Masters glory, or
yeeld to the Adversary without his ignominie. This advice did <hi>Xerxes</hi> like well
enough, wherefore hee delivered 300000 of his Souldiers to <hi>Mardonius,</hi> and with
the rest, hee prepared to goe backe into his Kingdome: Which the <hi>Grecians</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
resolved to breake the bridge that hee had built at <hi>Abydo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being cut off, hee might perish with his Army: or at least being driven to despaire,
might sue for peace.</p>
                        <p>But here againe did the wisedome of <hi>Themistocles</hi> appeare, for fearing that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
when hee was cooped up, and so necessitated to fight, would turne his cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize
into valour: adviseth the <hi>Greekes,</hi> that they had enemies too many in the
Countrey, and it was not convenient to increase their number by stopping those that
would bee gone: but seeing hee could not prevaile with his advise, hee sent his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
a second time to <hi>Xerxes</hi> to acquaint him with the resolution of the <hi>Greekes;</hi>
which when <hi>Xerxes</hi> knew, in a shamefull afright, with a few of his servants onely,
hee fled in all haste to <hi>Abydos;</hi> commanding his Captaine speedily to March after

                        <p>After that dishonourable flight of <hi>Xerxes, Mardonius</hi> his Generall followed the
warfare at land: <hi>Olinthus</hi> was the first Towne hee sate downe before, and it hee
tooke by Assault. After this hee laboured to reconcile the <hi>Athenians</hi> to the King his
Master, promising them restitution for the losse of their City which was burned:
but after hee perceived they would not part with their Liberty and freedome at any
rate, hee set fire to those buildings they had begun to reedifie, and so Marched into
<hi>Boeotia,</hi> where the maine Army of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was inquartered, consisting of a 100000
men; there they came to blowes neere the City <hi>Plataeae,</hi> which was not farre from
<hi>Thebes: Sed fortuna Regis cum duce mutata non est,</hi> For <hi>Mardonius</hi> was there utterly
overthrowne, himselfe slaine by a common Souldier, his Tents, stuffed with the Kings
Treasure, seized on; and finally <hi>Greece</hi> freed from the <hi>Persian</hi> Warre. The <hi>Athenians</hi>
would not loose the benefit of this victory, but with their Sea forces sayled up the
<hi>Hellesponte,</hi> and by Assault tooke the Towne of <hi>Sestos</hi> from the <hi>Persians,</hi> and sacked
it. After this they turned home, built and fortified their City; and joyning them
with other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Pausanius</hi> and <hi>Aristides</hi> they tooke

                        <p>Thus you see this great Monarch, who had so many Millions of men under his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
could not live in Peace; yea, and for want of good order in his Army suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
many shamefull overthrows: which together with some other iniquities of his
owne, brought him in contempt with his owne Subjects: who before was a terror
to other Nations, and by and by after, hee was slaine by his Lieutenant <hi>Artabanus.</hi>
His Successor was <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Chron. Cario. Lib. 2.</note> who was also called <hi>Longimanus: quia dextra longior

not guilty: yet for all that, the King bound him in golden fetters, deprived him of
liberty: and had done so by his life also in matter <hi>prohibuisset:</hi> But afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
liberty, hee was so much inraged against his Brother by this disgrace, as that
hee began openly to threaten him with Warre. And for that purpose hee gathered
a great Army out of <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, and 10000 <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> also out of <hi>Greece,</hi> with
which hee marched against his Royall Brother, beyond the River <hi>Euphrates. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
was not unmindfull of these affaires, but like a wise and a valiant man,
prepared forces to bid his Brother battell: When they came to blowes, <hi>Cyrus</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Brother, and forced part of his Army to give ground: but being of a hot and
haughty spirit, and with weake Attendants, beating to farre within his Brothers
Troopes; at last hee was slaine by his Brothers Guard. Vpon the newes of his
death, the whole Army tooke the Route, save onely the 10000 <hi>Greekes,</hi> who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> departed whole away, and came safe into their owne Countrey.
After the death of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the faire Lady <hi>Alpasia</hi> was taken in his Tents: on whom
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (when hee beheld her) set his affections: and this Lady was the cause
of a new insurrection; for being equally beloved of the Father and the Sonne: the
Sonne petitioned to his Father for her, and had her granted: But the Father after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18615:16"/>
condoling his owne losse, tooke her away againe: Whereupon the Sonne
conspired with one <hi>Terebathus,</hi> that they two with some armed Troopes, should
on a certaine day, breake into the Kings Closet and slay him; but this plot being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
the King escaped the Treason: <hi>Terebathus</hi> and his Troopes, were slaine by
the Kings Guard; and <hi>Darius</hi> the Kings Sonne apprehended as a Traitour, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to death by the Councell of Princes, before whom his Father would have
him stand for his tryall: after his death, also the King himself languished and died, and
appointed for his successor, <hi>Othus</hi> the youngest of those three Sonnes that hee had by
his lawfull Queene. <hi>Othus</hi> Reigned about Twenty Sixe yeares, more like a Tyrant
then a King: for hee filled his Royall Pallace with the bloud of Princes, his owne
kindred: <hi>Nulla non sanguinis, non sexus, non aetatis misericordia perm tus:</hi> and for his
cruelty was slaine afterwards by the Prince <hi>Bagoas,</hi> who thought to have seated
himselfe in the Royall Chayre: but having not power enough to effect that, he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18615:16"/>
this out of a Millitary bravery hee neglected, and it cost him no lesse then the losse
of the battell, and afterwards of his life and Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>The first battell betweene the two Kings was in the field of <hi>Adrastia,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Plut. in vita Alexand.</note> where the
<hi>Persians</hi> were vanquished: <hi>Non minus arte Alexandri, quam virtute Macedonium:</hi>
After this, <hi>Alexander</hi> fought another Battell with <hi>Rhaesaces</hi> and <hi>Spithradates,</hi> two
of <hi>Darius</hi> his Captaines at the River <hi>Granicus: quos jam non tam armis quam terrore
nominis sui vicit:</hi> and in this encounter, both the <hi>Persian</hi> Chiefetaynes were slaine:
<hi>Rhaesaces</hi> by <hi>Alexanders</hi> owne hand, and <hi>Spithradates</hi> by the hand of <hi>Clytus.</hi> After
their overthrow, (having yet no more to doe in the Field) hee fell to taking in of
Cities, <hi>Sardis, Miletus, Helicarnassus,</hi> and all such places as bordered upon them,
were taken in: and so comming through <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> hee tamed the Inhabitants of
of <hi>Pisidia</hi> and <hi>Phrigia.</hi> At last hee tooke the City of <hi>Gordis,</hi> which above all other hee
desired to take, not for the spoyle, but because hee had heard, that there in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iupiter</hi> was kept the consecrated yoke of <hi>Gordians</hi> Waine, whose bindings and
knots whosoever could unloose, <hi>Eum tota Asia Regnaturum, antiqua oracula ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visse:</hi>
these knots when hee could not unloose them with his fingers, hee cut them
in peeces with his sword: and truely there was no knot so hard, but with his
sword hee could undoe it to make way for his conquest of <hi>Asia.</hi> While hee was in
this City, hee received tydings of <hi>Darius</hi> his approach: wherefore with great speed
hee passed over the mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> and came to <hi>Tarsus;</hi> with which extraordinary
March, his bodie being over heat, hee cast himselfe into the River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> whose
vertues being extremly cold, cast him into a suddaine and almost irrecoverable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease:
but having with much adoe recovered health, hee marched forwards to meete
his enemy, who was comming against him with a very great Army. When they
were met,<note place="margin">Iustin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 400000. Plutarch in vita Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, decies centena militum millia.</note> 
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> riding about his Troopes, encouraged the <hi>Illirians</hi> and <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
with the shew of riches, the <hi>Grecians</hi> hee inflamed with the memory of former
Battells, and the antient hatred betweene them and the <hi>Persians:</hi> Hee likewise tells
his <hi>Macedonians</hi> of there conquest of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> now so much desired; boasting
that they had not their matches in the World, and if now only they would shew them
selves men, this Battell should bee the end of their toyle and labour, and the very
pride of their glory and honour. Neither was <hi>Darius</hi> all this while idle, but like a
good Captaine, rid about his Troopes ordering and exhorting them to bee mindfull
of the antient glory of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and of the honour of their Empire which they
had received of the immortall gods: Then joyning Battell with great courage on
both sides, for a while what the successe would bee was doubtfull: but both the
Kings were wounded, and <hi>Darius</hi> after his hurt fled; and then were the <hi>Persians</hi>
slaughtered on all sides untill they fled as their King did before. After this Battell,
there were found in the <hi>Persian</hi> Tents, much gold and other riches; and together with
many other noble prisoners there were taken, the Mother, Wife, and two Daughters
of <hi>Darius.</hi> This victory did well-neere settle the Crowne upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> head;
for after this hee tooke <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the royall City of <hi>Susa,</hi> where hee got inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
riches: and being at a feast one day under the guilded roofe of the Royall Pallace,
hee sayd; Then have I obtained the fruite of my labour, when I can feast so magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently
within the Pallace of proud King <hi>Xerxes.</hi> After this he besiedged the City of
<hi>Tyre,</hi> and within the Moneth tooke it: And from thence passed forwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iosephus Lib. 11.</note> with whom hee was displeased, for that they refused to assist him
in the siedge of <hi>Tyre:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ant. Iud. cap. 8.</note> but the <hi>Iewes</hi> now fearing the Kings displeasure; <hi>Iaddus</hi> the
High Priest that hee might pacifie the Kings minde, met him upon the way clad in
his Priests vestures, and accompanied with a great number of Priests and Elders, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the Kings favour: There did <hi>Alexander</hi> alight from his Horse, and in a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner salutes the High Priest, promising Peace: at which sight his Captaines
wondring, asked why hee received the Priests so honourably: To whom he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that in <hi>Macedonia</hi> before the beginning of the Warres, hee had seene one habited
in the like vestures, calling him into <hi>Asia,</hi> and commanding him to make Warre with
the <hi>Persians,</hi> reaching forth his right hand towards him, as if hee would be his guide:
and seeing the Priest in that similitude, hee thought God had some speciall regard
of this People, and that hee himselfe was assisted by that God whom they served:
and therefore hee resolved to bee mercifull unto them and to shew them favour,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18615:17"/>
From hence did <hi>Alexander</hi> March into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which hee tooke without resistance:
here hee visited the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Hammon,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iustin. Lib. 11.</note> whereby the Priest (whom before
for that purpose hee had corrupted) hee was styled <hi>Hamonius filius:</hi> from hence
hee returned into <hi>Syria,</hi> where he received letters from <hi>Darius</hi> concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of his Captives; for whom hee promised to pay a great summe of money:
<hi>Sed Alexander in pretium captivarum regnum, omne non pecuniam petit:</hi> Afterward
<hi>Darius</hi> sends a second Embassage, proffering him his Daughter in marriage, and with
her a portion of his Kingdome for a Dowry: To this <hi>Alexander</hi> answered, that as
yet hee had proffered him nothing but that which was his owne by right of conquest;
but if hee were desirous of Peace, hee must come and render himselfe and Kingdome
to the mercy of the Conquerour. <hi>Darius</hi> now perceiving that all hope of Peace was
taken away; begins to leavie his third Army; resolving to try if with his sword in
hand hee might obtaine that, which by Embassadours and treaties hee could not:
With this new Army, consisting of 500000 Horse and Foot: hee hunts after his
Adversary, but in his March hee heareth of the death of his Wife in Childe-bed, and

writes the third letter to <hi>Alexander,</hi> rendring him many thankes for his courtesie to
those that were his Captives, offering him also his other Daughter in marriage, and
the greater part of his Kingdome, even to the banckes of <hi>Euphrates</hi> for her Dowrie,
and 30000 Tallents, for the redemption of the Captives. To this <hi>Alexander</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it was a thing too too vaine to receive thankes from an enemy; neither had
hee himselfe done any thing to flatter his Adversary; that which hee had done, was
out of the greatnesse of his minde: which, as it had taught him to contend against
the force of his foes, so not to triumph over their calamities: neither would he have
<hi>Darius</hi> to thinke him so simple, as to suffer the victory to bee taken from him, with
hope of a marriage; No, no, hee would have <hi>Darius</hi> know, that there was no way
so safe as to come yield to his mercy: which if hee did, hee would promise in the
word of a Prince, freely to bestow upon <hi>Darius</hi> all those things that now hee proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto him, upon this condition, <hi>Si secundus fili, non par habere velit:</hi> For as the
World could not bee governed by two Sunnes, so neither by two Kings with any
safety: therefore either that day <hi>Darius</hi> must prepare himselfe to yeild, or the next
day bring his Army into the Plaines, where hee should finde the like entertainment
that hee had before.</p>
                        <p>The next day both of them tooke the Field neere unto <hi>Arbela,</hi> and were ranged
in view one of the other: The Kings on both sides rid about their Troopes, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to demeane themselves like Souldiers in the Battell. <hi>Darius</hi> assured his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
that if a strict accompt of his own and Adversaries number were taken, he was
ten for one: On the contrary <hi>Alexander</hi> admonished the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that they should
not be moved neither with the enemies multitude, nor with their Gyantlike bodies,
no, nor with the glittering of their Armour; onely they should doe well to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that twice before they had encountered them, and doubtlesse in this third Battell
they should not finde in them greater courages then at first: for having already twice
put them to flight, and that with a great slaughter, the sorrowfull remembrance
thereof hee knew would much daunt them, who had no overplus of courage before:
Furthermore, hee assured them, that though <hi>Darius</hi> had the most men, yet had hee
the greater forces: wherefore there was nothing remained, but that they should
scorne those Bands that glittered in gold and silver, among whom they should finde
<hi>plus praedae quam periculi,</hi> more treasure then danger, since that victory was usually
carried rather by the sharpnesse of the sword, then the garnishing of the Armour.</p>
                        <p>After these encouraged on both sides, the onset was given, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

had beene conquered: On the other side, the <hi>Persians</hi> because they had been so often
soyled, wished rather to die, then to lose the day: In fine, seldome was there more

<note place="margin">Chron. Carionis.</note> But at last the <hi>Persians</hi> were overcome with the slaughter of Ninety thousand
of their men. <hi>Darius,</hi> when he saw the Battell lost, would needs dye upon the place;
but yet was compelled by those that were about him, by flight to provide for his
owne safety: and some there were that advised him to breake the Bridge over the
River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> that so his flight might be secured from the enemies chase: but <hi>Darius</hi>
refused that counsell, resolving not to provide for his owne safety; by objecting
so many thousands of his men as were yet ungotten over the River, to the fury of
his Adversary: <hi>Debere &amp; aliis fugae vtam patere, quae patuerit sibi.</hi> This Battell fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

Cities yeilded on all sides, the <hi>Persians</hi> patiently submitted their neckes under the
yoake of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> servitude; themselves having ruled the space of 200 yeares
and upwards.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Darius</hi> in his flight was slaine by <hi>Bessus</hi> and <hi>Nabaczanes,</hi> two of his neare kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whose body was found by <hi>Polystratus,</hi> one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Souldiers, lying in a
Chariot after a squailed manner, goared with many wounds, and weltring in that
Royall bloud that had issued out thereof: Which woefull spectacle after that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
beheld, he tooke it heavily; first mourning and weeping for the Royall Corps,
then covering it with his owne cloake; and lastly, causing it to be buried in a most
solemne and Princely manner: neither did he ever cease, till he had attached <hi>Bessus</hi>
the murtherer, and put him to a shamefull and ignominious death. This was the
end of this mighty Prince, and also of this mighty Empire, which was now brought
out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> from <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Macedonia;</hi> where the third Monarchie

of fresh Souldiers, seeing so many of his deare friends put to death; began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
that hee was called for rather to partake with his friends in their punishment,
then with <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Warfare. Wherefore hee most wickedly plotted with
his Sonnes <hi>Cassander, Philip, and Iolas</hi> (attendants on the Kings Person) about his
poysoning: which was afterwards performed at the house of one <hi>Thessalus,</hi> who
had invited the King to a Banquet, they all giving it out, that hee died of a feaver,
caused through excessive drinking. His sicknesse lasted the space of eleven dayes: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time, their happened a tumult amongst the Souldiers, who suspected the
King was poysoned: this hee himselfe pacified, by shewing himselfe unto them;
and permitting such as hee saw weeping, graciously to kisse his hand; yea when all
about him fell a weeping, yet was hee without any signe of griefe. <hi>Adeo sicut in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem;
ita &amp; in mortem invictus animus fuit.</hi> When as those about him perceived no
hope of his recovery,<note place="margin">Quem Imperii faciat haeredem. Respondit dignissimum.</note> they desired to know whom hee would assigne for his Heire,
and successor in the Empire, hee answered the most worthy. Such was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his minde, that passing by his owne Sonne <hi>Hercules,</hi> his brother <hi>Arideus,</hi>
and his Wife <hi>Roxana</hi> great with childe, hee declares the most worthie Person to
bee his Heire; <hi>quasi nefas esset viro forti alium, quam virum fortem succedere.</hi> And
this had like to have set all together by the eares, every one of the great Captaines
esteeming himselfe most worthie; begun privately to procure to themselves the
Souldiers favour. But this growing dissention, also was pacified by <hi>Alexander</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
for upon the sixth day of his sicknesse when his speech failed him, hee tooke
his Ring from his finger,<note place="margin">Iustin. Lib. 13.</note> and delivered it to <hi>Perdiccas:</hi> by which signe it appeared
that hee appointed him for his Successor. After the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> some time
was spent in setling the affaires of Estate; for this purpose they met in the Royall
Pallace at Babylon, and being set in Councell they were divided into three severall
opinions: First, <hi>Perdiccas</hi> was of opinion, that they should expect till <hi>Roxana</hi> (the
late Wife of <hi>Alexander)</hi> who was great with childe. should bee delivered; and if
shee brought forth a Man-childe, hee should bee declared Successour to his
Father.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Meliager</hi> was of another minde; for he thought it not safe to suffer their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
consultations, to depend upon an uncertaine childe-birth: neither is it fit (saith
hee) that wee should expect till a King bee borne, when as wee may have one that
is borne already: and if a Child will please you, there is <hi>Hercules</hi> the Sonne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
begotten of <hi>Arsine:</hi> if a young man will like you better, there is <hi>Arideus</hi>
Brother and companion of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Campe, and one that is beloved of all;
not onely for his owne sake, but for his Father King <hi>Philips.</hi> And furthermore for
<hi>Roxana;</hi> hee sayd shee was descended of the <hi>Persian</hi> bloud: and was it right, that
they should appoint a King to rule over the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> which should spring from
them, whose Kingdome they had now conquered? <hi>Ptolemy</hi> differed in opinion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18615:18"/>
from both the former; and first hee utterly rejected <hi>Arideus,</hi> and that not onely for
the basenesse of his Mother; for hee was begotten by <hi>Philip ex Larisco Scorto:</hi> but
also for a greater infirmity, want of wit; for as <hi>Ptolemy</hi> sayd, if hee were admitted
to the Crowne; <hi>Ille nomen Regis, alius Imperium teneret:</hi> for his part hee thought it
better, that out of those who for their vertue and prowesse were neere unto <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
some should bee elected to governe the Provinces, and manage the Warres.</p>
                        <p>Of these three opinions the first was best approved generally: wherefore it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon, that they should expect till <hi>Roxana</hi> were delivered: and if shee brought
forth a Sonne, <hi>Leonatus, Perdiccas, Craterus,</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> should be his Guardians.

of the Horsemen: which being once knowne, the Horsemen in feare departed the
City; and having fortified their Campe, the footmen themselves also began to doubt
of the successe. <hi>Perdiccas</hi> who commanded in chiefe amongst the Horsemen, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the danger likely to ensue upon this division: resolutely went unto the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and having called an assembly, he spake unto them as followeth.</p>
                        <p>Souldiers and fellowes in Armes, I desire you would consider what an horrible crime
you now commit in arming your selves, and raising a sedition: Remember I pray you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom you attempt these things; they are not Persians but Macedonians, not ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but Citizens, and for the most part of your owne bloud and kindred, Fellow-souldiers
of the same Campe, and Companions of the same dangers together with you. Consider betimes
I advise you, what an egregious spectacle you are about to set forth to the view of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
the Persians; looke how much they grieve to see themselves vanquished by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
armes, so much will they rejoyce to see you embruing your swords in the bloud one
of another: by which meanes it will come to passe that they shall offer sacrifice with your
owne bloud, to the soules of those enemies which you have slaine.</p>
                        <p>With this Oration the footmen were so moved, as that presently they approved
his councell; chose him their Captaine, and by his meanes also were accorded with
the Horsemen: but yet so, as that <hi>Arideus</hi> should have the Empire; and onely a
portion thereof should be reserved for <hi>Alexanders</hi> Child, if it happened to be a Sonne.</p>
                        <p>These matters being thus composed, the Empire is divided into many Lieutenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships:
but there were foure chiefe ones, who were more remarkable then the rest:
<hi>Qui Reges ex perfectis facti magnes opes non sibi tantum paranerunt; Verum
&amp; posteris reliquerunt.</hi> And these were first, <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> Sonne of <hi>Logus</hi> who
possessed <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who possessed <hi>Babylon</hi> (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith)
<hi>Cum vicinis gentibus.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who possessed <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse: And fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Antipater,</hi> and after him <hi>Cassander,</hi> who possessed <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By this wee see the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel</hi> fulfilled, for hee had long before Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
that the great horne of the Goate being broken: For it, should come up
foure notable ones: <hi>Dan. 8. 8.</hi> Which prophecie is expounded in the 21. and 22.
verses of the same Chapter, in this manner. <hi>The Rough Goate is the King of Grecia;
and the great horne that is betwixt his eyes, is the first King</hi> (which was <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great.) <hi>Now that being broken, whereas foure stood up for it: Foure Kingdomes shall
stand up out of the Nation, but not in his power.</hi> Now these Kingdomes are the foure
I have last spoken of: for however by the first composition, they were to bee but
Provinces; and these Princes forenamed, to rule in them onely as Lieutenants to
<hi>Arideus;</hi> yet afterward that agreement was rejected, and every of these made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
absolute Kings, <hi>1. Mac. 1. 9.</hi> And this was the first occasion.</p>

                           <hi>Perdiccas</hi> (to whom nothing fell in this division, but the tuition of the weake King,
and the conduct of the best Army) cast about how hee might make himselfe equall
with the rest: for this purpose hee set upon <hi>Ariarathes</hi> King of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> in which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18615:19"/>
Warre hee proved victorious; yet gained little more then the bare and naked King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
for his enemies being overthrowne, they fly to their chiefe City, where they
burnt themselves, their houses, and all that ever they had. <hi>Vt nihil hostis victor suarum
rearum preter incendii Spectacula frueretur:</hi> This Kingdome hee left to the custody
of his best betrusted friend <hi>Eumenes,</hi> to bee a place of sure retreate upon any occasion,
but as for himselfe hee aspired after greater matters. Power enough hee had in the
Army hee conducted, but hee wanted Royall authority to countenance his Power;
and <hi>Capadocia</hi> was to little to limit his high thoughts: Now that hee had proved
his strength to make himselfe equall with the other, hee would try one cast more too
for the superiority: to this end hee secretly treated a match with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the sister
of great <hi>Alexander,</hi> by whom hee hoped to attaine the Soverainty of all the rest:
but belike hee was jealous that <hi>Antipater</hi> (in whose power the Lady was) would
crosse this marriage. Wherefore to cover his intents, hee fained love to <hi>Nicaea</hi> one
of <hi>Antipaters</hi> Daughters, hoping under that pretext to gaine the Lady before any were
aware of it, but the old Foxe quickly espied his drift: <hi>Et dum duas eodem tempore

                        </p>
                        <p>This plot of his being overthrowne by the cunning of <hi>Antipater,</hi> hee sets his wits

transferre the Army into <hi>Europe</hi> under the pretence of bringing the King into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi>
the seate of his Ancestors, and head of the Empire; whose presence hee knew
would actually make voyd for the time, the office of the <hi>Viceroyes:</hi> and so <hi>Antipater</hi>
with <hi>Craterus</hi> being once in case of private men, and himselfe onely in authority,
the match with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> then might easily bee effected; and so should his greatnesse
meet with a good title, and what obstacle then could there bee, to debarre him from
the Empire?</p>
                        <p>There are two men taken into consideration, which hee thought might bee some
hinderance to him in that accomplishment of this project: And they were <hi>Antigonus</hi>
Lieutenant of <hi>Phrigia,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomie</hi> of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For the first, hee caused to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of certaine crimes, which might very well have served to take away his life;
which <hi>Antigonus</hi> would not seeme to take notice of, but prepared himselfe in shew
to come to his Answer: but in the meane while hee made an escape, and came into
<hi>Aetolia,</hi> where <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> were with their Armies, about the conquest
of the Countrey. These tydings which <hi>Antipater</hi> brought, quickly finished the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolian</hi>
Warre, and caused both <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> to foresee their owne danger.
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> also being advertised of these passages; apprehended them deepely; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was easily drawn to side with <hi>Antipater</hi> his Coleagues, <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Being thus joyned in League, they begin to prepare for defence; And <hi>Perdiccas</hi>
(understanding by the flight of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the League that now was betweene
him, and the aforesayd parties, that all his drifts were discovered) resolved to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
all before him by fine force, having both the strongest Army, and the Kings name
to countenance all his actions. But the thing that troubled him was, against which
of the Coleagues hee should first attempt. This being propounded in Councell, some
advised hee should transferre the Warre into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where <hi>Olimpias</hi> the Mother
of great <hi>Alexander</hi> then was;<note place="margin">Justin. lib. 13.</note> whose presence and the peoples favour, would much
promote all their enterprises. Others advised that they should first attempt on <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi>
in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> least while they were in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> hee should invade <hi>Asia;</hi> and
this advice prevailed; whereupon <hi>Eumenes</hi> is charged to have regard of <hi>Asia,</hi> and

                           <hi>Antigonus</hi> understanding what a Souldier <hi>Eumenes</hi> was; thought it a farre safer
way to cut him off by policie, then by force: wherefore taking the advantage of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
absence from his Army (for hee was now visiting <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the sister of great
<hi>Alexander,</hi> at <hi>Sardis)</hi> hee caused letters to bee spread through his Army, wherein
was promised great rewards to those who could bring <hi>Eumenes</hi> his head unto him.
<hi>Eumenes</hi> at his returne finding out the project, called an assembly, giving his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
great thankes, that amongst them all, none was found that preferred the hope
of a bloudy reward, before the faith they had given to their Generall: but withall, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly
telling them, <hi>Confictas a se has epistolas ad experiendos suorum animos esse.</hi> And
by this policie hee did not onely afright those that were wavering; but also did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
against future times: that if any such thing should afterwards happen, the soldiers
might suppose; <hi>Se non ab hoste corrumpi, sed a duce tentari. Antigonus</hi> when he saw
that hee could not entrap his Adversary by cunning, then prepared to set upon him
by force. And <hi>Eumenes</hi> accordingly prepared to entertaine him; but through the
treachery of <hi>Apollonides,</hi> generall of his Horse (who in the heate of the battell fled to
the Adverse part) hee was overthrowne.<note place="margin">Plut. in vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to bee a man fit for his purposes (if hee could winne him to his side) both for his

<hi>Silla</hi> had given his friend a caveat to beware of <hi>Caesar:</hi> this dislike of each other
was increased by both their ambitions: <hi>Pompey</hi> would endure no equall, nor <hi>Caesar</hi>
superiour; but hitherto their intents were smothered, two obstacles being in the
way: first <hi>Pompey</hi> had married the Lady <hi>Julia, Caesars</hi> Daughter, and during her life,
friendship was preserved,<note place="margin">Nec hic ferebat parem necille superiorem. Flor.</note> at least in shew. Secondly, <hi>Crassus</hi> through his inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
riches, Linage, and eloquence, was almost in as great reputation as either of the

to demand the Consulship, himselfe staying behinde within his owne Province; the
reason why hee desired (though absent) to bee declared Consull, was for feare of
some enemies that had threatned to accuse him: this honour was decreed him at the
first, by ten of the Tribunes with <hi>Pompeys</hi> good liking. But some of <hi>Caesars</hi> enemies
withstanding this decree; <hi>Pompey</hi> quickly altered his opinion, and then was <hi>Caesar</hi>

dismisse his Army by such a day, and that hee should not therewith passe the River

                           <hi>Caesar</hi> observing the order of his enemies Battels, doubted that his right Wing
might be oppressed with the multitude of the enemies horse; wherefore from his 3.
Battell, he drew certaine choise companies, which he opposed to the enemies horse,
shewing them what he had appointed them to doe, affirming that the victory that
day, depended upon the valour of these Cohorts. The signall of Battell being given,
in <hi>Caesars</hi> Armie, <hi>Crastinus</hi> (a man of tryed valour one that the yeare before had the
leading of the <hi>Primipili</hi> in the tenth Legion) was called forth to begin the fight. He

his battels in the Flancke: Which <hi>Caesar</hi> perceiving, he made a signe to those selected
Cohorts (which for that purpose, he had set apart from the other squadrons) to charge
upon the enemies Cavallery, which they performed with such force and fury, striking
them (according to <hi>Caesars</hi> directions) no where but in the face,<note place="margin">Miles faciom feri. Flor.</note> which <hi>Pompey</hi>'s horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
unable to endure, turned head and fled to the Mountaines. Which service finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

as yet had not moved, so that <hi>Pompey</hi>'s men, being now with fresh Companies char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
both in the front and reare, were not able any longer to sustaine the Battell, but
all of them turned their backes and fled. The victory being gotten in the Field, <hi>Caesar</hi>
followed <hi>Pompey</hi> to the Campe, which he easily tooke; and then <hi>Pompey</hi> fled for his

new troubles did arise in Africa: thither many principall <hi>Romans,</hi> which had

Leptis where he is received: and while he lyes thereabout, <hi>Labienus</hi> comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

perceiving his intents,<note place="margin">Artificio magis quam viribus decertandum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hirtius debello Afr.</note> resolves to deale with him rather by cunning than force. And
first, he chargeth his men not to stirre above foure foot from their standards, which
the horsemen of <hi>Labienus</hi> perceiving, presently compassed them about, so that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
people were compelled to fight as it were in a circle: There, <hi>Labienus</hi> shewes
himselfe unto them, having uncovered his face, saying withall to one whom he saw

puts them to flight.</p>

miscarried, and fell into the enemies hands, in one of which was a Centurion with
some old soldiers, and some newly taken up, all of them were brought before the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>
Scipio, <hi>and to them thus he addressed his speech.</hi> I know and am assured (Soldiers)
that it is not of your owne accord, that thus wickedly you pursue and prosecute good men your
fellow-Citizens, but rather that you are forced thereunto by the command of that wicked
Emperour of yours: since therefore fortune hath brought you within our power, if you will
(as your duty bindes you) with other good men labour to defend the Common-weale, you
know that we will not onely spare your lives, but also take you into our protection and pay,
wherefore answer us what you are minded to doe: <hi>To this the Centurion of the 14. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(having liberty to speake) answers:</hi> For thy great good will, noble <hi>Scipio,</hi> I give
thee hearty thanks, and happily I should make use of thy proffered curtesie, if too great a
wickednesse were not coupled therewith, wherefore know you that I will never beare armes
against <hi>Caesar</hi> my Emperour, from whom I have received my order, and for whose dignity
and honour I have fought more than 36. yeares: moreover, I would counsell you, noble
<hi>Scipio,</hi> to desist from thy enterprise, for if hitherto thou hast had no experience of him against
whom thou dost contend, yet now at last take him into consideration: chuse among all thy
souldiers one whole Cohort, which thou thinkest to be most strong and valiantest, and I will
take but ten of these my fellow-souldiers, which now are within thy power, and by our valour
you shall understand, what trust and confidence thou canst have in thine owne Troopes.

souldiers immediately.</hi>

fought with them twice in the field of Philippos, a Citie in Macedonia: In the

because he knew his enemies were pinched with want of victuals, and some other
necessaries: secondly, because he saw the left wing of his Armie which had beene

Legions, and two Standards with the Imperiall Eagles. But oh the cruelty that these

may see that none of the foure great Monarchies of the world, how strong and

Enemie to enrich himselfe with the spoyle of the Country; and when such an Armie
is composed, what good can be expected from it, seeing it must needs consist of
raw, and untrained people, hastily gathered together, and altogether unskilfull in the
use of Armes? When <hi>Caesar</hi> came against <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great into Italy, <hi>Pompey</hi> and the

(as this Kingdome is) who on all sides, coast it upon the Sea; as
that no Warre, neyther offensive nor defensive, can be well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
without it. If we be on the offensive part, our forces cannot
be transported without <hi>Shipping;</hi> and if we bee on the defensive
part, we cannot well keepe out an enemy without the same. For
though the Enemy may make his approaches in one place, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to land there, yet then will the strength of the Island be drawne thither to
impeach his landing; which the Enemy perceiving, can easily put out to Sea againe,
and by next day be in another part of the Country, where he may gaine landing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
with lesse hazard: But suppose resistance be made there also, yet can hee
by putting to Sea againe, finde out a third, fourth, or fifth place, as convenient for
his landing as eyther of the former; and I am sure we cannot have an Armie in every
Harbour to impeach him, much lesse can wee with one Armie so speedily follow
him, as to prevent his gaining the shore; because he can sayle farther in one night,
than we can march in divers dayes, and if he hath gained our shore, hee can eyther
sufficiently intrench himselfe, before we can possible come to impeach him; or hee
can pillage and waste the Country, and be gone againe to another part of the Island,
when he perceives the approach of our Land forces; and there also doe according to
his owne discretion.</p>
                        <p>An example hereof we have in our owne Chronicles;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Stowes Annals</hi> in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Edmund.</note> 
                           <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the <hi>Thames</hi> with a mighty Navie, besieged the Citie of London; but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to prevaile there, he re-imbarkes his men, and sailes into the West of England;
where at his pleasure, he landed them againe in Dorcetshire; there <hi>Edmond,</hi> sirnamed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18615:27"/>
                           <hi>Iron-side,</hi> after a long and tedious march met with him; which <hi>Canutus</hi> perceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
shippes his men againe, and enters the <hi>Severne;</hi> causing <hi>Edmund</hi> to beate upon
the hoofe, to relieve Worcestershire; which the Dane had much pillaged. No soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was <hi>Edmund</hi> arrived there, but <hi>Canutus</hi> re-imbarked againe, and came for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
after him speeds <hi>Edmund:</hi> and then the Danes repaire to their shippes, and so
returned for the Westerne parts. Thus they tyred <hi>Edmund</hi> and his whole Armie,
with continuall marches; ever wasting the Country, before resistance could
be made.</p>
                        <p>The like example, we have in <hi>Maurice</hi> Earle of Nassaw, who in the yeare 1590.
shipped his forces, with forty Canons, pretending for <hi>Gertrudenberg;</hi> and to make the
Enemie beleeve so, he sailed up the River so farre as <hi>Breda;</hi> the Enemie presently
thrust into <hi>Gertrudenberg,</hi> such men and provision as was fit for resistance; which the
Grave understanding, changed his course and sayled up the Rhine, and thence into
the River Yssell; and so fell downe the streame before Zutphen, which he surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
before the Arch-duke (who was 80. miles from thence) could come with his
succours; when the Arch-duke approached, the Count retyres to his ships; and
changing his course, arrives before Hulst in Brabant, which he surprized, ere the
Spaniards well understood where he was; when the Arch-duke approached neare
Hulst, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> returnes to his Navie, and presents it before Nimmegem, in
the Confines of Guilders, which he also surprized before the tired Spaniard could
come with his forces.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is needfull for Islanders and Maritine Countries, to maintaine
<hi>Shipping</hi> and Marriners; So is it as needfull for them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Souldiers and <hi>Land-forces;</hi> which though they bee the last
refuge, yet are they the safest and strongest defence, and must
wholly be relyed on: For it is possible that the enemy may over-power
us at Sea, or he may by helpe of Windes and Mistes, or
other advantages that may bee gotten, gaine footing on our
shore, though we have a more potent Navie than he on the Seas; and how shall we
deale with them on land if we maintaine not our <hi>Land-forces</hi> and Martiall discipline?
for which this Island hath beene very famous in times past; Should wee suffer our
souldiery and the Art of Warre to decay amongst us, ten thousand of the Enemies
well trained, would foile forty thousand of ours, that are not flesht, nor know the
use of their armes, were they never so valiant; For <hi>Valour in the warres without skill,
availeth but little:</hi> As may appeare by the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; who
with no more than 40. thousand well-trained souldiers (Macedonians) in the fields of
Adrastia, overthrew sixe hundred thousand Persians, that were unskilfull in the use of
their Armes.</p>
                        <p>I would to God that notice might be taken hereof, and that greater care might
be had of our Trainings than is; that they might no longer be used as matters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport,
and things of no moment; but as needfull for the training up of souldiers, and
enabling of men for the Warres, against times of danger and hostilitie; so should our
Prince and his Kingdomes, receive both honour and securitie: But as Trainings are
now used, we shall I am sure, never be able to make one good souldier; for our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
and use is now adayes, to cause our Companies to meet on a certaine day, and
by that time the Armes be all viewed, the Muster-master hath had his pay (which is the
chiefest thing many times he looks after) it drawes towards dinner time; and indeed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18615:27"/>
Officers love their bellies so well, as that they are loath to take too much paines
about disciplining of their souldiers. Wherefore, after a little carelesse hurrying over
of the Postures, with which the Companies are nothing bettered, they make them
charge their Muskets, and so prepare to give the Captaine a brave volley of shot at his
entrance into his Inne; where having solaced themselves a while after this brave ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
every man repaires home; and that which is not well taught them (oh the shame)
is easily forgotten before the next Training. Whereas, if we trained but twice in the
yeare, and at each time kept the Companies together, but three or foure dayes at the
most; they would be better acquainted with their Armes and the use of them: so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
practising of them at one time, would make them remember what is shewed, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than seven yeeres practice as now we goe to worke.</p>
                        <p>But, peradventure some will thinke, that to keepe souldiers so long together at
once, would damnifie the Country, by reason of neglect of husbandry: But as farre as I
conceive, it would rather be beneficiall to the Country; for now every Moneth in the
Summer, they lose a day by reason of the Training, and the greater part of the Souldiers
use to fall a drinking after the Training, and happily lose the next day also; and so in the
Moneths of Iune, Iuly, and August, which are busie times for Hay, and Harvest,
they lose three dayes or more; which is more damage to them, than eight dayes in
May and September, for these are the two times in the yeare, wherein husbandmen
have more leisure, than in any other of the Summer-Moneths; in May, because all
their seed is then in the ground, and no Hay nor Corne ready; in the latter end of
September, because Harvest and Hop-time, for the most part is over, and wheat-seed
not fully come; wherefore I thinke, with lesse damage, they might spare foure dayes
together in May, and so many also in September, than to spare in every of the Summer
moneths but one.</p>
                        <p>We have other inconveniences also which attend our Trainings, and hindreth our
breeding of Souldiers; for we appoint our meetings, commonly neare some great
Towne, as indeed it is meet for the reliefe of the Companies, but this inconvenience
followeth thereon: when we are in the Field, many of our souldiers (so regardlesse
are they of the Service) slip away, and are in the Innes and Tavernes tipling, when
they should be exercising in the field. And this is another cause, why divers of them
are so ignorant in the use of their Armes; hereby also they get an ill habit of drinking,
which is the disgrace of our Nation and the losse of many of our souldiers, at such
times as they are imployed in forraigne service: As appeared in the taking of the
Groyn,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Stowes Annals</hi> in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Elizabeth.</note> where by immoderate drinking, many of the soldiers became senselesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable,
being altogether carelesse both of their proper healthes, present danger, and
imployment. By this inordinate drinking, the Plague was bred among them; and
(which is worse) the sword of the Enemie might have cut them off;<note place="margin">Priusquam Scythae e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietate, quam Bello vincuntur. Just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 1.</note> had not the
Generall, for redresse hereof, caused the head of all Wine-vessels, to be strucken out:
according to a former president (upon the like occasion) in the conquest of S. <hi>Dominigo
Jago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> For prevention of which abuse, the Captaines must either have more
power to punish, or if they have power enough already, they must better put
it in practice upon such malefactors, or we shall never be able to make them Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we admit into our trained Bands, without judgement or discretion,
any that are offered, how unlikely, or uncapable soever they be of the <hi>Art militarie;</hi>
yea, which is worse, we suffer them almost every Training to alter their men, and
put in new ones, and how is it possible, with our best skill and paines, to make such
men souldiers? <hi>Mercuries</hi> Image is not to bee made of every wood, nor eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dull heavie fellow, to be made a <hi>Mars</hi> or man of Warre; care must be had to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
this abuse also, if we will have able souldiers to oppose against an enemie. We
must therefore herein imitate the worthy Citizens of London,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Stowes Annals</hi> in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Elizabeth.</note> who in the Reigne of
Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> chose out of their severall Companies, three thousand of the most
likely and active persons, whom they appointed to be Pikemen and shot: These that
we admit into our trained Bands, must be likely and active; for every one that will
be a souldier, must have these two qualities in him; <hi>Likelinesse,</hi> and <hi>Ingenuitie</hi> to
conceive the use of his Armes, and then <hi>Activitie</hi> and <hi>Abilitie</hi> of body, to put it
in practice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:18615:28"/>
Thirdly, some be admitted for their wealthes sake, into Captaineships, which
neither have courage, skill, nor delight in Armes themselves, nor discretion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
others; but I hope of these not many, yet if any, it is too many; for how can
we hope to make our people souldiers, when they bee under blinde and ignorant
guides;<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>If the Blinde leade the Blinde,</hi> the issue (as our Saviour saith) will be; <hi>Ambo
in foveam cadunt:</hi> We will not commit the teaching of our children to a Dunse, and
what reason is there we should commit the leading of our souldiers to such a one?
wherefore this must be remedied also, and I suppose it may easily be done by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
care of the Lord Lieutenant in every County: Had wee but all these abuses
well corrected, me thinkes we might make our English trained Bands, paralell the
best souldiers in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Now because in times of danger, it is requisite that the trained souldiers should be
drawne to the Coasts to resist the Enemies landing; it were fit that men should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
themselves of double Armour, that we might also have an Army of the best men
of the Kingdome, to guard the heart of the Land; and to keepe under dis-affected
persons, if any such be; which Army as occasion served, might give succour to the
Trained Souldiers,<note place="margin">Stow in regno Haroldi.</note> in case they should be in any danger; for it is not safe to hazard all
upon the fortune and successe of one Battell; as King <hi>Harold</hi> did (contrary to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his brother <hi>Girthe)</hi> by meanes of which he was defeated, his people disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
his Enemy Duke <hi>William</hi> animated; and finally, thereupon followed his owne
and all his subjects confusion: For upon his enemies marching forward after the
Battell, every man for his owne particular safetie, reconciled himselfe to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour;
whereas, if there had beene an Army in the heart of the Land, to have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
the other, it would both have bridled the Enemie, succoured the distressed
Army, and have kept the Natives from revolting.</p>
                        <p>For the better composing of such an Army, in the heart of the Land; it were well
also if all our great Cities and Townes, would imitate the famous Cities of London,
and Westminster: which have instituted the two <hi>Artillery yards,</hi> for the training up
of their ablest Citizens, in the use of their <hi>Armes;</hi> from whence not onely good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
but also many good Leaders and Officers might be drawne, for the conduction
of our forces in the heart of the Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, whereas divers Noblemen and Gentlemen keepe proper men to
attend them; if they would but take care to have such Servants well instructed in the
use of their <hi>Armes,</hi> both on Horse-backe and Foot, what exceeding profit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
might redound to his Majesty, and his Kingdomes, if he should have any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
imployments? And those Servants thus souldier-like qualified, were as easily
maintained and kept, and as fit for any other service, as those brave swaggering fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes;
who had rather be like <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> among light women, than among
Troopes of armed souldiers: And truly such Noblemen and Gentlemen their bee
in divers places, who to doe their Prince Service, are at great charges to keepe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
good and well ridden Horses, and divers Gentlemen with good furniture, to
serve both on Foot and Horse-back.</p>
                        <p>Besides if every private man, whether in the City or in the Country, which
keepes Coaches for their owne ease and reputation, would but have furniture for the
riding and managing of such Horses, what an increase of strength would this bee in
suddaine danger?</p>
                        <p>Lastly, whereas divers Gentlemen of the lower ranke, and rich Yeomen, keepe
very good Teames of Horses for their private use; if such would but have furniture
for one of their principle Horses, which when they had leisure, they might ride and
manage for their recreation; this would make his Majesty, if occasion served, equall
if not superiour in Horse, to any Prince in Europe; neither would it bee any great
charge to any man, onely the purchase of the furniture, and armes, which once gotten,
would last to Generations.</p>
                        <p>We would easily be perswaded to these things,<note place="margin">Publica privatis ante ferenda bonis.</note> had we but as great a care for the
generall safety of the Kingdome, as we have for our owne particular security: which
of us in there, that is not at great cost and charges, for provision of strong Gates,
doores, and lockes, without; and of strong Closets and Chests within, for the
preseruation of our owne private wealth and substance; but what will this private
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18615:28"/>
care availe us, if we be negligent of the generall safety of the Kingdome? Should we
by our senselesse security suffer an Enemy to picke the lockes that are to keepe him
out of the Realme; What good would all our private Gates, Doores, Lockes, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,
and Chests doe us, for the preservation either of our Estates or Lives? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let us be perswaded rather to respect the common good in keeping out an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by provision of Armes, and able souldiers, than in looking to our owne private
honour and security, by building our houses strong and stately.</p>
                        <p>But some peradventure will thinke, this provision of land-forces, is altogether
needlesse; because no Enemy can make warre upon us, we living in an Island; but
upon very difficult termes: First, in regard of our dangerous Seas and Harbours.
Secondly, in regard of our Navie and shipping; which upon intelligence, will bee
fitted to entertaine them. Thirdly, in regard of our strong Castles, and Blockhouses;
which will be able to impeach their landing. As for our Seas and Harbours, true it is
they are dangerous,<note place="margin">Histori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cubits in height: yet for all this, our owne, and Neighbours shipping, (having
good Pilots) dayly frequent them without damage or danger: and doubtlesse, what
Enemy soever assaulteth us, will store himselfe with Pilots, which knowes our
Seas and Harbours as well as our selves; as may appeare by the practice of the King
of Spaine, in the yeare 1588. Wherefore, we may not be too secure, upon conceit
of our dangerous Seas and Harbours.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for our shipping; true it is, if we have sure intelligence, we should bee
provided: and doubtlesse, would quell an enemy that should dare to approach them:
But the Enemy to blinde our intelligence, may carry his designes in the Clouds, by
making his preparation in divers parts and Ports of his Kingdome; as if they were
to be sent to sundry places, and about sundry imployments; and yet all these severall
Heets, after some time beating on the Seas, may meet and joyne; cutting a speedie
passage through the waters to accomplish their designes. By such courses as these,
our intelligence may be deceived, and so our Ships unfurnished. Yet suppose wee
have sure knowledge of the enemies purpose, and have our Navie in readinesse, yet
are there 32. points in the Compasse to sayle by, and our Island the Center; in one of
these 32. points, must our Navie await the approaches of the Enemy; and he to eschew
their opposition, and gaine our shore, may sayle by 20. other. Yea, though he sayle
upon the same point whereon our Ships doe lye, yet may he without discovery escape
them, by the helpe of a Mist or night. Or suppose our shippes discover and fight
with them, yet we know victory in every fight is doubtfull; because no understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Enemy will put out to Sea, but with such a Fleet, as he thinkes is proportionable
to his adversaries, whom he assayleth. Therefore, you see we must not relye upon
our shipping.</p>
                        <p>Neyther may we relye too much upon our Block-houses and Forts, for the sure
keeping out of an Enemy; for they are not very many: I am sure we have them not
upon every Harbour where the Enemy may land; and those we have, are not very
strong, not answerable to those Forts beyond the Seas. But though they were, yet
experience teacheth us that upon swift currents they are of little use; for in such
streames, if a Navie have but a merry Winde and Tide, a hundred sayle may passe by
one of them, without having much damage; as was seene in the three yeares siege
of Ostend,<note place="margin">Grimston.</note> where the Arch-duke had planted two Batteries, one on the West, and
the other on the East side of the Haven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the shippes every day passed too and fro
from the Towne, and scarse one vessell touched, when 70. shot had beene made at
a Fleet; and in the whole three yeares siege, scant 50. Vessels were sunke, when thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
passed too and againe, every yeare.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the King of Denmarke threatned to stop
our Eastland Fleet at the <hi>Sound;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Sir Walter Raleigh.</note> yet they passed by his Castles, having one of the
Queenes ships called the <hi>Minion,</hi> to lead them, and received no hurt; this so provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the King, that he made the best provision he possible could, to sinke them at their
returne; but the Queenes ship led the way backe againe, and did not onely passe in
safety, but beate downe part of the Fort of Elsenore.</p>
                        <p>So in the siedge of Antwerp the Duke of Alva so planted his Ordnance, that it
was thought to be impossible for a Boate to passe them; yet the Zealanders having
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18615:29"/>
faire Winde and Tide, passed by daily without damage. Wherefore, you see not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

be quartered in this manner: the Body to attend the principle place supposed for the

hold an Enemy play, till the forces of the Country comes downe. But in regard the
Land is spacious and wide, it were well that souldiers should learne to ride on

(unknowne to the Enemy) might bring him in very great hazard of our dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Rockes and Sands; and in regard our Sea-coasts are so large, and our Harbours
so many, as that in every one of them we cannot have an Army to defend it, it were
well that in places of advantage (such as winding waters be, which are commonly
slow, and where at every turne they cannot have the helpe of the Winde) some more
Forts were built; in such places they would indanger an Enemy, if he should dare
to approach them; how ever they would secure the Coasts from rifling and robbing
by Pyrates, as often they be in times of Hostility.</p>

For the raising of Fortifications, we must observe what Figures are capable of
Regular Fortification, and what are uncapable; which are termed Irregular.</p>
                           <p>Regular Fortifications are such formes or figures, which containe in them Angles
sufficiently equall, and capable for the direct answering one to another; sixe points
being the least that may be admitted, and so upwards: all figures under, are termed
Irregular; as the figure <hi>Pentagon</hi> consisting of Five points, the Foure-square, the
Triangle, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>We will first begin with Irregular-figures used
in Fortification; of which the <hi>Pentagon</hi> is the best,
in regard it hath more capacity in it, than the Foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>square,
or Triangle, or Halfe-Moones, &amp;c. The
forme of this Figure hath five points, by reason of
five Lines that divide the Circumference in five e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
parts, as by this Figure appeares.</p>
                           <figure/>
                           <p>The next Irregular Figure, is the Foure square;
and is capable of foure Bulworkes, upon each point
one; and is tearmed a <hi>Skonse,</hi> as the Figure demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</p>
                           <figure/>
                           <p>The next Irregular Figure is the Triangle, being
farre inferiour in strength to the former, in regard it
is capable but of three Bulworks, upon each point
one; as the Figure demonstrates.
<figure/>
                           </p>
                           <p>The next Irregular Figure, is the Horne-worke;
and is most proper for the lodging of men in it, and
for the securing of the principall walles and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
of a Fort, from the ruining of the shot.
<figure/>
                           </p>
                           <p>All Forts framed without Bulworks, are eyther

                           <p>The second kinde of halfe Moones whose

Workes, as after shall more fully be demonstrated,

                           </p>
                           <p>The first Regular Figure is called <hi>Sexagon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath sixe equall sides, dividing the Cord in
sixe points (upon which points are sixe Bulworkes
to be raised) The same proportion of distance your
Compasses take, in making the Circumference, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stirring them, being plac'd sixe times upon the
Circumference, makes the said Figure in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                           <figure/>
                           <p>The second Regular Figure is termed <hi>Septagon,</hi>
because it containes 7. points of equall distances in
the Circumference, and this is of greater defence
than the former; for the more points the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is capable of, the greater is the resistance; as
the Figure in the Margent shewes.</p>
                           <figure/>
                           <p>The third Regular Figure is termed <hi>Octagon,</hi>
because it containes eight sides, the Circumference
being divided by eight points of equall distance; the
rest, for brevity sake, we will onely name: by these
already described, any Figure, of what diversity of
sides soever; most easily may be framed.</p>

ad infinitum:</hi> These are sufficient to serve for the use of Fortification; because it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

these Figures are called Regular, because they have their sides, and their Angles

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here can be no perfect Fortification made, without the use of these
precedent Figures: as for our example, the Figure <hi>Sexagon</hi> is to
have sixe Bulworks <hi>(viz.)</hi> one upon every Angle; and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
of the rest of the Figures, so many Angles as many
Bulworkes. But first, before we begin to fortifie any place, wee
are to consider the scituation, and the forme and fashion of it;
to the end we may the better know how many Bulworkes will
be requisite: wherefore we will begin to fortifie the Figure <hi>Sexagon,</hi> because it is
the first Regular forme; as for the Triangle it selfe, it is altogether unproper to bee
fortified, because the Angles of it are too sharpe, and pointing out: and likewise for
the uncapablenesse of the place: for such Bulworkes as are made upon three Angles,
doe so farre point out and extend themselves, that they are of no strength to releeve
each the other: Likewise the square Figure is very rarely fortified with Bulworkes,
unlesse in case of necessity, where it may bee help'd and assisted by some naturall
strength, as <hi>Skinkens-Skonse</hi> by <hi>Cleve,</hi> is naturally fortified and strengthened with
two great Rivers surrounding it. Likewise the Figure <hi>Pentagon,</hi> although the points
of it are more apter to be fortified, yet it is not capable of all those essentiall parts, that
a perfect fortification ought to have. Therefore we will begin to comment upon the
Figure <hi>Sexagon;</hi> and as we have shewed before, this Figure is to have sixe Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes
<hi>(viz.)</hi> one upon every Angle: Wee are further to suppose, that the Figure
aforesaid containes in circuit 180. Geometricall paces, and five feet to every such
pace; so that every side betweene Angle and Angle, will containe 30. paces; and
being thus divided into sixe equall distances, of 30. paces in each, the whole amounts
to 180. paces; for sixe times 30. makes as before, 180. Now it remaines to make a
Scale, as you may perceive in this Figure following, marked with <hi>A B,</hi> with the
which Scale we will give all the proportions of this Fortesse, which we now intend
to set forth for an example to the ingenuous Practitioner.</p>

mention of a cheaper way of fortifying, by deciphering a Bulworke with a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse

set forth: and as it is of lesse charge, so it is of small defence, in regard it is deficient

are so much discovered, that the enemy may ruine them in a short
time: I shall now endeavour to shew you another kinde of Flancke
with a shoulder, as the next following Figure hath, marked with, a a
to the end that the Flancke B should be covered from the force of the
shot; So that if the enemy should plant his Ordinance upon the battery C. to shoot
against the Flancke B. it cannot possibly make a breach, because it must first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

downe the shoulder A. which will nothing advantage them to doe; or if the enemy
thinkes to passe by the shoulder with his shot, hee cannot possibly hit the Flancke,
but must grase against the Curtin: And for this onely purpose the shoulder was first
invented to joyne to the Flancke. Now for the forming the Shoulder, you must part
with your compasses, the length of this Flancke into three equall parts, and take two
of these parts to frame the Shoulder A. the third part is the length of the Flancke B.
which shall bee tenne paces long, and fifty foot deepe into the Bulworke: Likewise
the sayd Shoulder ought to bee drawne right opposite to the point of the Bulwork D.
view the Figure, and you shall perceive this allowance of depth into the Bulworke,
maketh a short line betwixt the extreames of the Curtin B. B. especially if the Wing
bee allowed but 120 feete: whereby some may judge it the lesse defensive, yet it will
not prove so, in regard the Defendants (in case the enemy hath once gotten the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke)
may place more men upon the reintrenchment, then the enemy can place
upon that line: But indeed the Flancke lieth more open, whereby the Artillery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
may bee dismounted more easily, then if the defence did proceed from the Angle
of the Flancke, as you may perceive by the peeces of Ordnance planted upon the Catte
E. how they directly beate into the middest of the Flancke of the Bulworke, passing
downe by the Line of defence: View the Figure following. I shall take an occasion

of some Port. In these necessities, wee are to accomodate
our selves according to the nature of the place, and save the expence of money and
time, which a royall Fort would cost: for indeed there is nothing so strong as such
places that are strong by nature, as you may perceive by the subsequent Figure, which
hath two broad Rivers compassing two sides, which makes it very strong; so that
the simplest Bulworkes there, are as defensible as the artificiallist: observe the Figure,
and you shall perceive the two halfe Bulworkes in the farthest sides of the River
marked with E. and F. are but halfe Flanckes, because it is not to bee feared that the
enemy can gaine the worke by any of those sides, but rather on that side where there
is firme Land, wherefore the Bulworke C. is as a perfect forme. Likewise you may
take notice of the halfe Moones, M. and N. which are places of retreate, for those
that shall defend without, beyond the Mote. The Port of the Towne is at P. the
Bridge is O. upon that side of the great River B. because there the enemy cannot so
easily approach to raise a battery, being scanted in ground, the sayd River not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them space: The place you see marked with H. and L. are the Platformes, and
so called, because they are a plaine forme without Flanckers, and are very commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to plant along by the Rivers. Further, observe that the Enginiere is to consider
in all such irregular places, how many Bulworkes it can well containe: for to raise
more Workes then needs must; or to place fewer, whereby the distances from one
Worke to the other will bee too farre, will prove a great fault; wherefore by the
scale, you may take all the true distances; as for those sides the Rivers surrounds, few
Workes will serve: provided alwaies, they bee well guarded and Man'd; for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the enemy will put in practise some strattagem against that side you thinke your
selfe securest of: For hee may make Bridges of Cords, and scale the Walls, which
will be a most difficult thing for him to doe, if you bee provided for him afore hand,
for such an encounter: Neverthelesse it will bee very good to make a halfe Moone,
where the Guard may have certaine Boats secure, to take a view up and downe the
River; especially the head of the River, towards X. least any Boates should come
downe the streames; and likewise to stay all Boates that shall passe by day and night,
and search them, least they taste the same sharpe sauce that <hi>Skinkens-Skons,</hi> and <hi>Breda</hi>

                           </note> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the ground would require, it is thought the safest way to cut off the said point
<hi>M,</hi> and to fashion it with a double point, so as it may defend it selfe, and strengthen
the Bulworke the better, and a great deale lesse paines and travell in raising of it; for
indeed the very point of the Bulworke must have beene raised a great way in the
water, as you may observe by the prickes. Take notice likewise of the two halfe
Moones before each port, which have their defences from the two Bulworks on
each side of them; and as I have sayd before, they serve for a retreat to those that
guard without, and likewise defend the Ports from suddaine surprises: Further,
observe that the Flanckes are but 20. paces, because of the small distance, for indeed
their needs no such large flanckes; for if they were bigger, then the Bulworke should
extend it selfe further into the River, which would be a mighty charge, and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
as you may perceive by the Bulworke <hi>q,</hi> the pricked lines that are marked in
the water. Lastly, observe for a generall Rule, that in all workes of this nature, if
the line totall of any side, be 170. paces, or thereabouts, that then the Curtaine
flanckes is made about 200. paces; if shorter, then the Curtaine shorter proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably;
alwayes provided, that the flanckes looking each upon other, upon each Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
be neare of of equall length: for the shoulders, it maketh not much if they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

the other side, at the letter <hi>L,</hi> is firme land: wherefore
it behoveth that the side <hi>L,</hi> should be very well fortified,
according to the rules of a Regular figure, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

the other side, the Walles are to be made very high, for
feare of surprizall, without any workes of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,

Moorie or Rockie side, <hi>H,</hi> a good Ditch, yea though the
Rocke be so high, that no water can come into the Ditch; and if it should likewise
happen that the other ditch <hi>L,</hi> on the Land-side should be dry, and without water,
yet there is a little Wall that runnes along the Ditch at <hi>BB,</hi> which is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

for they cannot be annoyed by the Enemie, because they are below and under the

for no Fort whatsoever can be accounted strong, unlesse the ditches of it will stand
full of water: Those ditches that are dry, serves onely to defend the Counterscharpe,
that which is full of water hinders the Enemy from making his surprises; as wee
shall more at large discourse of afterwards. <hi>View the Figure following in the 54. Page.</hi>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving sufficiently discourst about Irregular Figures of Fortification,
it now remaines, that we should take notice of such Fortifications,
as in former ages have beene used for the safeguard of Townes; and
so take an occasion to discourse of the imperfections of our walled
Townes here in England, that we may not bee deceived in putting
our confidence in the strength of them; and afterwards wee shall
observe the strength and perfection that our moderne Enginieres have brought this
Art unto: Wherefore note, the first Fortifications that the Ancients made use of,
was naturall; as strengthened by Waters, by Rockes, by Mountaines, inaccessible
and Moorish quag-mires. We may see this by the King <hi>Atilla,</hi> entering into Italy
with great force and strength, in such sort, that hee vanquisht all; except, such as
escaped and fied for their defence, into an Island in the Mediterranean Sea, where
they releeved themselves; The place is now called <hi>Venice,</hi> being partly scituated in
the Sea, and partly upon Moores and Quagmires; so that the Enemy could not come
at them, neither with Horse nor foot: but finding these places naturally strong, not
to be sufficient to defend them, they began to joyne Art to helpe fortifie Nature;
laying a foundation round the Towne, of Bricke, Stone, and Lime; building thereon
very high Walles, with square Towers, some 60. paces a sunder; from whence they
did defend themselves and their Walles. Rome is the most antientest Fortification;
which by the aforesayd Walles, the River Tyber, and the great Hilles, they made shift
to increase their Dominions. Likewise, in England we have divers old Townes, as
Colchester, &amp;c. But in short time, Art grew more perfect; and finding those foure
square Towers to be weake and unprofitable, by reason of the Corners, being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the rest of the Wall soone gave way to their Engines; wherefore they inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Towers of a rounder forme, as being farre stronger, like to the Fortification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Ipswich, and Norwich, as in the next Chapter we shall discourse of: <hi>View the

could not demolish those round Towers, untill
they had learned a way to get the foot of them, and to
inmine themselves under, so that the Defendants could
not spie them; as you may perceive by the Letter A. at
the foot of the Tower: So that in short time, by helpe
of their Engines, they would overturne their Towers;
and they within could not offend them from the next Tower, as you may see by the
Line drawne from A. to B. Wherefore they were constrained to finde out a remedy
to strengthen themselves better. By this you may see what poore strength our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

a third way, which was to Fortifie with a kinde of
Angled Figure; which Angles extended equally out, and the
former Ages termed them Bastions: And these kinde of
Fortifications were so equally framed, that the Enemy could
finde no place to secure themselves under the Walls of
it; but that the Defendants could easily annoy them: then
they thought themselves their Crafts-masters, and that they
had attained the perfection of the Art of Fortifying: But experience soone taught
them, that their Bastions were some longer then the other, and being altogether too
little; and so consequently of small defence: wherefore they were constrained to
make another Worke in the middest of the Curtin, within the Ditch, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
at <hi>A.</hi> the which they called a Platforme; which they thought could streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

Whereupon they did not much change the fashion of the Figure,
but the place of the Platforme, whereas before it was set below:
Now they plac'd it above upon the Rampiere, in the middest of the
Curtin, in the forme of a Quadrangle; the other being in forme of
a Circle, being in a place the enemy could not approach to: they
counted the matter not great, of what forme it was, so it could lodge foure or sixe

and remedies; Now it remaines wee should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
of our moderne workes, which are now brought
to bee most perfect, in regard of those Ancient Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
before mentioned: And first wee will speake of
their measures and proportions; the which must serve
us for Maximes, because they are grounded upon very
good and infalible reasons, as experience hath shewed, and
doth teach us dayly.</p>
                        <p>I. That Fortresses are composed of many Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes,
and that the sayd Bulworkes should bee of equall distances, and of equall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles;
the ground being so large, that a Regular worke may bee raysed thereon, as
neere as may bee equally: As for Irregular workes, necessity must drive us to make
them; wanting the commodiousnesse of ground, that the Regular Figure should
have.</p>
                        <p>II. The Bulworkes ought to bee large and spacious, to the end they may
Re-intrench themselves, and the point or Angels as blunt as possible may bee made.</p>
                        <p>III. That the entery or mouth of the Bulworke, ought to bee from Sixty to
Seventy paces (viz.) Thirty or Thirty five from each end of the Curtin, to the midest
or point of the entrance into the mouth of the Bulworke.</p>
                        <p>IIII. That the defence of the Bulwarkes, ought to bee taken from the third
part of the Curtin; at the least, as in all Formes or Figures of 6. 7. and 8. and of those
of 9. 10. 11. 12. of the halfe of the Curtin. As for the Pentagon, it will permit the
taking of the fift part of the Curtin, because the Angels are not so much pointed. As
for the square Figure, it ought not to bee put amongst the number of Fortresses, and
much lesse the Tryangle; for they onely are to bee raised in places of advantage,
which are strong by nature, or in a Campe or siege of a Towne.</p>
                        <p>V. The Line of defence (viz.) the distance that is taken from the Flanke, to
the point of the Bulworke opposite to it; ought to bee 180 paces (viz.) five foot to
each pace at the least, and 200 at the most: Although <hi>Erard</hi> alloweth not above 122<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Toyses, sixe foot to the Toyse Amounts to 735 feete: But his errour I shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
shew; and likewise the reason why I allow 265 foot more then he doth.</p>
                        <p>VI, The Line of the Flancke ought to bee Thirty paces, and if the Shoulders
of the Bulworke bee comprised in it; then the Flancke ought to bee larger by
the third part, (viz.) tenne paces, and twenty paces for the formi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>VII. The Ditch or Moate, ought to bee thirty paces broad, and running e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the sides of the Bulworkes.</p>
                        <p>VIII. In the middest of the Ditch, there ought to bee a Cave digged deeper
then the rest, some foure paces broad.</p>
                        <p>IX. The Counter-scarpe there, ought to bee framed, with Stones without
Lyme.</p>
                        <p>X. Vpon the Counterscarpe, there ought to bee an Alley three paces broad,
with a breast-worke ready to defend them; so that they may kneele and lay their Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
over it to discharge: and the Ground is to bee made all even beyond it, that the
enemy may have no Bancke to defend himselfe.</p>
                        <p>XI. All the good earth which is beyond the Counterscarpe, ought to bee thrown
away, a Musquet shot from it; and all kinde of Stones to bee plac't there in the roome
of it, which will infinitely offend the enemy, being battered about with the shot
from the Walles of the Fort.</p>
                        <p>XII The halfe Moones which are plac't in every Angle betweene two Bulworks,
ought to bee forty paces (viz.) twenty on either side; and the defence thereof,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18615:42"/>
ought to bee alwaies taken as neere as possibly may bee towards the Curtin; the Ditch
therof being foure Paces at least in breadth.</p>
                        <p>XIII. The Ditch or Moat, ought to bee Thirty foot deepe; being well stored
with all kinde of Fish, which may bee a great helpe to sustaine them in the time of a
Siege.</p>
                        <p>XIIII. The Wall or foundation of the Fort, ought to bee thirty foot high.</p>
                        <p>XV. The Rampier above the foundation of the Wall, ought to bee likewise 30.
foot in height, and 20. foot broad; both Curtins and Bulworks, are to have a Parrapet
answerable, and a foot-step for the Muskatiers to step upon, to make them of sufficient
height to discharge their Musquets over.</p>
                        <p>XVI. Vpon the entery or mouth of every Bulworke, there ought to bee a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere
eight foot high, and twenty paces large: So that three or foure Peeces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
may bee planted there for the making of Counter-batteries.</p>
                        <p>XVII. The place of the Hankes ought to bee fifty foot broad, and 75. or 80.
foot long.</p>
                        <p>XVIII. The rightnesse of the Shoulders ought to bee 50. foot long, in such sort
that it may shoot right to the point of the opposite Bulworke.</p>
                        <p>XIX. That such Sally-Ports as are necessary, ought to bee 15. foot broad, made
under the Wall in the Hancke, betweene the Shoulder of the Bulworke and the end
of the Curtin, to bee Brick't over like a Vaute; and at each end of it, a very strong
foulded Gate. These Sallyes are for the Souldiers to passe into the False-Bray to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Moat, and the foot of the Bulworkes and Curtins.</p>
                        <p>XX. The False-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ray, ought to bee 15. or 16. foot broad from the foot of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
to the Moat: At the very foot of the Rampiers, is planted a bed of quick-set, two
foot broad, which will not onely hinder the enemy from sudden running through it;
but also stayes up such earth as shall bee battered downe, from falling into the Moat:
Next the Moat, the False-bray hath a breast-worke, three or foure foot high for the
Musquetiers to shoot over to defend the Moate.</p>
                        <p>XXI. That above the end of the Shoulder called the Orillion, there ought to bee
an Imbracer, for to place a Peece of Ordnance, to batter against the Ruines that the
Enemy should make, in the face of the Bulworke.</p>
                        <p>XXII. That the Rampiers ought to bee made as much sloping, as they are high;
which is their naturall sloping: pinching inwards, that the Water may shoot off:
View the Table following, and reason will not only allow it, But will also reprehend
Mounsier <hi>Bellay,</hi> page 21. who allowes onely one foot slope, in 8. or 10. foot height:
So that a Wall being 60. foot high, by his Rule shall have but 6. foot slope; which
would make it so steepe, that without the battering of the Canon, every shower of
Raine will wash it and moulder it downe: Observe your best Fortifications, as <hi>Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
and <hi>Densburge,</hi> in Gilderland are by this rule framed.</p>
                        <p>XXIII. That such foundations of Stone or Bricke-workes as are made against
Waters, or otherwise to beare up the Fortifications of Earth; ought to bee 5. foote

so of the other parts: Now if the Head bee not wel-disposed,
then all the other Members will bee found ill: even so those
Bulworkes which are not formed according to the disposition

wee ought like the wise Physitian, alwaies to have some soveraigne Salve or
Antidote to apply according to the cause thereof: wherefore it is great wisedome
for us to examine from point to point, the defects, that wee may attaine the perfect
knowledge of them; whereby wee may gaine honour by making the perfecter cure:
Wherefore first let us examine the Battery, and the defects thereof; that wee may
apply the remedy that is proper to it. Batteries are made after divers fashions, as first,
the Enemy making divers Gabions or great Baskets, placing them accordingly, and
filling them full of good earth, which serves them for a shelter, in making their first
approaches: Afterwards approaching neerer, they raise their Cavaliers, and plant
their double Canons thereon, to batter downe the defences, and ruine their Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes;
then by their approaches in Trenches under the earth, just to the side of the
Counter-scarpe,<note place="margin">How to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies batteries made with Gabions.</note> they may come to ruine their Flanckes, which the defendants cannot
see to prevent; when at the first approaches they make use of Gabions: Those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Fort must helpe themselves by making Counter-batteries of their Cavaliers,
and batter downe their Gabions; which may easily bee done, if the Cannoneers bee
skilfull, whereby the Enemy will bee kept in continuall action; for there is no doubt
but that the Enemy makes approaches, to the end (as being Master of the Field) hee
shall gaine his desires in a short time: But the Defendants within the Fort, may make
him loose his time, which is the principall thing a good Fortresse can doe, for they
must expect reliefe to assist them, to cause his departure sooner; or that the deadnes
of Winter will make the Enemy retreat against his will. The principall thing to bee
required from the strength of a Fort, is to keepe off the Enemy, and delay him; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him loose his time,<note place="margin">Answer to an object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</note> nothing being more precious then the same: As to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

from their Cavaliers or Batteries; For the effecting of this they have but small time;
and it will prove very troublesome and dangerous to scale the same Breaches; because
our walles shall be raised in such sort, that the Counterscarpe shall be almost of equall
height with them; so that the Enemy shall not come at them with their Ordnance,
to make any deepe breach; for from their Platformes they shall no more then see the
top of the Workes, as you may perceive by this subsequent Figure at <hi>A. B.</hi> And as
for the Workes of the Fort, they are made so sloping, that the Cannon Bullet cannot
possihly batter it downe: and they are so thicke, that the Bullets rest in the middest
of the thicknes; they being 36 foot thick, and above; so that a Cannon cannot
possibly pierce halfe thorough, especially if the earth bee good, and well rammed

                        <p>Now let us discourse of the defects which may come by springing of Mines, which
is the most dangeroust disease incident to the ruining of Bulworkes: Wherefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,

Trayne, will blow up the Worke and all within it. To redresse this inconvenience,
and to hinder the Enemies Mining: There must instead of good Earth, bee Gravell
and Stones, which would hinder their Mining: and besides these Stones would fall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18615:46"/>
downe upon their heads, unlesse they framed supporters to stay it, which would bee
an infinite charge and trouble: those Stones would bee very offensive to the Enemy
being battered about amongst them by the Ordnance from the Walls; it would more
hurt and annoy them, then the Ordnance themselves: Further if the Mote bee full of
Water, and the Graft in the middest of it made so deepe as before is declared; it will
bee a meanes to drowne them in their Trenches and Mine: if the Mote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Water upon a Wooll-sacke, workes the same effect; this being discovered, you may
suffer the Enemy to dispose his Powder in the Mine, and when they are gone to give
fire to the Traine, in the interim to Mine to it and take it away: The like hath beene
done many times in the Netherlands: But the surest way to prevent the force of the
Powder in the Mine (if all other devices faile) is by making a Vaute downe deepe
into the Earth in the most suspected place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

darken the place. Now when the Enemy shall come to undermine the Bulworke, he
shall come to worke into that Vaute; where divers Souldiers being within it ready
provided for their comming, shall repulse the Enemy, they having great advantage
over them because the Vaute is large, and formed proper and fit for defence: The
Trenches of the Enemy being so small, they cannot stirre in them; and suppose the
Enemy should worke into the Mine, and finding no resistance, places his Powder,
and makes his Traines; yet it cannot take any effect because of thoses hole, which let
out the force of the Powder.</p>

and gaining the Souldiers loves by gifts and promises: In this case wee must make
choise of a trusty faithfull Captaine for Governour, which must bee allowed sufficient
maintenance, and having a good estate of his owne: Likwise the Souldiers must bee
well payed, and suffer no discontents to bee given them; there is nothing in the
World discontents a Souldier more, then debarring or misreckoning him in his Pay:
Further you may by the demeanoure of Souldiers perceive if they be bribed; First they
cannot containe themselves when they have money, but they will play or drink more
then ordinarily before, or shew their moneys, or buy themselves Apparell. Notice
being taken of these things, the judicious Captaine must have them in examination,
and search them, and upon the least suspicion commit them.</p>

he is to give so many sounds as there be severall persons; if the Troopes bee
Foot-men, then the Sentinell is to hang out a white-Flag, on that side the Tower
which the Port is of they come; if Horse-men, then he is after the same manner to
hang out a red Flag: by this the Guardes are warned to be in a readinesse, and the
Ports (if it be day-time) immediately to be shut up, and Spies sent out to discover
what they are, and their intents. Further, if intelligence should be gained that the
Enemy is a Foot, then to be more warie and set a double watch; these things may
seeme sufficient, for prevention of the premises.</p>
                        <p>The last maladie or imperfection, is a long Siedge; which spends both Men and
Munition,<note place="margin">Remedies to be used in a long Siedge, to prevent the Enemies purposes.</note> their Food and Provision to maintaine them. To this we must reply.
that a Fortified Towne, ought alwayes to be provided with Men and Ammunition,
and all kinde of other Provisions; as Corne of all kindes, Beere, Wine, Salt-fish,
Bacon, Vineger, or any thing else that is sit to sustaine the life of man; sufficient of
Salt-peter, Brimstone, &amp;c. for making of Powder, and Wild-fire; store of Lead for
Bullets, and the like. Further, such a Fort ought alwayes to have a Troope of Horse
in it, and store of Provision for them; whose Office are to make incursions upon the
Enemy, and to discover his marches and designes. Moreover, there must be good
store of Ordnance;<note place="margin">The difference in a Siedge betwixt great and small Ordnance, for their service.</note> especially some peeces, for they will be able to doe better Serviue
than the great Canons, in two respects; as first, the expence of Powder will be lesse;
Secondly, they are easier to be removed from place to place, as occasion shall bee
offered: The well managing and orderings in such a Fort, is of great consequence;
for we must conceive, an Enemy is at three times the Expences, let him be as provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as he can; Further, the Enemy being constrained to lose his time and spend his
meanes and Treasure, by bringing an Army against them; which shall eyther cause
them to raise their Siedge (as Grave <hi>Maurice Van Nassaw</hi> did at the Siedge of
Bergen-up-zone, he marching his Army to Rosand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Siedge of Duke <hi>John de Austria,</hi> finding him so strongly intrencht, retreated with
his Armie, and pitcht before Sluce, and suddainly tooke it. Thus you may see the
properties of a strong Garrison, how necessary they are in all respects; such imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as cannot be eschewed, must be borne withall, seeking to prevent them in
the best and safest manner we may. I hope this discourse will give a reasonable satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

take the space of 100. or 110. Toises, from the flanke of one Bulworke, to the point

as the Regular Figures are. This they use onely for the fortifying of some old Wall in

of defence, of the perfection of it, as I may terme it, because in the just proportion
thereof, depends the conservation of the Fortresse. Wherefere now we use to make

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this discourse of Fortification, we have fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
the Rules; how to fortifie after the Low-Country manner,
being the most absolutest manner that can be invented; we will not
lose the time to repeat it againe, they being drawne with the same
proportions, that at this day is, or ought to bee used in all places in
Europe, that is famous for Fortification: And in our progression
we will indeavour to make some comparisons, betwixt our moderne way of fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the ancient manner formerly used: From thence we shall draw the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the perfection of this Art, how farre it exceeds the writings and practises
of former Ages. First, we will begin with the Spanish and French; and by the way,
let us observe the oppositions that the French will have about the Line of Defence, in
their Fortifications, The principall Enginieres in France, as also <hi>Errard de Barledce,</hi>
which hath writ of Fortification; and he would have the defence of the Bulworke to
to be 100. Toises, which is 120. Venetian paces, that is 60. feet English by the
Rule,<note place="margin">A Toise is 6. Foot.</note> 12. inches to each foot; to the end (sayes he) that it may be defended with
Muskets; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lledging further, that the Canon can doe no great hurt or damage, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the uncertaintie of the shot; and because they cannot be discharged so often
as the Muskets, but there will be a great deale of intermission betwixt shot and shot.
He further opposes, that the defence ought to be taken from the Flanke: because
sayes he, it makes the Bulworke more obtuse in his Angle-Flanke. To these oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
we must make answer altogether, because the remedies of one of these faults,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18615:51"/>
depends upon that of the other: And first; we must know and hold for a Maxime
infallible, that no Fortresse but ought to be made with all advantages: so that it may
be able to defend against a great number; as if I should say; the advantage must be so
great, that one man may resist ten, this being taken for a ground and Rule, we come
now to confute this French opinion. <hi>(viz)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Line of Defence they hold ought not to bee above 100. Toises, or sixtie
feet English, or 120 to be the most; because (saith he) 120 or 144. Toises is the
furthest a Musket can shoot, to defend with them; further, the Canon they alledge
is of small validitie, in regard of its uncertaintie in shooting, so that it doth small
damage to the Enemy. If the French Enginieres will maintaine this Argument, they
must of necessity destroy the Flankes; making them so small for the lodging of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers
in them; but I say that cannot be done, because they must be larger to lodge
farre more Souldiers, for the defence of the Fortresse; for they ought to be 17. Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
large with the Shoulders, as Mr. <hi>Errard</hi> intends to give to each Flanke; which
amounts to some 20. paces, 5. foot to each pace, and this is but capable to lodge 34.
Souldiers on the sayd Flanke, allowing 3. foot distance for each Souldier to use his
Armes in: Now doe but observe, how the Enemy will have a wonderfull advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
by making his approaches in his roling Trenches, and Mines under the earth,
which shall bring them to the Counter-scarpe, where being arrived, they can raise
their Batteries, and cause their Ordnance to beate continually upon the heads of the
Musketiers that defend the Flankes, or the place that is to be assaulted; so that they
cannot be able to make resistance, or to doe them any hurt from the Walles; besides,
the Mote being large, the Enemy may lodge in his Workes, three times as many
Souldiers, which shall continually shoot against the Hankes of the Fort, and keepe
them under; so that their defence will be to no purpose: Moreover, the Enemy
having raised his Batteries within distance,<note place="margin">The opinion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Flankes with Musquets dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by argument and reason.</note> hee will soone beate those Musketiers
from off the Shoulders of the Bulworke, causing them to retreat; they having then
but the space, which is rescued by the Flanke, being but 6. or 7. Toises, which is but
distance enough for 12. or 14. Souldiers; how doe you thinke then, they shall bee
able to resist 300. which shall be upon the Counter-scarp, and under it? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
I demand, if he will not have the Flankes defended with Ordnance, how will
he be able to impeach and hinder the Enemie from making their Traverses or Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
over the Mote,<note place="margin">View the Figure where the manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Bulworkes. Now if you will please to observe the excellencie of the Canon for
the defending and offending which in a most absolute way is performed; namely,
if the Enemy makes his approaches close to the Mote as before is sayd, yet he durst
not enter the Mote, because of the shot that shall come continually from the Flankes;
wherefore to prevent the danger of the shot, they are constrained to take the earth
that is taken out of the Trenches, to make a sufficient Barricado against such places as
they shall shoot from; so that the force of a Canon shall doe small hurt, and shall not
be able,<note place="margin">A reason produc'd why the Musquet is not of validity to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Workes from the Flankes.</note> without great trouble, to hinder their approaches, they being secured by
their Workes. Much lesse then can the Musket-shot prevaile to hinder them, so that
they will soone gaine the Bulworke, after the Gallery is put over the Mote; because
they may have a recourse securely from Gun-shot, and by this meanes undermine the
Bulworke or scale it, as the Figure before named will demonstrate.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Enemy may make Galleries over of Timber, covering it over
with earth, to prevent the firing of it with Wild-fire, which they within the Fort
may cast upon it for that purpose. Likewise, the Mote being full of water, they may
prepare Bridges of Boates, covered over with earth or raw Hides, to preserve them
from fire:<note place="margin">The Musquet is not able to beate downe the Enemies Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: wherefore they must have Canon shot planted on the Flankes.</note> I would gladly know, how these proceedings of an Enemy might bee
prevented without the Canon, onely by Muskets, as the French Engineere would
have it?</p>
                        <p>Moreover they doe reply, that although they would have the Musketiers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
from the Flankes, yet not at all times would they bee destitute of the Canon:
which may serve for such purposes as to hinder the Enemies designes. I say all good
Orders and Rule so ought to be necessarily observed; contrarily, Disorder and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
ought to be echewed, as the greatest discommodity. The French replyes, yes,
he intends good order should be kept and observed, that every one may know what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18615:52"/>
he ought to doe: and that they should put all their strength and industrie to
to acquit themselves from the Enemy. To which we may truly object, that the
Flankes being the eyes of the Fortresse, they ought not to bee imployed about any
other thing, but to spend the time in hindering and offending the Enemy, from make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Galleries or Traverses: Now the Musketiers are not able to performe that
duty, but altogether hinders the operation of the Canons; for if the Canons comes
to be discharged, they must hinder the Muskets from defending the face of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
for they being two different things that cannot stand together, one of the
two must be slighted as insufficient; wherefore we must conclude, that Muskets are
not proper to be plac'd in the Flankes, because they are not of force to beate downe
the Traverses, and hinder the Enemies approaches unto the Bulworke. The Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeres
in France,<note place="margin">The fond opinion of the French Engineers.</note> can hardly be brought to beleeve this; but that the Canon is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unprofitable, and and that the Musketiers are all in all; to this we may answer
without contradiction, that in all things due order is to be observed, as <hi>Errard</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
confesses: Wherefore take notice, the Office of the Flankes is onely to pierce
and batter the Traverses, and Crosle-workes, which the Enemy shall raise upon the
Counter-skarpe, and that the Muskets ought to bee plac'd in another place, more
apt for them to doe the same Office, which he would have them performe in
the Flankes. Now I dare say their eares glowes to heare what place is aptest to
place the Musketiers in, to performe the same Office they would have them doe in
the Flankes, (which is onely to defend the face of the Bulworke) they being ignorant
of any other place from whence they may defend.<note place="margin">The defence of the Bulworke is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the third part of the Curtin.</note> Now you shall both see and judge
their imbecility, whether it be more apter and convenient to take the defence with
Musketiers from the Flanke, or from the Curtin, which is farre better, and also
from the Cavalliaris; whereby the defence is made threefold: Let us but weigh the
discommodity we have, with the commodity we ought to receive, and then make
choise of one of the two, which seemes probablest for our best service. Wherefore
it is not to be doubted, but that a Bulworke well guarded with Souldiers, is farre
stronger than one that is onely defended with a stone or earthen Wall without men.
The strength that is to be expected in a stone or earthen Wall, is the forming of the
Workes more obtuse, and so consequently the stone Wall is strongest: and yet there
is no comparison or proportion in it, to a Worke that is defended with men. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as before we have related, that a spacious obtuse Bulworke is compared to a
strong man without Armes, for his Armes are his defence, that is, the Souldiers
which continually shoote from either side of the Bulworke. Wherefore wee may
safely conclude, with that Maxim which the Hollanders and Venetians hold to be most
proper &amp; profitable; to take the defence from the third part of the Curtin: If you please
to observe in the first figure of Fortification the commodiousnesse of it,<note place="margin">It is most safe to take the defence from the third part of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</note> that then I
make no question, you will consent with my opinion, and conclude I have made
those former Propositions cleere. Now it follows I should answer another Objection
of <hi>Errards,</hi> and withall, give some good instructions about the length of the Line of
Defence. <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The distance from the corner of the Flanke, to the point of the next
Bulworke opposite. He maintaines, it ought not be above 100. or 120. paces, for if
it be longer, he sayes it is out of Musket-shot; All good Rules are to be grounded
upon firme reasons and sound grounds, wherefore we will discourse and illustrate
this proposition, that thereby we may gaine experience and profit. Because a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
cannot possible convey a Bullet so farre as a Canon, therefore the Line of Defence
should be answerable to their shooting, or conveying their shot; by this we intend
that the Musketiers which are ordained for the defence of the Bulworke, should
have their distances 100. or 120. paces, being plac'd upon the third part of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;
and those that are plac'd below upon the Worke in the Mote before the Cunette,
which is to be esteemed one of the principall defences; and likewise the Canon may
have for his Line of Defence from the Flanke and Cavalliares to the point of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
180. or 200. paces at the most; whereby the Enemies Galleries and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
may be hindered and broken downe. Suppose this to be the advantage and
commodity we gaine by this large distance in hindring the Enemy from having a
distance, which otherwise he will take by reason of the breadth of the Mote, from
battering downe the Flankes, for he is able to batter 182. or 200. paces; yet in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18615:52"/>
regard the Mote is so large, and the Workes hee is constrayned to make before his
Battery for to preserve it, causeth the Battery to stand at the least 260 paces from
the Flanke: Now I would gladly know what hurt a Battery can effect, shooting
such a distance against a strong Bulworke well Shouldered, and if hee bring his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neerer; into what eminent danger hee brings himselfe you may plainely perceive
by this Figure following, which being viewed, wee will proceed and answere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his objections.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>You see wee have fairely gotten the day of the French Enginiere, both by grounds
of solid reasons, and by our demonstrative Figure, which cleare all his objections:
Now it remaines to have another Veny with him about the Mote or Ditch, which
they would have full of Water to the brimme; because saith hee, it is very difficult
for the Enemy to get over to scale the Workes: Wherefore hee demands, whether
a dry Ditch or Mote bee better then that: To which I make answere, that betwixt
two extreames wee ought alwaies search out the middle proportion <hi>(viz.)</hi> not to
decline too much to the one, nor the other; but to keepe the Golden meane, and
part them in the middest equally: Therefore wee will not condemne a full Mote of
Water altogether, neither will wee condemne a quite drie Mote; but wee will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of both, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that one halfe of the Mote or Ditch should have Water, the
other halfe should bee without; so by consequence, it should be halfe full, one should
serve to prevent Surprises, the other should bee the defence thereof: Experience
teacheth, that such a Mote is the best and perfectest of all; for the Mote which is
brimme full, is a hinderance to them in the Fort, and keepes them as if they were in
a Prison, and disables them from defending the Ditch but onely from above the Wals,
which is but a poore defence,<note place="margin">Reasons why the Mote ought not be brimfull.</note> in regard the first thing an Enemy practiseth at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
is to batter against the toppe of the Walles, and beate the Defendants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
so that there remaines no defence for the Ditch,<note place="margin">The Worke in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the Mote is of great defence and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the precedent Figure.</note> but from the Flankes: Now
on the contrary, those that have their Motes halfe dry, they can Intrench themselves
therein, and keepe off the Enemy without any danger to themselves; without the
which the Enemy would soone finde great advantage by annoying the toppes of
the Walles from their Batteries; so as you should not bee able to shoot over without
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18615:53"/>
great losse of men:<note place="margin">The first thing to bee done in an Assault, is to batter the tops of the Walls.</note> and if the Enemy should give an Assault, he must first be constrained
to winne this Worke made within the Mote by great difficultie: The Defendants
are secured from the Flanckes, and from the Workes above them; they having a
good Parapet before them for their Cover, and halfe the breadth of the Mote for
their securitie;<note place="margin">Note this Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Mote must not be made so low, that the Counterscarpe may command it; for then it will bee of no force.</note> and likewise upon all occasions to retreate into the Bulworkes by the
Sally-Ports that are plac't in the Flanckes: And in regard this kinde of defence lyes
so low that the Enemy cannot see it, whereby it the harder to bee gained by him;
by these circumstances wee conclude, that a Mote or Ditch made in this kinde, is
the most safest and most defensive against the Enemy. I hope this discourse will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
any Souldier of reasonable capacity: In the next Chapter wee will frame our
discourse about the manner and proceedings that ought to bee observed in Assaulting
and defending these Fortresses.</p>

to gaine it, (which are to bee supposed these following,) First,
the ground being proper and easie to make the Trenches in; or
if the defence bee not strong and good upon that fide, whereby
any advantage may bee gained; then you must begin to raise
your Trenches as you may perceive in the Figure following by
<hi>N. N.</hi> drawing them right to the point of the Bulworke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those that defend within may not annoy the Pioners; and they are to cast the
earth alwaies towards the Enemies Workes, the better to secure their owne bodies:
as you may perceive by the Trench <hi>O.</hi> and <hi>G.</hi> they being drawne crooked like a
Serpent; and so directing them until they come close to the Counterscarp of the Mote
at the point of the Enemies Bulworkes,<note place="margin">When to mount the Canons for Battery.</note> where being arrived, the Enemy will bee
glad to quit the two halfe Moones that are without the Mote, whereby the Worke
is halfe wonne: for now you may safely mount your Canons, and make your Battery
<hi>K. K.</hi> which shall shoot against the Flankes at the bottome of the Ditch: The rest of
the Canons at the point of the Bulworke <hi>E.</hi> (at the same instant the Enemy that is
under the Counter-scarpe) shall pierce the sayd Counter-scarpe, and enter the Mote,
and there make a Gallery over at <hi>F. F.</hi> not forgetting to cast up the earth for your

small hurt, from their Flankes to your Galleries: The Motes having water in them,
you must frame your Galleries over them of strong Timber, and so make your assault
over them by the point of the Bulworke <hi>C.</hi> and by the Breach <hi>E.</hi> Now for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this assault,<note place="margin">How to prevent an Assault.</note> the Enemy within the Fort prepares to Reintrench himselfe, as you
may see by the Reintrenchment <hi>D.</hi> by the which they are able to defend the Breach:
they must have alwaies in readinesse earth Wood and Timber, and all such things as
are necessary for Coverture, and are proper to resist the Enemies Batteries: but the
Reintrenchment is not to bee feared, because they within the Fort will bee easily
constrained to quit it; as they were first made to leave the point of the Bulworke.
Their next refuge is immediately to begin a new Intrenchment within the other, as
you may perceive at <hi>S. S.</hi> to the end the other being lost, they may Retreate into
this; and there they ought to plant their Canons to defend the Breach.</p>
                        <p>And now it is high time to intreate of Conditions for the rendering up the Fort,
this being the last intrenchment they can possibly make; and it shall bee honour suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
unto them that they have held it out to the last: But if the Defendants expect
any Troopes that are suddenly to come to their ayd; or that the Workes bee so great
that they may raise the third Reintrenchment, then let them hold it out still: But if
the place bee so small that they cannot Reintrench, they must give place to Fortune.
Thus by these demonstrations, you see it is possible to enter any Fort that is accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18615:53"/>
wherefore to delay time,<note place="margin">Werefore Out-works were devised.</note> and to waste Men and Treasure of the Enemies, wee
must use meanes to prevent an Enemy from making his approaches neere the Ditch
and Workes: Therefore Out-works are devised, as Horne-works, Skonses, Halfe-Moones,
Redouts, Lines, Crosse-Lines and the like, which are to bee raised in the
convenienst places beyond the Mote, for defence of the Portes, Mote, and Wall;
whereby the Enemies appreaches shall bee hindered: not forgetting if their bee any
way by Water to relieve the Towne, that then you raise such able Skonses, that may
beate off the Enemy from hindering the passage;<note place="margin">Passages by water carefully to be forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> as was at the famous Siege of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-up-Zone:</hi>
there were two Skonses which secured the Haven, so that upon all
occasions reliefe did enter: For had Marquesse <hi>Spinolla</hi> gained those Skonses, the
Towne had beene famisht: There are onely three wayes whereby Fortified Townes
may bee gained; The first is by Stratagem, as <hi>Breda, Skinkins Skense</hi> were unawares
assaulted and taken: The second is by Intrenchments and Batteries to prepare a
Breach, and so to make the assault, as in this following Figure I have demonstrated:
The third is onely by Intrenching an Army about a Fort, whereby all passages are
Baricadoed up; so that reliefe cannot possibly come to enter the Towne, so that by
meere hunger they are constrained to yeeld upon such conditions as they may: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the defending of Workes or Breaches, there must bee a speciall care had, that
all Warlike instruments bee in a readinesse for to beate off the Enemy,<note place="margin">All warlike instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to bee in a readinesse to repel the Enemy from the Breach.</note> as Granad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to throw amongst them Wilde-fire, Pitcht-Ropes, Hoopes, Frames of Muskets,
Flayles, Stones, Peeces of Timber to role downe, and the like: The Fire-balls
will doe much good when the Enemy is wrought under the Walls, so as the Shot

if you see you shall bee forcd to leave the point of the Bulworke, or any Worke else
whatsoever: Then privily to make some Mine well planted with Powder, the
Traine being drawne into your Reintrenchment or Retreating place; that so soone
as the Enemy is entered: Fire may bee given and blow them up: Further, observe
when a Breach is made,<note place="margin">By the ceasing of the Canon, you may know when the Enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to enter the Breach.</note> you may know when it is high time to make resistance, by the
Enemies leaving giving Fire to the Canons; for when hee assaults, hee cannot shoot
towards the Breach for destroying his owne Men, but bends his Ordnance against
the Flankes and Bulworkes on either side of the Breaches to hinder them from shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
whereby their assault may bee safer and easier. <hi>View the Figure following in the

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ee that will Be-Leager a Towne or Fortresse, ought to
have three things in his consideration:<note place="margin">Divers considerations for a Generall, before he enterprizes any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</note> First, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can derive any right or true Title to it; Secondly,
whether hee be of Power sufficient to manage the Siege
<hi>(viz)</hi> all kinde of Provision, as Meate, Drinke, Money,
Souldiers; all kinde of Amunition, Ordnance, Peeces,
Armes, Powder, Bullets, Match; all Warlike Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Granadoes, Morter-Peeces; all kinde of Wilde-Fire,
and the like: Thirdly, hee must consider whether
the profit hee shall gaine by it, will countervaile the
charge that must bee spent in the Siege: Having thus well considered of all these
precedent things; then hee must get a true discription of the frame and fashion of
the Fortresse, with the Wayes and Paths; the condition of the grounds about it, and
the number of Defendants in it: Then sharpening his valour upon the Grindstone
of Resolution, let him leade his Army in good order against this Fortresse, where
hee must bee carefull to quarter his Men in the best and aptest places of security; then
having Invironed the Fort on all sides with Skonses and Redoubts, so that there can
bee no Recourse too nor from the Fort; then hee must Fortifie against the face of
the Canon, to the end it may serve for an advantage as you may see by the Bulworke
marked <hi>G.</hi> The other part of his Army are to bee plac't to keepe the passages, least
the Enemy should come in the Reare of them and beat them out of their Trenches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore strong Workes must bee raised well Pallizadoed to prevent them; Next
he must looke that his quarters bee well Intrencht with Crosse-Workes, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Forts and Redouts raised for that purpose, as you may see the Trenches
<hi>C.</hi> are defended from the places <hi>R.</hi> and from the Redouts <hi>P.</hi> Hee ought likewise
to make choice of a fit place for the Army to make it his Field for Battell, as you may
see by <hi>R. S. T.</hi> Next you must raise good and sufficient Batteries as neere to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
as possible may be; which must bee secured and faithfully Guarded by a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
number of Souldiers, as the Battery <hi>A.</hi> is well Retrencht with the Bastions
<hi>R.</hi> and beset with good Gabions filled with good earth, having a great care their bee
no Stones in it; least the Canon shot from the Fort should beate them about, and do
more harme to the Souldiers, then the Bullets themselves: They ought also to doe
the same on all sides, as wee see by the Cavaliers <hi>A. D. E. Q.</hi> the which must bee
raised at the same instant, begining to make the Canons Play, to batter the tops of the
Works in the Fort, with all fury without intermission; to the end the Pioners may
have time to make their Trenches and approaches in greater safety and more strongly:
for the Canons beating against the top of the Workes of the Fort with such fury that
the Defendants have no leisure to discover the designe of the Assaylants, and much
lesse shall they know how to use meanes to prevent those blowes and batterings;
besides the great feares and terrours that the poore Souldiers will bee in all the while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Wherefore there must bee great diligence used, for feare they should lose that good
and favourable time, wherein they may make their Intrenchments without danger:
Those within the Fort in this case,<note place="margin">How those should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves in the Fort against the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants.</note> ought to have very experienst Souldiers and good
Canoniers; and likewise all the Platformes for the Artillery or Cavaliaries should use
their best endeavours by continuall shooting to prevent the raising of the Enemies
Batteries and Trenches, and not to feare any colours, being they are protected with
a good Parapet from the dinte of the Shot: Likewise oftentimes they ought to
change the places of the Musquetiers,<note place="margin">How the Musqueteers ought to be demeaned at the Enemies first approaches.</note> those which were upon the Curtins, shall bee
plac't upon the face of the Bulworke, and so to the Shoulders of it; continually thus
changing the Musquetiers from place to place, as occasion shall bee offered: this will
much annoy the Enemy, and the rather, because they know not how to bend their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18615:55"/>
Peeces against them; because of the uncertainty of their places. Moreover the
Enemy having battered those places that hindered him most, cannot helpe it, but
he must suffer your Souldiers to set every man his Basket, being set close together
that they may put their Musquets betweene them, and shoot continually for all the
blowes of the Canons; whose shottes are made very uncertaine: above all things
we must have an eye, that the Musquetier discharges not by Vollyes, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
so that some may be alwayes giving fire, whilest their fellow-Souldiers
charge. And likewise, to take good ayme from betweene the Baskets; which
ought to be plac'd upon every Worke neere the Enemy; after the manner deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered
in this Figure following.</p>

these Baskets, and Wheele-barrowes in the Fort, to be used upon all occasions.</p>
                        <p>If these should be wanting, they must have Sackes filled with good earth, place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them accordingly to shoot through. The Enemy seeing such prepared resistance
within the Fort, will begin his Trenches the profoundlier, to the end his Souldiers
may be preserved; for it is the duty of a good Captaine, to have a speciall regard to
the safety of his Souldiers: For that is a practicall policy used alwayes by the Prince
of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> whereby they conceived he would not cause his men to run head-long
to destruction, which made them the more forward in Service, and the valianter to
execute what they were commanded by him; this ought to be a thing remarkable,
for otherwise a world of Souldiers are lost, and the Captaines are discomfited, for
not gaining an impossible victory.</p>
                        <p>The Enemy is to conduct his Trenches to the Counter-skarpe,<note place="margin">How the Enemy ought to draw his Trenches.</note> and make them so
deepe, that the Defendants within the Fort cannot possibly hurt them; they being
brought alwayes towards the point of the Bulworke, as you may perceive by the
Trench <hi>C, C,</hi> because they should not be so much molested by the Ordnance and
the Musquets from the Workes of the Fort: and when the Enemy hath gained the
Counter-skarpe, they shall make their Crosse-workes as you may see by the distance
<hi>X, X,</hi> where they shall lodge a good number of Canons; raising their Batteries or
Cavalliaries more spacious, although they serve for little or no purpose, onely to
batter against the Flankes, and make them unprofitable; during which time you ought
to follow the speedy making of your Trenches, and bring them to their halfe Moones,
and then by the assistance of your Pioners, they raising a sufficient able high Traverse,
to shelter them from the force of the Cavalliaries and Bulworkes within the Fort,
which otherwise would command them, and is most easie to be effected, especially
if the More or Ditch be not spacious; and at the same instant your Souldiers are to
make their assault, be it by Scaling-ladder or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>The Generall must cause divers Peeces to be brought, which shall be to discharge
upon all parts of the Wall, to hinder their annoying of the Assaylants; who must
enter the Breach with a brave resolution. The roring of the Canons having so asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those within the Halfe-Moone, and battered their Parapets, that they have no
time to see if the Battery be finisht or not, and they being not provided for the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
it will wonderfully puzzle them, the assault being followed with good order
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18615:55"/>
and resolution; this being the time and place, where men ought to purchase honour:
and these Assaults will discover, which are the valiantest spirits. The Officers at the
Siedge of <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> shewing their resolutions to their Souldiers, threw their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
into a Halfe-Moone, from which they had beene repulsed three or foure times,
by the Musketiers and Pikes within the said Worke, whereupon they ranne furiously
to redeeme their honours upon the Pikes and Muskets, rather chusing to dye with
honour, than to lose their Colours with disgrace: this On-set did so revive the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
they seeing the Noble resolution of their Leaders, at one instant assaulted the
Worke, and discomfited the Enemy, so as they gave way to their magnanimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions.</p>
                        <p>Having gained this Halfe-moone <hi>Y Y,</hi> the Defendants for their safety retreate
into the Ditch,<note place="margin">What the Defendants ought to doe, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having gained the halfe Moone.</note> behinde the Parapet of the Worke called the Cunette, with short
Cudgels and Flayles prepared for that purpose, to defend the entring of the Enemy
into the Ditch; which will be a hard worke for them to enter and obtaine it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

intrenching, and cast the Earth towards the side of the Flankes, making the Traverse
<hi>M;</hi> during which time, the Battery must shoot furiously on all sides, then those which
are upon the Counter-skarpe, must be provided with good store of Granadoes, which
they must cast over into the workes called the Cunette, to the end they may cause
them to quit the Worke; then the Traverse being made <hi>M, M,</hi> they shall have the
better freedome, to transport a great number of Souldiers over the Mote to make
their Assaults: and being arrived at the foot of the Bulworke, they may presently
undermine it, if it happens that the Breach bee not sufficient for them to get
over.</p>
                        <p>Now the Defendants within the Port, have for their refuge the Bulworke, to
re-intrench in, as you may perceive at <hi>V;</hi> causing a sufficient Parapet to be made for
the coverture of those that defend the re-intrenchment: Having alwayes a sufficient
company of Souldiers, with all kinde of warlike instruments, ready and in good
order for to releeve them, the Enemy being so neere them wrought, that they are
like to be surprized and beaten backe; the best defence they can then have, will bee
the Granadoes and Artificiall Fire-workes, which they must cast over into the Ditch
or False-Bray, for to annoy them that are undermining the Bulworkes.</p>
                        <p>But the Enemy standing upon his honour,<note place="margin">How to prevent the breaking of Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.</note> seeks all wayes to prevent the breake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Granadoes, and burning of the Fire-workes, by choking them with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or raw Hides, so as they fall to the ground, so that they worke small effect.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, the Defendants place great peeces of Timber upon the Walles, to
role downe upon the Assailants as they are climbing the Bulworkes: But when
the Defendants have used all their indeavours to no purpose, and the Enemy being
got into the Worke, then it is time to intreat and provide for a Composition: yet
for all they are reduc'd to these extremities, they ought to make choise of such incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
as are least hurtfull to them.<note place="margin">How the Defendants ought to make their Composition with the Enemy.</note> The Composition is to be made, according
to the Forces they have, and the hopes they have to releeve it, and according as they
are able to sustaine themselves, if they should put it to the last brunt. It is no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for a Captaine to intreat with his Enemy, in two respects; the first is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their Armes, and Baggage: the second is, the Pillage which may bee
made within the Fort; the which may possibly be regained againe by some strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,

Now having the Fortresse surrendred upon composition, the Generall must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whether he be able to maintaine it, and whether the profit of it will be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the charge; which if it be, he must rase downe all the out-Trenches which
the Enemy made, and repaire the Breaches of it: and then to draw his Army into
convenient Garrisons, that they may be fit for the next imployment of the Prince.
Thus taking Reason and Experience for his guide, in all his enterprises, which must
be just and equitable; will cause the Honour and glory of a Generall to shine.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou must observe in these Precedent Figures (both of the
Forts and Batteries which were raised by <hi>Spinola</hi> at the
Siege of Breda) Those sides of them which looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Towne, were made Canon-proofe <hi>(viz.)</hi>
25 foot thicke.</p>
                        <p>The first of the three Batteries was 160 foot long,
and 125 foot broad; in the Reare and Flankes of it, it
had a Wall 15 foot thicke, saving that one side of this
Wall was thicker then the rest, rising with a walke and
a Parrapet on the inside: in the Front it was lined with
two exteriour Angles, the face of it rising with Nine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Windowes, for so many Peeces of Ordnance to play out at; each Window was
2 foot 1/2 wide, opening wider outwards by degrees: On the inside a Groundselling
was raised like a bed of Turffe and Faggots, 8 foot in heigth, and 35 foot broad, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with Plankes, for the speedy removing and recoyling of the Artillery:
Behinde this Groundsell, was a place of Armes 130 foot long, and 50 foot broad.
The outside of the Wall under the Canon Windowes, was Pallizadoed with sharpe
long Stakes.</p>
                        <p>Before the Battery there is a halfe-Moone raised, wherein was a Guard of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettiers,
and compassed with a Counterscarpe and Pallizado, these were for the
safety of the Battery: Round about the Battery a Ditch was suncke seven foot deepe,
and 48 foot broad; the sides of the Ditch were cut sloping from the top to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
so that in the bottome it was but 38 foot broad; Vpon the outmost shore of
the Ditch, was plac't a long Pallizado to hinder all sudden assaults, <hi>View the Figure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second and third Battery had their dementions much after the former, onely
the least being the second Batery had a Fort about it for its defence, by the Figures you
may perceive the difference both in their length, bredth, and corners: The foregoing
Forts which <hi>Spinola</hi> raised against Breda, I have drawne the Figures of them, which
if you please to view, you may observe that the Walls of them were 28 foot thicke
at the bottome, and so were raised 15 foot high with a Parrapet upon the toppe of
the Wall for the safegard of the shot, 6 foot high the Parrapet; the Wall was made
sloping and Pallizadoed round; the Ditch about these Forts were 22 foot broad, 10
foot deepe, and 12 foot wide in the bottome, <hi>View the Figures.</hi>

of a Fort; Collected from the famous Siege of Breda, Anno 1624.
With the Description of the chiefest Trenches, Forts, Redouts,
and Batteries, which were raised by Marquesse
Spinola, against it.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou having taken a view of the precedent Figure of a Fort
beleaguered, being surrounded with Trenches, Redouts,
Forts, and Batteries; for your better understanding the
manner and way how an Army should be brought and
pitcht in convenient Quarters, and how the Trenches and
Redouts, Forts, and Batteries, are to be plac'd in places
convenient: I have taken some paines to bring to your
view the orderly way which that famous Generall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
<hi>Spinola</hi> observed, at the remarkeable Seige of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da:
It being the Queene of Garrisons in the Netherlands,
beautified and strengthened with the absolutest Fortifications that eyther Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
could afford: So that it was conceived to be impregnable.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore in the first place, take notice how <hi>Spinola</hi> divided his Army (which
consisted of 198. Foot Companies, and 32. Troopes of Horse) into three parts;
purposely to distract the Hollander: to which end they tooke their marches seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to other places, then that which was intended; but at last they met, and joyned
together at a Dorpe neere Breda.</p>
                        <p>The Towne of Breda fearing their designe, did immediately strengthen their
Garrison, with 45. foot-Companies, and onely two Troopes of Horse: these For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Towne were quartered in the Out-workes, and Walles, where they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
immediately to be raised divers Horne-workes and other Fortifications beyond
them, as the precedent Figure of the Horne-worke will demonstrate: the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Towne past into these Out-workes through Sally-Ports, made under the
Wall of the Towne.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spinola</hi> having encamped his Army two Leagues from <hi>Breda,</hi> he rested certaine
dayes not doing any thing; which made the Hollander thinke they had some other
designe: But having weighed all difficulties in his Ballance of reason, upon the 26.
of August about twi-light, he sent <hi>Medina</hi> with 10. Troopes of Horse, and 4000.
Foot, to pitch downe upon one side of the Towne of Breda.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ballion</hi> had order the same time, to march with his owne Regiment, and 14.
other Companies of Foot, and a certaine number of Horse, with divers Canons;
and these were to pitch downe in another Quarter, neere the Towne, just oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the former Troopes, and there they raised divers Workes, and intrench'd
themselves.</p>
                        <p>The next Morning, by breake of day, <hi>Spinola</hi> arrived with the rest of the Forces,
and intrencht them upon the other two sides of the Towne: Then from these foure
severall quarters, they began to draw a Trench of earth, from quarter to quarter,
in which they raised divers Redouts and Forts, about 400. paces one from the other,
which served for a prevention of all suddaine Sallyes out of the Towne; each Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
from his owne quarter wrought towards the next; and mann'd the Workes
with parties of Souldiers: The first, Trench was but 5 foot high, and 7. foot thicke
at the bottome, and three foot broad at the top; the Ditch was 6. foot deepe and 7. foot
broad at the top, and two foot at the bottome. This Trench was 3600. paces in circuit,
but in regard of the overflowing of the grounds in Winter, they quitted these first
Works, and were constrained to raise more solid Works further off from the Towne.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore they raised a second Trench neere ten foot high, and fifteene foot thick at
the bottome, and made somewhat sloping; there was two foot bankes for the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiets
to step upon, to give fire over the Brest-work, this Brest-work was raised above
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18615:68"/>
Foot-bankes, five foot high; ten foot thicke at bottome, and sixe at the top: This
second Trench contained in Circuit 16000. paces.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, beyond this second Trench from the Towne-wards, distance about
200. paces, they were constrained to raise a third Trench, with divers Forrs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douts,
and Batteries, as the precedent Figures will shew you; this Trench was of
the same demention that the former was; being made very solid and strong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their quarters from the Prince of Oranges his Forces, who did seeke to raise
their Siege, or to releeve the Towne; This last Trench fetcht a Circuit round
about the former Trench, it being 52000. paces in compasse.</p>
                        <p>Vpon the out-side of both these Trenches, a Ditch was sunke seven foot deepe,
15. foot broad at the top, and 8. foot at the bottome. The Souldiers of <hi>Breda</hi> sallyed
out upon <hi>Spinola's</hi> men, as they were raising the first Trench next the Towne; and
if they had falne upon them in severall places at once, they would by all probability
have beaten them from their quarters, they being very weary, and but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at the first: So that they were constrained both to fight and fortifie themselves,
the space of three houres: afterwards a greater resistance was made to beate them
backe.</p>
                        <p>The Redouts of Earth were made of a quadrant Figure, <note place="margin">The Description of the Redouts.</note> and were so plac'd in
the Trench, that no Angle or corner appeared outwards, they were 50, foot wide
in the inside, and on the out-side 80. and strongly fortified with a Pallizado of
sharpe sparres, placed in the outward edge of the Parrapet, they had a ditch about
them, and a Counter-skarpe beyond the Ditch, and upon the verges of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skarpe
another Pallizado of Spiles was plac'd, to hinder the Enemies approaches.</p>
                        <p>The Forts were raised with greene Turfe, <note place="margin">The Description of the Forts.</note> with foure irregular Bulworkes 35.
foot thicke, and 13. foot high; their Curtins 100. foot long, as the Figures of them
will shew you: These were of the strongest sort which were plac'd neere the Town,
their Ditches were 12. foot wide, <note place="margin">The Description of the rest of the Forts and Redouts.</note> and 8. foot deepe, these were to indure the batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Canon from the Towne. The other Forts and Redouts, were raised 13.
foot high from the ground, and 15. foot thicke, the Ditches 12. foot broad, and 8.
foot deepe, the inside of these Forts and Redouts were but 8. foot high, and raised
perpendicular; at which height, a walke was made five foot high and broad: and
upon this was a Parrapet round the Workes five foot high, and ten foot thicke, this
was to shelter the Musquetiers from the shot of the Towne.</p>
                        <p>These Workes had a kinde of Planke to lay over the Ditch, for the Souldiers to
goe over into the Workes; and being these Bridges were drawne up with Pullies
and fastned with iron haspes to the Posts of the Gate they both served for Bridge and
Gate; And before these Workes, upon the out-side of the Ditch was a halfe-Moone
raised well pallizadoed, to defend the entrance into the Forts.</p>
                        <p>These mighty vast Trenches, with the Forts, and Redoubts, were (by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Souldiers which wrought both night and day, they being continually
releeved with fresh-men) finisht in 17. dayes. You shall finde amongst the precedent
Figures divers great Forts, one of them was formed in a forme quadrant, with
foure halfe Bulworkes, made very sollid for Artillery to be planted upon; it was Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
proofe. The Curtins were 120. foot long, 28. foot thicke, and 15. foot high,
pallizadoed round, to hinder the Enemies assaults. Likewise, you shall finde the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of 4. Forts more proportionable in strength to the first; these had a Trench
raised, which ranne from one to another, very strong and solid, as before is shewed:
these Workes differed in forme, but were of one and the same demention; these
were plac'd upon an eminent passage, upon a little heath; by which the Prince of
Orange might possibly have conveyed provision to the waters side, by which meanes
the Towne might have beene releeved.</p>
                        <p>There were two Batteries raised at the entrance of each quarter, with halfe
Moones before the entrance upon the out side, and divers Forts besides, according
to the different scituation and danger of the place: the Figures of these Batteries
I have likewise drawne for your better information.</p>
                        <p>There were three great Batteries raised, in three severall places neare the Towne,
which battered against the Flankes of the Bulworkes of the Towne, and those sides
both of the Batteries, Forts, and Redouts, which beheld the Towne, were made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
proofe, 25. foot thicke.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:18615:69"/>
The greatest of these Batteries was 160. foot long, and 125. foot broad, in the
Reare and Flanke of it, it had a Wall fifteene foot thicke, it was made rising with a
Walke, and a Parrapet on the inside; in the Front it was lined with two exteriour
Angles, the face of it rising with nine open Windowes, for so many Peeces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
to shoot out at, each Window being a foot and a halfe wide, opening more
and more out wards by little and little. On the inside, a Groundfell was raised, like a
bed of Turfe and Fagots, eight foot high, and 35. foot broad, covered over with
Plankes, for the speedy removing and recoyling of the Artillery.</p>
                        <p>Behinde this Groundfell, was a place of Armes 130. foot long, and 50. foot
broad, the out-side of the Wall under the Canon-windowes, were pallizadoed; and
before the Battery was two halfe Moones, guarded with Musquetiers, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with a Ditch and Counterskarpe, and a Pallizado of Spiles upon the Counterskarp,
for the safety of the Battery, the Ditch was 7. foot deepe, and 48. foot broad, at the
bottome but 38.</p>
                        <p>The two other Batteries were raised indifferent large, the manner of framing
them, was much after the former; saving that the least of the two became the largest,
by the Addition of a Fort: the Figures will better informe you, in the difference
both of length, breadth, and Angles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spinola</hi> raised upon all Passages, very strong Forts; and upon the Causies (where
there was no passage on neither side of it) he caused very strong Pallizadoes of yong
Stadles droven into the earth, and framed together 15. foot high. Likewise, crosse
the waters that drowned the Medowes, he made a double Pallizado, to prevent the
Boates from going to the Towne.</p>
                        <p>Also, he blockt up the Rivers with a strong Bridge, and a guard of Musquetiers
upon it, with sharpe peeces of timber lying pointing out of split their Boates. Also,
he had Boates lay at Anchor in the River, to hinder the passage; besides, divers
Boates bored through at the bottome, which were to be sunke upon the sudden; and
divers other Boates of Combustible stuffe, to burne the Enemies Fleet. Also, within
the River, at foure severall places a good distance one from another, there were
strong Spiles of timber droven downe, and coupled together with Crosse-beames, in
manner of Pallizadoes, which made the River unpassable.</p>
                        <p>The Townes-men raised five great Horne-workes, to secure their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarpe
and Mote, before every Port of the Towne one, and the rest in other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
places; the Levell-side of these Horne-workes, were 210. foot long, and
150. foot broad. I have presented to your view, the Figure of the largest Horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
which was raised before the Castle, it is 240. paces long, and 200. paces
broad, it was pallizadoed thicke round about, to hinder the Enemies assault; beyond
this Horne-worke is a Halfe-moone, fortified with a Counterscarpe a cubit high, and
invironed with another Ditch, as the Figure thereof will better informe you: these
Out-workes, were flanquered from the Towne walles; there was a Trench drawne
from one Worke to another, to beate off the Enemy from the Counterscarpe.</p>
                        <p>The ordinary Carrison of this Towne, which consisted but of 15. Bulworkes,
were 1600. Foot, and five troopes of Horse; but the brute of this Siege caused
them to be re-inforced with 28. Companies more; besides there were 1800. able
Townes-men, which were to manage the Walles.</p>
                        <p>The Governour sent away 3. troopes of his Horse, because they could affoord
them no service in the Siege.</p>
                        <p>The Provision layd in against winter for these Souldiers, was 8200. measures of
Wheate, of Oates 2800. 3600. weight of Cheese, and as much dryed Haberdine;
and every Townes-man was (besides) to furnish himselfe for a yeare.</p>
                        <p>And in regard <hi>Spinola</hi> could not have his Provision for his Army come by Water,
he was constrained to convey it by Land, it being 12. houres march; for the same
purpose, he had all his Provision brought to one of his owne Townes that lay neerest
to the Campe, named <hi>Lyre.</hi> But the Prince of Orange his Campe lying at <hi>Ros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ndall,</hi>
they were constrained to march about, and to fortifie divers Dorpes in the way for
the resting and securing of the Convoyes and Provisions.</p>
                        <p>Count <hi>Henry Van den Bergh,</hi> had the greatest part of the Horse, and as I take it,
4000. foot with him; besides, there was 1000. Horse more newly raised; with
these forces he was to conduct the Provision.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18615:69"/>
His manner of proceeding was this; In the morning before day, hee gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to put in order the disordered multitude of Carriages and Waggons;
then hee sent some Troopes of Horse before to discover: Hee commanded them to
March, he placed Artillery both in the Van, and in the Reare to give warning by
their discharging, of the Enemies approaches; so that his men might gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as he had given them order, for to repaire to the place which stood most in need.</p>
                        <p>Hee guarded both sides of the Way neere where the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Army lay
with loose Wings of Horse; and hee lined these Horse with Guards of Musquetiers,
and with the rest of the Horse he brought up the Reare.</p>
                        <p>Vpon occasion of feare hee made use of his Wagons instead of a Trench, drawing
his Foot-forces within them: Hee had daily and hourely Spies to know the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
intentions and proceedings; He cut downe all Bridges that might afford the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
a Passage to come at him in his March: By this meanes they sustained their
Campe in despight of the Hollander: And as <hi>Vanden Bergh</hi> was to make his Retreat,
hee fearing the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would have set upon his Troopes, hee ordered his
Forces accordingly, by dividing them into three grand Squadrons; and so Marched
ready to receive any charge.</p>
                        <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> then having Incampt his Army at <hi>Mede</hi> a Dorpe 2 houres
distant from <hi>Breda,</hi> thinking to have relieved the Towne; So soone as <hi>Spinola</hi>
understood it, he left all the Workes about the Towne well Manned, unto the charge
of <hi>Medina,</hi> and Marched himselfe with 7000 foot, and 30 Troopes of Horse to
a convenient place neere <hi>Osterhout,</hi> where hee Incamped within three miles of the
Enemy, where he confronted the enemy, and anticipated the place of great advantage
for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to have relieved the Towne by it.</p>
                        <p>After that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did perceive their was no hopes of relieving the
Towne; hee provided for his safe Retreate, to which end hee raised divers Workes
to hinder <hi>Spinola</hi> from pursuing him: As first upon a convenient passage hee raised
a Fort to Retire his men into, and to defend them from the sudden pursuite of the
Enemy; and upon the side next <hi>Spinolas</hi> Campe by which hee was to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate,
hee raised a Brest-worke along the Causie, with a deepe Ditch to cover his
men from the Enemies shot, and also to obscure them in their Retreate: <hi>Spinola</hi>
fearing the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> should have assaulted some of their Garrisons with his
Army, Hee commanded <hi>Grave Hendrick Vanden-Bergh</hi> to dog him with his Army
to prevent his designes.</p>
                        <p>This Siege having lasted part of Summer, all Winter, and part of the Summer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which was a thing thought impossible to have bin done being eleven Months:
The Governour of <hi>Breda</hi> founded a Parley, and was content to surrender the Towne
(they being almost famished) if <hi>Spinola</hi> would agree to such Articles as hee should
propound: For the performance of which Articles there were sufficient Hostages
from either side to confirme the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>I have set downe the Articles, they being a most fit patterne for all Governours
to shape their Agreements by, The Articles follow.</p>
                        <p>First a Captaine of the Garrison of <hi>Breda,</hi> brought <hi>Spinola</hi> two Copies of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
betwixt them, that hee might first signe them both; which done hee carried
them backe to the Governour for him to signe, one part of them was brought backe
to <hi>Spinola:</hi> Vpon the signing of these Covenants, the Governour demanded 1200
Waggons, and 60 Boats, to carry away sicke and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving finished the former discourse of Fortification;
we are now to proceed, and take a Survey, how both
in Ancient and Moderne times, Artillery hath been used;
and so collect from the best Writers, such observations
as shall be most pertinent for our discourse; and adde
such things to this Worke, which others have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in, and so wee will indeavour to make it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
And as there is great variation in Authours opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
so the Reader may make as various constructions
in his contemplating on them. Therefore, I shall inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to reconcile their opinions, and reduce all things materiall to a perfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, first we must begin with such instructions, as ought to be inherent
to the Master of the Ordnance; and in this discourse, for brevitie sake, wee shall
give a touch of all other inferiour Officers duties, and of what things particularly
are to be committed to their charges: And in regard it is an Office of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and diversity of things runne through his hands, and are by his wisedome, to
be rightly ordered: Therefore it behoves him to be a man of excellent performance,
both in Valour and Learning, and not daring to thrust himselfe into this great Office,
not being well qualified and fitted for it.<note place="margin">The parts a Master of the Ordnance is to be indued with.</note> He must be a geod Arethmetician, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,
Geometrician, and besides an expert old Souldier: for in this, if the
Practicke be not joyned with the Theoricke, and so both inseparable in this Officer,
there will be a deficiencie in the execution of this Office. The care and charge of
this place being so weighty, and impossible to be performed by one man, therefore
divers Substitutes and inferiour Officers, are allowed for his assistance, and the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
under him, is his Lieutenant; who must be a man most able, in his judgement
and carriage, to take a great part of this heavie weight off the Masters shoulders.
Wherefore, in what place of consequence the Master of the Ordnance is absent,
there the Lieutenant is to be present: if the Master bee in the Campe, then must the
Lieutenant be at the Battery, Breach, or Curtin; if the Master bee present in the
afore-named places, then ought the Lieutenant to be at the Store-house, the Mines,
or some other place of most necessary importance and imployments.</p>

                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:18615:73"/>
The residue of the Sub-Officers are these, Master Gunner, under Canonires, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-Master,
the Furrier, and divers Clerkes, besides Gun-makers, and Carriage-makers,
and others of meaner dependency. Great care is to be taken, that the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
performe their duties, in managing their places, both in mounting, dismount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
charging, levelling: and where he sees a defect, these superiour Officers being
expert and skilfull in this Art, may be able to instruct, correct, and controule the
ignorant, and see those escapes amended, in what sort soever committed; hee is to
make an Inventorie of every small and particular parcell that accompanies the Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Ordnance, and of them the service being performed, to give his accompt.</p>
                        <p>Against the Army march, it is requisite he make provision, that every Peece hath
his sufficient number of draught-Horses, and Oxen, apt to draw the same according

Likewise every Peece hath his Gunner, with his Co-adjutor or Mate, and a man to
serve them both, and helpe them charge, discharge, mount, wadde, cleanse, scoure,
and coole the Peeces being over-heated. Further, there must bee a Master of the
Timber or Wood, and a Smith; their duties must be to see the Garriages fit, or to
amend them.</p>
                        <p>Over the aforesaid Gunners, there is a Corporall or Constable chosen, to view

is to give speedy order to his Clerke to deliver both Powder, Match, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets;

Lines dividing the body of the Peece into foure equall divisions: then take a straight
rod, and put it into the mouth of the Peece holding it close to the side of the concave,
directly in it as the Lines directeth; one Line whereof lying directly upwards, the

product by 22. the quotient is the Diameter or height of the circumference; likewise
measure the circumference of the Mossel-ring; and multiply that measure by 7. divide

then substract the diameter last found, from the diameter of the breech ½. that remains
is the true disparture: Or for want of Callibres, take a cord and measure the greatest

Likewise measure the greatest circumference of mettall at the mouth, multiply that

this being divided by 22. the quotient is 42, the height of the mettall at the Breech;
likwise multiply 88 by 7 you have 616, divide this by 22, the quotient is 28, the height
of the mettall at the mouth; which 28. abated from 42. rests 14. the which 14.

of the Peece.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if you finde your Peece thicker of mettall in one part then another,
shee will convey her Bullet towards the thickest side; wherefore after with your

middle part of mettall at the Breech of your Peece, that disparture, and the middest

Fire being given the shot will hit right; but if the thickest part of the mettall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,

set downe by Gunners; that so oftentime the length of the Cillender or Concave of
the Peece is to the marke, and then knowing how much the Peece is thicker on
th' one side then the other; the one halfe of that overplus being multiplied by the
quotient first found, the product will shew how much the Peece shooteth wide of
the marke; (as for example) If a Governour findes a Canon to be thicker of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
by two Inches on the right side then on the left; she being 9. foot in length,
and the marke assigned to be shot unto is supposed to be 500. paces from the Peece:
To worke this, you must bring the 500. paces into feet, which makes 2500, feet,
the which being divided by 9. feete, being the length of the Concave: Cillinder
of the Canon, yeildeth in the quotient 277. feet 7/9. the which multiplied by 1/2. the
superfluity of the mettall being one Inch, makes 272. feet 7/9 still, and so much wide
the marke should the sayd Peece have shot at such a distance, although she had
beene layed full against the middest of the marke.</p>
                        <p>These observations I thought fit to gather and present to the view of the Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Valour, and experience.</p>
                        <p>So let this suffice for the Tertiating and measuring a Peece of Ordnance, which
otherwise the Gunner may be deceived in Charging it; and also it shall bee sufficient
for the disparting any Peece of Ordnance, otherwise their will be great errours in
making a true Shot: In the following Chapter wee will discourse of divers circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances

that measure by 7. then multiply that summe that commeth in the quotient by 3.

Moreover a Peece of Ordnance over hot with shooting, will not raunge so farre

                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE having travailed thus farre in observing what our
famous Gunners of this latter Age, have through their
industry and experience found out, to perfect and
beautifie this noble Art, which is now brought to a
most excellent perfection; I hold it most fit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of every particular branch in an orderly way;
and to performe this, I shall indeavour to picke and
cull out of the ablest Authors their best practicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
and so briefly and distinctly handle them,
that the ingenuous Commander may profit thereby.
And first, not forgetting how wee have formerly
shewed the nature and quality of all kinde of Ordnance,<note place="margin">Note, in spunging your peece, you are to stand on the right side, the spunge being drawne out, you must give it a knock on the out-side of the mouth of the peece to shake off the foulnesse.</note> their due due strength and
Fortitudes, with divers accidents that may hinder their true shooting; Now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
divers further Observations and Curiosities, which may not bee omitted
in lading or charging them Gunner-like: Wherefore having Powder, Bullets
and Match, with other implements in readinesse for Service, and before you
charge your Peece, you must cleere the Touch-hole, and spunge the Peece
well.</p>
                        <p>A Peece of Ordnance is eyther to be laded with Cartrages or with the Ladle,
Cartreges is the readiest way,<note place="margin">How to frame Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trages of Canvas or paper, which shall hold the due charge of powder for any kinde of peece if they bee made of paper, then the seames are to bee glewed, if cloth, then towed.</note> they are framed eyther of Canvas or paper royall:
For the making of these in a due proportion; that they may neyther hold more nor
lesse, but a due charge. You are to take the height of the Bore of the Peece with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the vent of the shot, then cut the cloth or paper of the breadth of three such
heights, and if it be for a Canon, the length must be three Diameters of the Bore,
for a Culverin 4 and for a Saker, Fawlcon, and other inferiour Peeces 4 ½. parts
of the height of their proper Bores: Note, you are to leave in the middest, top,
and bottome, one other such height, at each of these places to lye over, and make
a Cover and a bottome for the Cartreges;<note place="margin">Some use Formers of Wood, made the just height of the Bore, to winde the paper or cloth about to fashion it.</note> moreover, you are to augment or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
these Cartrages, according as your Powder is in strength or weaknesse, or
according as your Peece is hot.</p>
                        <p>If your Peece bee an ancient cast Peece Taper bored, the former of Wood
must be made accordingly, that the Cartreges may goe to the bottome; if Chamber-bored,
<note place="margin">The papers of the Cartrage must be oyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the canvasse must be tallowed over to defend them from wet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> the Cartrage must be layd in a thin instrument called a Chassela, which will
convey it into the Chamber, but if right bored your Rammers head put it close home,
and with a three-square sharpe priming iron make a vent through the Cartrage at
the Touch-hole; so that the priming powder that is to take fire may come to the
powder in the Cartrage.</p>
                        <p>The next thing considerable,<note place="margin">How to charge a peece with a Cartrage.</note> is to know how to give a true charge with a Ladle;
First, we are to consider (as formerly I have sayd) whether the Peece be double for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
or not,<note place="margin">How to give a Canon her true charge.</note> or whether inferiour in mettall; a double fortified Canon, is to bee

that the Gunner may not deceive himselfe, in the over or under-charging his Peece,

whereof it shall be impossible to make a true shot; for there is a certaine proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
charge of powder to be found for every Peece, according to the strength of the
Peece and the weight of the shot, some hold that the truest charge is a just quantity
of fine powder, that shall all fire within the Cillender of the Peece, and what is
more is superfluous.</p>
                        <p>Now we are to observe,<note place="margin">The three sundry e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the first is a small corned powder for Birding-peeces, and Fowling, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ngredients
is 7. or 8. of Peeter, and one of Cole and of Brimstone, and this is quickest and of
greatest force; the second is for Musquets and Pistols; called sine-powder, the
Composition is 5. or 6. of Peeter for one of Cole and of Brimstone. The third is called
Ordnance powder, and that hath 4. or 5. of Peeter for one of Cole, and of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone:
to distinguish the force of these severall kindes, or of any powder decayed,
there is an instrument invented, the Figure and use of it followes in this Booke, in
the discourse of Warlike instruments.<note place="margin">How to know when powder is decayed through mutation or corruption, three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides, it is easie for a Gunner to know if powder be decayed through mutation
or corruption, three severall wayes; the first by the sight. Secondly, by the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ling;
the third and surest way, is by firing it: If it lookes blacke and darke, or if it moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
or clammes together, it is naught and decayed; for good powder will feele
nimble, and looke of a blush or tawny colour: if good powder be fired upon a peece
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18615:79"/>
of white paper, if it rise quicke being fired, and spread in a moment, smoke little, but
rise in a cleare flash, and leaves no peeces upon the paper, but carries all away cleane,
without firing the paper, the powder is very good, otherwise not; by these symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
a Gunner cannot be deceived in proportioning his due charge.</p>
                        <p>Next, we are to know the difference of Bullets; both in their heights, weights,
Circumferences, and Mettals, which being not observed, a world of errors will bee
committed, and a true proportionable charge can never be found to make a right shot.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, first observe our best Gunners doe allow for all kinde of Bullets 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. part
of the Diameter of the Peeces Bore for vent.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">According to the weight of the shot, the powder must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, whether it be Iron, Leade, or Stone-shot.</note> according to the weight of the shot, the charge of powder must bee
proportioned. Therefore it is most necessary, first to know the true weight of any
shot by the Diameter thereof. Secondly, to know the different weights of Bullets,
being of one and the selfe-same Diameter, proportion, circumference, and height,
but of severall substances: as Iron, Leade, Stone, and the like. Wherefore take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
the proportion in weight of Iron to Leade, is as 30. to 46.</p>
                        <p>Likewise,<note place="margin">The difference in weight betwixt a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of Leade, Iron, and Stone, they being all three of one Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> Stone to Leade is as 18. to 72. and Stone to Iron as 18. to 48. the
powder due to every charge, must be proportioned according to the weight of the
Bullet, be it more or lesse, as Mr. <hi>Digges</hi> in his 17. Theorem doth shew, and as
Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> Comments upon it: That if a Gunner shoots three severall shots in a
Saker, the Bullet of the first being Leade, the second Iron, the third Stone, the true
charge of powder being 12. pound as the leaden Bullet requires, then the Leade out-rangeth
the other two, and that of Iron will out-range that of Stone; but if these
three severall Bullets be discharged with other severall proportions of powder, as
the Iron Bullet requires 8. l. of powder,<note place="margin">The true quantity of Powder each kinde of Bullet requires for its proportionall charge.</note> then will the Iron out-range the Leade, and
the Leade the Stone-shot. But thirdly, if these three kinde of Bullets bee severally
shot with 4 l. of powder, being the true proportionall charge for the Stone-shot,
then will the Stone-shot out-range the Iron, and the Iron the Leade.</p>
                        <p>Further in his 18. Theorem, the convenient weight of a Bullet alters according
to the quantity or validity of the powder,<note place="margin">Zote, these proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have beene obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to doe best execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for as formerly is shewed, that the Leade
shot requires the whole weight of ordinary powder, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. of Corne powder, and
the Iron-shot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>/2. of ordinary, or 2/3. of the best powder; and the Stone-bullet 2/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap> of the best powder.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, these precedent things being considered, yet there is further to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the length of the Peece,<note place="margin">The length of the Peece is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, before a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Powder can be allowed for its charge.</note> for although there be a convenient ponderositie of
Powder and Bullet, answerable one to the other, which might cause a perfect shoot,
yet if the Cillender of the Peece be not proportioned in length, but is eyther longer
or shorter, it will cause alteration; for the longer Peece will require more powder to
be fired in her, before the shot can arrive just at the mouth of the Peece to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
than the shorter will,<note place="margin">A difference in firing the Powder in a long, from a shorter Peece.</note> for if all the powder be fired before the shot arrives at
the mouth, the after running thereof within the mouth of the Cillender, will hinder
the swiftnesse thereof: So likewise if the Peece be too short, so that the Bullet be out of
the mouth of the Peece before all the powder be fired, having received all the force of
powder, for want of sufficient length in the Cillender of the Peece, it cannot possible
doe the true execution. For conclusion, we are not to forget to learne the weights
of all kinde of Bullets by their Diameters, and by having the true weight of a small
Bullet, thereby to finde out the weight of a greater; as also, by having the weight of
an Iron Bullet, thereby to finde out the weight of a Bullet of any other mettall.</p>
                        <p>An Iron Bullet; whose Diameter is 12 inches, the weight thereof is 240. l.
the same Diameter of Leade weighes 360. l. and the like in Marble Stone, 90. l. as
you may perceive by a Table following, exactly calculated by Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the next place,<note place="margin">An example, whereby to finde out the true weight of a great Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, by having the true weight of a small one performed by Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall Rules.</note> by having the weight of a small Bullet, thereby to finde out the
weight of a greater, is performed by this Example following.</p>
                        <p>An Iron Bullet of 6. inches Diameter weighing 30. pounds; by this I would
know, how much a Bullet of 12. inches Diameter weighes, being of the same met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
This is performed by multiplying the Diameter of each Bullet cubically, where
I finde the Cube of 6. to be 216. and the Cube of 12. to be 1728. Then by the Rule
of proportion I say, if 216. weighes 30. l. weight, what shall that Bullet weigh
whose Cube is 1728. So multiplying 1728. by 30. l. the weight of the lesser Bullet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18615:79"/>
ariseth 51840. which being divided by 216. being the Cube of the lesser Bullet, yeilds
in the quotient 240. l. So much shall the Bullet weigh, that is of 12. inches Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</p>
                        <p>How by the weight of an Iron Bullet, to finde out the weight of a Bullet of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Stone, being of the like Diameter, or by the weight and height of a Marble Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
to finde out the weight of an Iron Bullet of like height, is thus performed.</p>
                        <p>As for Example.</p>
                        <p>An Iron Bullet of 12. inches height, is of 240. l. weight; to know the weight
of a Marble Bullet of like Diameter:<note place="margin">How to know by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall Rules the weight of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bullet by an Iron, they beeing both of one Diameter.</note> You must first observe, that a Bullet of Iron to
the like Bullet of Marble Stone, shall beare such proportion as 18. to 48. (as before is
shewed) and therefore I multiply the weight of the Iron Bullet knowne, being
240. l. by 18. the proportion the Stone Bullet beareth thereto, of which ariseth 4320.
this being divided by 48. the quotient is 90. l. Thus much shal the Marble Bullet weigh,
that is in Diameter equall with the Bullet of Iron of 12. inches Diameter.</p>
                        <p>After the same manner take the height and weight of a Stone Bullet,<note place="margin">By the same Rule to finde out the weight of an Iron Bullet, by a Marble, being both of one Diameter.</note> being 12.
inches Diameter, which weighes 90. l. and multiply this 90. l. by 48. the Iron Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
beareth to the Stone, which Product being divided by 18. which is the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Stone beareth to the Iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the quotient will be 240. the number of pounds
the Iron Bullet weighes.</p>
                        <p>After the same manner, a Leaden Bullet being of the same Diameter that either
an Iron or a Stone Bullet is of, by knowing the proportion betweene Iron and Leade,
or Stone and Leade, you may finde out the weight either by the other, as before is
shewed.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if there be two Bullets, one higher in Diameter than the other, if you
want a paire of Callibre Compasses to take the just height, you must take a Cord and
guirt the Bullet or Bullets (whose height you desire to know) just in the midst, then
lay the measure to an inch Rule, observing how many inches or other measure the
same containeth, which being done, multiply the said measure by 7. and divide by
22. the quotient will shew you the just Diameter,<note place="margin">A Rule to finde out how much one Bullet is higher in Diameter then another.</note> then abating the lesse Diameter
from the greater, the remainer will shew you how much the one is higher than the

                        <p>As for Example.</p>
                        <p>If the Circumference of one Bullet be 20. inches, and the Circumference of the

                        <p>Likewise, having the Circumference of any Bullet, you may finde out the height

                        <p>First, take the disproportion that Iron beares to Leade, and Leade to Marble
Stone; for as formerly is shewed, Iron is in weight to Leade as 30. to 46. Leade to
Stone as 72. to 18. and Stone to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Diameter that weiges 30. l. to know what a Leaden Bullet of the same proportion
weighes; First, multiply the weight of the Iron Bullet knowne being 30. l. by 46.
the disproportion Leade beareth thereto; there ariseth 1380. which being divided
by 30. the quotient is 46. As appeares in this Table.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if you would know what a Stone Bullet weighes, of the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a Leaden is of, being 6. inches Diameter, and weighing (as in the quotient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is shewed) 46. l. and likewise observing the disproportion in weight to be
72. to 18. as before; you must multiply the weight of the Leaden Bullet knowne
being 46. l. by 18. the disproportion the Stone beareth thereto, so ariseth 828. which
being divided by 72. the quotient is 11 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I have adjoyned this Table, of the Square and Cubicke root; to the Table of the
height and weight of iron, Leade, and Stone Bullets; because Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> conceives
that a man of a small capacitie and practice, may finde out the weight of any Bullet
by the helpe of this Table of the Cubick-root.</p>
                        <p>As for Example.</p>
                        <p>Suppose an Iron Bullet of 4. inches Diameter and 1/2. now by dividing the Cube
of the Shot by 8. and take the quotient for pounds,<note place="margin">Note, to perform this the solid square inches must be found out, by multiplying the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Diameter of the Bullet cubical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then againe multiply the Cube by 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, and divide the last Product by 21, and the number in the quotient, is the solid square inches: The square inch of an iron Bullet, weighes foure ounces, and so of the rest.</note> and each unite of the Remainer
for two Ounces; and so the Cube of 4 ½. being 91. and divided by 8. the quotient
will be 11. l. and the 3. remaining will be 6. ounces; the like in all kindes may be
done for Stone-shot, by the Rule of 3. onely: Saying, if 48. the proportion of
Iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give 202. ounces, what shall 18. the proportion for Stone give? 76. ounces,
which is 4. l. and 12. ounces for the weight of the Stone-shot, which is 4. inches
1/2. in height.</p>
                        <p>Now to proceed in our discourse, the powder and length (being considered) of
the Peece, and the Bullets weight observed, to the end that a convenient proportion
of powder be found, answerable to the heavinesse or lightnesse of the Bullet. For if
one proportion of powder should be taken, for the three severall weights of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
being of divers mettals, as this Table doth distinguish the disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Iron, Leade, and Stone, there would prove an infinite variation and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
As Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> well observeth, that a mans hand is able to throw a weight
of foure pound Leade, further than a weight of 20. pounds of Iron; or then two
pounds of feathers:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Art of Great Artillery, <hi>p. 36.</hi>
                           </note> As he exemplifies it by a Saker, having made 3. shots; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of powder being 12. pounds, as the leaden shot weighes; in this case the shot of
Leade, will out-range the other two, and that of Iron will out-range that of Stone
But the quantitie of powder being altered to 8. pounds, as the Iron shot weigheth;
then the Iron will out-range the Leade, and the Leade the Stone-shot, Thirdly,
these Bullets being severally shot againe out of the same Peece, with the proportion
of 4 pounds of powder, then will the Stone-shot out-range the Iron, and the Iron
the Leade Bullet.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, this observation is not to be forgot; the higher a Peece is mounted, the
more doth the weight of the shot resist the powder,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, about the true charging a Peece of Ordnance, with the due proportion of powder allowed to Bullets of each kinde of mettall, prescribed.</note> and the lighter the shot is, the
easier it is forc'd out of the Peece; so that if the Bullet weighes either too much or
too little for the force of the powder, the motion thereof will be various. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he holds, the Leaden shot requires for its due charge, the whole weight of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
powder, or 4/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. of Corne-powder; and the Iron-shot 4/5. of ordinary powder,
or ⅔. of the best; and the Stone ⅔. of ordinary, or ½. of the best. This shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;

three things considerable; The first is the distance to

called point-blancke, and in this there is neither moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                        <p>The second, is when the marke assigned is farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

                           </gap>ed: Now from these
observations there is a fourth ariseth of equall consequence to bee observed with the
former <hi>(viz.)</hi> the finding out the true proportion of distance or paces of ground,
whether it be to shoote beyond, or under, or neere the true levell of point-blancke;
If both Art and judgement be not used in this, it will prove impossible ever to mount
or imbase a Peece to any point to performe a perfect shoot.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I hould it best to discourse of the diversity of wayes used by most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Gunners in levelling of Ordnance; wherein we shall be something large,
in regard the subject requires it; and in the next Chapter I shall discourse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and rules which which are to bee used in taking a true distance of paces to
any marke assigned.</p>
                        <p>And in this our present discourse, I shall first describe a quadrant, and then shew
the use of it; and so breefely proceed to other instruments invented for the like uses,
with such due observations as befits this Theame; for indeed this quadrant is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
by which divers conclusions belonging to this Art may be wrought,</p>
                        <p>This Gunners quadrant is a Geometricall instrument, containing in circumference
one quarter of a circle,<note place="margin">The quadrant descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with its parts, which is to bee made of Brasse or some hard Wood.</note> divided into 90. equall parts or degrees in the outmost limbe;
and in the second limbe within, there is 12. equall parts or divisions, and likewise
each of those are subdivided by meanes of parallels, and diagonalls, into 10. equall
parts so that each side will be thereby found distinctly divided into 120 equall parts;
the use of them is to take all Geometricall mensurations, both of distances, heights,
breadths, and depths, which are either accessible or inaccessible, as shall in the next
Chapter bee declared.</p>
                        <p>But as for the degrees and points, principally they are to helpe the Gunners pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice
to levell and shoot at the best certainty, both in the right line called point blancke,
and also upon the advantage of all kinde of Randons or markes assigned; onely you
are to make use of certaine Tables, Scales, and directions which I shall intreat of and
demonstrate by Figure.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore observe this quadrant must have a ruler made very straight about two
foot long, which is joyned firmely to one of the sides or Semi-diameters thereof; or
rather to have one of the sides extending it selfe out in forme of a ruler; this subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Figure represents the true proportion of it, as for the severall parts of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
which onely belongs to the taking of heights and distances, I omit alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in this place, reserving it for the next Chapter.</p>
                        <p>

                           <figure/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now therefore observe this Ruler to which the qudarant is artificially joyned,
being two foot long, divided into equall Inches and parts, with a hollow S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>t in the
midd'st, upon which is placed a plate with a round hole in the midd'st thereof; The
use of it is to set the ruler upright at the breech of the Peece, the plate before named
moving up and downe as you shall see cause, to take a perfect sight; by this you may
know, what length, or what Inches and parts any Peece requires to reach any marke.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, before you go about to level your Peece by the quadrant to make a Shott;
you must first by the use of this ruler, take a true view through the two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ight holes,
upon the backe of the same, then accordingly let the plumbline fall at liberty on the
degrees of the quadrant; and if the plumbline falls on the line of levell, then the mark
is of equall height with your eye; but if the thred falles towards you, the marke is
above point blancke; otherwise, if from the Line of levell, it is under point-blanck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by this you shall know whether your marke assigned be higher or lower then your
platforme or the Cillender of your Peece, for it is most necessary, first to see whether
the Base or lowest part of the sayd marke or altitude bee above or under point-blancke.</p>
                        <p>Now in levelling your Peece, you are to put the ruler into the mouth of the
Peece close to the lowest side of the mettall,<note place="margin">The mounting o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then mount or imbase your Peece in her Carriage, untill the plummet fall directly
upon the Line of level, and then the Axis of the bore or Concave or Cillender thereof,
will lye straight and levell.</p>
                        <p>But if the marke assigned be found by this instrument to lye beyond the reach of
the Peece at point-blancke, so as shee must bee mounted at some one degree or other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
according as the distance shall be found; in this you must make use of certaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

exactly framed, which hereafter shall bee demonstrated. But before you can attaine
to any understanding in them, you must first learne to finde the right Line or right
Range of any shot discharged, (out of what kinde of Peece soever it bee) for every
elevation.</p>
                        <p>Next you are to finde out how much of the Horizanticall Line lyeth under the
crooked range of the Shot, at any elevation that shall be assigned.</p>

                        <p>Further by observing the severall Diameters of divers Peeces, and their various
lengths, causeth much alteration in their ranges; yet for the ease of the lngenious
Souldier, our moderne Gunners have taken wonderfull paines in framing a Table of
the proportions of right ranges; the use of it is thus to bee understood: Let your
Peece be of what kinde soever; you must first know and prove how farre this Peece
conveyes her shot at any one degree of the quadrant; as suppose you finde your
Peece shoots at 6 degrees of mounture, 200 paces in a right Line, not sensibly croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
now your desire is to know how farre the same Peece will further convey her
shot in a straight Line, shee being mounted to ten degrees.</p>
                        <p>For this you must repaire to the Table following, and propound to your selfe,
if 285 the number against sixe degrees giveth 200 paces, what will
354 the number in this Table against 10 degrees give.</p>

paces, view the Table of the proportions of right ranges in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                        <p>Yet by the way observe these Tables are not absolutely true, nor
cannot possibly correspond in a just exactnesse, in regard of divers
Fractions; wherefore practice must be the best Schoole-master in
these conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Now to proceed in our discourse; the next thing to be observed,
is the finding out how farre a Peece shoots at every degree of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at its dead range, and for to performe this, the right range and
crooked being added together into one, is then called the dead range,
which is to bee understood the whole distance from the platforme,
from which the Peece is discharged, unto the first fall or graze of
the Bullet upon the levell Line, or Horzianticall plaine.</p>
                        <p>And likewise as formerly is sayd, the differences in the Bores and
lengths of Peeces, and likewise the strength and feeblenesse of the
powder increaseth or diminisheth the course of the Shot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
most difficult to finde out the true range, but by Diagrams, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
or Scales made from experiments; and to that end and purpose
our late practitioners in this Art, have beaten their braines and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to arrive at some exactnesse; by their experiments and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
endeavours they have attained to some seeming perfection,
far better then uncertaine guessing, and for that purpose framed Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
as appeareth in the Margent, which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath as he confesses grounded
upon often observations and tryalls; the use of this Table of the proportions of dead
ranges he hath thus demonstrated; First you must take the right
range of the Peece experimented, from the right range of the
mounture assigned, and divide the remainder in such reason as the
sayd angle of mounture is to the angle of the complement thereof;
and to the quotient adde the said right range found, and the product
thereof will be the dead range for that Peece: he further gives this
example, Suppose a Peece mounted at 30 degrees, shoots 300.
paces in the right range, and 300. at the dead range; if you would
desire to know the dead range at 40 degrees; to performe this you
are to worke in this manner following: First divide the dead range
into any number of parts as you shall please, which being set out in a
Line, at one end of the right line make an angle (as <hi>Euclide</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
by his 23 proposition) and from the other end of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd
Line, you must erect a perpendiculer Line (by <hi>Eucledes</hi> 11 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position)
untill it intersect the Line that framed the angle given, and
note well how many such parts it containeth; then you must multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the parts of the dead range, by the parts of that line which fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the angle containeth; then the product being divided by the
number of parts, which you divided the Line of the dead range in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and the quotient will be the secant range, which being knowne,
then you must worke after this manner following.</p>

                        <p>This staffe being this framed and ordered, the use of it is thus; You are to bring

notice of the number of the quotient, which last quotient being likewise divided by
360, the degrees contained in the whole Circumference of every Circle, the last

                        <p>Lastly, observe if you would have your Peece mounted by an inch Rule, for to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
any number of degrees under 10, either you must Multiply that number, by the
number of inches, and parts of an inch, that makes the degrees of a Quadrant, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you may worke as you did the first Conclusion, Multiplying the first product by
the number of inches desired, and dividing the product by the numbers before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
your last quotient will resolve you.</p>
                        <p>As for a further example, the peece of Ordnance before mentioned, you desire to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
by an Inch rule to answer to 8 degrees of the quadrant, first you reduce the length
of the Bore into Inches, as formerly is shewed, doubling that measure, &amp; it makes 168
(as in the first conclusion) which 168 Inches, multiplyed by 22, yeelds 3696 Inches,
the which Product being now multiplyed by 8, ariseth 29568, which sum divided by
7, the quotient is 4224, the same divided by 360, yeelds in the Quotient 11 Inches 1/15
parts of an Inch. So many Inches, and parts of an inch, must the same Peece be elevated
unto, with an Inch-Rule to answer unto 8 degrees of the Quadrant. But to lay your
Peece point-blank without instrument, you must bring the height of the Mettle at the
mouth, equall with the Horizon, and then the Concave Cillinder will lye point-blanke.</p>
                        <p>But Master <hi>Norton</hi> doth mislike Master <hi>Smiths</hi> wayes in shooting by the Mettall or
<hi>Mira Comune;</hi> and he hath beene very zealous in finding out a more perfect way,
and Sayes to shoot with any Peece by the Mettall, or <hi>Mira Comune;</hi> the difference
or mount, about the levell which the Mettall causeth being considered, and exactly
examined, will shew the angle of the Peeces Mounture, with the which you must
repaire to the precedent Table of proportionall Mountures for the severall Randons
upon each point or degree of the Gunners quadrant in page 127, which is thus to
be appropriated unto any Peece; first having made one shoot with her at the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a certaine marke assigned, and finding her dead range for the same; which
being reverted to the given elevation, will soone yeeld the range required; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
is after this manner given; That suppose by examination it be found out, that
by reason of the eminencie of the Mossell Ring; and length of the Chase of the
Peece; the directions of the Mettall at the breech, and the Mossell ring, to mount the
Peece higher then it would, if the assise of her Bore were duly directed by a true
desparte unto any Marke assigned by six degrees, and let it bee imagined that the
Marke is elevated six degrees above the Horrizon, so found by the Quadrant, and
observing that at the mounture, the Peece did shoot 850 paces for her dead range;
the question is, how farre the same Peece would convey the like shotte, with the
like loading and accidents, if she weare by the highest of her Mettall at Britch and
Mossell, directed to the same marke.</p>
                        <p>Say then if 722, the number in the Table of dead ranges against 6 degrees gives
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18615:84"/>
850 paces being the measure of the shotte made in her at six degrees of mounture,
what shall 1394 the number against 12 degrees of Mounture give? By making use
of the Rule of three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and multiplying the third of these three Numbers, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
dividing the Product by the first, the Quotient will be 1534 paces. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
collected, and fitted this discourse, so that the ingenuous Souldier may gaine
some profit by it, I leave it to his discretion, to cull out such Rules and Examples, as
shall best fit his practice.</p>

one time farther then the other; but being elevated past
those degrees, shee shootes every degree shorter than
the other, untill she come to shoote perpendiculer, or in

her shotte upwards, according to the distance of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

of the ayre upon the marke; of this we shall speake largely, towards the finishing
of this Chapter.</p>

marke is in neerenesse; and so to performe this, wee will only make choyce of the
Staffe before in that Chapter described, invented by Master <hi>Norton</hi> for that purpose,

in regard there askes small cunning to performe this only practice, and use will
guide a man to direct the shot by Imbasure to her right marke; I will leave it, and
proceed to the use of Morter-Peeces,<note place="margin">The best of a Morter-Peeces Randon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene 50 and 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Quadrant.

in; and further, that it is the nature of all Peeces to shoot above the levell of the
Marke, if the object be upright, as a side-banke, or the like.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Morter-peeces, how they are used, and levelled wee shall crave
your patience to be more large, in relating the Collections of the rules, and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of those that have beene ablest practicioners in this Art.</p>
                        <p>The Invention of these Morter-Peeces was to annoy the Enemie, when other
Ordnance cannot possibly be used against them: and for the making a perfect Shot
in one of these peeces two things are requisite to be knowne.</p>
                        <p>First, how farre your Morter-Peece will carry a Bullet or Fire-ball at the best of
her Randon.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, you must know how farre it is from the Peece to the marke you intend
to shoote; these being knowne, you may make a perfect shot; as for example, if you
find your Morter-Peece will shoot a Bullet,<note place="margin">How to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Shot in a Morter Peece, proved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> or fire ball, 700 paces at 45 degrees of
the Quadrant; and that the marke you intend to shoot at, is but 500 paces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then (by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18615:85"/>
the Rule of three reverse) you must say,<note place="margin">Note the due charge of a Morter Peece is 1/10 part of the weight of the shotte in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, shooting upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mount above 45 degrees, but with 1/2 parts shooting levell, or downwards.</note> if 700 paces requires 45 degrees, what
will 500, thus multiplying the second by the first, and dividing the Product by the
third number, you shall find it must be mounted to 63 degrees of the Quadrant to
hit that marke.</p>
                        <p>Further, observe if a Morter Peece will shoot 450 paces, at the best of the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if you should elevate her one degree aboue the utmost Range, shee will shoot
10 paces shorter: to prove this you must divide the distance of the utmost Range
(being 450 paces, as before is said) by 45, the degree of the best of the Randon, and
you shall find the quotient to be 10, as before is related. But by the way, great care
must be had in ordering your Morter Peece, so that she shoot not wide, either upon
the one, or other hand; Wherefore to prevent it, you must lay a straite Ruler, upon
the mouth of the Peece, and upon it place a Quadrant crosse-wayes, and the plumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
will direct you; but withall observe how the windes blow, and so accordingly
order your Peece.</p>
                        <p>Then if you please, you shall make use of such further Rules and Tables, as have
beene approved to be certaine and good; the Table followes, and the use of it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner;</p>
                        <p>Having once made knowne the distance the Peece did shoot at, being mounted to
what point or degree you have first resolved upon, as suppose it be 53 degrees from
which she conveyes her shot 700 paces, to know how farre shee will shoot at any
other degree of the Quadrant, the Example is this;</p>
                        <p>You shall levell your Peece at 60 degrees, now because 700 degrees is not at all
in this Table, but you shall find against 60 degrees there stands 529 paces, therefore
say by the rule of 3, if 562 being the number against 53 degrees, gives 700 paces,
what shall 529 the number against 60 degrees give; now according to the Rule, if
you multiply 700 by 529,<note place="margin">Note your Peece must have the same proportionall charge of powder and shot, that it had at 52 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</note> and divide the Product by 562, the quotient will bee

                           </gap>/4, the number of paces which the said Morter Peece will shoot at 60 degrees
mounture. Thus for any other number of paces or degrees, you may helpe your selfe
by this Table following, which was Calculated by Captaine <hi>Vffanio,</hi> for every degree
betweene the Levell, and 90 degrees for the Randons of the Morter Peeces.</p>

                        <p>Now for the mounting your peece to any of these degrees, it is not so proper to
put the Ruler of the Quadrant into the mouth of the Peece, in regard there may be
error, because many of these kind are taper-bored, or galed at the mouth: to rectifie
this, your Gunners have invented a very apt instrument, framed after this manner;
First, there is a Ruler of 18 Inches in length; at the middle point or pricke thereof
must be another shorter Ruler framed artificially above a foot long joyned close, and
falling perpendicularly on the middle point of the longer Ruler; Whose containing
Angle lighteth justly on the middle point of the longer Ruler, from which point is

                           </gap> part of a Circle, and divided into 45 equall divisions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
so as the 90 degrees stand just on the Center, or middle point of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Rule.</p>
                        <p>The use of it is thus, by laying the longer Rule crosse the mouth of the Peece, you
shall immediatly perceive at what degree the said Morter Peece is elevated by
the Plumb-line, the Peece being mounted at any grade above 45, observe the Figure.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>And for to conclude this Chapter remitting all further Circumstances, wee will
only take notice of another Table which <hi>Vffanio</hi> hath likewise Calculated for a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Peece to shoot thereby, fitted to the 12 points of the Gunners
Quadrant, as you may perceive; Thus having runne over such rules
and examples as I conceive most apt and necessary for the true le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
of Ordnance; It now only remaines in the Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
to take a view of such Rules, and Instruments, as are
most proper and commodious for the taking of heights and
distances, without the which it is impossible ever to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
any designe belonging to this Art of Gunnerie, or to
the Art of Myning; Wherefore be pleased to take a Survey of
the subsequent Chapter.</p>

the knowledge and understanding of these kind of Instruments,
the true use of them, with the Rules and documents, which our
ablest Practitioners have through their paines and industrie, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for future ages to practice; For the ignorance of this, makes
both the Art of Gunnerie, and Myning, lame and imperfect;
wherfore I will indeavour to be as briefe, as the matter will permit
in discoursing of the severall parts of it. And by the way you may remember, that in
the fiftieth Chapter, page 125. I began to describe the Instrument, called a Gunners
Quadrant; but I left the description how it should bee used, about the taking of
heights and distances, to be discoursed of in this Chapter; only be pleased to have a
regard, and reference to the precedent Figure of the Quadrant; and then I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoure
to describe those parts of it; that serve for our purpose.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore observe, as I have said in the Figure, that from the Center <hi>A,</hi> there is
a line drawne aslope (called the Hipothenusall line) which comes to the corner <hi>C.</hi>
upon which if the plumb-line falls upon the Center <hi>A,</hi> looking through the sights
<hi>EF,</hi> and withall, beholding the extreames or highest parts of any Altitude; Note,
then the distance from the middle part of your foot, to the base thereof, is the
just height of the said Altitude, adding thereto the height from your eye; But if the
Plumb-line, falls on the line <hi>A. B.</hi> then that marke you view through the Visuall
sight <hi>EF</hi> is of equall height, or levell with your eye; Now the square lines or Scale,
which extend it selfe from <hi>B</hi> to <hi>C,</hi> and from <hi>C</hi> to <hi>D,</hi> are divided into 12 equall
parts; and if it were divided into 90, or a 100 divisions, or ten times as many, the
better it were for the use of Shadowes, Length, and Heights. Now by the way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
not to remember that the side <hi>C D,</hi> is called the right Shadow; and this serves
to measure all the Heights, with the length thereof; but the side <hi>B C,</hi> is of contrary
shadow, and that serves to measure all heights, without the length thereof; the Rule
we have described the use of it in page 125.</p>
                        <p>Now, suppose we were to take the height of a Castle wall, of a Fort, or any other
Altitude aproachable; first we must aproach as neere to the object, that wee ghesse
we are neere about the length of the height of the same, then set your quadrant to
your eye looking through your visuall sights, beholding the extreme or highest part
of the Altitude, then moving too, and from the same, untill the thred and plummet
cut, or fall upon the part 12 of right shadow; then measuring how farre it is from
the middle part of your Foot, to the base of the said Altitude; You have the just
height of that Altitude, only adding the height from the ground to your eye. You
may further find out any upright height, with the length thereof, both by the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and without shadow, if the ground be plaine; wherefore you must aproach as
neere to the Base or foot of the Altitude, that the plumb-line may fall on the part of
Right shadow; then measuring the distance from the middest of your foot to the
Base thereof, multiplying the measure by 12, adding thereunto the height, to your
eye, from the ground, and you have the true Altitude.</p>
                        <p>Or letting the Sunne beames pierce through the Vissuall sights, the Plumb-line
falling at liberty upon that part of Right-shadow (then measuring as before is
shewed) and multiply that measure by 12, and dividing by the parts whereon the
Plumb-line cuts, the quotient will tell you the true height of the same Altitude.</p>
                        <p>And note this for a generall rule,<note place="margin">Generall Rules <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> for the taking the heights by the right Shadow.</note> that upon what part of Right shadow the
Plumb-line cuts; if you measure the height or Altitude, it will prove more then
the shadow by such proportion, as 12 exceedeth the part or division of the Scale,
where the Plumb-line pointed unto; As for example, if the Plumb-line be found to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18615:86"/>
fall on the part 2 of right shadow, if you measure the distance, from the midst of
your foot to the Base for the Altitude six times, that measure is the height of the
same, adding from your eye to the ground, for you must observe that the part 2 is
contained in 12, being the division of the Scale 6 times.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, what part soever the Plumb-line falls on of right Shadow, looke how
oft that part is contained in 12, just so many times as the measure is from your foot to
the Base, is the height of the thing you measure, adding from the ground to your eye.</p>
                        <p>The contrary Shadow shewes to measure all Altitudes without the length thereof;
first multiplying the length of the shadow, by the Point or, division of the Scale,
where on the Plumb-line falleth, then dividing the Product by 12, the quotient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is the true height of the Altitude.</p>
                        <p>In measuring any Altitude without shadow, you must goe as neere to the same,
that you perceive you are within the length thereof, then lifting up your Quadrant,
orderly going to,<note place="margin">Note, in this rule the farthest stationis twice the length of the height of the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, adding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to your eye.</note> or from the same, untill you espie the top of the Altitude through
the Visuall holes, then the threed falling upon the part 12, standing upright with your
body; at the middest of your foot make a marke, then goe directly backwards from
the same, untill through the visuall sights you espie the highest part againe; the plumb-line
falling on the part sixe of contrary shadow; and as before make another marke;
the distance betweene these two markes, the height of your eye from the ground
being put to it,<note place="margin">Note, the farthest sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is three times the length of the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if you measure from the Base there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> is the true height of the altitude.</p>
                        <p>Further observe, if the plumb-line fals on the part 6 of contrary shadow; and at
the second station on the part 4, the distance betwixt these two markes is the height
of the altitude, adding as before.</p>
                        <p>Or if the plumb-line fals on the part 4 of contrary shadow at the first sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
then upon the part 3 at the second, you shall finde the distance betweene
your two stations to be the just height, and the furthest station is foure times the
length or height thereof.</p>
                        <p>Or suppose your Plumb-line falls upon the part 2 of contrary shadow;<note place="margin">Note if the Scale of the Quadrant were divided into 100. or a 1000 divisions, by so much further from the thing to be measured, you may find out the height thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> and at the
second station, it falls on the part one, then the space betweene the two standings,
will be six times the length or height of that Altitude, or the sixt part of the measure
is the height of it, and your further station will be twelve times the height thereof.</p>
                        <p>In the next place we must observe some rules for the taking of distances from the
Platforme, or Batteries your Ordnance are planted on, to any Marke you are to shoot
at;<note place="margin">Divers Rules how to take the true distance from the platforme to any marke assigned by the helpe of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant.</note> And to performe this, you must lay your Quadrant flat upon some steady thing,
as a stoole or staffe, firmely and perpendicularly set up, then placing your Quadrant
upon the same, and turning the edge of the Rule to the marke you desire to measure
the distance of, then espying the Marke through the Visuall sights, at that place or
station set up a Staffe; then turning your body round, not altering neither Rule nor
Quadrant by the Line of levell; then through the Visuall sights, make choyce of
some other Marke athwart the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rst, and set up the second Staffe, the distance whereof
suppose to be 60 feet; then comming to the first station where the Quadrant is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
viewing through the visuall sights upon the Rule, some other marke in
a straite line backe from the first station, the distance whereof suppose to be 100 feet,
and there place a third Staffe, so as the first and the third Staffe, will be in a straite line
with the marke, then removing the Quadrant to the third station, turning the right
Angle or Line of levell overthwart towards the second station, so as the Visuall line
may be paralelled to the Line that crosseth from the first station to the second, there
you must place a fourth Staffe, so as the Visuall line passing from the same, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by the second Staffe may crosse the marke, or end in a point there with the first
Visuall line; The distance between these two last stations, suppose to be 65 feet; The
Staves being thus orderly placed, you must abate 60 feet the distance between the first
and second Staffe or station, from 65 the distance between the third and fourth Staves
or stations, the remainder is 5 for your Devisor, then multiply the said 65 by 100 the
distance from the first to the third there ariseth 6500, the which divide by 5, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
is 1300 feet, the distance from the first Staffe to the marke; Observe this figure
following, where the Towre represents the marke, the Vnit. 1. the first Staffe or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the figure 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the second Staffe; the figure 3, the third Staffe; and the figure 4, the
fourth Staffe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:18615:87"/>

                        </p>
                        <p>Or you may finde out the distance to any marke neere hand by the quadrant and
Gunners Staffe divided into even portions; First placing the angle of the quadrant
upon the toppe of the Staffe, it being erected perpendicularly; and then through the
sights of the rule view the marke you desire to measure, letting a long thred fall to
the ground, from the center of the quadrant whereon the plum-line hangs; which
thred must be drawn alongst the Line of levell or edge of the quadrant to the ground,
observing where the thred points at on the ground, and beholding the marke through
the visuall sights, and looking what proportion that part of ground betweene the
Staffe and where the thred points at, hath to the Staffe, the same proportion shall the
length to the marke have to the height or length of the Staffe, as by this subsequent
Figure more plainely appeares.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore observe the Gunners Staffe <hi>A. B.</hi> is to be supposed eight foot long,
and the distance betweene the Staffe and the ground where the thred points you to;
(being the space <hi>C. B.)</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note, the higher the Staffe is, the further may you measure any distance by this Rule.</note> is but eight Inches; Therefore looke what proportion <hi>C. B.</hi>
beareth to the length of the Staffe, (which being reduc'd into Inches, will be 96 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
the same proportion shall the length to the marke <hi>D.</hi> have to the Staffe,
which by making use of the Rule of three, will discover unto you in this manner;
for example; If eight Inches yeelds 96, what will 96 Inches; if you multiply
96 by 96, the product is 9216 Inches, and this divided by 8, yeelds in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
1152 Inches, the true distance from the Staffe to the Marke.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Moreover, by the quadrant you may foresee whether Waters or Springs may
possibly bee brought to any place desired, which indeed is a thing of much conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in the Warres; Wherefore observe, that by going to the head of the Spring
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18615:87"/>
or Waters, and by setting your quadrant to your eye, being in height equall with the
Water, so that the plum-line falls preciesely on the Line of levell; now if you may
see above the place through the sights, then you may judge the Water is possible to
bee brought; but if you sight falls under, then it is impossible: It commeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
to passe when the place to the which you would have Water conveyd, is of
any great distance from the head of the Spring, or Rivers banckes; the Hills, Vallies,
and such like impediments, hinder the visuall Line from having its free course:
wherefore observe this remedie.</p>
                        <p>At the head of the Spring or River-bancks you intend to cut out; you shall looke
through the sights of the instrument (as before) and take notice of some marke in
in the next Hill towards the place, then goe to that marke, and in like manner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
some other marke if any other Hill happen to bee, and so proceed untill you
may see the place desired; if then your sight running through the sight of the Rule,
(the thred ever falling upon the Lane of levell) exceeds that place, the conveying of
that Water is possible, otherwise not.</p>
                        <p>If it should chance that a quadrant bee wanting, yet you may take the distance
to any place by the Carpenters square; First you must have a Saffe divided in certaine

the Center of the quadrant by the Lines of levell, may direct you to the sayd marke;
and the visuall Line passing from the Center of the quadrant, by the 12 point or
division of the scale, which is called the Hipothenusal line, may direct you to the other
marke, and then the length of your standing to the marke, which the Line of levell
doth direct you to, is from the same just the distance betweene the two markes you
intend to measure; then looking athwart by the other edge of the quadrant, or
through your sights on the Rule, espie another marke directly against the marke you
meane to measure, and the visuall Line passing betweene the station and the sayd
marke will be paralell to the Breach of the sayd Wall or Line passing betweene the
two marks, whose distance you would measure; then removing your quadrant before
the other Marke, placing the same so as the Line of levell may direct you to the sayd
Marke, and the Line passing by your sights on your Ruler may direct you to your
first station; the distance betwixt your two stations being measured, is the just space
betwixt the two Markes or two ends of the Breach, as by this demonstrative Figure
appeares, where the Line <hi>A. B.</hi> sheweth the length or distance of the Breach to bee

consequence in the time of Warre, I have thought
it very necessary to discover such secret wayes,
as have formerly taken effect; and likewise, some
new wayes in writing of Letters whose secresie
cannot possibly be discovered, the use and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whereof may bring a double conveniency to
Souldiers. First, in making them cunning to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
and discover an Enemies Letters and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Secondly, in causes of extremity to make
use in conveying such Letters, as they conceive
may bee most prevalent, and difficultest for the
Enemie to discover, if they should be surprized.
For great inconvenience attends the surprizing of a Letter, if the Enemy should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the contents of it; as was well seene by <hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> interpreting <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubals</hi>
Letter directed to his Brother <hi>Haniball,</hi> to meet him at <hi>Vmbra</hi> to joyne both
their powers together, for the subversion of the <hi>Romans;</hi> presently upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
and reading it, he left his fellow Consull in the night unknowne to <hi>Haniball,</hi>
and with 6000. Foot and 1000. Horse, came to <hi>Livius,</hi> another Roman Consull,
who lay to intercept <hi>Asdruball,</hi> comming from the Mountaines into <hi>Italy;</hi> and
there joyning force with his, gave battell to <hi>Asdruball,</hi> in the fight overcame him
and slew him, before ever <hi>Haniball</hi> knew of his being in <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus was <hi>Haniball</hi>
brought to distresse, by the knowledge of the Contents of a Letter, whereby time
and opportunity was taken to fight: the consideration of which, hath made me lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

looking to the Watch, and finding his fit opportunity, shot a Letter from the

                        <p>Some Philosophers, and others of great insight in the hidden qualities of the

although they be a thousand miles distant: the manner to performe it is thus. Take
two peeces of round Bords being smothed, about the bignesse of the top of an houre-glasse,
upon these must be glewed a peece of cleane paper, which being done, a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
must be drawne on eyther of them, and the Letters of the Crosse-row
being set downe distinctly a pretty distance a sunder round the said Circumference,
of each of them. Then after the manner of a Sunne-diall, there must be a Steele-nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
plac'd in either of them, of one length and weight, these Needles must be toucht
with the <hi>Magnes</hi>-stone both at one instant; your Friend is to have one of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
the other to remaine with your selfe; the just time of the day being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
when the discourse should begin, you must with your finger direct the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to such Letters, one sensibly after another, for the making up a word, then pauze
so long as you thinke he may well write it downe; then removing the Needle againe
to those Letters, which doe spell such words as your minde may be understood, and
as you remove your Needle, so voluntarily will your Friends Needle point at the
same Letters, whereby you may discourse what you please. <hi>Viginerius</hi> in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

next you must shew one light once which signifies <hi>A,</hi> then obscuring the Light as
before, you must next shew two lights twice which signifies <hi>N,</hi> being the second
Letter of the second part of the Crosse-row; the word being finished, you must

                        <p>One of the surest wayes to write a Letter, which is not possible to be read, but
by him that is to receive it and knowes the device, is in this kinde to be performed;
First, you must have two flat Rulers, three or foure inches broad, and halfe a foot
long, they must be both of a breadth, to a haires breadth, then take a sheet of cleane
Paper, and cut it out into narrow peeces like your smallest Tape, then with mouth-glew
fasten the ends together, and winde it even about the Rule, giving the end
you begin to write at a privie marke, then write your secrets upon the Paper, eyther
in Letters or Characters, which being unwound from the Rule, can never be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
brought together to be read, unlesse it bee wound about your Friends Rule,
whereby he may understand your minde.</p>
                        <p>There is a most excellent way to write, so as it is impossible to bee understood,
which is performed after this manner; Take two halfe sheets of Paper, and Rule
them one upon the other, so as the Lines may be of equall distance, then take your
Pen-knife, and just upon the Lines cut through both the halfe sheets of Paper a Loop-hole,
so broad and long as a man may write a word through it; then a prety distance
from that hole in the same line, and after the same manner, cut another; thus doing
through the whole Paper in convenient distances one from the other; this being
done, let your friend keepe one of these papers, and your selfe the other, and when
you intend to write your secrets, lay this paper upon a cleane sheet, and write your
minde through those holes, which being done, take off the paper, and with your
Pen write some other circumstance in the line betweene word and word, which
may alter the sense, and make it more obscure; this being sent to your Friend, so
soone as he placeth his Paper with the holes over it, he may reade through the holes
your intentions, and without this it will seeme impossible ever to make sense of it.</p>
                        <p>Further, you may take notice of certaine Characters whereby a man may expresse
his minde freely, and secretly, to his friend; the manner how to performe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>First, you are to observe the fashion of each Character, whose property is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the Letter that stands within it, as you may perceive by the first <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>〈☐〉</desc>

                           </gap> hath <hi>b</hi> in it, and
represents the letter <hi>b;</hi> and so of the rest. Further, you must take notice, that the
Characters of the first figure are without any prickes; the Characters of the second
Figure, hath to each of them one pricke, as <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>〈☐〉</desc>

                           </gap> This kinde of writing cannot possibly bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
if it were writ upon the Paper wound about the Rule, as before is
shewed.</p>
                        <p>We may likewise write without inke, that it may not be seene nor read, unlesse
the Paper be wet with a kinde of water prepared for the same purpose; To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this, you must take some Vitriol and powder it finely, then temper it with
faire water in a cleane thing, when it is dissolved you may take a Pen and write what
you please, and it cannot be read, except you draw it through water, wherein some
powder of galles hath beene infused, and so it will shew is blacke as if it had beene
written with inke.</p>
                        <p>Further, we may take the yelke of a new-laid Egge, and grinde it upon a Marble
with faire water, so as you may write with it; having ground it on this wise, then
with a cleane Pen dippe into it; and draw what Letters you please, upon faire white
Paper or Parchment, then being through dry, blacke all the Paper or Parchment
over with inke, and let it also dry on; afterwards you may scrape it with a knife,
and all the Letters you wrote with the yelke of an Egge will be faire and white;
those that knowes not the devise will take it to be a blurred Paper.</p>
                        <p>There is likewise a most excellent way to send Letters by wilde Pigeons out of a
beleaguered Towne; the manner to performe it is thus; When you suspect a Fort
shall be beleaguered, take divers old Pigeons, from such a place as you intend to
send your Letter to, which being kept in a Basket, and let loose with a Letter fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about the necke of it, she will speedily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mysterie of it, may take the Pigeon, whereby he shall understand his Friends inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
This shall suffice for the secret conveying of Letters.</p>

the Hollander, whereby they have much annoyed their
Enemies, and blowne up their Out-Workes, yet many
times it proves dangerous to the Pioniers, if they be not
carefull to sustaine the earth over their heads with props

if that cannot bee, a Well at the month of the
Mine must bee made for a receptacle for all the Springs to runne into, and Pumpes
and forcers are to bee set sufficient to mount the Water.</p>
                        <p>There are foure principall causes to impeach the working of a Mine; first, the ill
stopping of the Forne;<note place="margin">4. things that hinders the effectual working of a Mine.</note> secondly the weaknesse of the sides by Countermines or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns;
thirdly by fayling of the Traine through moisture or ill contriving; fourthly,
the most important is, that the Frame whereon the Barrells stand bee not placed too
low, as under the levell of the entrance, which it must ever exceed, because the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of fire is ever to ascend.</p>
                        <p>Now for the conducting of this Mine, their are divers circumstances to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
First, the distance from the place you intend to sincke your Mine, to the
Wall or Bulworke you intend to blow up; Secondly, whether the ground be rising
or declining towards the object; Thirdly, whether there bee any Rockes or Ponds
which may hinder the direct carrying your Trench to the place assigned: These cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
being considered, there are divers Instruments to bee used in the orderly
conveying of them;</p>
                        <p>As first, the quadrant or Iacobs-Staffe to take the distance; Secondly, the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Compasse, (if a fitter instrument cannot bee had) by this you must observe in
what point of the Compasse the place you intend to Mine unto stands, from the place
you intend to breake ground first; then you must have a levell by which you may see
how the ground riseth or declines, and accordingly bee guided, so that you worke
not your selfe too farre out of the ground, nor too deepe in.</p>
                        <p>The Rules with the demonstrative Figures for the taking of heights and distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
you shall finde in the latter end of the discourse of the use of Artillery. Here I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18615:93"/>
will shew you a figurative example for the taking the profunditude of a Valley, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may the better learne how to conduct your Mine towards a Valley if occasion
<figure/>
should bee; and although it bee somewhat difficult to bee done in regard there are
divers observations to be made; and for to begin, we must from the point <hi>B</hi> take
notice of some opposite object in the plaine Horizon as the letter <hi>A,</hi> the sight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you may in a right Line take with this instrument by the helpe of a Plumb-Rule;<note place="margin">View the third Figure of distances by the Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs Staffe in the end of the discourse of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</note>
then from the point <hi>B,</hi> you are to take the distance <hi>B C</hi> as formerly is shewed;
that being done, from the point <hi>B</hi> let your visuall Lines from the moveable Rule
of your instrument agree in <hi>A</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> your instrument being so set, doe not alter
it, but take againe the angle <hi>A B C</hi> upon the plaine fielding; then turning you
about, forme the Angle <hi>F B H</hi> which is equall to the Angle <hi>A B C,</hi> then sticke
downe some marke upon the Lines <hi>B F B H,</hi> and upon the Line, <hi>B H;</hi> count how
many paces or feet you can finde betweene <hi>B</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> and sticke downe a marke at
the end of the last pace or foot, which shall arrive in <hi>E;</hi> All these things being thus
disposed, apply your instrument to make a right Angle, putting the moveable Ruler
upon the first point of the Index; for alwaies the instrument makes a right Angle
when the Rule is upon the first point of the Index: The instrument being thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that the visuall Lines extends by the points of the Rule upon the Line <hi>B</hi> and <hi>F,</hi>
so that you may make your sight agree in <hi>B</hi> and in <hi>E</hi> or in <hi>F</hi> and in <hi>E,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The demonstration of this proposition, is grounded upon the 26 of the 1 of <hi>Euclid.</hi>
                           </note> that it may
arrive in <hi>D,</hi> and not otherwise: Then measure the Line <hi>D E,</hi> and that shall bee
equall to the depth of the Valley <hi>G C</hi> where the Tower stands to bee blowne up;
but to build Forts upon the foot of the Valley is not usuall, in regard the Ordnance
will command it: Wherefore I have shewed this example but by the way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<note place="margin">If the ground bee le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, you are to Mine in, then at every 15 or 20 paces you may by the instrument know how much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or beneath the Line of levell you have err'd.</note> yet for better explanation of our former discourse, the depth of a Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found, or the true height of a steepe Hill, it will be very easie to finde how many
inches or feet you must rise or decline in every five paces of your Mining, by the help
of the levell; An easie Arithmitician may performe this, whereby they may easilie
perceive when they goe too farre outward, or too deepe inward, and for the erring
of either side, the Compasse will direct; If in the conducting your Mine you feare
the Enemies Counter-Mines; you must have a Wimble 15 or 16 foot long to pierce
the earth in all places, by which you may discover what the Enemy doth.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, when you have brought the Mine almost to the place, you must then
begin to make the Trench very narrow, and Angling about as this figure shewes you,
the Barrells of Powder being plac't as you see with vents one to take fire from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with sufficient Rafters and Plankes on the toppe to carry up all before it, then
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18615:93"/>
                           <figure/>
must there a pipe of Lead, or Reede runne from the Powder alongst the Myne, to
the place where fire is to be given, filled with Powder, and raised from the ground,
lest the wet should take it, then must the Myne be rammed up close, that no vent
may proceed; the arching about will much strengthen it, and stay the reverse of the
powder. The manner how to discover a Myne, is in the discourse of Fortification.</p>

subjects <hi>(Viz.)</hi> Valour, and Obedience, being things

and beare the honourable name of a Souldier, well besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a generous person of that Noble qualitie; And as
in a great building there are severall Peeces fitted to such
places, as they shall be used in; The like course I intend
to take, to fit and shew every Souldier and Officer their duties, to fit them for the
weightie employments of warre;<note place="margin">Foure principles each Souldier should grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his worth on.</note> Wherefore they must ground their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

                           </gap>ng; First,
to shew their Magnanimitie and forwardnesse to the uttermost of their powers, to
the last breath and drop of bloud, in the defence of true Religion. Secondly, wee
are tyed in a strict bond of obedience, to seeke, gaine, preserve, and defend, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our King. Thirdly, we have all a share and reall interest in the defence of
our Countrey, our lives, lands, wives, children goods, which are as goades to prick
us forwards to trample upon all miseries, and to levell all oppositions that should
seeke the ruine of our Land. And fourthly, for the better performance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
principles; every man, of what degree and quality soever, must and ought
to be diligent, and carefull to learne the art of Warre; Whereby we may not only be
equall in skill and judgement to our Adversaries, but also to exceed and transcend
them, so that our Valour, Obedience, and Policy, may bee antidotes, sufficient to
qualifie, and reprocusse the venomous treacherie, and subtill actions of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
And to move people to be in love with this most necessary profession, let them
take notice how very meane men of birth, have beene laded with Honours and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
gained by their prowesse, and valiant performances, as <hi>Caius Mazzius, Valentin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Maximinus, Nicholas Pichinino,</hi> and divers others that were of base birth.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, let a Souldiers resolution be truly, and sincerely to serve God;
keeping a quiet conscience within their breast, which otherwise will gnaw at the
rootes of vallour, and undermine all resolutions, wherefore a just and righteous
conversation ought to be a Souldiers companion, for his life is daily in danger.</p>
                        <p>And for our obedience to our King and Officers, that are in authoritie under him,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18615:94"/>
we may learne even of the brutish Turke, as <hi>Pietro Bizari</hi> hath recorded in his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the marvellous obedience that those enumerable Armies, honour their God and
King withall, they being in their warfare so just and strict, that they would not
transgresse their Edicts in warre,<note place="margin">The obedient behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Turkes in their warres.</note> nor abuse one another, when their Armies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of 400000 Souldiers, yet not one of them durst transport a woman for his
delight, but contenting themselves with meane dyet, (as <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army did)
who in a Famine were constrained, throughout their Army to eate bread made of
Rootes and Herbes, they banisht Wine or any delicasie that might effeminate them;
And this mighty Army of the Turkes were so well governed, that no quarrells, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies,
nor distractions was ever seene, nor heard through the whole Army, but low
and soft speeches; Alwayes both evening and morning recommending themselves,
their safeties and prosperous successe of their actions to their God; The considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this should make us that are Christians, if not surpasse, yet equall them in such
laudable actions.</p>
                        <p>In a Souldier is required six speciall vertues,<note place="margin">Sixe speciall vertues required in a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</note> as namely obedience, which is a duty
both to God, and to Kings duly to be administred: and as a learned Gentleman hath
demonstrated Authoritie, in the resemblance of divers Pictures, as the principall in
authority, whose commission from God is very large, he is therefore pictured or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
amply and fully, from the crowne of the head, to the sole of the foot, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of his great Soveraigntie.</p>
                        <p>The next in authoritie is drawne but to the middle, his Commission being but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
having but part of authority.</p>
                        <p>The last is portrayed but with a face only,<note place="margin">An Illustration of Authoritie, by the draughts of Pictures.</note> or visage of a man drawne to the neck,
his commission being of the meanest extent; Yet all these, though they have not the
amplenesse that the principall Picture hath, yet they beare the face of it, and so
ought to be honoured and obeyed;<note place="margin">How Souldiers must be obedient to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>r Officers, bee they of never so low a degree.</note> So that Souldiers must be circumspect in obeying
all those that have but the face of authority, so farre as their Commission extends, in
as due and obsequious manner, as those in higher authoritie; for the meanest Officer
in a private Band, resembles the authority of the greatest Generall.</p>
                        <p>The next thing that is to be attributed to the honour of a Souldier, is silence, and
that is to be taken in a very large sence, but intending brevitie, I will be concise.</p>
                        <p>First, Souldiers are to be silent in the times of their exercise, that the words of
Command may be understood, which are delivered by their Officers.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they are to be silent upon their Guards and Watches, lest any Enemie
discover any thing by them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they are to be silent in the execution of any assaults, which are to be made
in the night, lest the Enemie discover the designe, and prevent it.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, they are to be silent, when Authority commands any one Regiment,
Division, or private Company in the Army, to give an assault, or onset, they are not
to murmure and cavill, as if they were the men appointed for the slaughter, as the
French-men did before the Citie of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> whereby the whole enterprize was
frustrated; But Souldiers ought rather to take it as the greatest honour to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon any onset; for indeed no wise man can thinke the Generall doth it upon a
spleene, in regard every Regiment, throwes the Dice upon the Drummes head, and
as his chance falls, so he is to take his fortune.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, a Souldier is to bee silent in all adversitie, as when penurie, Famine,
wounds, or if pay growes short (if the Generall cannot helpe it) these things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in an Army, every man ought to lay his hand on his mouth, and wisely to beare
the affliction and crosse, otherwise confusion would soone betide an Army, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by Duke Albert at the Siege of <hi>Ostend,</hi> he being in some wants, both of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and victuals, some few foule-mouthed fellowes, raised a Mutinie, so that 2000
of his Souldiers fled to the Enemie, and had like to have confounded his designes;
so that a Souldier in all his wayes and cariages, must have that ornament of silence
never wanting.</p>
                        <p>The next thing required in a Souldier, is to be secret in all his wayes and actions,
fearing lest he should disclose any thing which might bee advantagious to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
as many times when Souldiers have beene taken prisoners by the enemie, they
have out of a base cowardly feare revealed what they knew concerning the state of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18615:95"/>
their owne Army, which many times hath proved obnoxious unto them.</p>
                        <p>The next thing required in a Souldier is Sobriety, which is a vertue that makes
a Souldiers honour to shine most bright, and advanceth him into the stirrop of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for drunkennesse is such a Lethargy in a Souldier, which brings present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and death to himselfe, and utter ruine to a whole Army.</p>
                        <p>The next thing which should adorne a Souldier, is Hardinesse; and this is to be
taken in a double sense; <hi>viz.</hi> Hardy in manly carriages and performances, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
hardy to indure and undergoe any misery or paines that accompanies the
Warres.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, every Souldier is to be guirt with Truth and Loyalty; not onely to his
Prince, but to all in authority, even to the meanest in Office; this Truth is such a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and that it exceeds the capacity of man to discourse of it, it is such a precious
jewell, that neither promises, guifts, affections, nor hopes of preferment can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine;
and likewise no torments, threats, or miseries, are able to make Truth and
Loyalty change that unchangeable colour, which duty and affection hath dyed it in.
This makes Souldiers ever bound to obey the Commandements of Superiours, and
Superiours likewise are to love and imbrace such deserving Souldiers; And further,
if Souldiers desire to be prosperous and to attaine to honours, let them bee chaste
and honest in their living, refraining all sensuality, and avoyding all occasions which
might seduce them to that vice; for those that give themselves that base liberty, are
ever infected with cowardice, and are most fit to attend upon that lascivious Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> whose pastime it was to exercise himselfe with Queanes, in all base
postures of dalliance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hanibals</hi> Army, by wofull experience, knew what it was to be lulled in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of women, having beene Garrison'd but one Winter in that delicious Towne of
<hi>Capua,</hi> the edge of their valours, and their steely hardinesse, was softened to poore
base cowardly dispositions; so that <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> tooke his opportunity to
conquer them.</p>
                        <p>Further, Souldiers must be obedient in every respect unto those in authoritie
over them, although such Officers should bee infected with any notorious vice; as
very few but have beene blemisht in one kinde or other. As <hi>Cyrus</hi> was cruell, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
and miserable, yet obeyed and beloved of his Souldiers; in the same kinde
was <hi>Cambises</hi> and <hi>Marcus Cato;</hi> also <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> swomme in his Dallian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Gluttony, and Riotousnesse, yet his Souldiers would have suffered themselves
to have beene crucified, to have done him any gratefull service; and the reason was,
indeed his excellent way of Iustice, which he caused to bee administred duely and
dayly in his Army; this did worke upon his Souldiers more than his defects in vertue
could infect them. And indeed, it is very requisite for all Commanders to beware of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ill examples, and to be charie how they doe or speake any thing, that hath but
the shadow of unseemelinesse; For as one sayes well, <hi>Multa sunt honesta factu quae sunt
turpia visu;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Plato in lib. 1. de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gib.</note> There are three principall parts in the body of Man; wherein are lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the three principall powers of the Soule; Concupiscence in the Liver, Anger in
the Heart, and Reason in the Head, as being the Citadell; in like manner, there
are three severall vertues that doe command and governe them; Sobriety or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
to over-sway Concupiscence, Courage against Anger in the Heart, and
Wisedome in thinking and judging with reason.</p>
                        <p>But here I must take an occasion to speake of our Trained Souldiers, which are or
should be fitted for a defensive Warre; they doe not consider how deeply every
man is interessed in it, for if they did, our yeomandrie would not be so proud and
base to refuse to be taught, and to thinke it a shame to serve in their owne Armes,
and to understand the use of them; were they but sensible, that there is not the worth
of one peny in a Kingdome well secured, without the due use of Armes, and that
the Gospell, which is the Garland of our Kingdome, cannot prosper and flourish
but under the shadow of a sword: This should incourage all Gentlemen and Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to be forward in the practice of Martiall Discipline, I am certaine we can finde
times large and sufficient to negotiate trifles, and to hunt after our owne pleasures,
solacing our selves in vaine delights, which produceth naught but folly, and ends
in griefe; halfe that time, and charge so ill spent, would make us expert; and gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           <pb n="153" facs="tcp:18615:95"/>
us honour; for as one truly saith, that our times are consumed, either <hi>Male agendo,
Nihil agendo, vel Aliud agendo;</hi> either in doing naughtinesse, or nothing, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences;
and by this meanes the principall is neglected.</p>
                        <p>And because that people are ready to make their excuses, to be spared from ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in their Armes, either for their youth as being too young, or for their age, as
being too old; to decide this question, we will borrow the opinion of the ancient
Warriours, and as <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> one of the Consuls of <hi>Rome,</hi> instituted a decree
that none should be exercised in Armes under 17 yeares of age. Which questionlesse
is a fit time for the inition of young Souldiers, having more aged to sort with them,
for they prove the best and ablest Souldiers, that professe the use of Armes from
their youth.</p>
                        <p>And whereas some imbellicke fellowes holds the opinion that forty yeeres is
too late to receive them into the Warres, they are deceived: for a man is of ability to
doe good service at 50. yeeres and upwards. Besides, their wisedome and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are more setled; and indeed, your <hi>Romans</hi> would not admit of a Commander,
unlesse he were forty or fiftie yeares of age: But some may object, that nature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
in this last age, mens strengths are not as formerly they have beene? To this
I answer. That the world waxeth old, yet not in post-haste; although <hi>Sensim, &amp;
sine Sensu,</hi> it is soft and faire, and by degrees insensible; as in reading <hi>Hackwels</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
you may finde sufficient satisfaction to confute this Objection.</p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Crinitus</hi> in his Seventh Booke <hi>de Honesta Disciplina,</hi> reports of <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Varro;</hi> from the authority of <hi>Discorides,</hi> a great Astrologer: That the <hi>Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
who tooke especiall care by the imbalming of dead bodies, and by their witty
reasonings, found out how the utmost age of Man was confined, taking their esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
from the weight of the heart; which every yeare receives the increase of two
drammes, untill 50 yeares be expired; after which period, it decayes yeerely two
drammes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill fifty more be expired: So that by this, it should bee fond for any
man to pleade insufficiencie, unlesse at the least 50 yeares were past.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, we finde in <hi>Demosthenes;</hi> that the State being in danger, men of 45
yeares of Age and upwards, did tugge at the Oares; and certainly, a man at 50 and
upwards is of more sufficiencie to doe service, than youth at or under 17: As in
the second <hi>Punicke</hi> Warres they made choise of, as <hi>Livie</hi> reports; <hi>Tum decretum
vt Tribuni plebis ad populum ferrent, vt qui minores annis 17 Sacramento dixissent,
iis perinde stipendia precederunt, ac si 17 annorum aut majores milites facti essent;</hi>
It was decreed that the Tribunes should tell the people, that such as being under 17
yeares of Age, and had taken their military Oath, should in like sort receive their
pay, as if they had beene full 17 or past; but the hopefull age for performance, is
betweene 20, and 50 yeares, because strength, gravitie, wisedome, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
at such yeeres, hath a corrivall in managing the actions of men; King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the fourth, was Conquerour in 8 or 9 severall Battels, before he was 41 yeeres
old. Likewise, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, had in a manner conquered the known world,
at 33 yeeres of his Age.</p>
                        <p>I confesse, Nature is sooner perfect and ripe in some men, than in others; and
likewise, decayes sooner in some constitutions than in others; for if Strength be not
the comfort of Age, and Wit the grace of Strength; and Vertue the guide of Wit,
in all Souldiers, they are not to be allowed of, eyther young or old; for Stre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gth
without Wit is dangerous, Wit without Vertue hurtfull and pernicious; so likewise,
Age without Strength is but tedious. Therefore Commanders ought to be of a prime
judgement in making choise of such Souldiers as are likely to prove serviceable.
And in regard our Weapons are of a divers Nature, as Pike and Musquet; it is to
be observed, that Nature hath framed men fit in stature and qualities to use them
The tallest and ablest men, ought to be trained up to manage the Pike, the men of
meaner stature are to serve in Musquets; and to inable them the better, every man
from his youth should exercise themselves in manlike actions, which might make
them hardy, setling their joynts, and breeding strength; so that in a short time their
Armour and Weapons would seem very easie and light.</p>
                        <p>Likewise Souldiers must be very carefull to observe their Rankes and Files, and
especially in time of Battell, taking notice that upon all occasions they must make
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18615:96"/>
their Leaders place good, if he should chance to be slaine before him; for if the Front
of the Battell be not kept compleat, the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Likewise, no Officer nor Souldier ought to goe beyond his Commission, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a Conquest might ensue; the reason is, because none may trench upon the
jurisdiction of Authority, and also in regard, for the most part, a thousand times
more mischiefe may ensue than good possibly can, which made <hi>Posthumu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the execution of the victory, must be diligent in the execution; and not to fall
to pillaging, whereby the Enemy may take an opportunity to rally his broken forces
and overthrow you.</p>
                        <p>It were very good for Souldiers to practice all kinde of Weapons, and to bee
singuler in the use of them. Likewise Souldiers must be very perfect in the divers
beates of the Drumme; they ought to be very expert in swimming, by reason many
exploits are to be atchieved by it, and the lives of many Souldiers sav'd by it. They
should use themselves to carry heavie burthens, that they may bee the fitter to carry
provision in a March, and to carry earth up the Trenches without wearisomnesse;
for a Souldier must looke to be exposed to all manner of toyle, upon occasions of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
In consideration whereof, the worthy Commanders of ancient times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

choise of Country labouring fellowes to be their Souldiers, because they could indure
paines and hardinesse, rather than out of Cities and Townes, for such are fittest to be
Horsemen.</p>
                        <p>Souldiers are further to take notice, that in Garrison or in a setled Campe, their
duty is upon all occasions (not making any delay) at the sound of the Drumme, to
repaire to his Colours, with his compleate Armes be it to answer an Alarum, or to
releeve the Watch; where no Souldier, of what birth or degree soever, should not
take it in scorne, or hold it a disgrace to stand Sentinell, untill such time as hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
himselfe better; and then being a Gentleman of a Company, he must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to be instructed and taught by the meanest Officer; it must bee farre from any
Souldier to disobey any of his Officers precepts, and especially, such as are given
in charge by the higher Authority; neyther to contemne or slight the Martiall lawes,
lost death be his reward.</p>
                        <p>Souldiers must be very wary how they undervalue their Officers, especially their
Generall; or how they speake invectively, or reproachfully of any service or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
that hath not taken effect.</p>
                        <p>Souldiers must rather choose death then cowardly to runne from their colou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

neither must they have any converse with the enemy, either by speech, sending or

the Towne preserved, and kept; and what defences else hee in his wisdome shall
thinke necessary to be raised, the Garrison must indeavour to doe it; what out-Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
either of Horse or Foot, he sees sit to be placed upon places convenient for the
prevention of the enemies secret approaches, he must command it, and his Major
must see it executed, he is the chiefe judge in place of judicature, only assisted by
the chiefe Officers, who have each of them a voyce, and the Governours stands for
two; by which meanes a Malefactour is according to his demerit punished or freed,
according as most voyces shall agree upon; by his authority hee may commit the
chiefest Officer for any misdemenour, and cause him to be brought to his tryall. By
his care and wisedome all things are to be managed; his Major,<note place="margin">The office of the Maior of a Fort.</note> is his eye, mouth,

their duty; the Sentenells stand at their postures, the Ports well guarded, hee is to
receive no Troopes into the Fort, but first hee must goe to them with a sufficient
guard of Pikes and Musquets; he is to receive the patent from the Captaine of those
troopes, which if he findes it to be the Princes hand and Seale, he is immediatly to
acquaint the Governour withall, and by his permission to conduct them in; if there
be divers Companies, that Company which first enters the Towne hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence,
the rest inccessively in order, and so accordingly they are to take their

lest the Enemy should lye in ambush; the Ports being opened, the Squadrons are
brought thither to guard, there is one Sentinell to bee placed without the Ports at

last, are exposed to doe their duty in person, with their Companies; the other in

be in times and cases of Danger.</p>
                        <p>The Army being Encamped, the Colonels Lieutenant of each Regiment, who
beares the titular name of Captaine, takes place to be the first Captaine of the Watch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then successively according to the antiquity of the Captaine: Their watch is set af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same manner as it is in Garrison, onely no drumme is to beate neither for the
setting of the Watch at night, nor for the releeving of the Guards in the Morning,
untill the Drum-Majors drum beates, then all are to imitate him. The Captaine of
the Watch is to goe no further than the Limits of his owne quarters, where he is to
be attended with the Gentlemen of the round, and to take the Word, as before is
shewed; that Night his turne is to be Captaine of the Watch, the whole Company
is to watch upon some convenient place by the Brest-worke before their quarters.
The Serjeant-Major of each Regiment, Colonell, or Lieutenant Colonell, may
walke the limits of his owne Regiment. The Serjeant-Major Generall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

of each particular Regiment, is to give Billets to every Captaine, what guards
they shall keepe; then accordingly the whole Company is to march to those

Redouts, leaving their colours in the head of their quarters, which is to bee guarded
by certaine Senteries appointed out of the next Company, whose duty is also to guard
the quarters and Hutts, that no abuses bee committed. The Armes that the Captaine
and Ensigne beares with them is a Pike, and his Armour of proofe; hee is to set out
his Sentrye Perdues upon all passages; and likewise a Sentery within the Redout,
these are to bee relieved by the Serjant or other Officers every houre or two at the
most: That Company which shall come to relieve the Watch, must stand in their
compleate Armes, untill such times as their Senteryes bee plac't out and the Bridge
drawne up, least the Enemy should take an advantage to fall upon them when they
are in a confusion: To resist the Enemy in their worke, they are to place betwixt
each two Pikes a Musquet; Any of the chiefest Officers in high authority may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Guard from one Redout to another, and visit them at any season of the day or
night, and are to take the Word from the Captaine himselfe.</p>
                        <p>Every Souldier must bee very carefull of giving a false Alarum, because all the
whole Army will bee disturbed and presently in Armes: If the Enemy comes upon
the Sentry perdue, hee is to retreate to the next Sentry behind him, then if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
seeme many, they are to retreate into the Worke and prepare to give them a
Vallye: Those Horses that watch, must bee plac't to keepe some passage, they must
send out their Horse Centryes to stand upon some way (which the Enemy must
take,) their stations are to bee a quarter of a mile beyond the foot; the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

as one truely sayes, <hi>Lex est Sanctio, Sancta, Jubens honesta, prohibens contraria;</hi> had
wisdome beene the guide to those geare-braynd transgressours, they would have had
a respect to the end; whereas their fancie extended no farther then the begining;
for had they fixed one eye upon the act, which is both in the sight of God and man
detestable: and the other eye upon the consequence, which determines their owne
confusion; They would have prized obedience and loyalty, (although a severe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

all mortall infections that might betide a Kingdome either in Warre and Peace. But
as <hi>Salust:</hi> well observed, <hi>Illis quieta movere, magna merces videbatur;</hi> the basenesse
of people is such, that they thinke the very disturbances of things established to bee a

Kings would like such familiarity; though a wise Statesman may performe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                        <p>Divines distinguish obedience in a double respect, as filiall and legall, which holds
good in the dutie of a subject to his Soveraigne, or to such as he shall constitute over
us in the managing of publike affaires; and I hope none are so devoide of reason,
but will submit to what Soveraigntie shall lawfully injoyne, in regard punishment
attends in a readinesse to be put in execution. But those are a degree neerer, who
weare the true character of obedience wrapt up in a tender loving heart, fearing to
displease, because love injoynes them to obey; and the frownes of their Soveraigne
are like needles at their hearts ever pricking, untill the sunshine of his favour bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained.
This was the obedience and loyaltie the antient Romans honoured their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18615:100"/>
Senators withall, for their loves did flow in a freer current then their Lawes and
Edicts did injoyne; they were prodigall in bestowing their lives and goods (when

suffer a cruell death with his enemies; Further in the same Warres which the Romans
managed against the Carthaginians, by the unexpertnesse of the Generall their whole
Navy was overthrowne, yet the wonderfull love and loyaltie of the Commons,
freely demonstrating their sincerity and obedience (as a rule for Subjects in future
ages) at their owne proper costs and charges, built a new Fleete in all points fit for
service; I would this age wherein we live, were so mindfull of their loyalties and
obedience, and not to mutter and repine, when Authority justly commands such a
poore thing as an Annuall stipend for the setting forth a Navy, for the honour and
safetie of our Kingdome. The Netherlanders are to bee admired and commended,
for setting their loves afloate above their Lawes, daily tendering their lives and
goods, in doing their States service; they are so free from grumbling, or having
any seditious thoughts or actions, that even voluntarily they condescend to pay an
Impost out of their Meates and Drinkes, towards the maintenance of their Warres,
besides their patience in induring their goods many times taken, and their houses
ruined by Souldiers; they are so farre from repining, that they thinke all well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
that tends to the publike good; they banish desire, and will not acknowledge
it an act of their obedience, the property thereof being only to looke at things to
come, but rather ground their actions upon Love, which points at things present.
Wee can protest we desire his Majesties wants were supplyed; but where is the
love that should command our purse-string? I say no more, let every obstinate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
blush, and see if his desires without performance can command the advise
and costly Drugges from his learned Physitian, for the prevention of some eminent
sicknesse, which the Physitian by his wisedome and skill foresees, that without spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
prevention will prove an incurable destruction to his body; let him rest upon it
that hath a desire, that either his body or his estate should languish.</p>
                        <p>Let us but take a further survey of this dutie of obedience, and you shall find it
defective, where feare only bindes, and love doth not joyne with it; <hi>Triplex amor,</hi>
as Scholers define it; <hi>Emanans, imperatus, &amp; elicitus;</hi> Naturall love, all sensitive
creatures participate in, being led by an instinct to their objects, there being a kind
of necessitie inforcing; as the Pismires love and care is to provide in Summer against
Winter; Even so Man in the same kind guided by certaine reasons, is by love trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to his object. Commanding love is, when firme reasons demonstrate some
good thing fit to be beloved, and then our wills command us to affect the same; Free
love is when the affections makes choyce of some good thing of excellent qualitie,
freely; and in contemplation of the goodnesse and priviledges, that is thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
drives the spectators into admiration, and the circumstances that attend the
actions, and demeanours of the object, begets his free love, and the prosperitie and
welfare that it is possest withall, satisfieth the whole desires.</p>
                        <p>Naturall love, seekes only its owne profit; but that is not here meant, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in a Subject, when he loves his Prince, only for the quiet gaining or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
of gooods; in this a Prince is not really to returne love againe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, when a Subjects will and affections, commands love for by-respects,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is not to be respected, but utterly rejected.</p>
                        <p>The third kind of Love, is the true root from Whence Loyaltie and obedience
springs, and that is pure without by-aymes or ends, of an enargeticall and working
quality, ever seeking and working such things as may bring Honour and safetie to
their Prince and State; <hi>Nam anima magis est ubi amat, quam ubi animat;</hi> The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a Common-wealth, should take instructions from the Philosophers, who
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18615:100"/>
hold that the Parts love the beeing of the whole, better then it selfe; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the water being but the fourth part of the Elements, that the great World is
compounded of, ascends up to the ayre, that there should not be a <hi>Vaccuum</hi> or emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse
in the universe, for the Elements touch one the other, as may be further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a small-mouthed glasse, the water contrary to the nature of it, runneth up to
the ayre, as it is pouring out, that there may not be a voide place, it preferres the good
of the whole, to its owne proper Center; and so in the little world Man, when
occasion of danger is offered, the hand is ever ready to defend, and preserve the
head; Even so ready bent and prest, should every member of a body politique be, to
defend and preserve their Prince and State, and to administer such helps, as his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
require with a free consent: he being our head, and all in all to us, we should,
and are bound in dutie to hazard all for him; For if we consider the large commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Almighty God hath beene pleased to give to his Vice-Roys upon earth, and
in such a copious manner estated them in their thrones of Regencie, that the sonnes
of men never had the like priviledges, as may bee seene by the large Commission
granted to <hi>Moses,</hi> his chiefe, and Generall over his peculiar people, where God
commands him, to make him a Trumpet of silver, to assemble the people, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Campe;<note place="margin">Numb. 10. 12.</note> It was a thing of such great importance, that in the infancy of
the world, God himselfe did immediatly by his owne mouth assemble the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and directed them how, when, and where to incampe, limitting the times
of their removals; But after he had made choyce of a chiefe, to be his Generall over
the people; he committed his care, and his office of command over to <hi>Moses,</hi> and
left him ample power to goe in and out before his people, as formerly hee himselfe
had done, and to take and claime such priviledges as are due, from inferiours to a
Majestie: Which made our Saviour Christ very forward for examples sake, to worke
a Miracle, rather then he would stand in contention with <hi>Caesar,</hi> he would disburse
for himselfe and his friend, (although he might have pleaded his freedome, as being
a man free-borne, or might have claimed the due to himselfe, as being King of
Kings) but he well knew affaires of importancy belonging to a State, could not be
compassed without daily revenewes, this made him so willingly pay his tribute,
which the wisedome of <hi>Caesar</hi> had imposed upon his Subjects, for the securing of
his kingdome, and especially in times of warre: as our Saviour Christ drawing a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the chargeablenesse, and dangerousnesse of it, wished a King first to sit downe
and count, before he entertaines warre; Whether his power and abilitie, that is to be
understood, not only the quantitie of armed men, but the qualitie, to sustaine them
with; which is Money, Munition, and Victuals; and these are to bee derived from
the inferiour members; as they may well be paralelled to the rootes of a high sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Ceder, which drawes the sappe out from the earth, and by the influence of the
atractive rayes of Soveraigne authoritie, forceth it up to the head; so that both blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes
and fruit may insue; Without this neither Warre nor peace can be safely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged;

strength of their windy Oratory, moves the Sea of waves and billowes of common
people to inveigh and batter against their shores, and rocks of Authority, and to
their powers ready to submerge them; And this ariseth from the curiositie of divers
Subjects of our Litigious times; who strive to soare above their owne Spheare, to
peepe into the Arcanity of State affaires, and their fond and false commenting upon
the actions and passages of those in high Authority, and according to the fancie of
their distempered braines, shape to themselves improper Hyerogliphicks, whereby
they would demonstrate as on a stage, what Comedies or Tragedies are in their
weake judgements to ensue. These are to be likned unto unskilfull Astronomers,
that only have heard of the operation and influence of some Starres and Planets, and
in perusing their Almanacke finde some one to have the predominancy for that day,

                        <p>This age of the world hath hatcht such a strange Brood called Novelists; these are
alwayes possessing the braines of simple people, with such strange fixions, either
deifying some one man for deserts which they esteeme consonant to their mindes
and courses, or otherwise vilifying others, and detracting from their goodnesse and
worthes, making them a scorne, and rediculous to all such as shall joyne in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and favour such vituperating courses, that it is a wonder how those in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
should have a heart to beare such callumnyes, did not their wisedomes and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
passe by with a smile the simplicity of such creatures, although many times
their aspertions are credited, whereby men in high Government and authority are
by their meanes hated, and ill opinions and false censures alwayes opposing any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that shall be intended, or put in execution for a generall good, either in time of
peace or warre: For the nature of these Novelists is such, that those they cannot fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
let their actions be never so good, and politiquely carried for the publike wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
yet to them it shall be distastfull, they being cloathed with jelousie and suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

cruell reward which is returned as a recompence to those which these kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hate; <hi>Quem metuant oderunt, quem quisque odit pruiise experit:</hi> To verifie this I
shall need make choyce, but of one example still fresh in memorie, which will serve
to exemplifie and prove the truth of this discourse, and that is the Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham,
who once, none then living so highly in favour, and generally honoured
of the Cominalty, and especially at his returne from <hi>Spaine,</hi> with our gracious
King that now is, it was their whole discourse to magnifie him with their applauses
of his worth, wisedome, and fidelitie; but how suddenly those of the Corporation
of novelists had changed the wind of his true fame into a contrary quarter, blowing
their flie-blowes of aspersions and disgraces so fast upon him, that hee grew more
hatefull and odious in the same mens conceits, which formerly so highly honoured
him, (and yet for his owne particular the same man, and to his power endeavoured
to doe the same good for the Common-wealth which formerly he had done) so that
what designe soever the people conceived his finger to have but toucht, was by
them vilified, or some doubtfull various constructions made of it, which at length
grew to the heighth of censuring, that when those Foote forces which returned
from the Ile of Ree were to be quartered, and Billited in Townes, untill his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
pleasure was to dismisse them, or farther to have imployed them; the common
voyce was, it was the Dukes plot to detaine these forces, to take his occasion to side
with the Enemy, and so to ruine our Kingdome: and what base Libells and scuru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
songs were made of him? so that at last they did hate his very person, so that by
their callumnious reports, and invective inventions they had set on his shoulders
(according to the fiction in <hi>Ovid)</hi> another head, so that his owne friends and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
did not know him for their friend, but wrought their owne Masters death most
villanously by their wishes, which was acted by the cruell hand of a hellish Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to their contents; but let them put the gaines they purchast by his losse in their
eyes, and I beleeve they may still see, whilst he lived the Common-wealth fared not
the worse; I think none can be ignorant of the mischiefes and inconueniences
which are ingendred by these Monsters of impudent censurings, and bold scrutinies
of these Novelists, which they ingrosse to themselves to please their pallats of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
desire of newes, and then to gaine a popular applause, or to maintaine Table-talke
they retayle it out againe, either to the honour or disparagement of some one
or other, as they shall stand affected; or as the time, place, or occasion shall bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Reports soone workes upon the weaknesse of ignorant people, who are apt to
beleeve any thing, especially if it comes from one that hath a habit of seeming san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
and by such they will be drawne, and lead to any thing. These Hitrogeniall
courses either of Subjects or Souldiers used to those in Authority over them, makes
an Enemie rejoyce, they perceiving by such wayes and courses, their pathes are ev'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and swept; and at their pleasures they can shape their designes and projects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the distempers and humours of the time, sayling with full wind and tyde
unto the haven of their expectations; for mens fancies are like to surfeited bloud,
that what infection soever comes first, is most surely taken; and indeed an enemy
will not lose his opportunity to fish where the waters are troubled.</p>
                        <p>And as in the little Empire of the body naturall, the beginning of all motion is
from the head, having the Conjugation of all sinewes, and the architecture framed,
built, and fashioned with joynts fit for motion, and by a secret instinct and light of
Creation annexed to the head from whence the whole strength is produced; now if
any of these sinewes or joynts are shrunke or dislocated, it marres and hinders the
sudden motion of the whole frame, causing the limme where such a defect is, to bee
altogether unusefull, and much hindering the orderly worke of the rest of the
limbes, which would be more quicke and apt to helpe and defend the head; the
Magnanimous Eagle is easily surprized if but the least joynt of her wings be perisht.
This corrupting, putrifying, and dis-joynting the members of a Common-wealth,
hath beene a pollicy ever used by the Enemie, and hath afforded him more freedome

a poore Pistoll by a Horseman returning from Trayning, all the Church was in such
a strange uproare, every one running to hide himselfe; tearing the Ayre with their

their hast tumbled one over another, some running a Mile or two before they durst
looke backe.</p>
                        <p>Likewise some few yeares after in the same Church, at the running downe of
the waight of the Clocke (which made to their thinking a fearefull noyse) caused
such an uproare as if the Divell and a lease of Beares had beene amongst them: these
things plainely shewes the pusillanimity and imbellick constitution that Peace and
security, with the laciviousnesse of the times hath hatcht in them; it would have
beene hard for a Generall or Captain to have gotten these people to have made a stand,
and opposed the Enemy at push of Pike, if occasion had beene of the Enemies land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
A County might have been pillaged before they would have assumed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

weigh these things, it would make every man more forward in his contribution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the maintenance of the Navie, which must secure us from these panicke
feares.</p>
                        <p>The ancient Gaules accounted no man further worthy then to serve in the affaires
of the house, that was not publickly called and generally thought worthy and meete
to beare Armes; and being Armed before the generall Counsell, then hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
a Common-wealthes man, and fit to bee employed to doe his Country

How farre are wee dissenting from those, yet wee would bee accounted
good Common-wealths men; but wee must first leave our factious jarres and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
by which wee thinke to attribute to our selves the name of good Common-wealths
men; and as the Gaules did, betake our selves to the service of our King,
and the good and safety of our Countrey.</p>

                           <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes mention,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> that the youth in those dayes did use no other recreation,

that they would leape voluntarily being naked against swords and Iave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
opposed against them, wherein they had an Art to disarme their Enemies, and
defend themselves: Hee adds moreouer, that they would play upon such dangerous
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18615:103"/>
adventures, as would make a man blush to bee a spectator.</p>
                        <p>The Ancient Romans upon their Theaters, tutored up valiant young men in the
Art of Fencing; and when they grew expert and hardy, they were renowned with
the name of Gladiators, our Gentry and Yeomen are not of that mettall; for either
they through coveteousnesse, are adicted like Boares to roote up the earth, to scrape
base drosse together, (which they deifie as their god) or else they swimme in a more
dangerous streame of drunkenesse, and riotousnesse, which weakens both their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and estates, making them not fit to doe neither King nor Countrey service; for
it may truely bee sayd of those that sayle in these extreames, that they are ignorant
to what end they were borne into the World; which next their duty to God, they
are bound in all loyalty and obedience to doe their best service to their King and
Countrey; mens owne private ends ought to bee the last thing to bee thought
upon.</p>
                        <p>The Ancients in former ages were not acquainted with such basenes, as this Age

reason was, their Governours would not suffer any Wine to bee brought amongst
them;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Strab. lib. 3.</hi> of the Venet.</note> or any thing that tended unto delicacie; they held it for an infallible rule, that
such things would abate the courage of men: And <hi>Strabo</hi> further testifies, that <hi>Caenus</hi>
a grave wise Commander perswaded the Getes to plucke up their Vines, for feare of
effeminatizing their people;<note place="margin">Tacit. lib. 4. cap. 5.</note> they neither delighted in delicacies nor riches; as <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
speakes very nobly in the behalfe of the ancient Germanes; who so highly hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after honours, condemning base cankered wealth, that in their marriage circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
instead of a great dowry, the husband presented a yoake of Oxen; a Horse
furnished and fitted for service, a Target with a sword and Iavelin: The Virgin
likewise presented her beloved with some weapons of Warre, simbollizing that in all
perrills and dangers bee it either in peace or Warre they joyne to run in one fortune.
Our age is so farre from this, that although by Statute they are bound to finde Horse
and Armour, they will have trickes to shift it, or being compell'd, will borrow of
their Neighbours to blinde the eyes of authority; so that in a Troope of Horse of a
100, there is not 80 of these Horse their owne, which ought to bee employed for
the Kings service; were these people allotted their possessions, and yet bound to
finde Horse and Armour, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> testifies of <hi>Phaleas,</hi> the <hi>Calcedonian</hi> that hee
first published in the Common-wealth;<note place="margin">Aristot. lib. 4. de anim. cap. 6.</note> that all goods and chattells should be equally
divided, to the end that two principall plagues to mankinde (which are Riches, and
Poverty) might bee banisht their Cities.</p>
                        <p>The Warlike <hi>Germanes</hi> put this in execution, by a custome received amongst
themselves; as <hi>Caesar</hi> avoucheth in his sixt Booke of his Comentaries; that they had
no certaine measure of Land, nor any particular habitation limited them, but as the
Princes and Magistrates assigned every yeare unto particular kindreds aud Parenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
so much ground or Land, or such a Citie or scituation as unto them seemed best
and convenient, and the yeare following they were constrained to seek elsewhere: The
reasons of this used by the same Author, were first, least the people being retayned by
customed continuance, in one place they should bee out of love with the profession
of Armes, taking more delight in their beneficiall and pleasing courses of life: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
from the occasions of withdrawing their mindes from the inlargement of
their Territories: thirdly, least they should bee over curious in building and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselves from cold and heate, and so prove starke cowards: fourthly, least
a coveteous desire should arise amongst them, scraping and gathering goods together,
whereon customarily issues threats, dissensions, and bloud.</p>
                        <p>These inconveniencies former ages have beene reduc't unto, to deterre them
from effeminate courses, and were constrained for all their uncertaine meanes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
themselves with Horse and Armour for the Warres: Wee have our compleate
possessions from generation to generation defended by his Majesties Lawes; Yet
how grievous it is to divers men to have a just taxation of Moneys, Horse, or Armes
impos'd upon them; when they know without it, the Realme cannot bee secured.
Let any sensible man compare these our dayes with these precedent circumstances;
and let him judge what good service, or what loyalty and obedience may bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18615:103"/>
of a people, either meerly given over to sensuallity, or altogether begrumbled
with covetousnesse, for we are now growne to that height that wee make it an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of our faith; that the possessing of goods and enjoying of pleasure, is the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
bonum</hi> required.</p>
                        <p>When as the people of the Iewes, that God so highly delighted in; that he would
give kingdomes for their ransomes, and hedged them about with his favours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might have presumed to have lived in security: Yet it was the Almighties
pleasure so farre to weane them from their eager dispositions of fortifying themselves,
which they aymed at for their better security, that they might live uncontrolled, and
wallow in their pleasures, and some in their covetousnesse, voyd of feare of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
surprizalls; both their hands were commanded to bee employed, the one about
their daily and common affaires, the other was to mannage the sword: So that one
eye was employed about finishing and contriving their livelyhood; the other had
due respect to the Enemy to prevent and resist them upon the first view: Is our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more confident of a miraculous preservation, then they might have claym'd? I
rather beleeve the contrary, for it is just wee should suffer, if wee slight (as most of
us doe) both Gods precepts, and the commands of Authority which enjoyne us to
a due preparation and daily vigilancy, which now is generally disobeyed and sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the noyse of the Enemies Canon sounding so far off, neither as yet hath the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
played his part upon our Stage; so that wee shall feare like the Shepheard when
the Woolfe comes; indeed wee shall hardly gaine succour and resistance, in regard
the common people take all warnings but as mockes and scare-crowes, which by
these consequencies following may bee plainely seene.</p>
                        <p>First, in our refractory carriages, when Authority commands any service for
the gayning experience in the use of Armes, as namely our Musters; what murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
are breathed out for the expence and charge of a little Powder and Match, and
the losse of a dayes Worke.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, what boysterings and stomackings there is against Officers that shall
give true information of mens sufficiencie, when accordingly Armes by Authority
are imposed.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, what strange circustances are used to gaine freedome, and the posting
it over to another, happily farre insufficienter then himselfe.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, when necessity compells the finding of Armes; what fond delayes,
and slight excuses are set abroach to deferre the time; and in this they have a double
ayme: First, either that the dallying with time shall bee the meanes to bury it in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion,
or, Secondly, the removing themselves out of the division they conceive to
bee prevalent, untill notice bee taken of some other to amplifie the List: Others of
lesse rethoricke, take it to bee the cheapest way to borrow their Armes; so that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times one Horse or one Armour, is fitted to the service of divers bodies.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, those that are compleate in appearance, will hardly bee intreated to bee
tutored one third part of the day, but some one evasion or other is put in execution;
many times they are so brittle, that they can hardly endure the calling over, which
makes them so skilfull at the yeares end, that they can hardly distinguish a Rancke,
from a File.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, their backwardnesse and unwillingnesse in answering to the commands
of Authority, and many times some of them are altogether deficient both in their
Armes and appearance, and usually all or the greater part will borrow two or three
houres of the set time, before they come to the place where they are to bee called o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
that dayes worke above all other is so tedious, that they desire onely to trifle it
to an end.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, a base scorning and inveterate hating of such Officers as have a desire
to take paines with them, in exercising them and shewing them their postures, and
causing them to bring in compleate Armes.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, the negligent and beastly keeping of their Armes, that hardly halfe the
Armes of the Band are fitted as they should bee for a present use, but altogether defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and making any trash serve to passe the Muster, not regarding future services:
In all these particular faults, our Horsemen are guilty of, and may blush for their
shamefull abuses to King and State; and in one thing they s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rpasse our Foot-troopes,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18615:104"/>
and that is the employing of such Horses as are sequestred from common rurall uses,
and onely appropriated to the Kings service; they instead of riding them and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them for the Warre, set them to Plow and Cart, or to performe some journeys
either in a Coach or otherwise; or rather more absurdly make a Cart-horse or Coach-horse
serve to beare the great Sadle, which they thinke sufficient to blinde the eyes
of Authority; should there bee any suddaine use that our forces should stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with an Enemy, I feare wee shall fall short of what is to bee expected.</p>
                        <p>And although these defects may seeme but as a shadow to such points of disloyalty
and disobedience, as formerly wee have discourst of; yet these defects argue and
savour of stupid security, and a base undervalluing esteeme of the use of Armes, which
all Nations doe most highly honour and esteeme, as the meanes for safety of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
the preserver of Lawes, and above all, the preserver and defender of Gods
Gospell, which without it, would soone bee dasht under feet, and a confusion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
our Realme: Therefore let us endeavour to amend what hath beene amisse,
and in all dutifull obedience follow such directions as Authority shall prescribe, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
our owne ends, and every day furnishing and fitting our selves to the largest
extent of our abilities and powers to doe our God, King, and Country the faithfullest,
and best service wee possibly may, and that willingly, and with a delight; for this
end wee were first borne, as was truely veryfied by <hi>Pompeius Magnus</hi> that famous
Commander, hee having shipt his men, and ready furnisht them with Victualls and
Munition for the reliefe of the City of Rome, which was then by the Enemy besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and in great distresse: In the interim, a wonderfull tempest of Winde, Raine,
Thunder, and Lightning arose, so that nothing but ruine to him could bee expected;
his friends and Souldiers besought him not to venter his life and the Navies losse;
Hee returned this noble answer, I am borne to obey Authority; <hi>Et necesse est ut
eam, non ut vivam:</hi> Hee knew the Rules and Edicts of Soveraigne Authority were
not to bee deferred, but hee tooke them as his Card to steere his course of loyalty and
obedience by.</p>
                        <p>If wee should but draw examples of obedience from the Creatures, and observe
how in all things they stand conformable and obedient to the Lawes of Nature;
How the great unruly Ocean observes the course of the Moone in bringing in her
tides: The Massie earth waites the time and pleasure of the Sunnes revolution, to
yeild up the fruit and hidden treasures contained in her bowells to the uttermost of
her power: All Creatures both Vegetative and Sensitive, are precise and ready bent in
all obedience when Nature enjoynes; And yet Man a Rationall Creature most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
and hetrogeniall in his duty, loyalty and obedience to his Superiours, which
Nature doth not onely challenge as a right, but God claimes it as a due: And how
siily and foolish are men above all other Creatures in making provision for their safety
there is no Creature but Nature hath armed it with some defensive weapon, not so
much but the poore Bee hath his Pike, which most valiantly and skilfully hee can use
for his defence and preservation: But the times wee live in are such, that wee have
neither will nor skill; but we referre all to a generall Providence, thinking it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
if they be roughcast with riches and prosperity: and the liberty and peace which

                        <p>It was partly seene and tried at the Isle of Ree in France at the Siege of Rochell,
and although our English had beene some short time tutured and exercised under the
banners of Mars; yet the right valiant and judicious Captaines had no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of them in the time of need, when the tryall of their obedience, skill, and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
should have beene brocht, then of a Herd of Deere: For all they saw by flight
there was no safety but eminent destruction, yet they could not bee perswaded to
make an honourable resistance, whereby they might either have freed themselves, or
have died like men with their faces towards the Enemy: Now judge you, if such
cowardly basenesse was found in those that scorned to give their heads for the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

being the prime spirits of our Kingdome, we cannot but expect worse of these
here behind remaining, which will fall short many bowes length of their worth,
(if we doe not flatter our selues) for they will find warre a wearisome stage where
Souldiers must play their parts against their wills; for truly it may bee said of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that are unexercised, and know the Warres but by heare-say: <hi>quod valentes sunt,
&amp; prevalent ante pericula, in ipsis tamen periculis discedunt;</hi> They have ability enough
and to spare, untill danger appeares; but when perill indeed comes, they get them

In every Battell, skill and practice doth more towards the victory, then multitudes
and rude audacity. But certainly our age is possest that an Enemy will dare at our
brave cariages and gay cloathes, as the Larke doth at the Hobby, untill they beate
them downe with their bolts. Let such make tryall that please, it will prove but
<hi>Dulce bellum inexpertus.</hi> Matters not usefull prove inductions to terrour; for there

soule, being not sensible of the event, as the Imbellicke Pesant quakes at the report of
a Musquet at his first hearing of it. The third dejects the spirits being voide of all
hopes, either of evasion or defence, much lesse of conquering; Therefore lest wee
should make our Enemies more terrible to us then indeed they can bee, let us daily
expect them, that when they come we may not be to seeke how to expulse them.</p>

of the Faculties of the irascible parts to a mature Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with Reason, Iudgement being the principall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
and Resolution the Modell that turnes all the
Wheeles, both of Invention and execution, which makes
a man truly valiant, to undertake without rashnesse, and
to performe without feare, bearing downe dangers with
a loftie courage, trampling on them with successe; it
makes a Souldier looke Death in the face, and passe by it
with a smile; it makes him afraid of nothing, but to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by feare, desiring rather to have his bloud seen, then his back; it makes a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
disdaine life upon all base conditions; Making him prodigall of his bloud, when
God, his King and Countrey shall command it; His boldnesse proceedeth neither
from Ignorance nor senslesnesse; But first he values the danger, and then disdaines
it, having his feares least, when perills are greatest; His Magnanimous mind scornes
flatteries, esteeming such as Flyes blowing corruption upon sweet vertues; he hates
to feed his spirits upon the fulsomnesse of surfeiting ease; his confidence keepes him
safe, and his unapaled lookes doth daunt a base attempter; it is more prevalent then
<hi>Briareus</hi> with his hundred hands, and more potent then <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaure, whose
strength and wisedome was matchlesse; Valour hath double oddes of a fearefull
Coward, for the undaunted carriage of a valiant man, drives feare up to the hilts in a
Cowards heart, so that he hath no ability left to offend his enemy, or defend himselfe;
This makes victory so easily gaind, for the spirits of a Coward are so retired, and
pent up with anguish and distresse, being wrapt up with feare of the approaching
evill, and dispayring of his fortitude to avoide it, that there is hardly strength left
to make the least resistance; whereby Valour takes his advantage to atchieve his
Honourable ends without much trouble, and lesse danger; for as boldnesse fortifies
the passions of the soule against the greatest miseries which are most difficult to be
avoided, and incourageth it to pursue Honourable atchievements that are most hard
to obtaine; so many times fearefull cowardize doth wannesse in it selfe its strength
failing; many times fearing that which is not to be feared; having only but a shew
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18615:105"/>
of danger, <hi>Saepius opinione laboramus quam re,</hi> Many times more troubled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with conceits then the thing it selfe. A Cowards eye is of the nature of an
augmentation glasse, dilating a small danger, and causing it to appeare tenne times
greater then the accident can be; whereas Valour accordeth with the deminution
glasse, contracting the dimentions of perils into so smal an Image, that they appeare as
shadowes. In a poore faint leaden spirit there are foure kindes of feare that undermine
the Heart; first a naturall feare, whereby every thing shunnes the destruction of it
selfe, and this is most proper in beasts. Secondly humane, which ariseth of too much
desire of this life. Thirdly a base worldly feare, when a man despaires to hazard the
losse of goods and credit. Fourthly, a stinking servile disposition which causeth a
feare of receiving wounds and death; any one of these is able to subvert the whole
fabrick of Valour. That warlike <hi>Caesar</hi> was free from the least tincture of any of
these feares, when his boyling worth in the middest of eminent perils, cheared up
his Souldiers and Mariners, and banisht their feares with the comfortable words that
<hi>Caesar</hi> and his fortunes were aboard: Hee was very expert in the opperations
of conceits, and passions of the minde upon the body; He being a warlike Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian
(in the prescription of Regiments to his fearfull Souldiers) he did alwayes
consider <hi>Accidentia animi</hi> to be of greatest force to further or hinder the atchieving
of Victory and fortune; for questionlesse imagination is prevalent in altering the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and spirits of the imaginant, having a manifest power to hurt, deject, and
weaken, the opperation of the spirits; so that there is to be observed an art in warre,
and to be used to coroborate, and strengthen the imagination, that they may like the
Loadstone, fix their conceits upon nothing but honours, victory and riches, which
elevates the spirits into a majestick Spheare.</p>
                        <p>There is a great deale of difference betweene a naturall inbred hardinesse, and a
soffisticated valour; a silly sheepe may be made, managed, and tuter'd, to oppose and
use violence to a dogge, but when the victory comes to competition, the wing is
preferred before the claw, whereas in a Lyon his naturall inbred magnanimitie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be altered, without the bereaving of life. The subject of Warre is variable, and
is only judged by the successe and event; Whereas other Arts and Sciences are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by acts, as the Pilot is judged by directing his course aright, and not by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the voyage; it is otherwise with valour, for that may have an aspertion of
timerosity, and taxed with indiscreet judgement, when the event is not answerable
to the acts performed, when as Imbellick fellowes may stumble on a victory by some
strange accident, when neither art nor courage did attend them, which by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and credulity of men shall be highly esteemed, as may bee manifested by the
overthrow of the Duke of <hi>Brunswickes</hi> Army, who were knowne to bee very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
and had so declared and manifested themselves in divers bloudy skirmishes, and
principally in a battell fought against Seignior <hi>Tilly,</hi> where he had all the advantage
both in force and place, yet most valiantly the Duke forced a way thorow the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Army; the greatest losse to himselfe was only the losse of his hand; yet these
brave Souldiers not long after were routed and ruined, by a few base countrey Bores
joyned with a few Souldiers which were privatly drawne out of the adjacent
Townes, to hinder the Enemies pillaging; these in the dead time of the night found
sufficient advantage to set their base mettall a worke, the Brunswickians being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
quartered (and their guards neglected) upon a plaine neere <hi>Brafford</hi> in <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland,</hi>
so as the divisions could not have the priviledge to draw themselves into
order of Battell to make their resistance, for I dare then say those Grollians and Bores
would have fled at the first charge, like Sheepe from Wolves.</p>
                        <p>True valour is of the nature of perfect coyne which goes currant in all places
without contradiction, and dares indure the touchstone, when as seeming hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
like base mettall will not indure the tryall, nor passe currant in valuation, yet
happily it may to the view seeme very splendant, as courage raised by the spirits of
Wine, may seeme more headstrong and violent (as one truly tearmes it a madnesse,
or a worth out of the wits) then the true valour which goes upon the feet of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and resolution, yet it will be nipt in the bud, and fall before the fruit be mature;
when as true hardy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them not; <hi>Neglecto periculo iminentis mali opus ipsum quantumvis difficile agrediuntur;</hi>

They goe about the businesse it selfe, how hard soever it be, although they consider
the danger with the mischiefe over their heads it may probably bring, which would
distract a Coward.</p>
                        <p>A Souldier must be so qualified, that adversity must not lessen his courage, nor
prosperity his circumspection; our English in former Ages, have beene esteemed
the best tempered mettals, transcending other Nations of the world for true valour,
and expertnesse in the use of Armes; whereby they have atchieved great victories:
as in the Battell of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where the French had all advantage against the <hi>Blacke-Prince,</hi>
both in number, force, shew, Country and conceit, with the chiefe strength
of the Horse of his Kingdome, which were esteemed the best in <hi>Europe,</hi> assisted with
the greatest and wisest Captaines of his Realme, so that the <hi>French</hi> Army consisted of
40000. men well appointed, and expert Warriours, nothing wanting in them; but
the golden spirits of our English, whose Army consisted but of 8000. men, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the French Army, and tooke their King Prisoner.</p>
                        <p>The like difference of worth in Souldiers, was manifestly seene at the Battaile
fought by the Estates of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the Archdukes forces, neare <hi>Newport</hi>
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where our English did workes of Supererogation, by the prudency
and valour of the <hi>Veres,</hi> with a handfull of disbanded men, routed the Battalia's
of the Enemy, and redeemed the victory lost of their owne side, snatching it out of
their Enemies hands, when in the judgement of all men it was lost. And that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
animosity and courage of a poore handfull of Souldiers, which attended
<hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> in his junenesse unto the Warres which he intended in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!</hi>
after the sacking of divers Townes there, he marcht with his Army to the Gates
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and entering a breach in the Wall, drove the inhabitants to such perplexities,
that the Pope gladly condiscended to any conditions which they should propound;
so as the World did admire their valour, wondring to see that no opposition could
withstand their warlike hands; so that Kingdomes trembled to see with what faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
they suodued in all places.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alphonso</hi> understanding this Army approacht neere <hi>Naples,</hi> feare so farre possest
him, that he crowned his Sonne <hi>Ferand,</hi> thinking that he more valiantly would have
defended his Country; for his owne security he fled into <hi>Sicily,</hi> being indeed toucht
in his conscience, for his abhominable wickednesse: but no sooner were the <hi>French</hi>
arrived at the Ports of <hi>Naples,</hi> but the sheepish <hi>Neopolitans</hi> durst not once offer a
repulse, but yeelded themselves with their Kingdome to his mercy, where he was
crowned King of <hi>Naples.</hi> By these examples we may see the wonderfull difference
betwixt an inbred naturall valour, and a forc'd made hardinesse.</p>
                        <p>As there is a vertue in the Load-stone to draw Iron or Steele to it, the vertue
not extending to other mettals; of the same nature is Valour, which in a valiant
Commander, will draw all his Captaines, Officers, and common-Souldiers, to step
the same paces to gaine honour and renowne; so that they will follow him in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
attempts, if they have the least graine of steele in them; which being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all the policy in the world is in vaine to seduce or draw them to any performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but like Leade (before other mettals) when it comes to the fire of tryall, will
soonest melt and runne.</p>
                        <p>As much may be sayd of an Effeminate Commander, whose mettall is no better,
than the Minerall which <hi>Saturne</hi> ingenders; if he be infected with the Pestilent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
of Cowardise, all his Souldiers under his command will soone be infected, and
participate in his running fore, before his begin to rise; Souldiers are very supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
dreaming there is more worth and wisedome in a Commander, than many
times is found; and when they perceive timerosity, doubts, and no apt performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in him, they conceit some strange effects are approaching, that may tend to their
confusion; and so like valiant Cravens, bethinke themselves best how to be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
reposing more confidence in one paire of Wings, than in two paire of clawes;

of the strange effects that the worth of a Commander begets in a Souldier, and what
poore Spirits and agast countenances are bred by the sickly courages of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;

a suddaine violent Tempest, which forc'd the Turkes Generall to remove his
Galleyes to a place of more safety.</p>
                        <p>The like pusillanimity was found in King <hi>Etheldred,</hi> who in the yeare 978.
swayed the Scepter in this Kingdome, being invaded by <hi>Swayne</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi>

the speediest way into <hi>Normandy,</hi> leaving his Subjects to the mercy of the
<hi>Danish</hi> King, who tyrannized over them untill his death. In all the passages of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Affaires, I have onely observed three severall passages, whereby valiant men
have beene subdued.</p>
                        <p>The first may bee sayd miraculously, as when God is seene plainely and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee the Author of a Conquest by a secondary meanes of lesse worth and power
used; and that is most usually, when God and his Glory is interressed in it: as in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, the overthrow of <hi>Goliah</hi> a man of mighty strength and valour, by
<hi>David</hi> although valiant, yet a Childe in comparison to the Gyant: (for valour and
strength must have a cerrivall to make a man compleate) Also the overthrow of King
<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who had ever beene victorious against their Enemies: Yet the
Almighty being at ods with them for their rebellions, in not performing execution
against <hi>Agag,</hi> they were subdued by their Enemies; yet <hi>David</hi> stiles them (in his
Lamentations for them) valiant men.</p>
                        <p>Also <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> the Emperour making Warre against the <hi>Quadi,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Xiphilinus.</note> being a
Warlicke people that inhabited Silesia; who by their worthes and policies had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Emperours Army in such a straight, the mountaines invironing them on the
one side, and the <hi>Quadi</hi> ready to give battell in their teeth; And as calamities sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
walke alone, the season of the yeare was very hot, and infinitely dry; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
being ready to compound his safety with his Enemy rather then hazard all,
feare had taken such possession of him and his Army: being in this deepe agony, a
certaine Captaine presents himselfe, letting the Emperour understand that hee had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Millitents, meaning Christians, which by their prayers to their God could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
victory, for whose sakes God was pleased to interest himselfe in this conquest,
by sending a miraculous Thunder and Haile, which so beate in their Enemies faces,
that they with ease vanquisht them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Valiant Commanders may bee foyled by their owne presumption; it
being a domesticke traytor which attends the ruine to valour, and so neere allied to
it, that it's hard to bee seperated, and many times it doth trayne and usher forth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
upon extraordinary disadvantages, or blindes it with a superstitious remissenesse
and loosenesse, in suggesting and acting such things as should bee requisite for safety;
abandoning all such rules and meanes as might tend to preservation and furtherance
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18615:107"/>
in their designes, making meere naked valour the Rocke to ground their confidence
upon, as in the Battell betweene <hi>L. Silla</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> against <hi>Archelans</hi> Generall
to <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> whose Army consisted of 120000 Souldiers, these
reposing their confidence in their valours, and great multitudes of men, having an
over-weening presumption of their owne strengths and deserts, caused them to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
such courses and advantages as might have beene prevalent to a victorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
whereby <hi>L. Silla</hi> tooke an occasion to give them an overthrow with the losse
but of fourteene of his owne men; But <hi>Archelans</hi> paying for his presumption the
lives of 2000 of his valiantest youths.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, as we have discovered Valour to be of too high a temper, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with presumption; so likewise when it is of too soft a temper being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with feare, as in Instruments of Steele, that which is absolutly Steele, and
of too high a temper, is of hardnesse sufficient to file in peeces any Mettall of a sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
temper, only it is brittle and subject to breake through its owne hardnesse; So
that Sword that is partly Steele, and partly Iron, so farre as the Steele is in it, and of
a true temper it will indure the stroake, and will give no more way, but equally to
that which is all Steele, but when the Steele is chopt, and hackt through to
the Iron, then that which is all Steele, soone destroyes and cuts through the softer
Mettall; accordingly when two valours meet in opposition, happily both sides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
the brunt a long time, so farre as strength and worth will give way, but being
cut and worne to the quicke, the tempered edge is taken off, and a softer mettall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
which is soone fretted asunder by the true tempered weapon, that hath not
that quantity of Iron in it to soften it; So that that Army which indures the assault
longest, is most sure of the victory; so that too hard is better then too soft, but the
golden meane betwixt them is the best temper of all, which is tough and apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any hardship that shall be opposed; as that famous Battell fought for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
betweene King <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, their Mettals were so
neere of a temper, and so truly tempered, that the victory was uncertaine which side
it would favour, untill the edge of the English valours was worne through by the
ominous death of King <hi>Harold,</hi> then their courages grew so soft and poore, that the
hardy <hi>Normans</hi> destroyed them like Grashoppers.</p>
                        <p>It was farre otherwise with the true mettalled <hi>Swedes,</hi> although the Emperours
Army had deeply worne into them, by seeking to blunt their edges by the slaughter
of the most valiant King <hi>Gustavus;</hi> Yet in regard there was nothing but true tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
mettall remaining, they indured the force of their Enemies opposition, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
their greatest onsets and assaults, they were predominant over their enemies,
standing to their tackling untill they had consumed their foes; Thus you see the two
ill tempers (as before I have said) which attends fortitude is feare and rashnesse;
The golden meane betweene these two, is only to be chosen by a Souldier; this is a
path so difficult to walke in, that few there are but erres; As one compares this
meane to the roofe of a Church, on whose top there is scarse roome to turne a foot
upon, but on either side a broad rode to ruine, if once falling, the stay is rare, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
miraculous.</p>
                        <p>There are sundry opinions argued betweene Valour and Pollicie, some are opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
that policie transcends valour, having a respect to the speach of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Achimedes,</hi> who saying of himselfe that hee could conquer more with his
gowne in his studie (meaning his studious way of contriving of Politicke plots)
then all his Enemies could performe in the field by their valours; others hold Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of most force, comparing it to the Saltpeeter in gun-powder which is irresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and Policy to the Gunne, which being not charged with this spirit of Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeter,
it cannot of it selfe be prevalent; but from both these ariseth a third thing
which effects all, and that is the Bullet; Wherefore Valour and Policie must goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably
together for the effecting of any matter of consequence; For the policie
which <hi>Iudith</hi> had contrived within the Citie for the destruction of <hi>Holofer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In a valiant Souldier there are two things required to make him able to sustaine
so honourable a weighty burthen; First, a love to the Warres; Secondly, a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mind to beare any misery, that the fortune of the Warres may reduce him unto;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18615:107"/>
hee that hath a love to follow the Warres, takes a pleasure and delight in it, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
from the sweetnesse of the object, which is honour and riches; All the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a mans soule depend upon pleasure or paine, which ariseth from contentment
or distaste received from the object; Contentment is a firme prop to sustaine a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
in the bloudiest Warres, after the love of that profession hath invited him to the
managing of Armes; and unlesse a Souldier keepes these two companions close to
him in his Warlike progresse, the stampe of Mars will soone bee eaten out; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
content bee of an excellent vertue to qualifie a Souldiers disposition in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of griefe and misery, yet there was never any but had some occasion of griefe
betyded him, Warre having so many alterations and suddaine changes attending
the issue of it: But however it beares him up by the chinne from sincking
into a muddy sadnesse,<note place="margin">The definition of griefe and sadnesse.</note> which is a base humour properly hanging about the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
which heavies and dulls the spirits, and extends to evills past, present, and
to come, following the understanding which comprehendeth all these times.</p>
                        <p>There are three kindes of this blemish of valour which a Souldier should not once
communicate with:<note place="margin">Three kindes of sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which blemish the valour of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</note> The first is a sadnesse which ariseth as Schollers define it, <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rationis Imperium,</hi> besides the command of reason; as motions suddenly eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
into the affections, doe surprize a man.</p>
                        <p>Secondly there is a sadnesse, <hi>Erga judicium rationis</hi> against the judgement of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and this subdueth reason for a while.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, there is a sadnesse, <hi>Secundum Imperium rationis,</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of reason, for his reason commands to be sad: These sadnesses dimme the
bright spirits that should enlighten a Souldiers actions; and as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Tristitia
turbans non est in sapiente,</hi> Although sadnesse may trouble a wise man, yet it perturbs
him not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Comines</hi> makes mention of a noble Family knowne by the names of the <hi>Laylands</hi>
in France,<note place="margin">Philip de Comines.</note> who held the Warres in such high estimation and love, and received such
joyfull content in them, that divers generations of them spent their bloud and lives
in their Majesties service, so that scarse one of them but died in some honourable
attempt.</p>
                        <p>Also <hi>Verticus,</hi> a chiefe Commander over the Rhemi, whose worth neither Warre
nor age, could consume or blemish, having alwaies borne a love, and taken content
in that honourable profession; that even in his decreped age being hardly able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stride
a Horse, hee would not consent that any Battell should bee fought in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                        <p>Of the same disposition was <hi>Camilogenus</hi> a noted Souldier amongst the <hi>Alerci,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Treasury of time.</note>
hee could not be importun'd to favour his aged body and to bid the Warre adue, but
returned this answer; that although his strength fayled, yet his judgement and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

                        <p>Also <hi>Strabo</hi> makes mention of certaine Frenchmen which were taken prisoners;
<hi>Alexander</hi> taking a survey of their manly dispositions and carriages;<note place="margin">Strabo. lib. 7.</note> demanded of
them if they were not fearefull in the Warres, and what it was they most feared;
they returned unto him this peremtory answer, (wee, sayd they) feare nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Heavens should fall on our heads.</p>
                        <p>Times haue wonderfully altered those noble conditions which former ages haue bin
indued withall; for in this age wee fall short, (being altogether effeminiz'd, and for
want of exercise and experience) even of divers feminine Sexes, whose worthes
are recorded in history for our learning and imitation, and to their immortall praise.
As first the Warlike <hi>Amazons,</hi> after their chiefe Leaders <hi>Plinos,</hi> and <hi>Scholpythus</hi>

<hi>Capadocia;</hi> their Wives with the rest of the feminine Sex, being possest with griefe
and feare which bred desperatenesse in them; like Beares ravisht of their Whelpes,
they pluckt up their mad desperate spirits, making choise of <hi>Lampedo</hi> and <hi>Marpetia</hi>
for their Conductors, who furiously set upon the conquerours, and in battell over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
them, and afterwards wonderfully inlarged their dominions.</p>
                        <p>After this <hi>Hippollite</hi> and <hi>Menalippe</hi> challenged the single Combate of <hi>Hercules</hi>
and <hi>Theseus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Likewise <hi>Penthesilea</hi> assisted <hi>Priam</hi> King of Troy with a brave troope of Virgins;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18615:108"/>
the valour of these Feminines was growne to that height, that they scorned their
male kinde which proceeded out of their owne loynes, banishing them their socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
and onely chose to trayne up the Females in the feates of Warre; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
divers Warlike weapons, that the lubberly Males were not capable of the use
of them.</p>
                        <p>Further, in the Province of <hi>Palmira</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> lived a famous Governesse named
<hi>Zenobla;</hi> being of such worth that shee stood in contestation with <hi>Gallienus</hi> for the
Empire of the World, She swayed all the Easterne parts.</p>
                        <p>Also the unconquered spirit of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> who led in her Army 100000 Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
of Warre, three Millions of Foot, and halfe a Million of Horse: She subdued
the Ethiopians, the Indians; and She having re-edified Babylon, newes was brought
her (as shee was playting her haire) of the revolt of this Towne; whereupon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her haire halfe undrest, shoe went and besieged it, never ordering the rest of her
haire untill shee had againe recovered it.</p>
                        <p>And our late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory may be a patterne to the world
for her true worth and undaunted spirit, She managing both her forraigne and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticke
affaires beyond the capacity of man to conceive, that the World admired
her high temper: Which was well seene in 88, with what a brave undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and heroyicke spirit of resolution, shee comforted, her Subjects in their feares
and eminent dangers: The consideration of these unmatclesse spirits might beget
worth in our effeminate age, to drown our childish spirits in their seas of valour, or
cause us to imitate the worthes and valours of former Ages, who pluckt out their
Calvish hearts and infused the spirits of Lions into themselves, whereby they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht
deeds which merrited wonder; and the rather the more to bee admired
because of their meane breeding and simple parentage which could not afford them
education; As we finde it recorded in holy Writ, <hi>David, Saul, Gideon</hi> of meane
parentage brought up in rurall affaires; one keeping Sheepe, the other Asses, the
last with his Flayle; yet when they assumed the countenance and spirits of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
what wonders they wrought, and with what honours were they dignified;
the dangerous't enterprises that ever happened in their times they feared not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
which was the stirrope that elevated them into there Thrones of highest
dignity.</p>
                        <p>Likewise we finde in Histories, what admirable parts men of meane parentage
have attained unto, and what Warlike wonders they have wrought; As <hi>Achilles</hi>
the Sonne of <hi>Aeacus,</hi> was a long time hid under the garments of a Woman amongst
the daughters of <hi>Licomedes;</hi> yet afterwards his spirit aspired so high, that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the <hi>Trojans</hi> greatnesse, and overthrew their Citty from the toppe to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Galerius Maximianus</hi> borne and bred up basely; wherefore he was termed
<hi>Armentarius,</hi> because hee was a Neat-heards Sonne: hee grew very fortunate in
the Warres, being indued with great valour and courage, was after for his deserts
made Emperour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iustia</hi> was first a Swine-heard, afterwards a Cow-heard, next a Carpenter, a
common Souldier, a Captaine, and by his conquests which he obtained by his valour
was made Emperour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pompienus Maximus</hi> Sonne to a Smith, gave himselfe to vertue, and Millitary
services, proving fortunate against the Polonians and Germanes in divers valiant
Conquests, was after created Emperour of Italy.</p>
                        <p>Also <hi>Maximinus</hi> a silly Shepheard, at his first inition into the Warres, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himselfe so honourably, that he was by the Souldiers made Emperour.</p>
                        <p>It is wonderfull remarkable what strange adventures the worth and valour of
men have spurred them unto, to undertake for their Countryes good, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
honours: It were worth the observation, if one of a thousand in these our
dayes would endeavour to performe the like, either for their private or popular good;
As the <hi>Phileni</hi> did for the Carthagenians,<note place="margin">Heylin.</note> who were in controversie with the Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
about the bounds of their Territories: They being willing to end the quarrell,
chose certaine men of either City that should set out at one instant, and where they
met, there the confines should determine; These <hi>Phileni</hi> being swift of foot, got farre
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18615:108"/>
into the Countrey of Cyrene before they were met; whereupon the Cyrenians being
inraged, wisht them either to returne backe into their Countrey, or dye on the place;
the valiant young men preferring the common good before private safety, accepted
to bee slaine.</p>
                        <p>That Reverent Fether of the Church <hi>Swinglius,</hi> a man not onely indued with
divine knowledge, but great learning, thought it a dishonour to him to withdraw
his hands from the Warres for his Countryes good; and the rather because hee had
incited others to be valiant in their Countryes behalfe, and to spend their bloud in the
defence of it; was himselfe the formost man in the Battell fought neere Zurich in
Helvetia, where by his eager valour pressing upon all disadvantages, hee was slaine:
Many Divines of our Age are not of that temper, but had rather appropriate some
strange irregular wayes to themselves, whereby contentions and factions may breed
at home amongst their brethren, then to exhort men to doe their Couutrey service;
but by their detractions rather diswade them, then stretch out their owne hands or
hazard their bodies for the good of their King and Countrey; for we are growne
so farre from incouraging one th' other to follow the Warres, or to distribute any
maintenance towards them, that wee altogether discourage those that would venter
their Purses, and hazard their bodyes for the good of their Countrey: But we may
learne of that ever renowned Lady <hi>Tiphania,</hi> Wife to <hi>Bertran du Gues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>lin,</hi> and let
her bee the patterne to all such detractors which seeke to deterre men from their due
service and honourable performances: This Warlike knight renowned in divers
Histories for his worthy enterprises, espoused himselfe to this fayre Lady of a noble
Family; his fame and honour being one chiefe cause she setled her affections; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
shee by her amorous courses did withdraw his spirits and love from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Warres, whereby his honour began to diminish; shee gently reproved him
(as hee was courting of her) and blamed him for effeminizing himselfe, and leaving
the Warres, whereby formerly hee had atchieved his greatest reputation; and that it
neither suted with the nature of valour, nor duty of a true Gentleman, to lose the least
repute of honour wone before, by over much affecting his new made choice; as for
my part (quoth shee) I ought to shine by the bright radience of your splendent
fame; and shall thinke my selfe too much dejected, if you doe not prosecute so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a course begun, and loose your spirits in doting on love: These her noble
and wise corrections, did so neere touch and trench upon the knights worth and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
that hee re-assumed a Warlike course, presenting his body against the hottest
assaults that ever our English Nation tendred to the Kingdome of France; he fought
against <hi>Edward</hi> called the blacke Prince; Hee restored <hi>Henry</hi> the eleventh king
of Castile in his Kingdome, maugre the English Forces; hee was after made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
of France, and highly indeered unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</p>
                        <p>I could gladly wish all Ladies and Gentlewomen of so noble a temper, esteeming
no honour to the fame purchast by Warlike actions, and instead of their teares and
fond embraces, to rouze their noble Husbands to prosecute the use of Armes; as the
brave spirited women of former ages have done; and for an example of their worths
it is recorded in History, how the Women of Aquilegia a City in Italy, did so ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and assist their Husbands and other Souldiers being beleaguered by <hi>Maximinus,</hi>
that when their Bowstrings fayled, they cut the haire of their heads and made them
new strings, all other materialls being spent, whereby they preserved their Citty,
and confounded their Enemies, to their never dying honours. I hope I have sayd
sufficient concerning this subject, and I take it for granted, that all mens spirits
have taken this Cordiall of valour; so that now it stands requisite we should give
some Rules, how and when wee should set our Valours a broach, and when to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine.</p>
                        <p>First, when two Armies are dayly in readinesse to give Battell,<note place="margin">Vpon some occasions Souldiers ought not to misconster the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to joyne Battell, and take it as cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</note> there are three
principall things to bee considered; as namely, if wee shall gaine lesse profit by the
Victory, then wee may feare detriment if wee should suffer an overthrow, upon
this occasion we are to forbeare, and Souldiers must not construe it as a trick of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize:
To give you an example of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> when hee invaded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Naples; the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had beene unwise if hee had given him Battell,
for the French could have lost no more but their Army in that battell; but if the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18615:109"/>
had inclined to the French, the Neopollitans had lost their Army and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with it; for it is a maxime amongst the rules of Mars, to delay an Enemy that
is of greater Potency and farre from his Country to gaine reliefe, whereby his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls
and Amunition may bee wasted, so that distractions and mutinies might
breed in the Army, the Souldiers being over-wearied in expecting the fatall day of
losse or gayne; so that the Natives may take at pleasure their best and safest occasion
to give Battell, so that victory may bee atchived.</p>
                        <p>The second reason why an Army may refuse to try their valours in a pitcht Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
<note place="margin">A second reason, why a Generall may refuse Battell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the imputation of a Coward.</note> and shall not bee imputed as cowardize unto them; is when a Generall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
that his Enemies Army will bee broken and scattered without fight; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth may bee example: For when hee made Warre
against the Protestants in Germany hee would never joyne in Battell with them;
for hee was credibly informed that their Army consisting of divers Nations could
not long agree, but be disperst without Battell.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, an Army may shun Battell and yet bee voyd of Cowardize, if hee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
knowes his power to bee inferiour by much to the Enemies,<note place="margin">The third reason why a Generall may refuse Battell without the imputation of a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</note> so that hee can
in no wise hope for victory: In this case a Generall had better doe as once a famous
Warriour was wont to say; Hee would rather make his Enemy a Golden Bridge to
March away, then give Battell upon unequall tearmes, for it is never good to assault
an Enemy if hee bee perceived to make meanes to March quietly away
without blowes; for many times an Enemy having beene brought into a desperate
case, hath beene the onely thing which hath gayned them the victory; as was well
seene not onely by the blacke Prince in France, but also by the Duke <hi>de Alva;</hi> hee
having beleaguered Aultmore in Holland, having blockt up his Enemy in the Town,
would neither cappitulate of quarter, nor suffer them to steale out of the Towne by
flight; this made the Townesmen and Souldiers resolute, in regard they expected
no favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with their manly courages resisted the Duke and put him to the foyle,
who otherwise would have fled and left the Towne to the Conquerour: For indeed
it is a great indiscretion to detaine an Enemy that is flying to stoppe his passage: for
without question, such valours are deprived of the sinteresis and light of naturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
becomming equall to beasts, managing their proceedings without feare or
wit; that will wilfully spill the precious bloud of man, and may accomplish their
ends without the hazard or losse of it: This was the honourable observation of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Warriour who left it in Ryme for future Ages to consider of; the words were
these,</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Spill not the bloud of man, to winne that hold,</l>
                           <l>At which an Asse may enter at with gold;</l>
                           <l>A Souldiers honour shines as bright</l>
                           <l>In politique Conquest, as in bloudy fight.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>Now it still remaines we should take some observations, in the true discerning of
Valour in an Army, that Souldiers may not flatter themselves with a false glosse of
Magnanimity;<note place="margin">The first observation of an Army indued with valour.</note> and in the performance of this, there are divers circumstances to bee
considered;</p>

                        <p>Now it remaines to shew how Warlike valour may bee begotten bred and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht
in the brests of Souldiers.<note place="margin">How valour may bee begotten and bred.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first is, to bee conversant in reading such Histories as treate of Warlike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
this will beget a speculative knowledge of all actions honourably performed by
valour, and withall, it will acquaint them with the events that have happened, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
dangers will bee made more familiar to them; so that by this the least sparke of
valour will be kindled in a kinde of emulation, to bee possest of the same honours in
performing the like victories or undergoing the like perills; as we read of famous
<hi>Tamberlin,</hi> who made it his practise to read often the heroicke deeds of his Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
which did so inflame his virtues, that hee proved the mirrour of the World.
For noble acts of Predecessors are as flaming Beacons that fame and time hath set on
hills to call us to the like occasions.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Theorie of Warre being truely understood, the stomackes of the
valiant will boyle with the conceit of the due honours and renownes that are therby
to be attained, and will force a man of courage to enter into the Lists of Mars, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in action, what before hee onely conceived incontemplation; in which large
field hee shall see all proceedings and events, whereby his body and min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

habituated unto it, so that the very jawes of death cannot affright such a Souldier,
who will sooner choose to be bereaved of life, then staine his honour.</p>
                        <p>Lastly for conclusion, such valiant Souldiers as take delight in the rudiments of
Warre, will alwaies have the faculties of their minde busied in plotting and project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all kindes of circumstances, which may tend to the beautifying of this Profession;
as it is recorded in the commendations of that valiant Souldier <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> that in what
place so ever hee became, hee in his walking would take notice of the Scituation of
each place hee came into, and in his fancy would contrive how hee should order his
Battell there with the best advantages; observing the fittest places to hide some Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busheadoes
in to fall upon the Enemies Flankes or Reare; and also which were his
convenientest places for his retyre, or for the safe encamping his Army, what passages
were fittest to bee guarded, and the like: Also in Fortified Townes hee would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the strength of their Fortification, and which place hee could have best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to make his assault; with the nature and quality of the ground for the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
placing his Engines of Battery, with millions of plots and devices, which
in his fancy hee contrived; whereby hee grew so expert, that neither time nor place
could poze him: This caused <hi>Haniball</hi> to answer <hi>Scipio,</hi> that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was the best
Souldier.</p>
                        <p>And to conclude this discourse, let us observe and follow the command that
God himselfe gave to his Generall <hi>Ioshua</hi> in charge, which was <hi>That hee should bee
strong and of a valiant courage,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ioshua 1. vers. 6. 7.</note> whereby prosperity should follow him wheresoever
his Army should goe: The Lord of Hosts seeing it was a thing of such high conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
Hee reitterated his former charge in a more emphaticall speech, being a
charge so speciall, that onely and above all things, <hi>they should bee strong and of a
valiant courage,</hi> for without this nothing could bee effected in the Warres.</p>
                        <p>In consideration of this necessity of courage and valour, that valiant Generall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18615:110"/>
                           <hi>Consalus,</hi> when hee had drawne his Army before Naples; he gave his Souldiers to
understand by his earnest protestations, (hoping they would imitate him) that hee
had rather dye one foot forwards, then to have his life secured for long, by one foot
of retreate: Such noble acts and honourable deeds of valiant Souldiers cannot be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in oblivion; but like the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> from whose preserved ashes one or other still
doth spring up like unto them.</p>
                        <p>The Ancients did so esteeme of a famous name that they deemed it immortall,
which made them ever ready to sacrifice their lives to gaine honour, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
above the Worlds endowments: Thus according to my poore ability I have
finisht this discourse, though not so exactly as the subject requires, in regard my
Schollership and capacity are corrivalls in simplicity.</p>
                        <p>In the next place I intend to bring in a discourse concerning Duells, being a thing
which assumes the cloake of valour, and may challenge a place in this discourse: but
I have thought it most fit to make a particular draught of it by it selfe, wherein
is shewed, who hath favoured this kinde of vindicating of honour
by the sword; and what circumstances may bee alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the supposed lawfulnesse of it, with divers

to the former discourse of valour, I
thought it meet to intreate of it in this place; and
I must confesse it is a high pitch of Magnanimitie
could it be warranted by divine and humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and having duly weighed the nature of Duels,
and likewise observed the oppinions of divers
learned, they holding it altogether unlawfull in
regard it is repugnant to Gods commandements,
and the Lawes of all Nations, which hate the idle
expence of such precious bloud, and will not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

the preservation of King and Countrey; to these I
must assent; Yet divers hot spirits have desired to prie further into this subject, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to skrew out a lawfulnesse, of the which they have falne short; I have therefore
used my best endeavours to summon up the likeliest arguments, and pregnantest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
that my poore reading can afford, to set the best glosse on it for their sakes,
although to little purpose; wherefore give me leave to speake my best in the behalfe
of the Duellist, and afterwards I will be an Attourney of the other side; wherefore
suppose there are divers probabilities that may induce to conceive a lawfulnesse in
some particular cases, having a respect to the limitations, and cautions that ought to
attend upon Duels; and first having a regard to the necessitie of Warre, and then du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weighing the circumstances belonging unto it; we shall find a secret policie lye
hidden, which will plead for it selfe, and will goe neere to prove that combats are
necessary, and happily within the limits of lawfulnesse.</p>
                        <p>And although <hi>Yno</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chartres</hi> did complaine against the French Church-men,
and especially in his letter to the Bishop of <hi>Orlians</hi> he assenting with divers

which might be produced from it; and having likewise scand the ill and mischiefe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18615:111"/>
that might consequently follow, did manifest and ratifie the lawfulnesse of challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Combat, which I must likewise suppose they did upon good grounds, they
having considered the manifold abuses, and most horrid aspersions that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

of some degenerat spirits would invent, and falsely lay to the charges of those they
hated, whereby both reputation and life of innocent men are indangered by false
accusations, which being beyond the wit of man to screw out the truth, in regard
no proofe can be produced, to leade Authoritie to discerne where the abuse lyes,
but only the justifying and denying of the partyes accusing, and accused; so that the
Engine of wit cannot invent a more politique and discreet way,<note place="margin">A safe argument to prove the lawfulnesse of duells.</note> then by decyding
the controversie by their Weapons; for reason tells a man, that in a just cause there
is no man but will be resolute to defend his honour, and put forth his best valour to
offend his Antagonist, his Combat being to maintaine the truth, and having a good
conscience on his side, doth adde vigour to his courage; whereas contrarily a guilty
conscience will so detract from the worth and valour of the false accuser, that feare
will under mine his heart, whereby he cannot performe in such a manly way, as that
party which hath right on his side; But admit there were no such thing in it, yet it
would be prevalent to make men cautelous in abusing their Neighbour, causing to
weigh the perill they must hazard; And although some have made this objection, that
all men are not of like strength and valour, so that in that kind it may seeme unjust;
Yet it is to be supposed in way of answer, that an inferiour man will not offer his
superiour in skill and valour, to scandalize him; and if a Superiour in skill and valour
should be so base, as to abuse or lay aspersions upon his inferiour, yet the inferiour
hath the aduantage to choose his weapon, which shall be fitting to his strength and
skill, whereby he shall be able buth to defend himselfe, and offend his enemy; for we
daily see by experience that very little weak men have had the better, as by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Sir <hi>Iohn Vere,</hi> he (being a very little Gentleman) to maintaine his reputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abused at the <hi>Hage</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> by a French Colonell, being a proper brave fellow,
who so farre undervalued Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> that at his comming to the place appointed for their
Combat, seeing a Coutrey Bore at worke neere that place, he demanded of him if he
did not see <hi>de cline manicke,</hi> meaning the little Gentleman, who presently came, and
at a few incounters at single Rapier, slew the brave Caviliere. And for my owne part
I have observed, that in all quarrels that were decided by Duels, hee that had done
the injurie, and did justifie it by his Sword, did ever goe by the worst, if not lose his
life. But some may further object, that there is provision appointed by Authority to
take up, and decide quarrels, and that the party abused shall have satisfaction by
compelling the abusive to aske pardon, and to shew contrition for the wrongs
offered.</p>
                        <p>I must confesse this is somewhat and very colourable, yet reason and experience
tells that such forced acknowledgements of satisfaction, doth not so fully cover the
sore of dis-reputation, as when the party grieved compells his Adversary, either to
give him satisfaction by justifying the disgrace he hath done, with his sword, or
otherwise to bethinke himselfe and cry <hi>peccavi;</hi> for although the Gentleman abused
hath satisfaction before Authority, which God forbid but every man should obey,
yet there remaines a secret tincture of disrepute, which will sume in the stomackes
of Souldiers, when they conceive Authority bindes the hands of the offendo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, and
strengthens the proceedings of the offended; a Souldiers honour and reputation
ought to shine so bright, that no blemish should be descride in it, for the smallest staine
of basenesse or cowardise pierceth through the heart of Honour and Valour, reducing
them to the secret scorne of all that knowes them, in which respect it behoves Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Souldiers to manage their actions and courses without giving offence,
that they may live blamelesse and untaxt. Besides these reasons let us take a survey
of the proceedings of the antient Worthies of former ages. Amongst the <hi>Saxons</hi>
Duels were very frequent and upon such occasions, which indeed are not to bee tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated;
But I find principally in History, that the <hi>Gaules</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi> ordained a
Law to decide such controversies, as no certaine proofe could be produced, and that
by foure wayes, as <hi>Aenius Silvius</hi> reports.</p>
                        <p>The first<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>was Campe fight or Combat, the accuser was with the perill, of his body,
to prove the accused guilty, and by offering him his Glove or Gauntlet to Challenge
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18615:111"/>
him to his tryall, which the other must accept or acknowledge himselfe culpable of
the crime; if the crime deserved death, then to fight on horse or foot untill one were
slaine; if imprisonment, then the vanquishing of the Adversary was sufficient,
and to take him Prisoner; In this kind of Combat the accused had liberty to take
another in his stead, but not the accuser.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they had another kind of way to trye out the truth, which they used
to Imbellick persons, and to feminine spirits, they tearmed it Fyre-ordeall, and was
used upon accusations without manifest proofe, although not without suspition: Hee
or shee was after many prayers and invocations to take in their hands a red-hot
Iron, or else to confesse guiltie.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they were to be blindfolded, and divers hot Shares and Coulters layed,
and the parties offending were led over them; if they escaped without touch, or
received no harme by touching them, then they were adjudged guiltlesse; it was
practised upon <hi>Emma</hi> the Mother of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, being accused for
dishonesty with <hi>Alwin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> which she performed without hurt;
It is likewise reported of <hi>Runigund,</hi> Wife to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the second, being
falsly accused of adultery, that she to prove her Innocencie, tooke seven hot Irons
one after the other in her bare hands, and received no harme thereby.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Numb. 5. 26, 27.</note> in holy Writ Almighty God himselfe ordained, that such women as
were suspected of Adultery should drinke of the bitter water of the Sanctuary;
which if she were guilty, it should make her thighs rotte off, and her belly burst; if
innocent she received no hurt.</p>
                        <p>Before we travell any further in this discourse, let us but duly weigh Gods om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie,
and his forwardnesse from time to time in protecting and assisting the
innocent, which hunts after no wrong; and how ready and neere he is in power to
inflict vengeance upon those that are abusive, and seeke the disgrace and detriment of
their Friends and Neighbours; which power of the Almighty questionlesse did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
the heart of <hi>David</hi> to answer the just Combat with <hi>Goliah,</hi> who had vilified,
and dishonoured the Host of Israel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Solomon</hi> the wisest that ever the heavens shadowed, hath delivered it for Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in his booke of Proverbs, that an evill tongue wounds like a two-edged Sword,
and if it wounds so deepe, it may indanger a mans life; therefore by the law of God
and Nations, a man may make use of his weapon in his owne defence, and his bloud
be upon his owne head, that dares give the occasion, and stand to justifie it; let this
be but by the way.</p>
                        <p>The third tryall of hotte water was used after the same fashion that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was.</p>
                        <p>Now the last was the tryall of cold Water, which they performed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the party suspected to be guilty had a rope put about him, then being throwne
into a deepe Pond, if he sunke then he was freed, but if against nature hee swome,
then hee was adjudged guiltie, because the water abhorred to receive such a base
person.</p>
                        <p>Such hidden secret injuries, scandals, and abuses, perpetrated against the innocent;
God did ever favour the manifestation of them, pointing out the truth in a miraculous
way by his owne finger: and in the bosome of the Church, where the hornes of the
Altar were a refuge for base bloudy Malefactours, yet God would have the Lotte to
be in use for to discover, and make manifest the truth.</p>
                        <p>Likewise <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, could not brooke the scandalous
rayling of <hi>Shimei,</hi> although he would not act it himselfe in person, and in hot
bloud, he considering his owne grosse sinnes deserved no lesse, and that his invective
vaporings somewhat trencht upon the truth; Yet the good King upon mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
gave expresse command, that his hoary head should not goe in peace to

                        <p>There hath beene, and still remaines a custome of challenging the Combat for title

God doth by a supernaturall hand favour it by bringing the truth to light,

were upon some peremptory abuse done to their persons, or to their honours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
which by it was so farre ecclipst, that it was irrecoverably staind, unlesse
they skrewed out the truth by this meanes, and before they would adventure to
challenge their Adversaries, they would search and seeke out the best meanes to
gaine the truth, and did use the fairest meanes they could devise, to bring their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
by faire meanes to confesse his abuse, so that the Sword was their last refuge.
Many times Authority would undertake the sifting out of the injuries, and then they
were very punctually to observe, and stand to such Injunctions as should bee given
them in charge to observe or performe.</p>
                        <p>Many times Friends would seeke to mediate peace, and to sift out the truth; to
this they would not be refractory, but did condiscend to whatsoever might stand
with their reputations and honours.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if their Enemies did desire to be reconciled, and would voluntarily
aske pardon, and acknowledge their fault before such Friends, as best knew the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the quarrell: then the party offended would not refuse this satisfaction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it were such an injury as did touch his life.</p>
                        <p>Further, those that were injured, if they were constrained to challenge the field
of their Adversary, in regard of their Enemies peevish refractarinesse, yet they
would banish all envie, hatred and malice; not once admitting any of these to bee
the subject of their strokes, and that the ground of their challenging was rather to
gaine their wounded reputations, then thirsty to shed bloud.</p>
                        <p>In the next place the ancients of former ages did attribute a great deale of honour
to such persons as were injured, yet were not furious and speedy to challenge his
enemy, but would waite a convenient time to see if his enemy will come in, and
acknowledge his abuses, for it could not be accounted a dishonour if the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
did challenge his enemie within a yeare and a day; of all the dishonours that
might be done a Gentleman the lye with a blow was held the greatest, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
presentest rebuke, because they esteemed a blow an absolute undervaluing, and a
high disgrace which had no circumstances of arguing belonging unto it, for it did
argue a voluntary and envious act, and there could be no plea of mistaking in it; but
in all other abuses they conceived there might be a mistake which being argued might
be acknowledged and reconciled.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="187" facs="tcp:18615:112"/>
Lastly, they held that a noble enemy would beare himselfe so valiantly that hee
would scorne to take any advantage, although his judicious forwardnesse might have
put his enemy to the worst.</p>
                        <p>Now I have shewed you how former ages did account of this kind of duells,<note place="margin">The Combat is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Christian in action, sufferance and right.</note> and
how they did tollerate them as lawfull, now I can doe no lesse but like <hi>Penelopes</hi>
webbe, unweave what before I had done, and shew you how in divers respects these
kinde of Combats are unlawfull and not to be tollerated amongst Christians.</p>
                        <p>In the first place the Duel or single Combat is denyed to a Christian man, to do it, to
grant it, and to see it, by reasons both divine and humane, as well Canonicall, as Civill.</p>
                        <p>It is prohibited by divine reason according to this argument, every act whereby
God may be tempted, is prohibited to a Christian by the Commandement of God;
for it is written, <hi>thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God:</hi> That God is tempted by the
Duell or Combat, I prove it in this manner; To make tryall of a thing, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be reduced to an end by naturall meanes, but only by the hand of heaven: such
attempting is to tempt God, as it hapneth in these cases of Combats, where it is
plainly and evidently seene (that by naturall course and disposition) the strongest,
active, and most powerfull person ever vanquisheth the weaker, and of lesse ability;
Contrariwise that the stronger body shall be overcome by the weaker, cannot hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
but miraculously.</p>
                        <p>Bringing then two such unequall persons into the field, victory is desired for him
that hath the right on his side, to the end that the truth may bee made apparant; But
then God is tempted,<note place="margin">Miracles only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the power of God.</note> in seeking that hee should performe a miracle; which must
needs be so, when the weaker man conquereth the stronger, being a thing as it were
directly against nature. I prove it further forbidden by divine reason; after this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
when a Law prohibiteth a thing, it forbiddeth also the doing of it, and a
man performeth an especiall inhibited thing, when he knoweth (by the divine Law)
that he is not to kill a man;<note place="margin">Murther may happen by Combats.</note> the Combat then is flatly forbidden, because thereby mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may happen.</p>
                        <p>I prove it otherwise thus; The divine law forbiddeth every action, that differeth
from the fountaine of Charity, which is the scope and end of all vertues, and utterly
expelleth vice; the act of Combat is farre off from Charity, leaning unto vice, because
charity is nothing else, but to love God and thy Neighbour, and hee that enters the
Combat to kill his Neighbour, is out of obedience to God.<note place="margin">The act of Combat killeth charity.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is likewise forbidden by the Canonicall Law, because it ever-more followeth
the divine Law, and in plaine reason what the one inhibiteth, the other never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
Combat is also forbidden by the Law of men; and the proofe is, that every
thing, which repugneth and contradicteth naturall equity, is likewise prohibited by
the reason of Man; because reason is grounded upon naturall equity: the reason of
equity amongst men, willeth that he which committeth a crime, should bee punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the innocent cleered: not withstanding by Combat it falleth out many times
quite contrary.</p>
                        <p>It is further proved by this Argument; Naturall equity whereon (as wee have
already said) all reason in men is grounded,<note place="margin">Naturall equity is for the conservation of mankind and combat is for his destruction.</note> is intirely for the conservation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of them. The act then which turneth unto the diminution and destruction of
men, it is quite forbidden: so ought Combat to be, because thereby men kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and men are of greatest price in the world.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, every act which repugneth the Precepts of naturall equity is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by mans reason, because it is grounded thereupon: one of the Precepts is, that
no man shall desire profit or honour,<note place="margin">The two maine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of naturall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are broken by the act of Combat.</note> by the prejudice of another. The second is,
that no man shall wish that to another, which hee would not have done to himselfe.
The act of Combat contradicteth them both, because he which commeth so prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the field, coveteth his owne glory, by the shame and harme of him against
whom he fighteth, which is his Neighbour, and wisheth that to him which hee
would not have executed on himselfe, for he would vanquish and kill him.</p>
                        <p>It is also forbidden by civile reason, and this is the rule; Civile right prohibiteth
every act whereby Iustice may be denyed to men, or injury done them; Now in the
case of Combat, oftentimes it falls out quite contrary for the innocent man dyeth,
and the guilty offender remaineth alive, so that by this meanes Iustice cannot take her
due place.</p>
                        <p>

                           <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> that the Law of Nature, never warranted the presumption

upon advisement, nor any other act, then a necessary defence upon a violent assault,
because a life might otherwise be lost before a complaint could bee made, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
working their outragious effects and ends in an instant, and without hope of
redresse. And yet the Civill Lawes, which speake with the voyce of Nature among
men, doe not admit so much as this defence of life by the sword, but upon necessity,
and as they speake themselves, <hi>Ratione inculpatae tutelae,</hi> which is in such distresse, as
destruction cannot be declined, nor avoyded otherwise: For if it fall out that the

or by craving ayde at the same leisure, that a Gentleman or any other wronged in his
reputation, may take his remedy without rage or violence, before a lawfull Iudge.
The Duellers of these dayes must want this thinne cover for an excuse of their auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
                        <p>For nothing can bee more certaine (sayth he) then that Gentlemen doe first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

                        <p>They spare not in like manner to transgresse the written Lawes of God himselfe,
which providently referres all kinde of complaints, actions, and suits that concernes

Plea and Plea, bloud and bloud; not to the humorous construction of the parties humour
that is interessed (and therefore partiality corrupts) but rather to the strength
of testimony, to the justice of Lawes, and to the conscience of an upright Iudge;
who bending neither to partiality nor prejudice, but looking upon the matter with
uprightnesse of conscience and knowledge, is more likely then the persons whom
the case so neerely and dearely concernes, to resolve according to the straight levell.</p>
                        <p>Wee make no question but that if honour had beene reputed such an <hi>Individuum
vagum,</hi> or such a wilde transcendent in former ages, as neither Civill Courts were
able to containe (which notwithstanding judge of all matters concerning liberty and
life,<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> which are reckoned with reputation, <hi>Inter res inaestimabiles)</hi> nor the Court of
Honour to confine (which was errected to no other end but to preserve mens repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and prevent the effusion of bloud; which the other Lawes of the Land did
omit as things not appertaining to their ellement) some other course would have bin
found before our dayes, that had beene more indifferent to have decided betweene
the sense of honour, and the severity of Law: But wee see the Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
proceed capitally against all those that are found to kill their Enemies upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
quarrells in the field after a fayre manner (according to the phrase) that is

although there have beene many members of the sayd house, which have

fight in Forraine parts, where the Kings Writte runnes not, neither can the Lawes
of the Kingdome take hold of any Subject in that case, though the Romans, and in
the Reigne of the first potent Emperours, would haue thought it strange, that the
life of any Subject, taken by another Subject wrongfully, should not be lawfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

by oath never to spare the life of any Subject in that State, that should kill another in

be, why the Lord <hi>Segrave</hi> (as appeares upon Record) attempting only to passe over
into <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Dover,</hi> for to performe a private quarrell, was condemned <hi>Iudicio

                        <p>But for a redresse of this,<note place="margin">pag. 100.</note> his Majestie having conferred with the learned Iudges
upon this point, that though there can be no proceeding by the Common Law against
one Subject that hath slaine another, by agreement upon Challenge to fight in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
parts: Yet by appeale, so often as it shall please his Majestie to appoint a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable

cause; the party thus offending may be condemned in that Court to death (as by an
Act of Parliament, made in the first yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth is evident) and
to this his Royall Majestie did protest by the word of a Religious just King, to put
this in execution; wherefore there should be no hope of former impunity, but that
such offenders thus condemned, should without remitting or forgivenesse bee
executed.</p>
                        <p>As for Seconds which these Combatants make choyce of, (to make the best of

                        <p>And to conclude his Majesties publication;<note place="margin">Pag. 114.</note> he wills every man that should find
himselfe grieved with any whisperings or rumours spread abroad, or any other way
abused, to resort to the Earle Marshall, who shall right him in his reputation, if hee
finds hee be wronged. Thus you see what a soveraigne salve it hath pleased his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
to prepare for the saving and repayring of Gentlemens reputations; so that
now you must confesse with me, that there is no dore left open for the Sword to
passe out at, unlesse men would runne willingly to destruction, by undergoing the
penalty of the Law here, and the eternall wrath of the great God of heaven, who
hath reserved revenge to himself, and none but himselfe shall repay it; and let us
blesse God that his Royall Majestie hath Authorized an Earle Marshall of so Noble
bloud, and so conscious and respective, in desciding such affaires; hee according to
his owne worth hath a tender care to render the due rights of honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to those that shall sue to his Noblenesse, giving them a free admittance to crave
his honours warrant for the conventing any such delinquent before him, and upon
conviction, imposing due punishment upon such refractary fellowes, with his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Injunction to the party offending, to restore the blemisht reputation of the
complaynant, before he depart his presence, so that never any that came before his
Lordship had ever cause to complaine of partiallitie, or remissenesse in his Honoured
course of Iudicature.</p>
                        <p>And for mine owne advise to gentlemen, having three severall times tasted of this
bitter fruit which hath growne by the Sword in the field, not so well then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
my selfe, as riper yeares and more mature considerations hath since ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in me, I doe rather wish a fayre reconciliation then a foule fray, for the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
of an enemy is more safe then to conquer him; my reason is because victory
onely deprives him of his power, but reconciliation, of his will, and there is lesse
danger in a will that will not hurt, than in a power that cannot, and againe power is
not so apt to tempt the will, as the will is studious to finde out meanes to provoke
power; if the enemy be base it is a dishonour to meddle with him, if hee be worthy
let his worth perswade thee to attonement, for hee that can be a worthy enemy, if
once reconciled may be thy worthy friend, for if in a just cause he dares fight against
thee, in the like cause as valiantly fight for thee.</p>
                        <p>It is pollicy to bee reconciled to a base enemy, bee it but to charme his slandrous
tongue, and use him as a friend in outward fairenesse, but beware him as an enemy, apt
to reassume his base quarrells, for a base foe cannot but prove a false friend.</p>
                        <p>And further let Gentlemen know that take a delight to busie themselves in such
litigious affaires, <hi>Sicut not Martyrom pana, sic non fortem pugua, sed causa;</hi> as it is not
the punishment that makes the Martyr, so it is not fighting that declares a valiant
man, but the fighting in a good cause, when his King and Countrey injoynes: And

ought to have a small Drumme for lightnesse to carry with him; hee is also to have

whole guards, and thereby have surprised Townes and Forts, as by divers examples
may be seene; as that of <hi>Breda,</hi> when the Turffe-boate lay before the Towne with
divers Souldiers immured in it, the Enemy had no way to gaine the wall but by the
Skipper, who had recourse to the next guard and made them drunke: So that their
duties were neglected; some being a drinking and most a sleepe, the Enemy stole
upon them at unawarres and slue them, and having gayned the watchword from the

ought to take all occasions in time of peace, to call forth such squadrons as have the
guard, and duly to exercise them there, also to shew every particular Souldier their
severall postures, and so fit them in readinesse for the chiefe Officers to exercise in

of training they are to looke that every man keepes his Rankes and files duly, helpe
order the company all the time of exercise; in time of Warre he is imployed upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are sent out to discover, or to fetch in Bootie and Farrage; likewise many
times to the guarding of passages; also in laying out of Perdues and visiting them:
Also in ordering of Troopes that are drawne out to charge some part of the Enemy,
where he is to bring up the Musquetiers to his superiour Officer in good order to
skirmish, and to give fire upon the Enemy, and so orderly to leade them off againe,
seeing them ranke themselves fairely, and causing them to make ready their peeces to
come up to give fire againe; also in retreite, he ought to assist the Souldiers discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in keeping their orders, lest confusion betides them; Also in time of fight to see
the Souldiers Bandaliers filled ready that no stay bee made, and to see the Powder
transported after them securely; he is also (when his Captaine, is Captaine of the
Watch,) to call out the Gentlemen of the Round to doe their duties, and to give
them the Word, he ought to assigne every Souldier his due and proper place to March
in, that no contention may arise; hee is to place the chiefe Gentlemen in the Front
on the right hand file; the next in degree is to leade the left-hand file, so placing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man according to his degree; hee ought to see that every Corporall bee a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiere;
hee is to fetch the powder, shot, and match from the Magezine, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
it to each Corporall, and so to each Souldier of their Squadron: Hee is at his
Captaines command to carry all delinquents to Prison, and see Irons put upon them;
If scarsity of Victuals should be in the Campe, he is to procure it from the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutioner
of the Army, lest the Company fall in want, which being procured, hee is
to distribute it to the Corporalls, and they to their Squadrons; Hee is also to instruct
the Drummes the true tone of beating, <hi>viz.</hi> a Call, a March, a Troope, a Charge, an
Allarme, a Retreite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hee ought to be resolute and forward in times of skirmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
shewing worthy examples to the Souldiers, that they might imitate him; Hee
ought by his serviceablenesse, and care to gaine the love of the whole Company, it
must be farre from him to be addicted to the hellish vice of drinking, drabbing, or
dicing, using his best indeavours to shame such as should in that kind transgresse;
Also he is not to permit any Souldier that is in drinke to performe any duty of charge
for that time, for feare of sleeping or quarrelling, whereby much inconveniences
may ensue, but rather seeke to punish him severely, that all may take example by him
to beware of the like oversight; Hee is every night at Drum-beating to draw Billets
for his Guard, and accordingly to leade his Squadron to it; and thus behaving
himselfe wisely and valiantly, <note place="margin">If the Guard bee at a Port then the Serjant is to guard with his Holbert all the day with the Squadron, and many times all night in times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> hee shall gaine honour and reputation, which will bee
steps to advance him to higher fortunes: And to define the office of Serjant truly, hee
is to be the eye, eare, mouth, hand, and feet of his superiour Officers; I could wish
our Serjants of Bands here in <hi>England</hi> were thus qualified for their Captaines sakes;

forwards like a valiant Souldier was slaine; the Captaine Brother to them both, tooke
up the Colours, and performed the Ensignes office, who in the scaling of the Wall,
was sore hurt and died thereof; thus three valiant brethren died honourably in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their Colours: if an Ensigne should lose all his Colours from the staffe and
hose, it is no dishonour; When an Army is drawne into Batalia, the Ensigne ought to
stand out before the front of it some five paces, and if the Generall, or some other
chiefe Officer of the Field passe by, he is gently to vaile his Colours holding the
butte end of his staffe at his girdlested: Also a maxime that no Souldier moves Hat
or Helmet to the greatest Commander that is, but only to bow his body to him;
Likewise in time of Battell the Ensigne is to withdraw himselfe for his safety into
the middle-most Ranke of the Pikes. Likewise in a March the Ensigne is to march

                        <p>If a King or great Prince passeth by, the Ensigne is to vaile his Colours close to

quallity and of undaunted valiant resolution; hee
should not bee inferiour in knowledge and skill, in all
the circumstances and actions belonging to Warre, in as
profound a manner as the chiefest Officer of the Field,
for hee hath a charge of great importance committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, hee being many times called to execute the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Serjant Major, or Lieuetenant Collonell; besides
hee is exposed to all manner of danger in the Warres,
for no Captaine but must leade on his men in the face of the Enemy, and charge them
in the teeth, which if hee bee not skilfull as well to leade them off as draw them on,
hee may bee the occasion of spilling of much bloud; hee ought not to bee a man cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18615:119"/>
civility, valour, and experience; the unexpertnesse of a Captaine hath beene
the ruine of Armies, and destruction of Common-wealths; In the time of peace every
brave fellow desires to bee honoured with the name and charge of a Captaine; but
when Warre approacheth and the Enemy is at hand, they quake their swords out of
their scabberds, and had rather make use in fight of their Wings, then their tallents:
A Captaine ought to be well seene and read in all the Liberall Sciences, to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with History, and to have what speculative knowledge that may bee to joyne
with their practice, all kinde of Stratagems should be similiar with him, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be wanting that might make him an accomplisht Souldier: A Captaine
ought to have regard to the due exercising of his Souldiers, fitting them in all points
for service; hee ought to see his Souldiers furnished with all things needfull; as
Armes, Munition, and their Weekely pay duely at the appoynted times; hee is to bee
very conscionable in delivering them their off-reckonings and apparrell; hee is to
passe very strictly (if it be in time of Warre) upon his Watch; being Captaine of the
Watch, hee is to command the Gentlemen of the Rounds to bee set out, and to have
the Word given them. If he be in the Field, he should leade out the Perdues and see
them visited in due season; then afterwards his Lieuetenant, and other inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
are to doe the like: If he be in Garrison, in time of danger, hee is precisely to
goe the first Round himselfe, being ayded with his Serjants and divers Gentlemen,
where hee must view the strength and sufficiency of every Guard, and how every
Officer doth dispose of his Souldiers; hee is to take the Word of every Officer in his
Round at every Corps-du-guard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If he be In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Patroule through his owne Regiment, and cause all Sutlers to exstinguish their
Candles, and to suffer no drinking after the warning Peece is discharged: If his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
bee 200 strong, hee is to have foure Corporalls, and to divide his Company
into foure even parts <hi>(viz.)</hi> Fifty Souldiers in a Corporal-ship: In the time of
Peace and being in Garrison, one Squadron onely watcheth, begining with the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Corporal-ship the first night, and so successively one Corporal-ship relieving
the other: In time of Warre, halfe or whole Companies, specially being in the Field,
no Guard shall bee relieved but once in 24 houres; hee is to make choyce of the
chiefe and ablest Souldiers being men of quality to be Gentlemen of his Company, and
they are to Guard with the Captaine of the Watch by turns, and to walke the Round
about all the Walls and Bulworkes; they are to give the Word to the Corporalls at
every Guard; they are to discover the Enemy, and to see the Sentinells doe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
which if they cannot or mistake it, the Guard is to charge them with their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
and apprehend them as Enemies; The Captaine is to lay out these Gentlemen

number of Perdues be layd, one a pretty distance behinde the other, so that if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
bee they may retreate backe one to the other, and so give notice to the Campe
that they may prepare for an Assault: those are to bee relieved every houre or halfe
houre; also the Captaine is to instruct his Souldiers how to make an Assault against
the Enemy, and also how to defend an Assault: Hee must be a good Enginiere, to
know how to rayse all kinde of Workes and Trenches, and how to place his men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Flankes to scowre the Bulworkes by the lyne of Levell; upon a Brestworke
in the Campe hee is to place betwixt every two Musquets, a Pike, the Musquetiers
are to give fire and fall off, and another imediately to present in his place, the Pikes
are to stand firme: the Captaine is to have his Armour of proofe, and a faire Pike for
his defensive and offensive Armes: He is to have two great Bougets made of dry
Neats-leather, which will hold a hundred weight of Powder a peece to furnish his
Musquetiers withall: Hee is to see the Bandyliers filled with Powder, with suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Match, and Bullets; hee must bee ever in a readinesse to answer an Allarum,
and the first that shall charge the Enemy: If the Enemy makes his approaches against
the Campe, after the Captaine hath drawne his men up to the Parrapet to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and being all ready to give fire, hee is to command that no man gives fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
hee gives order, and so suffer the Enemy to come up as close as may bee, and then
give him a brave volly of Shot altogether in his teeth, <note place="margin">If it bee in the darke, or night season.</note> one Musquetire relieving the
other, the Pikes charging manfully and stedfastly; at all convenient times hee is to

drill his souldiers very accurately, shewing them all the postures of the Pike and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
then how to march, counter-march, to double their Files, and Rankes, the
middle men to double to the Front, to advance forwards, and to retreat backwards
at the sound of the Drumme, to wheele about his Musquetiers, to make ready, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and give fire, to give fire in the Front, in the Reare, and upon either Flanke,
to fall off by Files and give fire, as we shall hereafter more largely discourse of. A
Captaine ought to march into the Field in the Front of his Company, and his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in the Reare; but marching out of the Field, the Captaines place is to bring up
the Reare, and the Lieutenant to leade the Company; the Ensigne is to march before
the first Division of Pikes, the eldest Serjeant is to bring up the next Division of
Pikes, and another Serjeant the last Division of Musquetiers.</p>
                        <p>The Captaine ought not to doe any reall act in the Warres, without Commission
from higher Authority, he is to lead up the right Wing of his Musquetiers to charge

is to carry the Pattisen or Colours, and being marcht into the Field, the Captaine is
to deliver the Pattisen or Colours (in the head of the Troope) to the Officer he hath
made choise of, commanding the Souldiers to take notice of him, and to obey him
as their Officer; he is to make choise of diligent Serjeants, and vigilant Corporals,
a trusty Clerke, and good Drummes; he ought to have one Wagon at the least, to
carry his Baggage, and to conduct sicke souldiers; he is to be as little pestered with

march, and also upon any service, be rather forward to fight for goods, than have
their mindes homewards, fearing to lose their owne; he ought not to be covetous
nor niggardly, but forward to gratifie all good services with some guifts and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
whereby he shall indeere his Souldiers to be prodigall of their lives to doe him
service: he must be familiar, and eloquent in perswading and diswading his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and to stirre up their valours to undergoe paine and perill; if a Souldior trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse,

Irons laid on him, by beating of a Souldier, a world of hatred will be stirred up, and
happily private revenge; he ought to be very carefull to keepe his Souldiers in action,
whereby idle expence of time (as drinking and playing) may be prevented which
usually ends in quarrelling and bloud-shed: He is to have Lanthornes and Torches,
such as will burne in any Storme and Tempest, for they may stand him many times in
great stead: he is to have his Tent in the head of all his Troope, and to bee conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
with them, shewing them ensamples of hardship; he ought alwayes to
have his Colours and his Drumme in the Field when he exerciseth his Company, as
well to give the more reputation unto the action, as also that the use of them may be

be diligent and forward in executing such commands as Authority injoynes him, and
so to persist in a resolution to feare nothing but infamie.</p>
                        <p>And I will conclude, with an Exhortation to all Noble Captaines, desiring them
for their credits sake, and for the honour of our gracious King, and welfare of our
Kingdome, to be more diligent in the discipling of their souldiers, and not to chop
and change so many new men into their Companies that betweene muster, and muster
the third part of the company are new untutored fellowes, that knowes not their
right hand from their left, so that it is a labor in vain to instruct them; and they are the
meanes of putting all those that have some knowledge out of square, by their aukward
doings, besides all base beggerly fellowes are admitted into the muster Rowle, when
as the best and chiefest yeomen ought to doe their King and country service in their
owne persons. Then lastly that every Captaine would command his Officers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the pikes and musquets whilst the rest are a calling over, and then eyther him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
or his Lieutenant to exercise them in grosse all their postures; and cause them to

finisht.</p>

vertues (without which a priuy Councellour cannot subsist) be so farre removed and

his Bosome: So on the other side men of meaner and lower advancement; who are
not capable of those high places in the Army; may yet bee much apter to advise, and
have a better and stronger Fort wherein to keepe secrets from perishing, then those

Likewise wee have moderne instances how <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> gave to <hi>Don Iohn</hi> Duke
of <hi>Austria;</hi> (that brave Souldier) <hi>Don Lewis de Zuniga</hi> to counsell him in all Marshall
occasions: and our <hi>Edward</hi> the third did the like for the blacke Prince, Hee made
choyse for his Councellors the Earle of <hi>Warwicke, Suffolke, Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Oxford;</hi> by
the strength of whose advice in the Battell of <hi>Poicteirs;</hi> hee not onely overthrew all
the Flowers of <hi>France;</hi> but also tooke <hi>Iohn</hi> their King and <hi>Philip</hi> his Sonne Prisoners.
Those Generalls that have runne in precipitate courses rejecting both Councellours
and Councells, have soone ruined themselves and their Armyes; as <hi>Crassus,</hi> when he
brought himselfe and eleven Legions to bee rowted and massacred in <hi>Parthia;</hi> and
<hi>Tyberius Gracchus</hi> when he had his braines dasht out in the Capitoll: After the same
manner did <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> who was made a bloudy sacrifice on the top of Mount
<hi>Aventine,</hi> for the much advised tempting of his fortunes.</p>
                        <p>By this we may see, there is nothing more necessary, than a sufficient Councell of
Warre, for their counsell and advice is more prevailent in Marshall-discipline, than
eyther Armour or Weapons, and more brave exployts have beene atchieved by wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

then they are chosen out of other great personages of eminency and worth, at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Generall; these private Councell of Warre, are to negotiate and deale
in matters that are profound, dangerous, and difficult, and are to argue and dispute
them, with sound understandings, and deepe judgements; And this shall suffice to
conclude this discourse. As for other Officers belonging to the Army, I omit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it bee a thing familiar to divers men to
Drill, and exercise a Foote Company, and that some
men have formerly to good purpose, intreated of
the Postures both of Pike and Musquet; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
my intent is to write a generall discourse of
every part of the body of Warre, I thinke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
in as short and briefe tearmes as the subject
will require, to demonstrate the parts requisite to
bee understood in the exercising of Companies;
shewing the grounds and reasons of every Posture
and motion that is materiall, either to offend or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
the reasons why they were invented, and
what advantage is in them; for although a Souldier
should know how to order, and demeane himselfe exquisitly in this Art of drilling,
yet if he doth not conceive the reasons to what purpose they were invented, and
the severall advantages they afford against the Enemy, in time of necessity hee
will be to seeke, whereby the whole grounds of Souldiarisme may miscarry, and the
ends they were invented for, lose their effect; and let no man expect that I should
invent any new anticke Postures, there being more already in use then are profitable;
But I could wish a Souldier should only make use of such circumstances as are really
most fit, and apt for imployment of Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Farre be it from me to discommend a comely manlike gesture and a correspondency
in the agitation of the limmes, when a Souldier handles his Armes; yet upon the point
of service all superfluous Postures are lopt off, and reduced only to these three acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note place="margin">The three usuall words of command in time of Service.</note> 
                           <hi>Making ready, Presenting, and giving fire.</hi> For should a Commander nominate
all the Postures in the time of service, hee would have no breath to oppose his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
neither could use any circumspection how to incounter with him; wherefore
I would rather wish all Commanders to affect the plaine and readiest way in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising,
which may best sute with the actions and capacities of plaine Souldiers,
which will prove more substantiall and essentiall; and those thus educated, are men
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18615:125"/>
likeliest to sustaine the brunt of an Enemies fury, and stand to their tackling, when
others with their Circumstantiall complements and superfluous slender devices, may
take a retraite for a charge, Wherefore in the first place let us observe that in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of multitudes into an orderly way of exercising, they must bee reduced into
Rankes and Files,</p>
                        <p>A File is a certaine number of Souldiers standing in a direct lyne one behinde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
face to backe, which number must not exceed ten in depth.</p>
                        <p>A Ranke is a number of Souldiers standing in an eeven lyne side-wayes, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

or decreaseth accidentally, according to the greatnesse or smallnesse of the
number.</p>
                        <p>A Company being thus ordered into Ranke and File, the next thing considerable,

precedent Chapter is shewed; But as for your divisionall
there be divers which I have omitted.</p>
                        <p>Intire Facings, are so called, when the aspect of the
whole Companie is directed one way.</p>
                        <p>Divisionall Facings are so called, when the aspect of the Souldiers is at one and
the same time directed divers wayes; as to the Front and Reare, the Right, the
Right and Left, or to all foure at once, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Angular Facings are so called, when the Aspect of the Companie is directed to
the right Corner man, which is the right Angle, or to the left Corner man, which is
the left Angle, or to the foure Corner men, which are termed the foure Angles.</p>
                        <p>These Angular Facings, amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> were of great use, for they made
use of them by reducing out of the Square, a Diamond Battell; and from the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
they reduc'd two Triangles, by cutting or dividing the same in the middest
at the two flat Angles; and of two Triangles they framed a Sheere Battell; and of
three or foure Triangles, they framed their Saw-Battell, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now for the instructing of your Souldiers how to Face Square (if the body bee
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18615:133"/>
but eight in depth) you must command the two first Rankes to stand fast, likewise
the two last Rankes are to face about, the rest of the Body, are to face to the Right
and Left; if the Body be deeper, then you must command more Rankes to the Front,
and so likewise to the Reare; and in the viewing the subsequent Figure, you shall
the better understand the manner of performing this motion of Square Facing.</p>
                        <p>Face Square, and March.</p>

                        <p>The three last Rankes face about.</p>

                        <p>To reduce them to their first Order:</p>
                        <p>Face all about to the Right; March, and close your Divisions.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the opening, and closing of Rankes and Files, there are
divers things considerable, as first in the motion of Files,
you are to observe your Leader.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in your motion of Rankes, you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

the File next his left hand.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, when they open to the Le, then the right hand
File stands; every File taking his distance from the
File next his Right hand.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, in closing of Files if it be to the right, then contrary to the opening the
Right-hand-file stands: the rest closing to the right taking then Distance, from their
next right hand-file.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, if you close to the left, then the Left-hand-file stands, the rest of the Files
closing to the left, taking their distance in like manner.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, when Files close to the right and left, then they close inwards, taking
their distance from the Files within them, neerer to the middest of the body.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, note when Files are commanded to open to the right and left (or by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision)
it must be outward.</p>
                        <p>Likewise you must observe when Rankes open forwards, then the last Ranke
stands, every Ranke taking his distance from the Ranke next behind him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, when they open backwards, then the first Ranke is to stand, and every
Ranke is to take his distance from the Ranke next before him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if Rankes close to Front and Reare, then the first and last Ranke stands,
the other taking their distances from them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, if they close Rankes towards the Center or middest, then they close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their two middlemost rankes.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, you are to observe, that in opening of Files and Ranks, you are (in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it) either to face to the right, or to the right about; these things being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and you hauing commanded them to even their Rankes, and straighten their

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He use of doublings were invented for the strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of any part of the Battell, according to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wise Commander, and are distinguished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these two generalls, <hi>viz.</hi> doublings of length, and
doublings of depth.</p>
                        <p>Doubling of Rankes doth make the number double so
much as was before, whereby the length of the Battell
is extended to the double proportion of ground.</p>
                        <p>Doubling of Files (or Flankes) doth likewise double
the number in depth; as the former did in length: and
before wee proceed to particularize these doublings; let us take notice of these obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
following.</p>
                        <p>First, that in this motion of doubling there is one part of the body stands firme and
the other part moves, <hi>viz.</hi> the standing part is to be doubled, the part moving are
those that double.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, observe that the distance for particular and divisionall doublings, is open
Order in Ranke and File.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, observe that the ordinary doublings of Rankes and Files is or ought to be
performed by three steps; <hi>viz,</hi> first stepping forth with that foote which is next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place named.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, in the reducement to your former station, you must returne by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
hand.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, observe in doubling of Rankes and Files, <hi>viz,</hi> if you double Rankes either
to the right or left hand; if you double your Files to the contrary hand, reduceth
them into their former station; or in doubling of Files to either hand; doubling of
your rankes to the contrary will reduce them.</p>

which produceth them; and also the words of Direction for
the reducing of them to their first Forme and Station; In this
Chapter, I shall endeavour to set downe briefe directions, how they
may best be performed; with the readiest way for the executing of
them. The Words of Command (you shall finde in the Margent) which produceth
each severall motion, of doubling both of Rankes and Files.</p>

double.
<list>
                                 <item>This doubling of Rankes to the Right, is naught else
but the inserting of the Even-rankes into the Odde-rankes;
wherein you must note, that in the doubling of Rankes, the
Even-rankes are to double into the Odde, beginning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to reckon from the first Ranke; so that the second
Ranke doubles into the first, entring in upon the Right hand
of him that stands in the Ranke right before him, and so
stands even a-Brest with them. The fourth Ranke, after the
same manner doubles upon the right hand of him that stands
before him in the third Ranke. The sixt Ranke after
the same manner doubles into the fifth Ranke. The eighth
into the seventh, and the tenth into the ninth. So that the
Right-hand man of that Ranke that doubleth to the Right,
is alwayes to take his place upon the outermost side of the
Right-hand man of that Ranke that was doubled, the rest
of his Ranke doing accordingly. After the same manner, it
is to be performed to the Left hand, onely now you are to
take the left hand of him that stands in the Ranke before
you after the same manner as before you did the Right.
For the reducing of them, those Rankes that doubled, must
turne off to the contrary hand of that they doubled unto:
The Command is, <hi>Rankes as you were.</hi> Or otherwise you
may reduce them, by commanding the Leaders to draw out
their Files, <hi>(viz.)</hi> those Rankes that doubled, are to stand
firme; and those that were doubled are to march out, untill
their last Ranke be a pretty distance before the first Ranke of
them that doubled, and then they are to step into their Even
distances, and stand even in Ranke and File, as before.</item>

it is as followeth; First each of the even Files dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
into the odde Files, beginning from the hand named;
as in this doubling of Files to the Left; The Left-hand-file
stands fast, and the second File doubleth into it by stepping
behinde his Left-hand-man at three steppes; The fourth
File doubleth into the third, and so for the rest; If your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
be to double your Files to the right; then contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Right-hand-file stands fast; the rest of the even
Files doubling into the odde, accounting from the Right, as
before from the Left; And by the way observe, that as in
doubling of Rankes any way, you are to observe your
Right-hand leader; So in doubling of Files you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

you may either in Ranke or File, be altogether in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Also take notice that this kind of doubling, is a doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of number, and not of place, for the depth of the Battel is

before demonstrated, both in quantity and qualitie: In
quantitie it differeth, in regard the other leaves a large di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

they formerly stood at. This contrariwise continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and preserving the same distance they formerly stood
at betweene each Ranke; It differeth also in quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it brings the best, and second sort of Souldiers, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Front; The words of Command, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(whereby this motion is produced) is placed in the

the tenth or last Ranke, which are the bringers up, are to
passe forwards even in ranke, through or betweene the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
to the right of them that stand before them, untill
they come even in Ranke with the Front; the ninth
Ranke following those which marched from behind
them, placing themselves in the second Ranke. The
eight eight Ranke in the third. The seventh Ranke in the
fourth. The sixt ranke or Halfe-files, in the fifth or reare of
the front halfe-files. This doubling maketh a very able
Front in bringing the ablest Souldiers together, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the depth of the Battell bee diminished, yet the
length of it is double in number; this doubling is in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

As for the doubling the Front to the Left hand by

to double Files to the right and left; for the right Flanke
is to double to the right, and the left Flanke to the left; by
this doubling of Files to the right and left outwards both
the Flankes at one instant are strengthened by doubling
their number in depth; but it weakeneth the inward part,
where it taketh two Files cleane away, leaving a large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall
in the midst; after the word of command is given;
the outmost File of each Flanke stands, and the second
File doubles into them; the third from each Flanke stands,
and the fourth File doubles into the third, the sixt into the
fift, and so likewise of all the rest. Note, that in doubling
of Files you must alwayes step behinde the side-man that
you are to double into.</item>
                                 <item>If you would double Files to the right and left inwards;
it is to be done the contrary way: <note place="margin">Of doubling Files to the right and left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> for whereas in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
doubling the outmost Files stand; and the other dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

inmost Files shall stand, and the rest are to double inwards
to them; and whereas in the other there is a larger distance
in the midst then in any other part; but in this doubling
inwards the midst will be as close as any other part; the
words of Command for the reducing of them into their

though not in quantity (for in quantity they keepe one

doubling by Bringers-up doth bring the best and second
sort of Souldiers together into the Front; the fourth and
third sort into the Reare; so that the Reare is 4/7 worse then
the front. But this doubling by halfe-files brings the best

outmost File of the Left Flancke, (the body being 20 in
Ranke, or brest) then the second into the nineteenth, the
third into the eighteenth, the fourth into the seventeenth,
the fifth into the sixteenth, and the rest in like manner. The
use of this doubling is to strengthen one of the Flanckes;

Marching in Ranke together untill they come to their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;

the skirmish, untill the other have attained the further Banke
of the River: Or else the Front halfe-files being opened to the right
and left, and faced upon the Enemy, march valiantly up and receive
the charge, whil'st the other provide for themselves; for the manner
and way of this motion, it may be thus performed. After the Command
is given, the Front halfe-files are to face to the right and left, and march
right forth until they are cleere of the other halfe-files of the Reare, then
they face to the Reare and march on, untill they have attained to be even
in rank with them whom they had command to double; which perfects
the doubling. The way to reduce them followeth; if you keep your place
of the first Front, then let your half-files face about, and march until they
are cleare of the Reare halfe-files which stand, then face to the right
and left inwards, and close their Division, and being againe faced to

forth-right untill the doubling be performed. For reducement,
if the Commander stands at the right Flank (which is the
part that was doubled) then the reducement is as followeth; the
half Ranks that doubled are to face about inwards, and march
forth-right untill they are clear of the right Flank which
stands; then the Front half-Files face to the left, and the Rear
half-Files to the right, and then close their division. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander

man of each Rank (which are the bringers up of the motion)

that the left-hand men are the Leaders of the motion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
command the Ranks that doubled to face to the left, and

is also a doubling both of number and place; for it increaseth
the depth, to double their former proportion of number, as from
ten to twenty. It also gaineth so much ground the more before
the Front, as formerly the Battell did contain, by transferring
the even Files of the body into the ground before the Front of
the odd Files; But this doubling doth diminish the number of
the length of your Battell, although it preserves their place.
The manner of performing this motion of doubling is thus to
be done; first the word of Command being given (as in the
Margent is specified) the odd Files are to stand, beginning your
account from the outmost File to the hand named; the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketires
and Pikes of the even Files are to advance their Arms
and follow their File-Leaders, every File-Leader leading his
File forth-right before his next File to the right, untill the
bringers up of the even Files are orderly placed before the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the odd Files. For reducement, Let the Files that dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
face about to the left, the bringers up of each File leading
them forth-right downe the distance or spaces which are on
their left hand, untill they are come even with the Rear, and
then stand and face about to their Commander, and they will
bee in their first forme and station. The doubling of Files to
the left intire advancing is after the same manner, only differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the hand. The words of Command used for this reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are, <hi>Files that doubled, face about to the left: march forth

for number and place; only it differeth from the other both in
the manner of executing, and in some sort of the matter execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for whereas the other doubling by advancing of Files did
transferre all the even Files into the ground before the Front;
contrariwise, this doubling doth transfer them into the ground
next behind the Rear. And as in the other doublings, half the
File-Leaders did remain in the Front, and the other halfe were
halfe-File-Leaders. Now in this doubling halfe the File-Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are to remain in the Front, and the other half are brought
down and plac'd in the last Rank of the Rear, and those which
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18615:140"/>
were Bringers up, are now in this motion become the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Ranks. The manner of performing this doubling, is thus
first having given the word of Command that produceth this
motion (as is specified in the Margent); then every man falling
behind his Bringer up, the even Files (accounting from the
hand named) immediately are to face about to the right, and
the Bringers up of each of the even Files are to turne behind
the Bringers up of the odd Files that stand; And so every
man as hee commeth downe to the Reare, turneth to the left
behind him that marcheth down the next before him, untill
those that were Leaders of the even Files are become the Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
up to those that were the odd Files.</item>
                                 <item>The reducement is thus to bee performed, according to the
words of Command used for that purpose, <hi>Bringers up (that
now are) double your Ranks forwards to the left.</hi> The instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for this doubling the Ranks forwards (by the Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
up) into the Front, is discourst of in the beginning of

Inversion makes their depth so many times more in number
as there are Files to double; or halfe so many, if it be done by
division: the use of it is to avoid the Shot of great Ordnance;

                        </p>
                        <p>First of Ranks ranking in equall parts, it is thus to be understood; when there are 12
or 20 (more or lesse) marching a Brest, and the Commander finding his passage nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or for any other intent, commandeth his Ranks to Rank 3 or 6 a Brest, or 5, 10,
or any other number, every Rank holding equality of number.</p>
                        <p>Secondly observe, that Ranks then Rank by unequall parts, when they Rank by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18615:142"/>
increase or decrease: as for example, when the first Rank shall be 3, the next 5, then 7,
9, &amp;c. which is commonly used in triangular figures, as the Horsemans-wedge, or the
Diamond-Battell.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly observe, that Ranks then rank intire into the Front, when the first Rank
stands, the second Rank placeth it self upon the right or left of the first; the third by the
second; the fourth by the third; and so forwards for all the rest, untill all the Ranks, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, either to the right or left, are become one Rank in the Front.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly observe, that Ranks then rank by division into the Front, when the second
Rank, and all the rest of the Ranks behind open to the right &amp; left, the one part going
to the right, and the other to the left, ranking even with the first, as is shewed in the
former; and all these being joyned together, makes one intire Rank.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly observe, that Ranks then rank to the Flank or Flanks, when either the right-hand
man of each Rank, or left-hand man (or both together) are as it were the Hinge
of the motion; the residue of each Rank wheeling about them to the right or left (or
to each hand by division) untill that every Rank bee brought into the distance which
was before the Rank, between the right-handman of the Rank next before, and the
right-hand man of the same Rank you stand in. If it bee to the left, then they wheel
into the distance between the left-hand Leaders of each Rank. If it bee by division,
then halfe the Rank wheeleth to the right, and the other halfe to the left, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
two Ranks.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly observe, that Files then rank by equall parts when they rank 3, 4 or 5 a
Brest (be it more or lesse) still keeping the number of men in Rank, of due proportion.
If you rank three a Brest (either to the right or left) and your Files be but ten deep;
then the first nine men makes three Ranks, and the fourth Rank must be made up by
the Leader, and the next that follows him of the second File: and so for all the rest. If
you rank five, and the Files be ten deep, then every File makes two Ranks, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly observe, that Files then rank by unequall parts when they either rank
by progressionall increase or by decrease: as when every Rank exceeds the Rank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, by two, three or foure, bee it more or lesse; or else that each Rank decreaseth
after the same manner.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly observe, that Files then rank intire into the Front, when there is so much
distance between File and File, as will contain each File Rank-wise, every man in the
File marching forwards to the right or left, as shall bee commanded, untill he stand
even in Rank with the Leader of his File, which brings the body into one Rank.</p>
                        <p>As for Ranks wheeling by Conversion to the right and left, or Ranks ranking to
each Flank by wheeling, it differeth from Ranks filing both in manner and matter.</p>
                        <p>In differs in manner thus; whereas in Ranks filing to the right and left, the right
and left-hand File-Leaders preserve and continue their places: in this wheeling by
Conversion to the right and left, you shall find it contrary to Ranks filing: for the
innermost File-Leaders become the outmost men in that part where the Front stood,
the other File-Leaders rank even within them; for when the word of Command is
given for wheeling, you are to wheel your aspects unto the hand or part named, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you either become a Rank or Ranks, and not Files.</p>
                        <p>This way of wheeling is a very speedy motion for a great body (if they have their
due distance) to give fire to one or both Flanks. The manner or performing it follows.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Ranks, wheele to the
right and left by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<list>
                                 <item>To perform this wheeling by division, the right and left-hand
men of every Rank are to become the hinges of the motion; the
rest of each Rank wheeling by equall division to the right and
left about, and above the right and left-hand Leaders, untill
they become Ranks to the Flanks.</item>
                                 <item>If you will avoid mixture of Arms, then place all your Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
in Front or Rear, or else wheele only your Muskets and
leave your Pikes standing; or else it may be done, the body mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
at length, the Muskets being in the Front &amp; Rear divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The word for the reduceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is, <hi>Ranks, Rank as you were:</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
is performed by facing to the Rear, and then to wheel back into
their places; then face to their Leaders, and they will be in their
former station.</item>

                           <pb n="247" facs="tcp:18615:142"/>
Now it remains to demonstrate the way and manner of Files ranking by Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in equall parts; the word of Command is,
<list>
                              <item>Files, Rank <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the left.
<list>
                                    <item>To performe this motion, the right-hand File-leader leadeth
forth his File, &amp; the three next men behind him move forwards
to the left hand of each other, untill they rank even a Brest
with their File-leader. The next four in like manner ranking
to the left, do make the second Rank, they being but eight deep.
The File-leader of the second File placeth himselfe next after
him that was the half-File-leader of the first, which now is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the right-hand man of the second Rank: the three next
men behind him makes up his Rank; and so in like manner for
all the rest untill the motion be quite perfected. This converts
each File into two Ranks, and brings all the proper File-leaders
and half-File-leaders to make the outmost File to the right.
The Bringers up both of the Front and Rear half-Files, maketh
the outmost File to the left. For the reducement of this motion
of Files ranking four to the left, is thus to bee performed: first
cause your Ranks to file (or invert) to the right; which being
done, command every File-leader to lead up his File to the left,
and so every man will bee in his first station.</item>

File being a Leader in his halfe Rank, File-wise: and so
likewise in the left-hand File the same. Then you are to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarch
the right Flank to the right, and the left Flank to the

the Hinge of the motion is the right corner man which hath the

about the two halfe file leaders of the outmost files of each

Master <hi>Barrifes</hi> directions, who hath excellently well described them, both by
discourse and figure.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore first take notice of giving fire by forlorne files, which most commonly
is used two maner of wayes in the exercising of companies.</p>
                        <p>The first is, for the two outermost files of each flanke of shot to march forth (being
led on by the two yongest Serjants,) a convenient distance beyond the Front of the
battell, who being there arived ought to make there stand, the foremost Rankes are to
give fire, wheeling off both to the right, (or to the right and left if it be commanded)
and to place themselves in the Reere of their owne Files, the rest of the Rankes firing
and doing of the like, untill they have fired once, or twice over, according as they shall
be directed, this being performed, the next two out most files, of each flanke are to
march forwards unto the place assigned, and are there to doe the like.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:18615:149"/>
Those files which formerly faced are in the meane time to troope backe,<note place="margin">Note the Shot are to prime and charge as they troope downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reere to place themselves to the Flankes of the Pikes.</note> and place
themselves next the flankes of the Pikes, upon the inside of the division of Musquetiers.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the shot after the former manner are to march up and give fire, placing
themselves as before is shewed, when they have fired all over and placed themselves
according to these directions they are reduced into their first stations.</p>
                        <p>The second way of firing by forlorne Files is thus to be performed: The outmost
files of each Flanke are led forth by the Serjeants unto the place assigned, and then they
command their Files to ranke inwards, and to present and give fire all at one instant as
by the subsequent figure you may perceive.</p>

                        <p>The first two files having ranked inwards and joyned together making one brest as
you may perceive at the figure 4. and having presented and given fire, they are to
wheele off to the right and left, each man following his Leader in single file (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
their postures of priming and charging, &amp;c.) as they troope downe to place
themselves on the inside of their division of shot alongst by the Flankes of the Pikes:
The next outmost File which followed the first in the Reere in the meane time are to
ranke themselves inwards, and are to give fire and wheele off as the former did, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
themselves alongst by the Flankes of the Pikes, after the same manner all the rest
of the Files are to performe their indeavours. Note the odde Files may eyther march

a Serjeant from each Flanke is to leade these two formost
rankes up to the place assigned: The first Ranke of each wing

to the words of Command placed in the Margent,<note place="margin">The severall wayes of firing belonging to the Demie-hearse Battell described.</note> the
manner of the forme is thus, the two winges of shot are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
before the Front of the body of Pikes: and closing
their divisions they shelter the Pikes from the fury of the
Enemies shot. And there may be as great execution perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by this forme of firing, as by any of the former, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it is so sollid and stable. In the former firings, the Pikes
either rank'd even with the wings of shot, or else the division
betweene the wings of shot being open, the Pikes are liable
to the danger of the Enemies shot, the Pikes are not able of
themselves to doe any thing either in the way of offence, or
defence, untill the Enemie be within push of Pike. But this
kinde of Demie-hearse Battell covers the Front of their
Pikes securely with the wings of their owne shot, untill the
Enemie be come within distance.</item>
                                 <item>There are two principall wayes of giving fire belonging
to this forme, namely first the Musquetiers may give fire in
the Front, and so wheele off by division, or if the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pleaseth, they may wheele all off to the right, placing
themselves in the Reere of their owne divisions and Files of
shot just before the Front of the Pikes.</item>
                                 <item>The next Rankes are immediately to move forwards into
their Leaders ground, and are likewise to give fire and wheele
off placing themselves after the maner of the former, the rest
of the rankes of Musquetiers performing the like, untill they
have all given fire: Thus having fired once or twice over
this way, you may make use of a second way of firing,
which shall serve for reducement of the former.</item>
                                 <item>Wherefore observe that in this second way of firing, when
the first Rankes have given fire, they are to wheele equally
off by division, each part faling file wise downe close by the
flankes of the wings of Musquetiers, untill the Leaders of the
rankes of shot are come downe as low as the first ranke of
Pikes, which being performed they are to face outwards:
and to move so farre forth in a straight line untill they have
ranked even with the first ranke of Pikes, not forgetting to
leave there a distance betwixt the Inermost Musquet of each
Flanke, and the outermost File-Leader of the Pikes. So
soone as the first Ranke hath given fire and wheeled away,
the second Ranke is to give fire, wheeling off as before, and
passing down betweene the Intervalls of the Flankes placing
themselves after their Leaders. The same is every Ranke suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18615:150"/>
to doe untill all the shot be drawne from before the
Front, &amp; placed on the Flankes of their Pikes. But when all
the shot in the front hath discharged unto the two last rankes,
then the Pikes are to porte, and when they have all fired and
wheeled away, then they are to charge their Pikes; then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
their Pikes again, the Battallia stands reduced as in its
first forme.</item>

that produceth this forme of giving fire,<note place="margin">The severall wayes of giving fire by Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction discribed.</note> by way of Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
it being a kinde of advancing against the Enemie,
and of gayning ground, although not used (in these our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
warres) but in way of exercise. It is to be performed
two wayes. The first, when the motion is begun by the
second Ranke from the Front. The other when it is begun
by the bringers up; wherefore observe before the firing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
you must open your Files of Musquetiers, to their open
order, so that the shot may passe betweene the Intervalls of
each File to give fire in the Front. The maner and forme of
this kind of firing by Introduction may be thus performed.
The Pikes being flanked with the Musquetiers, the first ranke
of each flanke is to present and give fire, and having fired,
they stand and make ready againe in the same place. The
second Ranke passing forwards before the first, doe there also
fire and stand. The third Ranke then passing forwards, after
the second, and standing even in Ranke with them that first
fired, that so soone as the second Ranke hath fired, they may
presently step before them and fire in like maner. In this firing
still the ranke which is next to fire, stands even in ranke with
them which last fired, untill those which stand presented have
first given fire, after which they then passe before them; the
Ranke which was their next followers, passing forwarde, &amp;
Ranking with those which last fired, every man following his
Leader successively, untill the bringers up give fire and stand
in the Front of all; and then this forme will be like the figure
of a Horne battell. All the while that this firing by Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is continued, the Pikes may be shouldred, if there be no
feare of the Enemies Horse. If you continue this firing twice
over the Musquetiers will have their right place: which
being done, march up your Pikes and Ranke them even in
Front with the shot, and they are reduced.</item>
                                 <item>The second way of firing by introduction: The first Ranke,
(or File Leaders) are to give fire as before, and to stand. The
last Ranke (or bringers up) in the interim of their firing
marching up, and ranking even with the second Ranke: the
rest follow their bringers up, as they doe when bringers up
double their Front: the first Ranke having fired, the bringers
up step imediatly before them, present, and give fire, the rest
still successively doing the like, untill every ranke have given
fire once over: observe with all, that the File Leaders are to
give fire twice over, being the first, and the last, and then to
stand, the Pikes marching up even with their Front of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers.
And thus they are reduced as at first. If the two
first rankes of Pikes in every Battallia should have bowes
fastned to their Pikes,<note place="margin">The severall wayes of bring, belonging to the Diamond forme of Battell described.</note> they might do good service against the

<list>
                                 <item>not used in the warres, The manner of forming it is thus: first
you must cause your Musquetiers of the right flanke, to open
to the right, to a sufficient distance for the receiving the shot
of the left flanke. Then you must Command the left flanke of
Musquetiers, to passe through into the space of ground on the
right. This being done, for to frame this battell you must
command your Files of Musquetires to ranke, 1, 3, 5, 7 &amp;c. by
increase to the left, then you must command the Files of
Pikes to ranke by decrease after the Musquetiers; The Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitiers
may give fire from this forme of Battell two wayes
principally, the first is the giving fire in Ranke <hi>(viz.)</hi> the
first man (or point of the diamond) is first to give fire, then
he is to wheele off to the right, and place himselfe just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the single Pikemen in the Reere; then the next Ranke
consisting of three men are to give fire, and to wheele off by
division, and are to place themselves in Ranke behind the
single Musquetiere as they were before the firing began,
next the Ranke of five Musquitiers gives fire wheeling off in
like manner by division, ever observing that where the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is odde, and they commanded to wheele off by division,
there the greatest number alwayes goes to the right: And
after this manner every Ranke gives fire successively, and
place themselves after their Leaders, as before is shewed:
when all the shot have given fire and are wheeled off, then
let the Pikes charge, which will be fiveteene in the first Rank,
the rest decreasing (having advanced your forme) will stand
like two wedges with their points joyned.</item>
                                 <item>If you would reduce your men from this forme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving fire, then let the Musquitiers stand, and the Pikes
face to the Reere, and then the wedge will stand faced in
opposition: Next you may command them to interchange
ground, the Musquetiers advancing forwards into the ground
of the Pikes, and the Pikes moving into the ground of the
Musquetiers, and then by facing the Pikes to the former
front, the body will stand in forme of a diamond againe. If
you would give fire from this forme in regard all the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers
are placed in the Reere, the body must face about, &amp;
so the firing will bee contrary to the former. But if you
wheele them about, then they may give fire the same way:
However after fire is given they must wheele off by divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and place themselves in the Reere of the Pikes, even in
Rank againe as they were when they gave fire: Thus having
all fired over &amp; wheeled away, the Pikes may charge, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againe advanced, the body wil stand in form of a diamond.</item>
                                 <item>The second way of firing on this Diamond forme is by
way of Counter-march, and is an oblique firing, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the other firing by Rankes in the Diamond Battell, each
Ranke fired by increase of two, beginning with one, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with 15. 17. or 21, &amp;c. (according to the quantitie of
your Souldiers) in a Ranke; this second kind of firing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
wise may beginne with 15. 17. or 21, &amp;c. and end
with one, still decreasing two; and to performe this firing
your Files must be at open order, because the Musquetiers
must Counter-march downe betweene the Intervals of their
owne Files to the right, every Musquetiere that findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himselfe
without a Leader, being to present and give fire,
and then to Counter-march to the right, and to place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the Reere of his owne File behind the Pikes, when
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18615:151"/>
the first Ranke (if it consists but of 15.) have given fire, then the next
Ranke of 13. is to present, give fire, and Counter-march, still placing
themselves in the Reere of their owne files; next there fireth 11. then
9, &amp;c. And in this manner of firing they that fire together stand nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Ranke nor File, but obliquely when all the shot have fired, and
are Counter-marcht into the Reere of their owne Files, then the Rankes
will become two, and two of a number.</item>
                                 <item>Your men standing in the forme before described if you please you

your Musquetiers to march ten or twelve paces, your Pikes to

and your Piks of a sollid wedge. Lastly, to reduce all these severall formes
into the first proper square battell; first let the sollid wedge, close for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
into the hollow of the other, then let the shot make ready, present,
and give fire as before <hi>(viz.)</hi> every Musquetiere that findes himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Leader is to give fire and Counter-march to the Reere of his owne
File, and the rest doing the like successively, when they have all fired and

up into the Front, and give fire, as in the next place shal be demonstrated,
onely first by the way observe the words of directions placed in the
Margent, which produceth this forme. The battel being ordred as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Let the first Ranke of Musquetiers, (which are those that followes
next after the Pikes) face to the right and march forth (File-wise) up
close by the right flanke of Pikes, untill he that is the conductor of
them become into the Front of the Pikes, then he is to leade them quite
crosse the Front of Pikes, untill he have attained the further part of the
Front to the left: which being done, they are all to stand present and give
fire. You must observe withall that he in this firing that was the right
hand man of the Ranke, and was the Leader of the motion: now becomes
the left hand man when he gives fire, and when they have fired they are
to wheele off to the left close by the left flanke of Pikes and so to fall into
the Reere of the Musquetiers. In the Interim whilst that the Ranke that
first fired, is wheeling away, the second ranke is marching into their
places to give fire. And in this maner they may maintaine their skirmish
so long as they please: the Pikes either porting or charging all the while.
The Musquetiers in their time of their crossing the Front, are to couch,
or stoope under their Pikes, that they may be no impediment to them in
their charge.</item>
                                 <item>There is another way of firing by extraduction, which is that the

                                 <item>For Reducement you must command your Pikes to stand, and your
Musquets to double their Front by division. But if you want roome

offensive,<note place="margin">The severall wayes of firings belonging to a broad fronted battell described.</note> or defensive. The words of direction that produceth this forme
is in the Margent, and the maner of performing it is thus, first cause your
Pikes to stand, and your Musquetiers to march untill the reere ranke of
Musquetiers be advanced a little space before the Front of the Pikes, then
let the Musquetiers face inwards, (or in opposition) and close their divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then face to their Leaders, And if you would bring more hands to
fight, double rankes to any hand. But the speediest way to produce thus
forme, is to wheele both flankes into the Front. For the manner of firing,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:18615:152"/>
there are Intervalls made for each division to the right; that so they may
either fall into the reere of the shot, and there continue the firing; or else
fall into the reere of the Pikes: and be thereby secured from the enemies
horse. Wherefore be pleased to observe the words of Command
whereby this forme is produced (which is placed in the Margent,) For
the performance of this firing, the first ranke is to present and give fire,
then wheele off to the right; all passing downe the Intervalls to the right
and placing themselves in the reere of their owne shot, the Musquetiers
making good their Leaders ground. Likewise after the next rankes have
fired, they are after the former Manner to wheele off and to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
This way they may give fire once or twise over, and then make
use of a second way. And that is to place themselves in the reere of the
Pikes; either standing or advancing: Or if neede be the Pikes may close
their divisions, and charge at the foote, the Musquetiers giving fire over
them. For Reducement: If you make this forme of battell by wheeling
your flankes into the front and there having given fire, as foresaid; Then
you must cause them to give fire over againe, and so fall into their former
places: for you must observe that the second firing will cause the body to
face to the Reere, which then becomes a Front accidentall, and then by
wheeling your Flankes into the Front againe, and facing them about to
the right; will bring them into their first station: or if you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them without giving of fire over againe; then you must Command
your shot to double their Front by division, that being done, you are to
wheele both Flankes into the Reare, then facing to their Leaders, you
must againe Command the Musquetiers to double their Front by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and they will be in their first forme and station.</item>

have wheeled as aforesaid. The Body standing in this forme, the shot may sleeve up

                        <p>If in giving fire in the reere, your Musquetiers wheele off and place themselves

flanke their Pikes; Or if you will reduce them with out a firing, cause your Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers

seeke to cut them off: or at least deterr them from ariving at their place of strength

differ: for you remember in the former, that the File of Musquetiers,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18615:154"/>
after that they had given fire were led off by their proper File-Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,
but this must be led off to the contrary by their bringers up, and
this indeede if the body bee upon a slow march is the readiest and
quickest way, and doth more speedily secure the shot after they have

described, you may take the words of command and direction which
produceth this firing, as it is placed in the Margent, and the way of
performing this firing is as followeth.</item>

The command being given, the outmost File presents to the right,
and gives fire, then faceth to the right, after their bringers up who
leadeth them off, crosse the Reere of Musquetiers marching them up
betweene the divisions, the bringers up supplying the File-Leaders
place, and marching even in Ranke in the Front with the File-Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the file Leader of the same File becomming the bringer up
in the Reere. The Files of Musquetiers or Pikes, (according as the
Command shall be given) are as they march, to open, thereby giving
way to the Musquetiers, after they have fired to come up betweene
the divisions; and so soone as the first file that fired is cleare from the
right Flanke, the second File is then to present and give fire, and in
like manner to wheele off as before, and so to march up betweene
the Pikes and Musquetiers; every File successively giving fire, and
wheeling off as aforesaid. This firing may be performed as often as
the Commander pleaseth: Never the lesse if it be twise performed
the men are reduced as at first, every man possessing his right place.
There is another way for the bringers up to wheele off, and each of
them to leade off his File untill he comes to the Reere of his division,
which is betweene the Musquets and the Pikes, and there hee is to
stand and ranke with the bringers up, the rest that follow passing on
forwards by way of introduction, and every man ranking before him
that was his Leader in the wheeling off, untill the proper File-Leader
be come into his place againe, and after this way they may give fire,
each firing being his owne reducement.</item>

are divided in the middlemost File, leaving such a proportionable
distance as may conveniently receive all the Files of shot after they
have fired. The word of command and direction you shall finde pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Margent: The command being given for the outermost
File to present to the right, (as formerly is shewed in the other firings
in the Flanke) the rest of the body still marcheth on untill that the
outermost File hath fired, and is faced to the left againe, following
their Leader: He now leading them off to the left, marched up in
the distance which is made betweene the middlemost Files of Pikes,
who are then to open to the right and left, so to give them roome
to march up betweene them; in the meane time the next File having
given fire, wheeleth off in like manner, marching up on the left hand
of the File that fired last before, and so successively for all the rest of
the Files of Musquetiers, all which are to give fire and wheele off as
before, placing them still on the left hand of the Files which last fired;
wherein still is to be noted that the Pikes are still to open to the right
and left, for the receiving the shot betweene them after they have
discharged. This firing, as well as all the former firings in Flank may be
led off by their bringers up, as well as by their File-Leaders, and then
the reducement will be answerable. The shot having all given fire
the Pikes may seeke to defend themselves by charging at push of
Pike, or at foote; if there bee any Bow Pikes they may gall the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the meane time, or the shot may play over the shoulders of
the Pikes as they charge at the foote, one ranke giving fire after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the formost Ranke having fired may kneele downe, and
there make ready againe untill the next Ranke behind hath also fired,
&amp;c. For reducement and to bring the Musquetiers into both flankes
againe as they were before wee discoursed of these severall firings in
Flankes; you must first command your Pikes to face inwards, and
your Musquetiers to the right and left outward, and so to passe them

firings in the flanke, the Shot were placed in the middest
of the Pikes, and now before we can give directions for
these divisionall firings in Front and Reere, we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the way of reducing the Musquetiers into the Front and Reere
of the Pikes, from the forme wherein they last stood. To performe
this, you must command the halfe Files of Musquetiers to face about,
which done, let the Pikes stand and the Musquetires march, untill they
are cleare both of Front and Reere of Pikes, then let them stand and
face to their Leader, then command your Pikes to close their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and the shot will bee one halfe of them in Front and the other
halfe in the Reere, in a readinesse to performe this firing which wee
are now about to discourse of: The Pikes being shouldred and the
words of command and direction given (as in the Margent is specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
the first Ranke in the Front presents, and the last Ranke faceth
about to the Reere and doth the like, and so by giving fire together
wheele off by division, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the one halfe of the Ranke following
after the right hand man of the same Ranke, the other halfe after
the left hand man who leads them close downe by the sides or
flankes of the Musquetiers untill they come to the Pikes: The first
Ranke of Musquetiers in the Front are to ranke even with the first
Ranke of Pikes, and the last Ranke of Musquetiers in the Reere are
to ranke even with the last Ranke of Pikes, leaving a sufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
betwixt them and their Pikes for the other Musquetiers to
march betweene. And by the way take notice that he that was outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
when they gave fire, must likewise be outermost when they have
taken their places on the Flanks; the first and last Ranke having fired
and wheeled off, the next rankes (the body marching on, three or foure
steppes) are in like manner to present and give fire, wheeling off by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
and passing betweene the divisions, there placing themselves,
they of the Front division are to place them selves behind those which
fired last before them, and they of the Reere division before them
which fired last in the Reere behind them; and thus they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to give fire after the same manner untill they have all given fire
over once, then may the body make a stand and the Pikes charge to the
Front and Reere if occasion be; or if the Commander would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his firing to the front and Reere still upon this same forme, then
let the shot of the Front place themselves (after they have given fire)
behind the Musquetiers of their owne division, and those of the
Reere division are to place themseleves betwixt the Reere of Pikes and
the shot of their owne division, and so the body moving but slowly
forwards they may continue the firing.</item>

the last Ranke of Musquetiers in the Reere faceth about and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents

firing and wheeling off after the same manner: Having fired once over
they are reduced every man to his place. The Officer must take some

                        <p>For the first of the seaven helpes before specified, which is the Voyce, it is used
divers wayes, as in the way of Correction, for his obstinacie or wrestinesse: a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

him, you must use milde termes with a cheerefull voyce; as in running
him, you must say, Hey, hey, or the like; if to retreate, you must use a low voyce,
Backe, backe boy, backe, I say.</p>
                        <p>If you would helpe him to advance at the stop, you must say cheerefully, Hup,

such way as a good wand, well labored upon a stubborne horse that is wresty.</p>
                        <p>The Bridle governes a Horse as the Helme doth the Ship, and it is the principall
instrument about him, to bring him in subjection; and to fit him for service, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
divers things in it are considerable: as the fashion of the bit, sutable to the
tendernesse of his mouth, the Musrowle, the Cheekes, kurbles, ports, treaches
and such like bitts according to the discretion of the Rider. He most likewise know
when to ride his Horse with a Bitte, then with what manner of Bitte, and how to
use it at first putting on, and in what part of his mouth it must rest.</p>
                        <p>Likewise how to hold the Raynes, when even together; and when one shorter
than another, and what measure he shall keepe with his hand, in bearing hard or

them; when and how to correct him with the Bridle, and when to helpe
him.</p>
                        <p>Many men spoile their Horse at first, by using to sharpe a Bitte; wherefore the
safest way is to take a plaine Cannon with right cheekes, and that hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

                        <p>In bearing your bridle you must observe three severall wayes: first, by bearing
the Raynes low beneath the pummell of the saddle, even with the wither<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

is a ready way to correct him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Note the left hand is onely to be held up so high to rest your Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuz or Carbine, upon when you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</note> bearing your hand heigher towards the middest of the pommell, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

maintaines him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, bearing him just above the Pommell, that is used in managing him; to
beare the hand higher is by sundry Authors disallowed; first, in regard it we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

the arme; secondly, if neede require, you have not so much power to stoppe your
Horse when you would.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, being upon Service in the field against your enemy, the bearing of your
hand so high, would be a trouble unto your defence, and a commodity to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
for thereby he may easily cut your Raynes in sunder.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, you can have no steady hand upon your horse, for any continnance, by
meanes whereof he can never rayne well, nor port his head steedy, unlesse you beare
your hand low, remembring when you turne your horse, neither to draw your
armes nor hands more on the one side than the other, but keepe it even with the
horses crest, and onely to turne your fist a little inward, or outwards, to signifie unto
him what hand you would have him turne unto: for the helpe of the caulfe and
heele in riding the Ring, you must consider divers Circumstances, as first a single
stroake of the contrary legge,<note place="margin">Vse of the Caulfe.</note> to the side you intend to turne upon: as for example,
if you would have him turne on the right side,<note place="margin">You must not forget to spurre behinde the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

left legge, if on the left hand, then with your right legge.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, a double stroake, striking him with both your legges together with an
even stroake, and this is to make him thrust forwards.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the closing stroake; as for example, when you would have your horse
close his turne well, as namely to the right hand; then in his turning touch him
with your left legge in the spurring place,<note place="margin">Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more backwards towards his flanke.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, to strike with both heeles one after the other foure or five times, serves
for a correction when your horse transgresseth.</p>
                        <p>The use of the Stir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>op availeth much in helping a young horse in his beginning;

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18615:161"/>
striking him with the Stirrop under the shoulder, on the contrary side, will cause

Ring; then let some other horse that is perfect tread it out before him; and let him
follow him; but if you tread it out your selfe, doe not trot your horse, but tread it
out softly, untill the way be beaten, that he may the better see how to demeane
himselfe, then afterwards to fall on with a gentle trot.</p>
                        <p>But if your horse be over metled, you shall not suffer him to trot the Rings at all,

                        <p>When you come to mannage your horse, or to passe a carriere, it is not then best
to use one place alwayes, or one length, lest hee be to seeke, when he change places,
thinking he should not doe it, in any other place; or that hee should not passe his
accustomed length, and so stoppe before you would have him.</p>
                        <p>After you have ridden your horse a few weekes, you may increase your Ring
turnes every day two times, untill hee come to 46. which makes a leaven large
turnes and a halfe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 22. for the left Ring, and 24. for the right.</p>
                        <p>When soever you gallop your horse in the Ring, remember alwayes to helpe him
with your Voyce, Rodde, or Spurre, according as the quality of the horse shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and when he doth well forget not to cherish him.</p>
                        <p>When you have trotted or troad your number of Rings, that you shall see meete,
then trot your horse right out in the furrow between the two rings, untill you come
to the place of stop, there staying a good pretty while together, keepe his body right
in the path: and after hee hath made his stoppe, you must cause him to goe backe;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18615:162"/>
three or foure steps, which will not onely stay his mouth, and make him easie ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but also lift his legges, and be apt to advance, or rise before.</p>
                        <p>To teach him to goe backe, you must so soone as he hath stopt, pull in your bridle
hand moderately, according as the horses resistance shall require, so keeping your
hand steady, without giving him any liberty, strike him softly upon the bowing of
his necke with your riding rod, saying with a soft voyce in that instant, back, back
I say, thus being obsequious unto him a pretty while together, if he then will not
move his legges,<note place="margin">Note you may have a fellow stand at the place of stop, with a sticke to Rap him on the knees, which will make him tread backe.</note> or doth make resistance, then spurre him in time, first with one
spurre, then with the other, but most of that side his hinder part stands out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when these things are performed, and your horse well verst in them, then at
the stop you shall further teach him to advance or rise, with both his fore feete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
three or foure times, a foote or halfe a yard above the ground, this thing is
so necessary that the horse cannot manage well, nor turne readily without this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
                        <p>If he will not advance by striking him at his stoppe on the right shoulder with
your rod,<note place="margin">How to teach a horse to rise before.</note> then keepe still a steady hand, and correct him twise or thrice together
with the even stroke of your spurres, or else with one spurre after another, cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
him with your voyce, as saying hup, hup, or hoyce, immediately after
trot him out againe, the distance of forty or fifty foote, with a swift trot, and at the
stoppe doe as you did before, continuing the same course untill he be perfect, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you may teach him the same devices upon his gallop.</p>
                        <p>In the next place we are to take notice of the narrow and streight turnes (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sufficiently spoken of the former large turnes) of the narrow turnes there are
three kindes <hi>(viz.)</hi> halfe turnes,<note place="margin">Of the narrow turnes there are three kinds described.</note> whole turnes, and double turnes.</p>
                        <p>The halfe turne is when the Horse turneth on the one side, and setteth his head
the way his Tayle before stood, the way he goes being but halfe a Circle, but if he
doubles it and goes the whole circumference of the Circle, his head will stand as
it did at his first setting out, and this is called a whole turne, and two such whole
turnes will make a double turne,<note place="margin">Divers considerations in turnes.</note> in these turnes divers things are to be considered.</p>
                        <p>First that the horse brings in the contrary legge upon the other, and that he carries
his legges neither too high nor too low, also that he keepeth alwayes one path:
and that he neither presseth forwards not reeleth backwards in his turning, also
that he keepeth his body at one stay, not any wayes awry, neither head, necke,
nor any part of his body, but to come in whole and round together, and to close
his turnes, in so narrow a roome as may be.</p>
                        <p>When you are come out of your Ring,<note place="margin">Remember alwayes to begin your Ring on your right hand, and likewise on the same hand to end it.</note> trot your horse right out in the middle
furrow, unto the place of stop, and having stopt; turne your horse faire and softly
on the right hand, taking circumference enough: that being done give him the
like turne on the left hand, and then returne him againe; (as before) on the right
hand.</p>
                        <p>Note when he is to turne on the right hand, he is to bring his left foote over the
right foote before, which is performed by helping him with your voyce, in saying

shoulder.</p>
                        <p>Likewise when you turne him on the left hand,<note place="margin">How your horse should order his feete at his first turning to either hand.</note> helpe him with your voyce as
before, and with your rod on the right shoulder, to bring in the right fore foote
over the left fore foote.</p>
                        <p>If your horse be harder to turne on one side than on the other, you must helpe
him with the contrary legge or spurre, or with your rod by beating him on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
shoulder.</p>
                        <p>And to make him close truely, it shall be needfull to helpe him with your closing
stroke of your heele and Spurre. Further if your Horse be so stiffe necked and
wresty that he will turne upon one hand and not upon the other, you shall tread out
in new plowed Land another fashioned Ring, as beneath is figured, which both
differs in shape, and in the order of treading from the former.</p>

                        <p>For whereas you were wont before in the former figure to goe twice about in
the right ring, following still the right hand; and then to goe twice about the left
ring, following then the left hand: Now in this last ring you shall goe three times
about each of them following still the right hand in both of them, and whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

than make a large turne,<note place="margin">In this second figure sixe goings about makes but a large turne, the reasons of it are described.</note> the reason is this, if you should goe out of the right ring

<hi>A.</hi> and the place of closing your turne with the letter <hi>B.</hi> betwixt which two letters
is contained the portion of a Circle, which will be wanting, wherefore of necessity
you must goe thrice about, to the intent the second turne may be fully ended, as for
any overplusse it makes no matter.</p>

a man stand as before is shewed, to strike him upon the stop, and cause him to turne
upon the right hand, which hand a horse must alwayes first turne upon, but if he be

                        <p>First when you make your Horse double his turnes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly when you gallop the field, making him wave in and out,
as is used in single skirmish.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly when you make him leape a loft, fetching divers saltes or
curveates; but this is not so proper to teach to a horse for service.</p>

length of twenty or thirty paces, turning him at each end thereof, either with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
turne, whole turne, or double turne, (this is termed manage) and in this word
there is three things observable, as first the manage with halfe rest, that is to cause
your horse at the end of every managing path, to stop and then to advance twise
together, and at the second bound to turne, whereby you rest one bound.</p>
                        <p>The manage with the whole r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

so you rest two bounds, the managing without rest, is when you turne him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon the stop, without any tarriance at all, which is most in use with
us.</p>
                        <p>Note when your Horse turneth upon the right Hand, turne you your left shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
towards his left eare, keeping your body upright in the Saddle, so that the raynes
of your backe may directly answere the ridg-bone of the horses backe, never the
lesse when you feele him to bend his hinder houghs, then leane you somewhat
backewards, for that will make him close his turne the more roundly and swiftly,
likewise when he turnes on the left hand accompany him with your right shoulder
towards his right eare,<note place="margin">A great horse must be ridde the shortest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>Your horse being perfect in all points before mentioned you shall ride him into
some plaine sandy way, voyde of all occasions of stumbling, and to acquaint him
with the way, pace him faire and softly the length of a good Carriere, which
must be measured out according to the strength and quality of the horse.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the Carriere path, let your Horse stop and advance, and at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
bound;<note place="margin">Three things of note in a Carriere, first that the horse gathers roundly, secondly that he runnes swiftly, thirdly that he stops easily.</note> turne him faire and softly upon the right hand, and so stay a little while
then suddenly with a lively voyce, crying hay, hay, put him forwards with both
Spurres at once, forcing him to runne all the path as swift as possibly may be, just up
to the end, to the intent he may stop on his buttockes; this being performed turne
him upon the left hand, and pace him forth faire and softly, unto the other end of
the Carriere path, and there stop him, and turne him againe upon the right hand,
as you did before and so leave him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="290" facs="tcp:18615:164"/>
Note there is no better way to bring a horse to this, than by using him
to tread the ring with a very swift trot, which will make him nimble of his legges,
and so swift and stayed of head,<note place="margin">When your Horse can runne the Cariere doe not exercise him in it above once in two moneths at most.</note> that comming afterwards to be runne, it shall bee
easie to him to performe; this was observed by that famous Rider <hi>Cola Pagano,</hi> who
would never runne his horse untill he saw him wel stayed of head, and well broken,
for although a horse may be halfe a yeare in breaking, yet in eight dayes he may be
taught to runne and stoppe in a most perfect manner.</p>
                        <p>Likewise to teach your horse to goe side wayes, (it being a thing of much conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in the wars) you must performe it thus, as namely you desire to have him
goe side longs towards the left hand, you must beare your bridle even and steady:
and clap your right legge close to his belly, and hold it there still, making him feele
the spurre on the right side; if he moveth his body that way you desire, then sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pull away your legge from thence, and make much of him, that being performed
make him doe as much with your left legge; and leaving to molest him on either
side untill he understands your meaning, thus with a little exercise, so soone as he
shall feele you stay your bridle hand, and touch him with your legge or spurres, on
the contrary side he will goe side wayes, so much, or so little as you will have
him.</p>
                        <p>Likewise to make him keepe his head alwayes towards the Enemie,<note place="margin">An excellent way to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

by striking him therewith on the contrary flanke behinde.</p>
                        <p>Further take notice the carriage of your Horses head is a matter of no small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence;
his forehead being the strongest part of his head; his snought or mussell
the weakest and tendrest;<note place="margin">The excellent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a horse, well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>, described.</note> the more he thrusteth out his mussell, the more he disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his backe, and beareth the lesse force in his actions; and it is impossible hee
should ever make good Manage, observe time, keepe order, or continue in breath,
any space of time together; whereas by bringing in his mussell and extending his
forehead, he uniteth his force together, and gathereth his strength in his backe,
whereby he becommeth more nimble in his actions.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he shall see his way the better, and be in lesse danger of falling in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and if he should chance to fall he is the abler to rise speedily.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in his performances against an enemie, he shall be able to execute, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
more with his forehead, than can be expected from his Mussell, being the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest
part of him.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly he cannot be so apt to be urged right forwards upon a sudden, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he might doe.</p>
                        <p>Lastly the Horse that Raynes well, and bringeth in his head shall alwayes
bee better stayed, both of head and necke, and have a better mouth than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore if your horse will not bring in his head at any time when you stop
him with your bridle hand,<note place="margin">The meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell a horse to rayne well described.</note> then holding your hand still at that stay, correct him
sometimes with your right Spurre, and sometime with your left, and sometimes
with both your spurres at once; and at the selfe same instant thrust him with your
right hand upon the necke towards his eares; to force him to bring in his head, but
if he will not yeeld with that, then by pulling your bridle towards you, cause him
to goe backe, some three paces, and then to returne faire and softly to his first place;
this being put in action divers times together; and every time he thrusteth out his
nose correct him as before is shewed.</p>
                        <p>Moreover if your horse by wresty,<note place="margin">A devise to make a wresty Horse goe forwards.</note> so as he cannot be put forwards; then let one
take a Cat tyed by the tayle to a long pole, and when he goes backewards thrust
the Cat towards his stones, where she may claw him, and forget not to threaten
your horse with a terrible Noyse: or otherwise take a Hedgehog and tye him
streight by one of his feete to the inside of the horses tayle, so that he may squeake
and pricke him.</p>
                        <p>Likewise if your horse be fearefull and shie,<note place="margin">How to make a shie horse gentle.</note> so that he is afrayd of every thing he
sees, you must take heede that in no wise you correct him for it, least he should take
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18615:164"/>
the thing he beholdeth and shunneth, to be the cause of his chastisements, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more fearefull than before, but rather stay a while and doe not force him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but by gentle meanes make him by little and little aproach neere the thing
he feares, which if he performes, cherish him with your speech and hand, and you
shall set by standing still sometimes to looke on it, and sometimes by going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the object he feares, he will be so acquainted therewith as he will not feare
it, and when he commeth at it, let him gaze and smell on it a good while, to the
intent he may be more assured thereof.</p>
                        <p>Further to embolden your horse to make him hardy in the warres, you must use
to incounter upon a soft pace or trot,<note place="margin">How to make a horse hardy and bold in the warres.</note> with another horse man face to face, in one

compelled backe a few steps which will harty the other, or if you please you may
incounter one with the other, riding in two sundry pathes, the one comming
cheeke by cheeke within a foote of the other, the pathes being both of a just length;
each of them containing about tenne paces, to the intent in managing your horse
too and fro upon a trot, you comming one towards another, from two contrary
ends, may both meete right in the midst of your course passing one by another,
which you cannot chuse but doe if you keepe true time, as well in their trotting as

the Ring, you may embolden your horse, by entring both together into the Right
Ring, then turning your horse tayle to tayle, follow you the right hand, and let
him follow the left in the same Ring, the ring path being so inlarged, that at your
meeting in ryding it about you may not touch one the other.</p>
                        <p>Having ridden thus about twise, you may enter the left ring, and doe as before
was shewed.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter we are to deale with the difficultest matter of all;
and that is now to make a Horse abide Pike, Gunshot, Sword,
Drumme, and the clattering of Armour, or to runne upon any
hazard, to performe this you must acquaint him throughly with
the rod or truntion, so as he may not feare it; sometimes coying
him therewith upon the Necke, and by holding the point right
forth by his eye, or betwixt his eares, so as it may bee alwayes in
his sight, and being throughly assured of the rod, then appoint a foote man, having
a staffe in his hand or pike, to stand in your way as you should passe, and as you
aproach, let the footeman by little and little make signes, seeming to strike your
horse upon the head, then encourage your horse to goe on towards the footeman,
who at the same instant must retreate backe as if he would flee, in doing this you
shall much imbolden him.</p>
                        <p>Likewise to make him abide the sword, a footeman must performe it in the same
manner as he did with the Pike, but be ware he strikes him not.</p>
                        <p>After this, cause half a dozen footemen or more to stand in his way, making a

you must incourage him to goe forwards; first with a soft pace, secondly with a

runne away, also let them threaten them with their staves, Pikes or swords.</p>

To make him dure Gunshot, Drumme, or clattering of Armour; or any hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
noyse whatsoever; let your horse goe hard by another horse, or rather betwixt
two other horses, that are accustomed to the like noyse, and are not afrayd, and as
you ride together cause three or foure Pistols to be discharged, first a good distance
off, then neerer hand, according as your horse beginneth to abide them; during
which time forget not to make much of him.</p>
                        <p>Likewise every morning before he is drest discharge a Musket or two, and sound
a Trumpet, and beate a charge with your drumme, and then when he is patient
feede him and cherish him, the Groome may sometime dresse him in bright ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
hee may be used to eate his Oates from off the Drumme head, you may
ride him against an armour, plac't upon a stake, that he may overthrow it, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it under his feete: Every horseman that doth not observe these briefe obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
and fit himselfe and his horse in all respects before hee come to be tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
they will prove both unfit for service; neither would I wish any Captaine to
approve either of man or horse, that in some reasonable manner, hath not attained
to this perfection; for an Oxe well Managed may in possibility doe better service
than an ill ridden wresty horse; neither can any security or reputation bee expected
by any service they shall undertake if the Officers be not diligent to see their
Troopes well ordered and demeaned.</p>

Troope, and this is termed vocall.</p>

a thing of great consequence to accustome your souldiers to these things, without

Captaine to performe; it shall prove very convenient to take some extraordinary

File in the same manner; from whence will arise such an emulation betweene each

an Island, and the chiefest of our Land forces farre remote from the Maritime places,
where an enemie may possibly land, which will be troublesome, and require much

                        <p>The <hi>Thessalians</hi> were the first inventers of the Rhombe, <note place="margin">It was attributed to <hi>Iason.</hi>

an absolute forme; in regard they were ready to turne their faces every way with

are plac'd in the Fanke, and the commanders in the Angles. <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Captaine in
the Front, and in the right, and left Angles of the Flankes the two ablest Corporalls,
and the Livetenant in the reare Angle.</p>

are to make the greatest ranke being the middle most of an uneven number, as of a
11. or 13. or 15. or 17. to which you are to joyne other rankes before and behind,
every one containing two lesse than the former; as if the greatest ranke consisted of
17. the next rankes on either side are to have but 15. the next on either side of those,
but 13 and so every one two lesse, untill at last you come to one, as you may perceive
by the next Figure following; the longest ranke consists of 15. the next of 13, &amp;c.
and so the whole Rhombe hath 113 horse in Battalia: of these I intend to shew you
the order of framing them, although not much used in these late warres: afterwards

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He forme of this Battell called the Wedge, plainely appeares in the
Rhombe, which both Rankes and Files, for the halfe of that
Rhombe is a Wedge.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore first you must beginne with a Ranke of an uneven
number as suppose 15. horse before that Ranke, you must place
another Ranke of 13. having two lesse than the former, and so
you are to proceede untill you end with one, which is the place of the Captaine;
this was the Invention of King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who placed his best men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that by them the weaker might be held in and inabled to charge.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Elian</hi> giveth reasons why the Wedge was in those times accounted better than a
Square forme, which we now have in use, in regard it is apt and proper, artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to breake the Enemies Square battels, for he Compares a Square Battle to an
Axe, for although it be sharper than a Wedge, yet having the edge drawne out
in length it cannot possibly, by strength be driven farre into the Wood, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
of strokes.</p>
                        <p>The Wedge being once entred, insinuateth it selfe, the point being Narrow, and
it holdeth what it getteth, untill at last it divides the Square forme in Sunder, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
never so tough. <hi>Polybius</hi> reports <hi>lib 4. 278.</hi> that the <hi>Thessalians</hi> being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatteled
in this kinde of forme, they could not be resisted by the <hi>Gracians</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Squares.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="314" facs="tcp:18615:176"/>
Moreover the Wedge is of greater strength than the Rhombes, because it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
more hands to fight, for the hinder part of the Rhombe is of no use but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde
surprises, for it avayleth nothing in charging, whereas all parts of the Wedge
are effectuall, <hi>viz.</hi> the point to enter, and the sides even to the flanke corners,
where the reare endeth doth dispart and dissever, and utterly disorder the Enemie,
whereby victory is gained.</p>
                        <p>And questionlesse this forme of a Wedge, were of excellent use in our warres
especially when an enemie is charged in Flanke and Reare, or Front and Flanke,
then this Battell in forme of a Wedge to come full upon the point of the enemies
Battalia, where they shall finde an easie place for entrance, in regard the foote
Troopes are constrained to make a double resistance, both to Front and Flanke, so
that there will be a space open for entrance; and then the sides of this Wedge bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
will give such a Valley upon the point, that of necessity they cannot be able to
withstand it.</p>

Square Battels, in regard they were oppinionated that forme
was the easiest to be framed, and best for Motion, besides the ablest
men were plac't in Front, and had all the principall Commanders,
to lead them on, to give the Enemie a charge, the weapons which
the Horsemen used were Speares, <note place="margin">Leo Chap. 5. Sect. 3. <hi>and</hi> Cap. 6. Sect. 39.</note> of such a wonderfull length to

Cubtis in length, that is 24. foote; and <hi>Livy</hi> verifies the same that their Pikes were
very unwildy in regard of their bignesse and length, and then they for the most part
did order their horse Troopes eight deepe in File, as <hi>Polybius</hi> speaketh plainely;
who was Generall of the Horse of the <hi>Achaeans;</hi> besides <hi>Leo</hi> in his seventh Chapter
writeth after this manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <note place="margin">Leo Cap 7. Sect. 81<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cap. 14. Sect. 70.</note> If there be many horse (saith he) <hi>(viz.)</hi> above twelve

and ready to be broken; by this we may conjecture that the filing of Troopes five
deepe was not a thing inforc't of necessitie, untill such times as they found the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of their over-long Speares; so that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> caused their
Speares to be but 15. or 16. foote in length, and then five horse in depth was rather
at the most, (then otherwise) to make use of those short weapons to offend the
Enemy in their charge.</p>
                        <p>They further aimed to order their Battells, so that the Battalias might seeme square,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> as deepe in Flanke, as broad in Front, so that thereby, the enemy might be
deluded; <note place="margin">Plutarch in Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in Flanke, which seemed as a square, by reason a horse taketh up twice as much
space in his length as in breadth; whereupon finding the inconveniences of those
kinde of squares, they bethought them of a more perfect square, lesse than which
they durst not venture, and more they could not; for want of horse, in regard their
pollicie was to discourage the Enemy by making their Troopes shew more than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
they were; wherefore they framed their Troopes of 50. horse, and ordered
them tenne in Ranke, and five in File; which forme represents a square, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the five horse take up as much ground in their length, as the tenne doe in
breadth, and this proportion they held best, for had there beene sixe, seven, or eight
horse in a File, <note place="margin">Leo Cap. 12. Sect. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their squares, as <hi>Leo</hi> after confessed.</p>
                        <p>But our manner of charging the Enemy differs from theirs; for wee are to give
fire upon the Enemy by Rankes, and so fall off into the Reare, so that all the Rankes
shall come up and give fire by degrees upon the Enemy, whereas their Troopes gave
a firme close charge, and wheeled off together; this was the use both of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Spearemen.</p>

                           </note> although they have abandoned the use of their
Speares, yet they have detained their forme of ordering their Troopes, five deepe
in file; and because each horseman hath two Pistolls, therefore they suppose that
they may charge and discharge as well as the foote Troopes that are tenne deepe
(with one Musquet for their armes) but let the ablest horseman of them all say
what he please; he shall finde it another businesse, especially if both sides stand to
their tackling, untill all the Rankes have given fire; for the small distance of time,
and the ordering of their unruly horses, will make them fall short of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
but indeede our horse Troopes, seldome stand so long in competition for the
victory; but that one side either retreates, or doe worse; for if they should, it
should be easily seene that that Troope whose Files were ordered sixe in deepth,
would soone weare through the adverse part, whose extent is but five.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I could wish that all our Troopes might be so ordered, in regard it is
a number so proper and apt, either to be divided, or to be doubled, or to be drawne
into any forme of Embattelling, wherefore more than sixe are unprofitable, and
lesse than sixe are not so serviceable.</p>
                        <p>In former ages they were driven to their inconvenience, in regard they were
scanted of horse; and so to make their fronts equall with the Enemies; they in
pollicie framed their Battalias but of five deepe; whereas their Enemies were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of many more, as 6. 8. or 10. many times; but after they had found out their
pollicy (which) was only to make the fronts of their Battells equall with theirs, being
constrained in regard of their thinnesse to line them with shot, and to have stands of
Pikes to rescue them to make them abler to resist their enemies streng Phalange; <note place="margin">

Enemy may passe through: then facing your Troope inwards, you are to charge
them upon the Flankes; you are to performe the like if you have a Battalia made of
two Troopes; and being charged by the Enemy, they are to divide themselves as
before, but keepe each Troope whole and entire; or you may cause three or foure
files of each of your wings to advance forward on the sudden, and to charge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
upon the Flankes; and to equall your Enemies Front, you may cause the halfe
Files of your Body to double your Front to the right and left hand by divisions.</p>

the next thing to be considered of, is how you may best hinder the Enemy from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Troopes into a body, wherefore some few Musquetires or Firelocks
are to be sent some by-way, where secretly they must get betwixt the Guard and
the Sentinells to cut off their retreate; the residue of the Musquetires are to creepe
to the Allarme place, and there to place themselves neere the passage where the
Enemy is to enter with his Troopes; and having the advantage of some Hedges,
Bankes, or pales, for to hide and secure them from the Horse, these shot shall give
fire upon the Enemy as they come scattering into the Alarme place.</p>
                        <p>In the meane time one of your Troypes of Harquebuziers or Carabines shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
secretly and without noise towards the Sentinell, and suddenly surprise him
by the helpe of the shot that lies behinde him: then speedily they are to fall upon
the guard and surprise them, before they shall have time to mount themselves, from
thence this Troope is to march forwards into the chiefe streetes of the Village with
a certaine number of Musquetiers following them close at the heeles, and there they
are to make their stand: the shot shall then Ranke themselves before the Horse;
the first ranke upon their knees; the second are somewhat to stoope, the third ranke
is to stand upright, and so to give a whole Volley upon the Enemy at once, and then
they are to fall off and march downe by the Flankes of the Horse into the Reare of
them, and there they are to order themselves as before in a readinesse to give fire
upon the enemy that shall seeke to charge them in the Reare; in the meane time the
horse are to advance forwards and charge the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The rest of your Troopes if there be foure or five of them, are to be imployed
in foure or five severall places, <hi>viz.</hi> one Troope is to follow the first Troope to
assist them; where if they they finde no resistance they shall possesse the Allarme
place, and assist the Musqueteirs that are layed in ambush, likewise there must bee
certaine Horse appointed to scoure the streetes continually, whereby the Enemie
shall be hindred from gathering together.</p>
                        <p>Your third Troope is to come Marching fairely unto the Allarme place.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Troope is to follow softly after, and where they heare any broyles or

                        <p>If at any time any of your Horse Troopes should meete, the Enemie

the sayd 300. horse are to face about and sustaine the Charge, which cannot but be
to the Enemies Confusion. In great ambushes you must make your number seeme as
small as may be, but in small ones you are to make shew of a greater number than
you have; wherefore your number being small all your horse must not Sally out of
the Ambushcado at once, but some 12. or 15. must remaine in the wood at the

such a politique advantage hath beene conquered; as appears by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Philip Macedon</hi> assisting the Thebanes in Greece against the
Phocians; by taking his advantage brought the Country under his own
Command; also the Romanes assisting the Sicilians against the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagenians
possest themselves of the Iland; likewise the Brittaines being ayded by
the Saxons, were by them thrust out of all: The same Cup tasted the Irish, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
the ayd of the English, were by them dispossessed: wherefore there is no
confidence to bee put in forraigne assistance; for they will not ingage themselves,
nor venter their lives when danger approcheth, as by the example of <hi>Francis Sforza</hi>
assisting the Millanois, he revolted to the Florentines in expectation of higher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment:
Likewise <hi>Gucapo Picinino</hi> assisting the King of Naples, left him in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of Battell; the Switzers did the like to the French. It is a thing most easie
for a forreigne ayde (if they be more potent) to keepe possession in a Kingdome, and
by drawing in more forces to them, to drive out the Natives; or if they be lesse in
power, to side with the Enemy, and so share the Kingdome betwixt them, as the
Burgundians did ayding the Romanes in Galacia against the Frankes; and joyning
with them overthrew the Romanes: these brittle helpes makes the remedie worse
then the disease; so that they are least to be trusted, and last to be tryed.</p>
                        <p>A politique Nation are ready to assist in three causes: as first when some man in
high authoritie upon discontent or desire of revenge openeth a way for them, as
Count <hi>Iulian</hi> did, drawing the Saracens into Spaine to be revenged of <hi>Don Roderigo</hi>
who had ravish'd his daughter.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, when a weaker faction maketh way for them to overthrow, or at least
counterpoise a stronger; as the Burgundians oppressed by the faction of the Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
made way for <hi>Henry</hi> the fift to passe into France: Likewise our English Barons,
being likely to have beene vanquish'd by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> sent for Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
to assist them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, when a Kingdome is over-burthened by a forraine foe, whom he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
able to repell nor resist; he is constrained to make use of a forraine friend; in this
ease as one wisely saith, <hi>plus a medico est, quam a morbo mali.</hi>

because their revolt might indanger a Country: or if a Generall

Townes standing in great suspition of revolt, and divers men of
note in them not to be trusted, whereby a conquest is unperfect; it
is his best policie to command them to beate downe the walles of
their Townes, and banish some of their Citizens whom most doubt is to be made of;
and this must be so carried that no Towne so commanded might thinke that this
charge concernes any other then themselves particularly: in practising whereof, the
command must be given to all the Townes at one instant, to the intent they might
all immediately obey; and have no respit to consult one with the other; and as for
those that are held in suspition for revolting, the fairest way is to give them some
commission to negotiate certaine affaires a-far off in such a place that they can worke

the Governour made choyce of two English men, (who in

Campe, to let him understand that the strength of the Towne was
most English, and that for divers discontents they were ready to
mutinie; and that (if it pleased him) hee could infect some chiefe
Captaines that should command the principall Guards to give way
for his entrance into the Towne; and (that the Governour should not mistrust any
treachery) they would onely shoot pouder at them in their Ordnance and Musquets
without Bullets; and that at such a night hee should not faile of his enterprise; and
for the better assurance, one of those English-men was to be left in hostage to be slaine
if they did not really effect it: whereupon the Prince gave them large gifts, with
great promises of future preferment. The signe being given that the Duke should
come with his Army, the English Hostage was bound hand and foot, and (for
their better security) was carried in the Front of the Army; that if any treason
should be, he might be the first should suffer: so (finding the Ports open, and the
Pieces discharged onely with powder) made them come flocking upon the Bridge;
but so soone as the formost was entred with the English Gentleman that was their
Hostage; the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> let downe the Port-cullisses; and (being ready with
the whole strength of the Towne) gave them such a Volley both of great and small

they entred their Quarters, where suddenly sounding their Trumpets, and beating
their Drummes, and making an infinite shout, some firing the Tents, others slaying
all that stood in opposition, others lying in ambush at the Ports of the Campe, to
murther those that fled out; thus with suddaine noise, fire, and slaughter, the other
were so amased, that they fled to the Ports and were slaine; others got over the
Workes to the second Campe, and were taken by the <hi>Roman</hi> ambushment, so that
none could possibly escape to carry newes to the next Campe. This being finisht, the
<hi>Romans</hi> made all possible haste to the second Campe, where they arrived by breake
of day, finding that more easie to enter than the first; for some were fetching Wood,
others Forrage, some walking, others at victuals, and none ready to make a defence,
these they cut off; others arming in the meane time made resistance, but when
they saw the fresh blood besmeared upon their swords and shields; their hearts fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they then knowing the other Campe was taken, and their Friends slaine.
Thus in one night, were two Armies overthrowne, 37000 slaine, and 1800 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners

intents, and being brought before him by the Watch, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi>
being sensible of the plot, wisht them to drive back
divers Cattell, as if they had gotten them as a prey from
the Enemies; this course they often used, so that it was
thought marvaile that they so often enterprised such
feates, and ever escaped unslaine; the Porter and Mayor
of the City they used very kindly, giving unto them part
of their prey for their courtesie and paines, being so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and vigilant to open the Ports for their going out and in; the residue, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon the Governour for his love and leave; the Porter was so accustomed, that
at their first whistle at all times of the night, the Gates were opened unto them, all
things being brought to a good passe for the accomplishing of their project. <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi>
Army lying within foure dayes journey from the Towne, he feigned himselfe
very sicke, and that it was the onely reason he stayed there so long, this was bruited
abroad, the night being appointed <hi>Haniball</hi> made choise of ten thousand Horse and
Foot, of the lightest armed, and removed from his Campe in the night, making
speed untill he came within fifteene miles of the City of <hi>Tarrent,</hi> where he secretly
abode, charging his men in no wise to breake their array and order, but to be ready
to performe what was commanded; wherefore he first set forth to palliate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,
and to the intent that none of the Country should descrie his Army, he sent
fourescore Numidian horsemen to go before him, commanding them to over-run the
Country, by which his Army should passe, and those they overtooke to bring back, and
if they met with any they should kill them; to the intent they should be taken by the
Inhabitants, for Robbers and Theeves, and not men of Warre; the fame of these Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
came to the eares of the Governour of <hi>Tarrent,</hi> who smally regarded it, because he
thought <hi>Haniball</hi> was sick, and his Army so farre a distance from the Town. He inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the next morne to send forth some men of Armes to drive back those Robbers; the
same night removed <hi>Haniball</hi> his Army to <hi>Tarrent,</hi> having <hi>Philomenes</hi> with him for his
guide, being arrived neere the Towne it was appointed that <hi>Philomenes</hi> according to
his custome should enter the Towne with a number of armed men; he having awaked
the Porter, telling him hee had brought a mighty Bore which hee had slaine; at the
first call hee opened the Gates, and two young men of his companions first went in,
then entred hee and other his servants, plucking in the great Bore; the Porter being
glaring at his greatnesse, <hi>Philomenes</hi> slue him with his Bore-speare, and incontinent
let in thirty other Souldiers armed, who slue the other Watchmen at the same Port,
and without noyse let in the rest of the Army, and secretly brought them into the
Market-place, where they abode without noyse; in the meane time <hi>Haniball</hi> with a
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:18615:197"/>
sufficient strength arrived at another Port; and first having made a great fire afarre
off, which was the signe betwixt him and <hi>Nico,</hi> who abode with other his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
ready within the Towne looking for his comming; which so soone as <hi>Nico</hi>
perceived, hee answered him with another fire; notice being taken on both sides,
the fire was put out, and <hi>Haniball</hi> approacht to the Gates; <hi>Nico</hi> also within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
came to the Ports guard, and slue all the Watch, and opened the Ports, so as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi>
with his Army entred, his Horse were commanded to remaine in Batalia
without; hee being arrived in the Market-place with <hi>Philomenes,</hi> and his other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
then had hee two thousand French-men, which hee divided into three parts,
and sent them to divers parts of the City; the residue he commanded to keepe the
most accustomed streetes of the Towne, and to slay the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers; the
Alarme being given, they saw there was no way but death or yeelding; wherefore
the greatest number fled to a Castle in the Towne, which was of great strength, and
upon all advantages they might, Sallyed out into the Towne; Wherefore <hi>Haniball</hi> had
another Project at his fingers ends, he caused his Men to raise a Wall to hemme them
in, and dreaming they would issue out of the Castle to hinder the worke, hee placed
an ambush in a secret and convenient place, which should cut them off, and disable
them from anoying the Towne; And accordingly it hapned, for the worke-folkes
gave suddenly back at their approch, which heartened them to go on the further, so as
the Ambushment surprized the greatest part of them: but suddenly there came Ships
of Warre from <hi>Metapontus,</hi> and entred the Haven, and relieved the Castle; and kept
all provision from the Towne, so as the Towne was like to indure want before their
Enemies, hee presently summoned a Councell, it was found there was no way to
hinder those Shippes, but by a greater force of Shipping, and that no shipping could
enter the mouth of the Haven, because they had fortified against them; whereupon
hee devised to hale their Shippes out of a creeke, and by Engines and Wheeles to
draw them thorow the spacious streetes, and so convey them into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
which hee performed, and made gimselfe Master both of Towne and Castle; I
have beene the more tedious in relating this Project, because in it there is nothing
but is of great consequence to be observed by a Souldier.</p>

a story of a Merchant of Lyons, who was exceeding rich both in Banque, and in
other goods and Possessions; and being noted for a notable Vsurer, hee went one
day walking into the Countrey; onely accompanied with his servant; and as they
were entred into a great Champion Field, the Servant began his illusions, speaking
unto him, and telling him that hee was an Angell which came unto him purposely
from God, to tell him, that he should give and distribute part of his goods ill gotten
unto the poore; and that hee should liberally recompence his Servant that had of
a long time served him without any reward or preferment at all received from him:
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18615:199"/>
the Merchant being astonished and abused at the voyce, demanded of his Servant if
he heard nothing, repeating unto him the strange voice himselfe had heard; the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
(counterfeiting a kinde of wonder and astonishment) denyed that he heard any
thing; and immediately (with a voice farre more stronger and subtill then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
hee repeated the same words againe, and that with such admiration of the
Merchant, that he was brought into a full beliefe that it was an Angell from Heaven
that spake unto him; insomuch, that being arrived in his lodging, he gave unto his

to carry Butter, Tobacco, and Cheese to the besieged Towne,
making shew of having narrowly, and with great danger escaped
the Enemies Sentinels and Guards: and being arrived hee was
to offer his service to the Governour to carry Letters from him to

Souldiers, in regard of the provision hee brought, and the Governour desirous to
know particulars, examined him about <hi>Spinola's</hi> Campe, about the passage hee found
into the Towne, and what was the received opinion abroad of the state of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires:
the fellow (being subtill) related many true things, and feigned as many of
his owne head, which begat a great beliefe in them of his honestie and trust; at last
being demanded whether he durst carry any Letters by that passage by which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
into the Towne; hee shewed himselfe at first fearfull and doubtfull what to
answer; suffered them by promises to worke him to that, to which of all things
(under pretence of backwardnesse) hee desired to bee perswaded. The Governour
therefore trusted him with his Letters to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> promising him great
rewards, if he brought him an answer: Hee promised to doe his best; but in his

sealed them up againe fairely, and dispatched this subtill fellow away with

caught in carrying his Brothers Letters to <hi>Breda,</hi> through the waters in the Winter

this trusty Messenger, did undertake to pay him what was owing him, with much
more, if he would now once againe adventure to carry one of his Letters to the
Towne, as he had convayed many of his Brothers heretofore; the woman knowing
her lesson, objected the danger of the passage, and the disease of her husband, but in

undertooke to perswade her husband, whereupon she departed to fetch her husband
to the Prince, who returned with her counterfeiting a lamenesse, as if his feet had

upon a peece of Iron skrewed into the Port with a Forke, to stay it close, and to

they
are made of is Brasse three parts, and Tinne one; which being cast in a Mould are
made hollow, and about halfe an Inch thicke; the Brasse must bee melted before the
Tinne be put in; the fashion is of a Pomgranat: the Concavitie is to bee filled halfe
full of fine corne-powder, and the other halfe next the vent, is to be filled with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine-Powder,
mingled with Rosin beaten to powder, so that for three parts of
Serpentine-powder, you take one of Rosin; then putting into the Snowt or hole of
it a little fine Powder, which makes it fire the sooner: being held in the Right-hand
ready to cast from you (at the same instant fire being given to it with a Match)
it is tost over into the Enemies Workes, where it breakes in divers peeces, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all neere it; the fashion of them you may behold in the next Figure following.
There is no way to prevent the force of these, but by extinguishing them with raw
Hides, or tumbling them into water to choke the Powder before the Priming-powder
bee burnt to the Corne-powder; wherefore divers Souldiers are to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
with Skoopes, and others with Hides to quench them in the water, or to
choake them for want of vent.</p>
                        <p>There are some <hi>Granadoes</hi> made without a snowte very round, only a vent-hole
whereby it is filled with Powder, as you see at the Figure <hi>B,</hi> this being filled with
fine powder, is to bee put into an Earthen-pot; so farre bigger, that it may hold it,
and a quantity of Powder besides; then divers threds of Cotton being folded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and boyled in Salt-Peeter and Brimstone to make it apt to hold fire, the said Pot
being covered at the mouth with a skinne close tyed, then crossing the Pot with a
peece of Wyer, as you perceive at the figure <hi>D,</hi> divers peeces of this Match is tyed
about it being well lighted; so that when the Pot is throwne and breakes with the
fall, the Match fires the Powder, whereby the <hi>Granado</hi> is also fired; And this is the
securest way to throw them: Note if the <hi>Granado</hi> be of Glasse, then the skrew-tappe
that is to goe into the vent-hole to carry the Priming-powder must be of Wood, for
the Glasse will breake so soone as the fire toucheth it; View the Figure.</p>

fastened unto it, and this is strongly lockt: upon the top of this Bome, goes a thick
barre of Iron from end to end, which hath large strong pikes rivited into it three
or foure inches one from the other.</p>

Lastly, the iron plate or Barre is rivited to the Bome, so that it cannot possibly be
cut in sunder, neyther can they have their Boates over it by reason of the Pikes;
this they may open and shut at pleasure; Many times they use iron chaines, but they
are more chargeable and not so good, in regard a Boat will runne over it. <hi>View the

earth, and so conveying them to the fittest place where the water is
narrowest and shallowest, and there to sinke them; Likewise by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
old sackes full of Earth or Sand, and casting them into the water,
will damme up a small Haven, and will hinder the passage of all kind of Vessels from
releeving a besieged Towne; and by this the breach of an arme of the Sea may bee
stopped, but first it must be well pyled to stay the Vessells and Earth from being
washed away; wherefore they must take the opportunity of a low-water to worke
in, and have sufficient helpe to lay the foundation sure, for feare of blowing up;
Moreover, if you feare the water will decay some weake place of the banke, then
there must be a stancke made to shelve off the force of the water; also if there be any
Skonees or other Workes that the water beates against the Wall, and decayes it by
dashing against it; then for the preventing of it, there must bee Mattes made of Sedge
and Bulrushes, which must be staked downe before the Earth, and Hurdles made
with Oysiers.</p>

Also for the Landing up of some shallow place, where the water runneth but in
Winter time, or in great Stormes, the best way is to set it thicke of Oysiers, which
will speedily grow, and keepe up the Sand and Rubbish from washing away, so that
in a short time it will be landed up; View the Figure following.</p>

the manner of framing it, is after this fashion; First, there are two
woodden Rowles, made of strong light wood, either of them being twelve foot long;
one of these Rowles have at each end a Winch, which may be taken off and on like
to a Grindstones; this is to wind and strayten the Ropes that they may lye tyte, at

must be fastned foure strong Ropes, but if there be more Ropes it will be the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
at every footes end there may be one, if the Bridge be twelve or ten foot broad,
then it is but boring so many holes, and drawing so many Ropes thorow: then you
are to take Cord, and knit it with Mashes, like the Mashes of a Flue, so that a mans
foot cannot slip thorow; this Cord being knit all the way fast to the Cordes, one end
of this Bridge is to be transported, either by one or two that can swimme, or in a
Leatherne Boate made for that purpose; the ends of the Rowles are to bee staked
downe strongly, either with Iron stakes made for that purpose, or with woodden;
Next it is to be straitned out straite with Winches, and made fast, you are to note
that over these Ropes and Mashes, there is Canvasse stitched downe to make the

force of the streame: over this Bridge (as <hi>Commines</hi> reports)
marched a hundred thousand men, with all their provision and Ordnance: The
States of the Netherlands have a kinde of an open flat Boat which they terme Punts;
these they convey by water to any place they intend to march over; but if they
march to some remote place, so that they cannot passe by water, then they are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
upon Carriages, and drawne by Horses, which doth them great service to
stow in them Powder, Match, Ammunition, Bread and such like; they are made
like to Horse-boatee flat-bottom'd the ends open and rising, so that when they are
joyned together, the rising ends meeting it is like an Arch, thorow which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

thirty foot long a peece; they are fastned together with iron hookes; and their
Masts and Tacklings are fixed to the sides of them, to strengthen them; the rising
ends of these Punts have ledges nayled halfe a foot distance one from the other, to
prevent the feet both of Men and Horse from sliding; they are stayed with Cables
and Anchors from falling downe with the streame. These are the surest and best
Bridges that ever yet were invented; and very easie to bee conveyed either by

Barrells will force up the Waters before them. Or after the same manner you may
take two Plankes eighteene or twenty inches broad a-peece, and twenty or thirty
foot long, or more; at the lower edges of these Plankes there is a bottome Planke of
the same length and thicknesse closely joyned and fastened; also downe the middest

very troublesome when the Troopes snall joyne at push of Pike; besides, the Pikes

questionlesse in the time of stormie wet weather, these Bowes would doe great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,

were made of such an indifferent bignesse towards the But end, that there might be
disposed in it three Petronell Barrels, made of a very light substance, as there is a new
Invention found out in that kinde; there is a light locke to be plac'd a yard from the
But end, this shall at once pulling up, strike fire twice, having a double pan, and that

be seduc'd by the traines of time; and the preservation of his honour must be his
chiefest aime, next the love and feare he owes to God, having an especiall care that
the Christian Religion be had in due reverence in his Army, causing such Ministers of

learne, and conceive more in a yeere then he possibly can see practised in his life time;
by reason whereof the worthies of ancient times, were portraited with a Booke in
one hand, and a Sword in the other.</p>
                        <p>And because there is no Generall, but is limited by his Prince in his Commission, he
is therfore to observe literally every tittle of it, &amp; not to exceed the limits of it, although
a victory might be attained; in the like kinde, all inferiour Officers are bound to obey
their Generall in all things he shall please to command; which obedience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servancy
made King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> protest, that the true observing of his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by his Generall the Count <hi>de Medina</hi> in 88. was farre more pleasing to him, than
the losse of his Invincible Navy caused griefe.</p>
                        <p>Generalls must be very circumspect in making choice of their Officers, not electing
them for their outward shew, but for their vertuous conditions and approved experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for favour may be prejudiciall in these affaires, and greatnesse of birth is not
to be expected as the sole thing to qualifie a man, and to beget in him the habit of a
souldier.</p>
                        <p>Also a Generall is not to be unmindfull to honour and reward the vertuous and
valiant, as well as to be severe in punishing the vitious and imbellick persons; for he

                        </p>
                        <p>A Generall ought to be very circumspect in Marching his Army in difficult wayes,
especially if the enemy be at hand; for an enemy will waite his occasion, and take the

which will discover the enemy and hold them play, untill all the foote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions

limmes ready to frame the body of the Army upon a sudden.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Likewise a Generall is upon all occasions, to call to counsell his chiefe Officers to
debate of all affaires and designes, taking every mans opinion at large, onely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18615:219"/>
reserving his resolution to himselfe in all secrefie, that none or very few should be
made partakers before the execution.</p>
                        <p>A Generall ought to know the situation of every countrey by his insight in the use
of Maps, and take a true survey of all such parts as his Army is to march thorow, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be plaines or champions, or woody and full of waters; whether or not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with strong Townes and Forts; so that accordingly he may proportion his
Horse and Foot; for in Champion Countries Horses are of greatest use; if situated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Straights and strong Forts, the Army must consist most of Footmen.</p>
                        <p>He is also to gaine perfect intelligence, how his enemy is appointed; how, and in
what kinde his Army is demeaned; for it is no pollicy to follow a light-footed enemy
with an heavy Army.</p>
                        <p>Also a Generall must take notice if any matter of feare or muttering be in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
upon the rumor of giving Battell: <hi>Exercitum terrore plenum Dux ad pugnam

                        <p>A Generall ought also, not onely to have expert Enginers and men of exquisite
knowledge in the arte of fortification, both of Forts, Campes, conducting of Mynes,
planting of Batteries, and disposing of all kind of Trenches; but also to have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himselfe absolute judgement and knowledge; otherwise he may be wondrous
misled, frustrating his designes, which will redound to his great dishonour.</p>
                        <p>He is also to have a speciall consideration of the place he meaneth to incampe and
continue his Army in; first respecting the healthfulnesse of the ayre, then the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the ground, the conveniency of wood and water; and that the enemy may
have no advantage to intercept the releefe and provision that is to be conveyed to
the Campe, either by water or land; that no hills be neere to annoy the Campe, and
that no waters be cut out to drowne it.</p>
                        <p>A Generall must cause his souldiers to take good rest and competent food, before
he presumes to give Battell; for it is a principle in warre, <hi>In pugna milites validius

that shall inflame their spirits, that like lightning they may consume where

                        <p>A Generall is to command his Officers daily to exercise their Companies, which
will inable their bodies, and preserve their healths; and although the enemy should
be far remote, yet duly to observe watches, guards, and setting forth their Sentinells
as carefully, as if the enemy were neere at hand; this will breed an habit and custome
to their bodies, so that it will not seeme grievous to them, when as they shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
those duties in earnest.</p>
                        <p>A Generall must be very circumspect in giving an expresse command to his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
that no abusive drinking be used amongst his Officers, nor Souldiers; <hi>par vino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolentiam

horrible abuses arise by drunkennesse, besides the neglect of their duties, whereby
an enemy takes his advantage to destroy a whole Campe.</p>
                        <p>A Generall is to have speciall care, that there be no quarrels or heart-burnings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his Officers, but speedily to reconcile them, before they goe upon any service,
lest a greater mischiefe insue, as did upon the like difference betwixt <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>A Generall must avoid mutinies, disorders, and abuses in his Army, by commanding
every Regiment to be drawn in parrado, and before the head of the troops; some Officer
to reade such lawes and edicts as are provided for the Army to be governed by, wherby
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18615:219"/>
may not plead ignorance, and if any dares offend wilfully against any of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
immediately to have the punishment inflicted without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                        <p>He is to command divers false allarmes to be made, whereby he shall see in what
a readinesse his Army will be in if necessity required, and if any base cowardlinesse
should be found in any souldier, that should not dare to answer the allarm with speed,
he should be brought before the head of the troops, and his armes broken, and banisht
the Army.</p>
                        <p>If a Generall perceives that the enemy stops his releefe of Victualls and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
that without hazard they cannot arrive; then he must take notice what
Townes, or Forts intercept the passage of reliefe, and give order for the taking of
them in, or strong Convoyes prepared to conduct the carriages; for it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to have an enemy in the Reare of an Army to hold any strong Townes or Forts;
for thereby they have advantage to stay and surprise all releefe, that should sustaine
the Campe.</p>
                        <p>He must be truly informed by Intelligencers, and Guides (whose informations he
must compare with the Map of that Countrey, to see that no false wood be used) how
farre the enemies Townes lye from his Army; he must not be ignorant of the Hills,
Vallyes, Wayes, Straights, Passages, Lakes, Rivers, and Bridges; their number;
quality, distance, with every particular circumstance; whereby he may know how
the enemy may annoy him, and the better he may know how to place his Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Guards, for to prevent him. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was well seene in these
affaires; he knowing the situation of the seventeene Provinces in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
so exactly, that he was able at one time to give directions, how sundry parts and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
should be guarded, what Straights fortifyed, what Levells drowned, either by
sea or fresh water, whereby hee avoyded present and eminent dangers.</p>
                        <p>Before a Generall intends to march with his Army, the wayes are to be skowred
by certaine horsemen, for feare the enemy should lay any Ambuskadoes; and also to
give notice of the conveniency of the wayes for the Souldiers and Artillery to passe;
and also he is to have provided able sufficient Guides to conduct them, the best and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
way.</p>
                        <p>A Generall is to see every Regiment as they march, take their places according to
their antiquities in the Field; but when Companies are in Garrison, that Company
which first enters the Towne hath the priority during the time they stay; also in a
March the eldest Regiment is not continually to have the Vaward, but the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that marcht the first day in the Van, the next day must march in the Reare;
and so proportionably every Regiment must take his turne if the march continues;
and in the morning before they dislodge, a peece of Ordnance is to be discharged
first, whereby the Army takes notice they are to march; at the second report of the
Ordnance, every Company is in armes ready to march; and at the third report of the
Cannon, the first Regiment marcheth.</p>
                        <p>If divers Nations should be in an Army, every particular Nation is to be quartered
in a division by themselves, and not to mixe Companies to avoyd quarrells: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
if the number be great of the Mercenary Nations, it is best to divide them, both
in marching and imbattelling, lest they should be treacherous, or cowardly; for
there is no confidence nor trust can be reposed in them, unlesse they be conveniently
placed in the Battell, so as they may be yoaked in and tyed to performe their best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
If an enemy should keepe a Straight to hinder the marching of the Army;
a Generall must draw out both Horse and Foote to charge them in either Flancke,
and then the residue to fight out their way in the Front of them.</p>
                        <p>Also a Generall must be very expert in distinguishing the severall seates of the
Drum, which is his voyce in the time of warre; the souldiers are also to be taught the
understanding of the same, that they may accordingly demeane themselves as the
beate of the Drumme commands.</p>
                        <p>A Generall is to give to the Serjeant-Major-Generall of the Army the watchword,
which is privately to be kept and returned to all inferiour Officers; by which word,
they may passe the whole Army through; this watchword is to be altered every night.</p>
                        <p>A Generall is to cause lots or billets to be made, with the names of every particular
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18615:220"/>
guarde written in them, those are to be rowled up, and put into a hat by the Major,
and so every inferiour officer drawes his guard; by this meanes disputes are preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the enemy cannot corrupt an officer to give over a guard, because it is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
who shall have that watch; also to give order to the inferiour Officers, for the
due and orderly releeving of the watch, morning and evening.</p>
                        <p>A Generall is to draw his whole Army into Battallia and to see them exercised in
grosse, changing them into divers formes of Battell; the footemen are to be ordered
in divers small Battallions, whereof are framed the right Wing, the Battell, and the
left Wing; the Battell is to consist of as many more men as either of the Winges
doth; the Horsemen are to bee devided into divers Battallia's, so as they may one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the other; the one halfe of the horse, are to be plac'd on the right Wing of the
Army, the other on the left, unlesse one of the Wings, and the reare of the battell
may be secured by Rivers, Bogges, or Rockie ground, so that the enemy may not
take advantage with his horse; then they are to be ranged only upon one Wing, they
are to be plac'd a sufficient distance from the foote, lest by their disorderly retreate
they annoy their owne foot-troopes; divers foote and horse are to be ranged a good
distance before the Army, which are termed the forlorne hopes, in regard they are first
to charge the enemy; these troopes being thus ordered are to be taught how to advance
and retreat, performing all actions, as ample as if the enemy were encountring with
them. This kind of exercise will make them ready, and orderly in their performances,
otherwise it may prove dangerous to bring them to the encounter.</p>
                        <p>A Generall is to animate his souldiers in time of need to take paines; as the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Emperour <hi>Vespasian</hi> who was the first man that carried a Basket of earth to the
Fortification, that his souldiers might not thinke scorne to imitate him; it is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
obedient minde, and the hard painefull body, that makes the noble soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</p>
                        <p>A Generall must take away all hope of refuge from his souldiers in time of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
as <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour and <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> did send away their shipping that
there souldiers should hope for nothing but either victory, or a grave; and in many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells
troopes of horses have been placed in the reare of the Army, to put to the sword
all such as turne head to looke for refuge.</p>
                        <p>It is not sufficient for a Generall to get a victory, but also to know how to use it, for

by the history of <hi>Bayan Chinsan,</hi> who was Generall to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Emperour,
after he had vanquisht his enemy at <hi>Cinguinguy,</hi> by their carelesnesse, disorders, and
drunkennesse, were set upon in the night by the remnant remaining, who put them all
to the sword.</p>
                        <p>It is very dangerous for a Generall to present battell to an enemy in such a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

necessity may make an enemy desperate. If a Generall sees his horse-troopes too weak
to encounter with the Enemies, then he must give order for divers shot to march up
in file with the horse; then seeing their advantage, to breake out from them, and gall
the enemy; these shot would be often exercised with the horse to make them apt to give
an assault, and also upon occasion to reunite themselves into a body to make a defence.</p>
                        <p>If a Generall drawes out any Winges of shot, (to charge and skirmish with the
enemy) any farre distance before the body of the Army; then they ought to be
backed with a guard of Pikes, which are to rescue them from the charge of horse, as
also to aide them if they should joyne pell mell with the enemies forlorne hope; but
this is to be performed long before the bodyes of either Armyes can meet, which kind
of skirmishes are for divers good ends; as first, to discover, and winne some ground
of advantage, or to give the souldiers courage, by seeing how those loose bands doe
valiantly foyle those of the enemy, in which skirmishes some politicke stratageme
is to be used, to skare and affright the enemy; for any unexpected accident, will
seeme strange to an Army, although it be never so small, and will be ready to
disorder them; he that commands these troopes must be very wise and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
left hee falles into the enemies stratagems, which may discourage the
Armie.</p>
                        <p>Also a Generall is not to trust to a seeming victory; for many times good successe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18615:220"/>
at the first, in a battell, occasioneth the overthrow of many great actions, as we have
the example of <hi>Theoderick,</hi> Generall of the Germans; his army being very potent,
had gotten the best of <hi>William</hi> Earle of Flanders at the first encounter, which made
the Germans confident, and the rather secure, in regard their strength exceeded the
Flemmings; but the Flemmings being rather desperate than resolute; and by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Earle they had so reunited their broken troopes, and with a furious charge
did so shake and disorder the Germans, that many of them were slaine, and the rest
put to flight.</p>
                        <p>If a Generall or some other great Commander, or if any part of the Army should
be cut off by the enemy, it is best to keep it from the knowledge of the rest of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
lest it dishearten them.</p>
                        <p>If an Army bee to march in the darke; to avoyd confusion, command must bee
given that every souldier shall carry the end of his Leaders pike or weapons from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any noise: and by that means they shall keep right in their ranks.</p>
                        <p>A Generall in time of battell must be very wise and discreet, to give order when
the skirmishers of the loose-banded Maniples shall make their recreat, and to what
place; also when the Horse shall charge, and what part of the enemies divisions they
shall assault; and to give order what foot-men shall be drawne out to succour them
if occasion be; also what Battalia's shall advance forwards, and when to retreat;
likewise when the whole body of the Army shall charge, and what divisions shall
pursue the victory; alwayes remembring to keep the maine Battell stedfast, and not
to move in pursuit after the vanquisht enemy; also to have Officers in the time of
fight, to gather together such stragling souldiers as shall bee disrank't and in disorder,
and so make a body of them in the reare of the Army.</p>
                        <p>There are sundry opinions about the place of a Generall in the time of giving bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell:
but questionlesse, the best and securest place is before the battell of succour; but
at the first he may stand in the front of the maine battell, untill such time as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
hopes are beaten in: he is to ride upon a small Palfrey, having a guard of able
gentlemen in like sort attending him, the which he may send to and fro upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
to give Officers intelligence of his pleasure.</p>
                        <p>If a Generall shall perceive fresh aids are approaching, then let him use his best
endeavours to give the enemy battell before they arrive; and also to draw out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
force to meet those aids, and give them battell in some place of greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                        <p>If a Generals victuals, amunition or pay begins to faile, then let him endeavour
to give his enemy battell, if he suspect Supplies: but if he knowes his enemy is in want
either of victuals, amunition, &amp;c. or that sicknesse, mutinies or the like are in his Army,
so that any hope be that his Army may of it selfe dissolve, then a Generall must stand
strongly upon his guard, and by all meanes avoid joyning battell, as was practised
by the Prince of Orange about fourteene yeares since, when <hi>Grave Hendrick Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg</hi>
marcht over the river <hi>Ysell</hi> in a great frost, by the Towne of <hi>Duesburgh</hi> into
the <hi>Vello,</hi> with ten thousand men; where his Excellency and the States of <hi>Holland</hi>
might have given him battell with a great deale of conveniency, but he rather suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to pillage the Dorpes and burne where he pleased, because hee knew hee could
not stay long, nor march far from the river, lest the frost should have broke, and he
disappointed of his returne.</p>
                        <p>If a Generall hath had victory triumphed on his side, a little perswasion will serve
to cause the Souldiers to encounter a second time; for as the proverbe saith, <hi>victoria
victoriam parat, animumque victoribus anget, &amp; adversariis anfert:</hi> for questionlesse
one victory begets another, and puts great courage into those that have already had
the better; and it beats the edge of courage and spirit from those that have beene bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
wherefore a Generall must be very wise and carefull how hee brings on his men
to fight after an overthrow once received, unlesse it bee upon great advantages and
firme hopes of a Conquest.</p>
                        <p>When a Generall intends to make a retreat from his enemy, hee must bee very
circumspect &amp; careful in his carriage, and demeaning of his actions for his better safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and strengthning, for feare his souldiers perceive any cause of feare should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
him, in regard of the nearnesse or potency of the enemies army; but hee is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18615:221"/>
to let his souldiers understand that his retreat is to draw the enemy after him to bee
surprized in some ambushkado; or rather, if it may bee with conveniency, for his
better advantage to give the enemy battell: for there are divers inconveniences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a retrait, if the enemie be in view: for although a Generall may ayme at some
place of better advantage, yet unhappily there may bee divers ill passages and
streights to hinder their quick passage: besides, these kinde of retraits breede a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
both in souldiers and their Officers; for they know that hee that forsakes the
field feares some danger: so that the safest way is either to recreat before an enemy
be at hand, or being neare at hand, secretly in the night; for it is a Maxime to be
observed, Rather to retreat in the darke than be beaten in the light: <hi>Si certamen

(saith a learned Generall). But indeed of all motions in the warre, a safe retrait
is the most difficult, but that danger will ever attend, as <hi>Monluc</hi> high Marshall of
France once said, <hi>Je ne trove poynt nul fait des armes choses si difficille qu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ne retraite:</hi> A
Generall must have a jealous eye over an enemy that is revolted from his King, and
beware what confidence hee reposeth in him; for divers respects; as namely, first,
they are not to be used in any great enterprizes, neither are they to be trusted in any
frontier Towne or Fort of any consequence; for they may redeeme their reputations,
liberties and estates lost, by surrendring up those Forts: The French had experience
of this when <hi>Don Pedro de Navarro</hi> (being banisht Spaine) was trusted with <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,</hi>
and to gaine his former freedome, he surrendred up this Towne, <hi>anno 1523.</hi>
A Generall may make use of a Treason, but let him never trust the Traitor.</p>
                        <p>A Generall must take this for a Maxime; If a Commander of any high authority

be sure afterwards to be rewarded to purpose. A delinquent regaining liberty, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the estate of an army and the life of a Generall: for high spirits will seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
as by our late wofull experience of that treacherous <hi>Felton,</hi> who spightfully
murthered our noble Generall, the Duke of Buckingham: therefore there is but three
wayes for a Generall to deale with such wilfull transgressors, whose spirits cannot
be subjected: namely, first to put them to present execution; although it be a solemne
thing, yet it must be allowed where it cannot be helped; but where with safety it may
be helped it is to be disallowed. The second is to keepe a delinquent close prisoner, or
confine him to the custody of some man in trust, and in this there is a great caution to
be used; for our Histories report of <hi>Morton</hi> Bishop of Ely, who was committed to
the custody of <hi>Buckingham</hi> by King <hi>Richard</hi> the third; he by his policie not onely
gained his owne freedome, but wrought the Duke to his owne faction. The third
and last is the more noble and gentile, and in most cases surest; and that is a free
and gracious pardon both of life and for liberty; which, although of it selfe, it may
seem partly unsafe, yet if the delinquent be of a noble disposition, and have any spark of
worth in him, there is no better way to endeare him to his Superiour, than by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him promotions and honours, or advancing him to some place of gaine or trust:
This was practised by <hi>Oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> who not onely pardoned <hi>Marius Celsus,</hi> the chiefe man
of <hi>Galba</hi>'s faction, but put him in a place of great command and honour in the Wars
against <hi>Vtelius:</hi> He yeelding this reason for it, <hi>Ne hostis metum reconciliationis adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret:</hi>
a pardoned enemy is jealous of the breach making up.</p>
                        <p>The chiefest meanes whereby a souldier will bee drawne to love and honour his
Generall, is by receiving courteous carriage, and carefull provision for those that are
wounded and maymed in the Warres, and by a strict command that the Officers do
not wrongfully abuse them: if any souldier should be taken prisoner, order is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be taken for his ransome. This will encourage souldiers to venture themselves
upon all perilous dangers.</p>
                        <p>A Generall ought to be very carefull to prevent discontents, and to appease muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which for the most part grow from the neglect of the due and well paying of
the souldiers their weekly pay, which drawes infinite dangers after it: for usually
they take the advantage to rebell, when the most present and urgent occasion of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is to be performed; as appeared at the siege of Ostend, where Duke <hi>Albertus</hi>
his forces would not be entreated to goe upon the service intended, without they had
first their present pay, which he, not being able to performe, nor having the art to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18615:221"/>
into their affection to gaine their patience and loves, but rather trusting to his
power to reduce them to his service by force of armes, caused two thousand of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to revolt to the enemy, which might have been the ruine of his designe. In such
a desperate case, there is no better way to prevent them, than by making loving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
and large promises, and to satisfie so farre as ability will extend. They
that are the chiefest in the faction, in a fit time and season are to bee privately appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
and punished, whereby the whole faction will be enervated and weakned
by degrees, and the inferiours seeing the chiefest in the rebellion to bee surprized, will
yeeld quietly of themselves, so that they shall be brought under obedience without any
hazzarding of the Generals person.</p>
                        <p>A Generall must conceive, that advice may be given and taken to a mans owne
destruction: for it may as well bee the wise mans fall, as the fooles advancement; and
is oftnest most dangerous in wounding, when it stroakes with a silken hand: for a
base Polititian is indeed a devouring furie in the shape of friendship, to advantage his
deceit the more.</p>
                        <p>That Generall that is not truely wise and valiant, soone loseth his Command,
and growes contemptible, and by his owne folly or feares, infects his troopes with
cowardize. It is reported of <hi>Caesar,</hi> (by <hi>Cicero)</hi> That in all his command in War,
there was not found an <hi>It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> but a <hi>Veni;</hi> taking it as a great dishonour to himselfe to
be any thing but the forwardest Leader in all his designes.</p>
                        <p>If any discontents and quarrels should arise in a Generalls Campe, between Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of great Authority and Command, it is not safe for a Generall to take part of
any side, but rather to mediate peace betweene them; for the contrary side that sees he
is despised or neglected, will study a revenge; as by the example of the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> who falling out in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his Court, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersets</hi>
part was chiefly taken; whereupon <hi>Warwick</hi> rebelled, and deadly Warres
continued twenty nine yeares, untill there was a generall confusion of both Houses:
so that the safest way, if peace cannot be mediated, is to confine them both, untill they
be glad to desire friendship of themselves.</p>
                        <p>A Generall ought in some kindes to participate in the wants and distresses of his
Souldiers, which makes them the more willing to undergoe it; as <hi>Alexander</hi> did,
who marching with his Army through a dry barren Countrey, where the Armie was
almost famisht, a Souldier brought him an helmet of water, who courteously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
him, and told him hee durst not drinke it unlesse there were sufficient for all
his Souldiers, and so cast it upon the ground; testifying, that he desired to fate no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than his Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>Also a Generall ought to take notice, that his Honour and all his Actions are
much subject to be dimmed and disgraced; especially, if hee seekes not to be beloved
and honoured of his Army: besides, it is the policie of a subtill enemy to study and
labour how to undervalue and disgrace Commanders, so, that their Souldiers may
have a base and poore opinion of their worths, whereby all enterprizes or designes,
taking no effect, shall be censured and ambiguously construed. <hi>Nihil est quod malè
narrando non possit depravari.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Generall is to consider, that in all treaties of peace and friendship, these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
are first to be cosidered,: In the first place, either betweene the victor
and the vanquished: secondly, betweene those, that having warred together, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
equall termes of advantage: thirdly, betweene those that have lived alwayes in
good agreement without any quarrell. Unto the Victor the vanquished must yeeld,
and patiently endure the imposition of some strict Covenants, which otherwise might
seeme unreasonable. Where Warre is made, and no advantage gotten, there it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
to demand and make restitution of things and places claimed, gotten or lost,
according as both parties can best agree: But betweene such Nations as never fell
out, there ought no conditions of establishing friendship to bee propounded, since it
seemes reasonable, that each party should hold their owne, and neither carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as Superiours unto other in prescribing ought that may be troublesome.</p>
                        <p>Thus do I conclude this discourse with divers Aphorismes (very proper and fit to
be annexed to this subject) which I have collected out of S. <hi>R. Dallington,</hi> and fitted
them for this purpose: and moreover I would not that any man should thinke that

                           <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we can come to treat of the nature of Battells, wee must
first call into our best considerations the absolutest forme and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
way which possibly may be devised for an Army to march in.
For without due observations, and judicious care, an Army may
be overthrown before they can come to order themselves in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia:
for prevention thereof, I have collected divers Rules out of
sundry of our best Authours, worthy the taking notice of.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore in the first place, before wee adventure to march,
we must be given to understand, whether the way we intend to passe, bee narrow and
straight lanes, or broad plain heaths or commons.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, whether the enemy be quartered neer or afar off, and accordingly wee
are to order our Troops.</p>
                        <p>In a March, if the enemies quarters are before us, then the Troops of Horse are to
march before the Foot,<note place="margin">A partie of Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires or Fire locks are best to discover wades, rocks, hils and the like, in regard the heavie armed cannot possibly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</note> and before them certain Spies to discover, for fear of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Ambushes.</p>
                        <p>If marching from an enemy, the Horse-Troops are to follow in the Rear of the
Army, to charge the enemy if he offers to pursue.</p>
                        <p>An Army marching through straight lanes, must order their men into so many
Files as may well march a Brest.</p>
                        <p>An Army being to march over Heaths or Plains, then they must march by divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as namely, three or four Companies a Brest, that they may the readier and more
suddenly be drawn into Battalia.</p>
                        <p>An Army is commonly divided into three divisions, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vant-guard, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and Rear-guard; every Colonell ought to march according to his antiquitie,
one before another; after like manner, every Captain of every Colonels Regiment
is to doe the same.</p>
                        <p>That Regiment which marcheth in the Vant-guard the first day,<note place="margin">Note, these divisions of the Army are not to be quartered too far asunder for fear of danger.</note> ought to come
to their quarters very timely, then the Battell must march forwards, and be quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beyond them; then the Rear-ward is to march up beyond the Battell, and there to
bee quartered: so that the next morne it may bee ready at the discharging of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18615:228"/>
warning peece to march. Note, that Regiment which marcheth the first day in the
Van, the day following is to march in the Rear; and they are daily thus to take their
turns, if the March continues long.</p>
                        <p>We are further to observe, whether we are to march in the day time or in the night,
and accordingly we are to demean our selves.</p>
                        <p>If by day, The manner now in use is to send out before the Army (by a sufficient
trusty Guide, which knows wel the passages of the Countrey) certain Fire-locks, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones
and Musketires to discover the enemy; and the Horse are to represse the enemies
incursions: these are likewise to surprize straight waies, Bridges and Foords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next after these are the Pioners to march, with a good guard to mend the waies,
and to cut through passages, so as the Ordnance may be drawn safe, and the Army
march the best and neerest way.</p>
                        <p>The Foot of the Vant-guard or right Wing, is in the next place to follow, every
Battalia thereof in their due order; the one halfe of the Horse of the Army before them,
and all their baggage or carriage behind them in the Rear.</p>
                        <p>The Battalions of the Battell are in the next place to follow in the same equipage
the former did; <hi>viz.</hi> with all their baggage and carriage in the Rear.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the Battalions of the Rearward, or left Wing are to follow in March, with
all their baggage and carriage behind them also; and every one of these Battalions
are to have their shot before and behind, and the residue of the Horse are to bring up
the Reare.</p>
                        <p>The Ordnance are to be distributed as the Carriage is, <hi>viz.</hi> both behind the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,
the Battell, and the Rear-ward, the better to secure against all attempts. But
this kind of ordering the Horse, the Ordnance, and the Baggage, is most commonly
used when the enemy is not at hand.</p>
                        <p>As for the marching of an Army by night, all the baggage and carriages are to
bee sent before the Armie with a sufficient guard; next after them your Pike-men,
then the Musketires, and all the Horse in the Rear: so that by break of day they
may come all together to their Rendevou. This way an Army in the night is best and
easilyest kept together, and is soonest espied if it faulters: but this is also to bee used
when the enemy is not neer.</p>
                        <p>Wee are to observe, that in a March, both Colonels, Captains and other inferiour
Officers are called from the leading of their own Regiments and Companies to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in another Regiment or Company., which many times happens in regard the
Generall will have the eldest Colonels by him, to discourse and advise of things Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
about the Warres. So that a Lieutenant Colonell commands a Regiment, and
the eldest Captain the Colonels Company; also a Lieutenant to command a private
Company: and these are thus ordered and disposed as it shall please the Serjeant-Major
to give commandement.</p>
                        <p>An Army being thus orderly marcht to the place of their inquartering, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
his field-Martiall and Serjeant-Major generall are to be very wise and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
in placing the Horse-guards outermost of all, upon speciall passages where they
must set out their Horse-sentinels a good distance from the guard, that they may
the better discover and give warning of the enemies approaches, by making an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme
by the discharge of their Pistols, so that the whole Army may presently bee in
armes. The Foot-sentinels are to stand upon some passages neerer to the Quarters
than the Horse are.</p>
                        <p>Upon Alarme given,<note place="margin">The Serjeant-Major is to acquaint every Officer where the place of imbattelling is, and the waies made plain and ready for every Company to troop to it.</note> all the Companies of the Army are speedily to march into
some convenient place appointed by the Generall over night, where every Company
is to be drawn into Battalia fit to charge the enemy.</p>
                        <p>And as before I have said how the Foot should march in divisions over a Heath
or Plain; after the same proportion the Horse-troops also are to march in divisions,
<hi>viz.</hi> two, four or six Cornets in a division; neither divisions of Horse nor Foot are
to march in far distance one from the other, but so as the whole Army suddainly may
joyn in Battell, if the enemy should approach.</p>
                        <p>At every stand the Army makes upon a Heath or Plain, every single division is
to march up and front with the next division before it, upon the left hand of the
same; and if the stay bee long, and the place dangerous, then successively all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18615:228"/>
the divisions are to bee drawne into a compleat Battell.</p>
                        <p>After this very manner the Army must be demeaned in marching off from a Heath
or Plaine; if the enemy chaseth them in the Reare, thinking to take an advantage
when the Army shall be drawne out by Companies to march through some narrow
passages, lanes, or high-wayes; the Horse are to be drawne in Battalia in the Reare
of these Troopes, to receive the charge of the enemy, untill such time as all the Foot
Troopes are marcht through those straights; where having convenient ground, they
are to re-imbattell themselves, to entertaine the enemies charge, if he dares adventure
to follow.</p>
                        <p>But the safest way is (if an Army cannot eschue,<note place="margin">This caution would have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           </note> but must breake his aray) to
march from an enemy through a straight, he being ready to take his advantage to
charge them; then to give them Battell, if your Army be equivalent in strength, is the
safest way; if not, then to intrench the Army securely, waiting an opportunity, and
making use of some pollicy to get safely from them.</p>
                        <p>If an Army be weaker in Horse than the enemies Army is, it is very dangerous to
march over the Plaines, but rather take some hilly rockie way whereby the enemies
horse shall be unprofitable.</p>
                        <p>The enemy being neere at hand, the best way is to have the Artillery and Baggage
to march on the contrary side from the enemy in all straights, and in Champions to
be plac'd in the midst of the Army.</p>
                        <p>In extremity of hot weather, the Sutlers belonging to every Company may march
with their Waggons between the Companies, whereby they may the sooner be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with meat and drink, which otherwise they cannot come unto but once a day:
but this must be when there is no fear of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>It is requisite to have good Guides for direction of the best and safest way:
Likewise those Horse-men that are commanded to bee Vant-currers for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of the enemy, their dutie is also to view the passages, and to take notice
of the breadth of every straight way; the Quarter-Masters are to doe the
same, and to give intelligence, that the Army may march accordingly. As
for example, suppose the way bee eighteene foote broad; the Armie must bee
commanded to march six men in Rank or Brest; because every Foot-man will
have three foot in breadth between File and File, and six foot at the least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Rank and Rank: so that twentie foure foot in breadth, and foure Miles
in length, will but containe an Army marching of three or foure and twenty
thousand.</p>
                        <p>When an Army is constrained to march thus in length, the straight passages hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
from marching in divisions may prove very dangerous, if extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
bee not hourely had of the enemies proceedings; for should an enemy
watch his opportunity to fall on the Front, Flank, or Rear of the Armie, there
could bee very little help expected; for the Front were not able to succour the Rear,
no more than the Reare could the Front; and being charged upon the Flank, there
could bee but a poor resistance made. But the best and safest way in such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
danger, is either to draw as many Companies as may possibly bee got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
into such closes of ground as shall bee strongly fenced, and there order them
in Battalia; where they shall bee able to make a good resistance untill the residue of
the Army provides for its safety.</p>
                        <p>Or otherwise, if the enemy chargeth upon any of the sides, then it is
best to file all the Musketires upon that Flank the enemy strives to charge; so
that every Souldier shall give fire over the hedge as hee marches, and so passe
along.</p>
                        <p>But if an enemy should chance to break into the high-way with their
Horses, bee it in the Front or Reare of the Army, there is no way but to
barricado up the way with Waggons, or fell trees crosse the way, or by fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a great quantitie of feare-wood to hinder the enemies execution untill the
Army be drawn out of the way into the fields, where they may so order them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that the enemy cannot possibly rout them: if a few Troops should bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by the enemies Horse in their March, the dimond Battell or the crosse Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
is of greatest strength: otherwise, if an Army opposeth another Army upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18615:229"/>
the plaines, then a Battell so framed that most hands may be brought to fight, and
succours to releeve them, is best, alwayes having the advantage of Winde and Sunne,
with Woods, Rocks, Rivers, Ponds or great Ditches, either on Flanck, or Reare, or both.</p>
                        <p>It is a thing unsufferable for souldiers to ramble from their Colours, to laze or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
but to march orderly in their rancks; for the Provost-Marshall by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and authority ought to hang up such fellowes the next bough they come at, for
the whole Army to see, and be warned by as they shall passe by them in their March;
for the inconveniences are many and dangerous to an Army. The enemy by taking
them gaineth intelligence of the state of the Army, besides the mischiefe which such
fellowes doe commit in robbing, and pilfering, whereby a friend-people will bee
incenst, and ready to be treache rous to an Army, seeing themselves abused and bereft
of their goods.</p>
                        <p>It is policy, if an Army marches in an enemies countrey, to ruine, destroy, and
burne whatsoever may be advantagious to the enemies livelyhood; providing alwayes
sufficiently for your owne Army.</p>
                        <p>If there should be any suspition that the enemy strives to gaine some places of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to hinder the march, it is convenientest to send speedily certaine Horse-Troopes;
likewise Shot and Pikes upon Bedees in manner of Dragons, or tenne or
twelve men in a waggon; hurry them speedily to prevent the enemy from fortifying
themselves in such places of advantage.</p>
                        <p>The Lord <hi>Montpezat</hi> in his march from <hi>Fossar</hi> was put to a dangerous plunge, he
being constrained to take his way through the Valley <hi>Pratgella,</hi> the entrance
into which was most difficult, in regard the Hilles and Mountaines were held
and possest with the enemy, whereby hee lost divers of his men; wherefore
hee sent certaine Forces under the conduct of <hi>Monsieur Dambres,</hi> to get
the higher ground, and force his enemy to a retreat, which they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
performe; by which policy hee marcht safe without the losse of a
man.</p>
                        <p>The wedge-Battell is the absolutest forme to enter a straight, for the Shot comes so
fluent and peircing, that the enemy cannot possibly resist unlesse the passage be Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoed
up.</p>
                        <p>If any Enemy be farre stronger both in Foote and Horse then thy Army is; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
that he assaults thee not on every side, but be sure of some place of safeguard, as
Woods, Bogges, or Rivers; for if the enemy be not three times as strong as thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is, he shall shew himselfe of very poore judgement to divide his Army, and
weaken it, for to assault thee in divers places; which may purchase his owne over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Machiavill</hi> in his Art of Warre, adviseth Generalls to accustome their souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to march, and in marching to joyne in Battalia ready for fight, and so draw out
into a march againe; then to face about into the Reare, and draw up into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
againe, the like also to performe on either Flanck; so that upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
suddenly they might understand to order themselves, and range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into any forme of Battell; but where there is no place of safeguard or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
the quadrate forme of imbatttelling is safest; for he durst not devide his forces to
charge that kinde of forme upon all sides.</p>
                        <p>It were very commendable, and very advantagious to the strengthning of our
kingdome, if every Lord Lieutenant might draw all the forces of the shire together,
unto some convenient place in the midst of it; taking a convenient time of the yeere,
that neither Hay-time nor Harvest may hinder, wheresuch troops may be drawn into
all formes of Battell, and learne to understand all advantages in march.</p>
                        <p>If an Army marches through the enemies land, or farre from the water, so that
provision may not be conveyed by shipping; the best way is to drive after the Army
herdes of Beeves and Sheepe, which being alive cannot much cumber the Army; all
other provision is to be conveyed by Waggon.</p>
                        <p>A Generall must be very vigilant and circumspect in his march to discover all Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes,
by which he may two wayes incurre danger, (viz.) either by marching into
them, or through the enemies policy trained into them unawares.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:18615:229"/>
For the avoyding of the first perill, as before is sayd, it is necessary to send before
the Army certaine Troopes to discover, which may be of strength to resist if occasion
be; and in this they must be very inquisitive of the country people; whether they
have seene any of the enemies troopes lately, and how and which way they ordered
their march: Likewise the more woody and hilly the country is, the willinger the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
will lay his ambushes, which being discovered, they cannot be hurtfull; but if not
foreseen, whereby the Army falls suddenly amongst them, tenne to one but they ruine
them.</p>
                        <p>It is easie to perceive where an enemy marcheth by the dust they raise, and by the
wondring of fowles and birds which will flye about and not light, which is a great
signe that an ambush lyes there.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the second case of the enemies trayning an Army into danger, there
must be great wisedome, not suddenly to beleeve such things as in mans sense seeme
not reasonable to be indeed as they shew for; for under the bait lies the hook; as for
example, if many of the enemies troopes be put to flight by a few of thy own men, or if
a few of the enemies troopes assaile a number of thine, or by making a sudden flight
without a charge; in these cases there can nothing but deceit be expected; for we are
to note, that to march through an enemies countrey is more dangerous then to fight a
pitcht Battell; wherefore in these cases a Generall must have a secret inward caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousnesse
and feare of surprizing; which his souldiers must not take notice of, lest
they should be discouraged. Likewise in the same predicament a Generall must use
lofty scornefull words, in way of undervaluing his enemy, which will animate his
Souldiers to fall on; therefore for the better and safer conduct of an Army, it is
most necessary to have an exact Mappe of the countrey you intend to march through,
in which may be discovered all places of difficulty and danger, that so they may bee
the easilyer prevented; also those Guides which are chosen for the conducting of the
Army, ought severally to be questioned withall, whether there knowledge be good;
and compare their relation with the Mappes, whereby the errors may be discovered;
and above all things secrefie is to be commended.</p>
                        <p>If in your march you light upon deepe and unpassible rivers, and having no means
to make Bridges to waft over the Army, you are to march further to the heads of the
rivers, where you may passe at ease; if the current be over big so that the Army can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
wade over, you must cut out the same river in divers places, and turne it into the
land, whereby you may the easier passe over.</p>
                        <p>Every Officer must cause his souldiers to march according to the beate of the
drumme; for if one part of the Army should march too fast, and the other part too
slow, it may breed confusion.</p>
                        <p>We are further to observe,<note place="margin">Observations about retreating from the enemy in a March.</note> if it should happen in a march that the enemy oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and seeke to give you Battell, and you finding your selfe too weak for to joyne in
Battell; a principle point then is, how to get safely off from the enemy without
blowes; of all the points of warre this is most dangerous to be practised, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it hath a shew of undervaluing your owne potency; and your enemy is puft up
with a selfe conceit of transcendent worth, and thereby is animated to stretch his
valour to the uttermost period; whereas the courages of your owne men fall
away being surprised with feare, which will make them tumble into confusion.
Therefore as formerly hath beene said, a Generall must set a faire glosse, causing
his souldiers to beleeve that such retreates are for other advantages, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
some other designe of further consequence, and not that you retreat to
avoyd the combate; wherefore some reasons that favour of likely-hood must
bee used to the Souldiers. Sir <hi>Walter Rawlyes</hi> advice was to dislodge in the dead
of the night, in such a quiet still manner that the enemy should not perceive it.
Marquesse <hi>Spinola</hi> made use of this when he broke up his Leaguer before <hi>Bergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up-zone,</hi>
when his Excellencies Army lay at <hi>Rossandell</hi> ready to have assaulted his
trenches.</p>
                        <p>But the safest way of all is to retreat before the enemy be too neere; for if the
enemy be in view, although you should march forwards to gaine some place of more
security, yet unhappily there may be some ill passages and straights to hinder your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18615:230"/>
quicke passage whereby the enemy may take his advantage to rout you; for it is
farre greater honour to retreate in the darke than to bee beaten in the light.<note place="margin">A farre greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to retreat in the dark then to be beaten in the light.</note> And as
Monsieur <hi>Bellay</hi> adviseth such as retreat by day, must place there horsemen upon two
sides like unto hedges leaving a way betwixt them, through the which the footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are
to retreat, by which meanes the enemy shall not perceive them, they being shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
by the Horse; and as every particular Battalia is passed the principall place
of danger, then they are immediately to intrench themselves, or otherwise one Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
is to stay for another, they being past danger and the enemies sight, untill
they are all stolne away in safety; but this must be understood that it must be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in some plaines or covert places, where the enemy hath not the advantage of a
Hill to discover them: but those that intend to retreat in the night, first send
strong Guards to defend the passages, fearing the enemy should prevent them,
and then leaving sufficient fires in the quarters, hanging out light matches, and
stuffing old cloathes with straw, and setting them in the place of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells,
leaving Dogges howling, Beastes lowing, Horses neying, Cockes crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Quarters, so that the enemy may not suspect your departure; if your
Ordnance cannot conveniently be drawne away, it is best to dismount it from
the Carriages, and bury them secretly in the earth; further (saith he) when an
Army is reduc'd to this exigent of extremity, it is much better for to be carefull in
saving the men (albeit that the Ordnance, Baggage, and other moveables should
bee lost) than to hazard men for a thing that may so easily afterwards bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained.</p>
                        <p>If an Army be pollitickly stolne out from their Quarters,<note place="margin">This is to be done, when the enemy knowes not of their departure.</note> they are to make no
stay, but to continue the march, resting as little as may be; but if it be so that of
necessity they are constrained to stay upon the way, then let them make choice of
some place that is naturally fortified, alwayes remembring to have certaine fleete
horses to stay behind the Army to discover a farre of from some Hills whether the
enemy pursues; which if he doth, the surest way for prevention is to barricado up the
passages with trees.</p>
                        <p>It is likewise safe to quarter your Army in some wood, felling the trees one over
another round about it, which will be an excellent safeguard both from the enemies
horse and foote.</p>
                        <p>Likewise a Generall may lay ambushes upon places convenient, which must be
such souldiers as are best horst, or those that are nimblest of foote, so that they
may the safer retire upon all occasions; moreover they must not stay over long
behind the Army, but so as they may soone recover it; for otherwise they will be cut
off by the enemy.</p>
                        <p>If a retreat be wisely carried,<note place="margin">An enemy may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more damage, then they that retreat.</note> the enemy that shall follow may receive more dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
then they that retreat.</p>
                        <p>But on the contrary side if you perceive the enemy doth provide to steale from
you, it is wisedome to anticipate such passages as they must passe thorow, sending se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
certaine troopes to fortifie at the entrance of them;<note place="margin">What is to be done, if you feare the enemy will steale from you.</note> likewise to barricado up
the way with trees, and to have your Army alwayes in a readinesse to set out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, following them at the heeles; but in this case the Army must keepe a very
strict order in their Battallia's, and march up close together, commanding your
horse to charge the enemy in the Reare, which will bee a meanes to stay the
hindermost part of the Army; and then the Vantguard of your enemies Army
being come to the passages that are blockt up, it will so discourage the enemy, that
your Army marching up to them in Battell aray, they will bee easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
as there hath beene divers examples to verifie this. The lightest Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
are the best to pursue the enemy withall; for which purpose <hi>Grave Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
the Prince <hi>Van Nasaw</hi> had fifty or sixty small field peeces cast, which hee
used to place between his Battallions, which were of great service in the time
of fight; for two or three men could weild one of them as they pleased, both
in advancing it forwards and drawing backe as occasion served; and it were
very fit and of excellent use to have such small peeces cast here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for his Majesties service, which may bee imployed many waies; I have
observed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> how they made use of these small Ordnances, to place
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18615:230"/>
them in little vessels which they provided to safeguard their great rivers, as the river
<hi>Issel,</hi> and the <hi>Rhine;</hi> one of these had thirty or forty souldiers to man her, and eight
or tenne of these peeces, whereby they prevented the enemy from marching over the
said rivers; likewise they were safeguards to the Army, when they were convayed by
Boates up those rivers, or when they lay intrencht neere any great river, they safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
the Reare of the qnarters from treachery; also they safe conducted such
Boates as brought Victuals and Ammunition to the Army.<note place="margin">The use of small vessels.</note> If occasion should bee
in our land (which God forbid it should be) they could not doe us lesse service than
by experience they have done them; besides such small vessels being made for service,
were of more worth to offend an enemy that should dare saile up in any of our great
rivers, than the greatest Ship of burden; for it were impossible for our great Ships
to make a fight in the river <hi>Thames,</hi> but they will be more ready to hurt themselves
than the enemy, whereas these small vessels will lye under the shot, and glide up and
downe by the great vessels sides and gall them.</p>
                        <p>In the next place it remaines how an Army should March neere an enemies Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to secure themselves from the shot; in this you must observe the situation of their
Batteries, how they are flancked, by which you may come to perceive in what direct

the files and ranckes for the passage of the shot, or else to fetch a circumference
in your March, so as the shot shall not touch the files, but only a ranke; but the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
way is to March secretly by the most obscurest places, so as the Ordnance may not
discover you. Lastly for conclusion, if the enemy should assault your troopes in
in some narrow passages or high wayes, you are to demeane your selfe as followeth:
First, you are to fill the passage or high way with your pikes; if the breadth of your
troopes be not sufficient to performe it, then double your rancks, whereby the Wings
will extend themselves to the filling up of the passage; these then charging your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
hande or foote, your Musketiers being in the Reare; the Battell being thus orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
let the first ranke of Musketiers (which are those next the pikes face to the right
hand and march forth file-wise) close up by the right flanke of the pikes, untill he that
is leader of the said file be even with the Front of the Pikes; then he is to face to the
right hand and lead them quite crosse the Front of the Pikes, untill he hath attained
the further part of the Front to the left hand; which being performed, they are to
make a stand, and couch under the Pikes, and give fire upon their knees so as the Pikes
may not be hindred to charge; then are they to march downe by the left flancke, and
place themselves in the Reare of the shot; and the next files in order are to advance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Front after the same manner, and performe the same service; by this meanes
continuall fire shall be given upon the enemy whilst this skirmish is in action. Let
there be drawne out certaine Pikes and Musketiers, into the best inclosed fields
either on one or both sides of the way, where they may secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the enemies horse, and there charge the enemy on the
flancks, or at least keepe them from charging your
owne troopes that are in skirmish to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the passage; view the figure fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving formerly discourst of such rules, and observations, as are most
requisite, and pertinent, for the Marching of an Army; In this
Chapter I finde it convenient that we should shew such rules, and
observations as are most usefull for the secure incamping of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
wherein there is great wisedome and circumspection to be used,
in the well managing of the same; wherefore first there are two
things offered to our consideration, (viz.) whether an Army is to be quartered but
for a night; or for to be incamped for a long season? and from these two questions
there is a third produc'd, (viz.) whether the Army of your enemy be at hand, or farre
remote? now in regard in the former discourse of marching; I have toucht briefely
the manner of quartering an Army, for a night or two upon a March; where most
usually no enemy is neere, it being then a matter of no such consequence, as it is
when an Army must pitch downe his quarters or entrenchments for a long sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and perchance in the face of the enemy; therefore I will bee sparing in the
first, and also be as briefe as the subject will permit in the second; (viz.) the incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Army for some long time, wherein also, there are two things considerable;
(viz.) the strength of the enemies Forces, and the neerenesse of his Camp; for wee
must observe that slight intrenchments, are of sufficiency to safeguard an Army,
where the enemy is weake, and his Camp farre remote.</p>
                        <p>In the next place we are to have a due respect to the situation, and commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of water, wood, forrage for the horses, and a safe and convenient recourse for to
convay victualls and necessaries to the Camp, which must bee either by land, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
these things being duely considered, the Army being drawne to the place
of incampment, standing in Battalia; the Quarter-master Generall being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Lord Generall of the Army, is to lot out the Stations of ground for
every regiment to be quartered in; then the Quarter-master of each particular
Regiment, is to line out every particular Companies Station in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
beginning with the eldest Regiments, and in every Regiment the eldest
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18615:232"/>
Company, which are to be plac't at the right hand, and so successively, every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
according to his antiquitie, and every Regiment according to theirs.</p>
                        <p>In the meane time the Earle Marshall, the Serjeant Majors, Scout-Masters are to
take notice what passages and places of accesse are, whereby the enemy may approach
to this Campe, and in the convenientest places of them they are to command double
guards, both of horse and foote, to be plac't for the securing of the Army whilst the
intrenchments are making. Before the principall workes of the Campe are to bee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
there must bee Redouts speedily made upon all such passages, to lodge those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards
in, and for the same purpose the Pioners and Souldiers are to make what
speed possibly may bee: These Redouts are to bee made in greatnesse, as the place
requires number of Souldiers to defend it: <hi>viz.</hi> upon a small passage, where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is not to bee expected, there a triangular Redout, sufficient to containe thirty or
forty men, is requisite; if the passage bee more dangerous, then a foure-square Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dout,
which may hold eighty or an hundred men; but upon the chiefest passage of
all, either a Sconce is to bee built, or otherwise two Redouts, which may bee either
foure-square or triangular, one being raised upon one side of the way, the other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
wide upon the other side of the way, with the point or corner of the worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the enemies approaches, by reason more hands may bee brought to give fire
upon them, from the two sides which make the angle or point. In the meane time,
whilst this is in agitation, the front of the Army is to bee pallizado'd with such stakes
as is described in the discourse of warlike instruments, which are to bee driven one
within a foote of another; these shall keepe off both the horse and the foote, if they
should breake through the guards: Then as soone as conveniently may be, the works
are to be raised of the Quarters, and as they finish, the pallizadoes are to bee pulled up
againe, as hereafter in this discourse wee shall speake more plainely of. The Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> used also many times to place Redouts more inward within Musket-shot one
of another, to secure the Campe: the horse guards are within the outmost Redouts, but
their horse-Sentinels are set out perdue beyond the furthest works, and also beyond the
foot-Sentinels, which are alwaies plac't a good distance from the works upon the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
that they may give the alarme upon all occasions, and so to retreat into the
worke.</p>
                        <p>No Souldier, during the time of his watch, in any of these Redouts, is to have his
Bandilires off from about him, nor any Pike-man his Gorget from about his necke;
their Peeces must be likewise loaded with powder and shot in a continuall readinesse,
and a Sentinell standing duly upon the brest-worke to discover the enemies approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
at which time, the Officer which commands the worke is to place betwixt each
two Musketires a Pike-man to make the better defence.</p>
                        <p>Those Officers that guard in such Redouts, seldome or never carry their Colours
with them, but leave them in their Quarters with a guard passing upon them. Both the
Captain and the Ensigne are to march with their Company with each of them a Pike.</p>
                        <p>These Redouts are to bee releeved every night before Sunne-set with fresh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
from the main Campe; where no Souldier is to pull off his Armour, or set
downe his Pike or Musket untill they bee all entred the worke, and the Sentinels set
out in their due places.</p>
                        <p>Every severall Redout hath a particular name to distinguish one from the other,<note place="margin">How the Redouts may bee pallizado'd.</note>
and the Officers must draw Billets who shall have the guard in them, so that no Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
shall aforehand know his guard, to avoyd trecherie. These Redouts may bee
pallizado'd to make the defence more strong against the enemy, which is performed
after this manner: when the worke is raised neere the toppe, then lay in some sharpe
stakes of hard wood a yard into the ground, and as much out of the ground, three
quarters of a foot asunder; but these kind of workes are seldome pallizado'd, unlesse
they be very great, and set in dangerous places for assaulting.</p>
                        <p>Now wee are to shew how the maine Quarters are to be fortified,<note place="margin">How the maine Quarters are to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated and intrencht.</note> wherein wee
are to dispose the forme of it according as the situation shall direct us: but by the
way, wee must make sure, that no hilly ground bee neere the Quarters, fearing left
the enemy take it for his advantage, and so annoy the Campe with his Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
if such a place should bee, either it must bee levelled, or else a worke raised
upon it to defend it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="31" facs="tcp:18615:232"/>
If an Army may have such an advantage to be quartered neere some great River,
that may bee of defence sufficient to protect the Reare of the said Quarters, then the
intrenchment will bee soone finisht, and much the stronger, in regard the whole
power of the Army is but to make resistance one way. But if an Army should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to bee incamped upon a Plaine, so as the enemy may approach upon any side of it,
the forme of it must be far otherwise, and the strength of it the greater.</p>
                        <p>When an enemy can gaine no advantage, but to come upon the face of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
onely, then a small ditch of eight or nine foote broad, and six or seven foote
deepe, the Rampier or Breast-worke accordingly, will serve; for there shall need no
better defence but to keepe off their Horse and to damp their Bullets: your forces
being more than sufficient to defend the workes from scaling, the highest part of
ground in the Campe is most fit to plant the Ordnance upon, to scoure the Plaines
before the Trenches. Divers have fortified their Campe by lodging their Army in
a Wood neer some great River, and in stead of intrenching of it, they have cut downe
the timber trees, and made a Barricado both against Horse and Foote, being a very
speedie and cheape way, and wonderfull secure.</p>
                        <p>But in regard all places cannot possibly be found to have such advantages of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
strength, wee must learne to secure our Quarters by art, as the ancient <hi>Romans</hi>
used: for they regarded not so much the strength of the place by nature, so as they
could conveniently fortifie it by art; and for the most part they used one kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment:
but in these moderne times wee use any forme, as the situation of the
place will permit; <hi>viz,</hi> sometimes crooked, as his Excellencie did betwixt <hi>Cleave</hi> and
<hi>Skinken-Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ce;</hi> other times triangular, as he did by <hi>Rayes;</hi> sometimes round, and
sometimes square: but these kind of intrenchments are not so good, especially, when
wee are constrained to regulate our selves according to the situation or extent of the
place; for we shall faile in the uniformity that is requisite to be observed in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whereby the Campe will bee ordered so absurdly and grosly, that almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will have his due proportion: for as a Fortresse serves to defend men against
the assaults of their enemies; so the well-ordering of a Campe within, serves to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
and place them, so that every particular Company may know what place is
proper and particular for them to defend, without which order there had need bee
Bulwarkes and large intrenchments about a Campe: for indeed, it were better to
want this fortification than the proper defence that the souldiers may make within it,
who being duely ordered as they ought to be, may for a need secure themselves with
little or no defence, their Quarters being alwaies so situated, and placed in such an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
ready way to resist all assaults.</p>
                        <p>But this is not the onely care that is to bee taken about the well disposing of a
Campe; but it is very requisite we should proceede further, taking a survey how wee
may have supplies of amunition, victuals, souldiers, and the like, to have a safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to this Campe, that they may not bee hindered or damnified by the enemie;
and (as in the beginning of this discourse) it must be either by water or land, and so,
as the enemie may not possibly cut off the passage, either for provision comming, or
the Armie retraiting: for if such an oversight should happen, an Army should be just
brought into a trap or stratagem for its owne confusion. Wherefore the enemy must
not bee suffered to have any Forts or Garrisons behinde you, to hinder you by land,
nor any Castle or Block-houses, to spoile you by water, but of necessity they must
be taken in first; and although the place should be never so commodious to transport
(either by water or land) necessaries to the Campe, yet if the place you intend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe
in be not very fruitfull,<note place="margin">The Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encamped about the River <hi>Nile, Ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the present necessity both of man and beast, or if the ayre be not healthfull, or if the
situation of your Campe be so low that it be subject to drowning (if the enemy should
cut out any waters) you would find your selfe but in an ill taking; for you shall bee
sure to suffer before you can redresse these things.</p>
                        <p>Further, a speciall care is to be had how to preserve the Souldiers in health, which
we may learn from that famous souldier <hi>Mounsieur Bellay,</hi> who saith that sicknesse may
be avoyded by taking good heed unto the excesse the Souldiers use; and for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
healths, there must be provision made that they may have warme and dry Hutes,
well thatched with straw, reed, or sedge; shady trees to defend the heate of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18615:233"/>
or stormes in Winter, their victuals sweet and good, well boyled and salted.</p>
                        <p>Further, if in the heat of Summer any of the Troops belonging to the Army should
bee forc'd to travell, they must take the early and cool morne, so as they may bee
returned to their Quarters by the chiefe heat of the day.</p>
                        <p>Likewise in Winter the Souldiers ought not to march through waters, or over
yce and snow, unlesse the place they goe unto will affoord store of firing to relieve
and dry them. Neither must they bee suffered to drink ill waters, or to bee ill clad,
for these are the originals of great sicknesses; this care being had, ties and unites the
hearts of poor Souldiers to their superiour Officers more than any other way: for
should not this care be had, a double losse of men would ensue; as namely, to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
by sicknesse, and slaine by the enemy: now since exercise is a principall thing
to keep the Army in health, therefore duly thrice a week they ought to be exercised
in their compleat Arms; this will be a means to keep them from vicious courses, as
gaming, drinking, and the like, which of it selfe is able to surfet and destroy an Army.</p>
                        <p>The Generall is alwaies to have one moneths provision in his Campe,<note place="margin">A Generall may tax the Towns about his Camp to bring in a certain quantity of corn &amp; victuals, and he is to set the rates according to his pleasure.</note> especially of
Bread, Cheese, Bacon, Fish, &amp;c. with all kind of Provender for the Horse. Also there
must be good and wholsome Laws established and proclaimed, and seen to bee put
in execution; for if Justice do not govern in an Army, all things goe to ruine in
the Camp.</p>
                        <p>For in the first place, the unrulinesse of the Souldiers will cause Victuallers, and
the countrey people to refrain the Camp, whereby a famine will soon ensue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
if the Souldiers bee suffered to pilfer and pillage the people abroad in the
Countrey neer adjoyning, those people will plot a revenge with the enemy, and
seek to betray you: besides the quarrels that will arise amongst themselves, whereby
a confusion amongst themselves will be wrought, if Justice should not prevent.</p>
                        <p>But now I shall come to that which all this while you have expected, and that is
to shew the best manner of incamping, the which I shall endeavour to doe by two
severall demonstrations: The first shall be (as before is spoken of) when the Rear
of the Camp is secured by some great River or Arme of the Sea. The second a square
incampment upon the Champion, where no naturall strength can afford us help.</p>
                        <p>For the first of these two; when the place affords such naturall strength, that the
Rear of the Army may be secured by some River or Arme of the Sea, (provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

Hutes, ought to bee ten foot broad, and four hundred foot deep, in regard each
Hute is to bee eight foot square,<note place="margin">The Lieutenants Cabin is to bee 12. foot long, and 8. foot broad.</note> and in every Hute two Souldiers are to bee lodged:
so that upon each side of the way there is to bee fiftie Hutes built, which are to hold
an hundred Souldiers upon a side. At the top of the street upon the right hand, is
the Lieutenants Cabbin, who is to bee allowed twelve foot; and upon the left hand
is the Ensignes Cabbin,<note place="margin">The Serjeants are there plac'd to keep the Company in good order.</note> of the same bignesse, the Serjeants are to have upon each

                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:18615:233"/>
In the Reare of these Hutes is another street or space of ground, which runneth
from one side of the Quarters to the other, marked E. being six paces wide, upon
the foremost side of which are the Sutlers, Butchers and Shop-keepers; behind these
is a wast place next the water, for the off all, filth and draffe to be conveyed away, as
you may perceive at G.</p>
                        <p>The space or distance of ground which is betwixt Regiment and Regiment, ought to

                        <p>The Generall ought to have his Tents in the midst of all the Quarters, and the

The other manner of fortifying a Camp is now to be discourst of.<note place="margin">A second way of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying a Camp de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> The Lord high
Marshall having made choice of a place convenient, being attended by the Quarter-Master
Generall, and the inferiour Quarter-Masters: about the midst of the ground
where you intend to incamp, set up the Generalls Standard, and about the same stake
out a square place of ground for the Generalls Pavilion, fourty paces square<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
from this towards the North, runneth one main street fourty paces broad,
which divides the Horse-Camp from the Foot-Camp; and on either side of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
Tents, runneth two other crosse wayes, thirty paces in breadth, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the armed Souldiers from the Pioners and Waggons: these two wayes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
two long squares of ground fourty paces broad, and five hundred and fifty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
long apeece; these may either of them bee divided into five Lodgings, of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces in length, and fourty in breadth, leaving between them certain passages
of ten paces in breadth, so that the Souldiers upon every sudden alarme, may the more
readily repair to the place of Assembly. One of the Lodgings next the Generalls
Tent, is appointed for the high Marshall and his retinue, and the other on the other
side, for the Treasurer; the rest may be assigned at the Marshals discretion, to the other
Officers of the field, and for such Noblemen and Gentlemen Voluntires as follow the
Warres at their own charge.</p>
                        <p>In the North-east Quarter of the Camp are the Horse-men lodged, in the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
the Foot-men: either of these Camps are divided into three parts, by streets run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
East and West; these streets are twenty paces in breadth, and five hundred and
eighty paces long: in every of these three spaces of the Foot-Camp are lodged a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 10000. men; and in the Hors-Camp, the middlemost of them shall serve for
1500. Lances, or Curassiers with their Beedets, the North space for the Harquebuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
on the other side of this street are the Lodgings assigned for the Colonels of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Regiment and their Officers; every space being thirty paces broad, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and seaventy long. By these Characters following you may understand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of this Camp the better, as in the figure following: A. stands for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of the Harquebuziers, B. for the Captaine of the Lances or Curassiers, and C.
for the residue of the Carbines and Dragones: Likewise, D E F. is the place for the
Leaders of three principall Regiments of Foot-men, the which are to be distingu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ished
by their antiquities, or by the usuall name of Vantguard, Battell and Rear-ward;
the Vantguard lies next to the Generalls Tent, and answers to the Harquebuziers,
the Battell answers to the Curassiers, and the Rear-ward to the residue of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
and Dragones. Every of these principall Regiments, you may (if you please)
divide againe into five smaller Regiments, by streets of ten paces broad, running North
and South: So have you fifteen lesse Regiments in the Foot-Camp, and five apeece
in every of the Horse-Camps, and every of these Regiments are one hundred paces
broad, and one hundred and seventy paces in length; and shall contain every of them
in Foot-men 2000. of Curassiers 300. of Harquebuziers 400. the residue of the
Carbines and Dragones 500. with their Colonels and their Officers.</p>
                        <p>The Colonels and Captains of the Cavalliary may be quartered at the head of their
Regiments, as you may behold in the figure of the Camp. Those marked G. are for
the Colonels of the Foot; H. for the Captains of the light-Horse-men or Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers;
I. for the Captain of the Curassiers or Lances; K. for the Captain of the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of the Carbines and Dragones: So there remaines Regiments of an hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
broad, and one hundred and fifty paces long for the Souldiers to bee quartered
in; which may, by small streets of five paces broad, be divided into as many spaces as
there are severall Bonds in every Regiment.</p>
                        <p>These last divisions of Bonds are omitted in the figure, because in so small a plot
it would breed confusion. This must be observed, that the shot bee lodged towards
the outside of the Camp, that they may bee in readinesse to answer the alarm; the
which may be done, by dividing the utmost seven Regiments into halfe, as you may
see in the figure by the pricked lines, leaving the seaven spaces marked with L. for
7000. Shot, and the other with M. for 7000. Pikes: all the other Regiments marked
with N. are likewise for Pikes and Muskets, to the number of 16000. Thus you see
in the North moytie of this Camp, is quartered all the Foot and Horse; the other
halfe of this Camp must serve for the quartering of the unarmed, as Pioners, Carters,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18615:234"/>
Carpenters, Smiths, Sutlers, Butchers, and all sorts of Mechanicall Artificers, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a large place of assembly for the Souldiers to retire unto, to put themselves
in order upon any alarm; as also to exercise themselves in sundry sorts of activity.
You shall therefore from the South side of the Generall Pavilion, six hundred paces
Southward, extend out your first main street of fourty paces broad, and crosse it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with another street, running East and West, three hundred and sixty paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the South side of the Generalls Pavilion; this street needs bee but thirty
paces in breadth.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Againe, extend the second narrow street that runs paralell to the first main street
untill you come to this crosse street last made; so have you O. your place of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
three hundred and thirty paces broad, and five hundred and fourty paces long.
P. shall be appointed for the Munition and Officers attending upon the Artilery. Q. is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18615:235"/>
the Marke-place, and round about this Market-place may bee lodged the Butchers,
Bakers, Cooks and Victuallers of all sorts.</p>
                        <p>About the place of the Assembly may be the Tents of all such as furnish the Camp
with things needfull for the Souldiers, as Armourers, Taylors, Shoo-makers and
the like.</p>
                        <p>There still remains two long squares of earth, either of them 540. paces long, and
190. paces broad: here the Carts and Wagons, with the horse and oxen; for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
themselves must alwaies impale that part of the Camp that is not fortified either
by nature or art: the Pioners likewise may be quartered in this Camp.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, you shall line out 60. paces distant from all these Regiments and Quarters
already set down, and there raise the circumference of the intrenchment of the Camp,
making a good Trench eight or ten foot wide, and raise a good Parapet or Brest-work
of five or six foot thick, and as high, with a foot-bank to make the Souldiers of height
sufficient to give fire over it: your Ordnance is to be plac'd on the same.</p>
                        <p>But if the enemy be near, and of greater force than your selfe, then you must make
your Trenches very large and deep, with a Rampart and Brest-work of a great height
and thicknesse, with a Bulwark at each corner, and in the midst of the Curtain. View
the figure following; where the line the Ordnance is planted upon, demonstrates the
sleight Trench and Brest-work which is to be made, the enemy being a far distance
from you. The outmost line with the Bulwarks, is the figure of the strongest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
for security when the enemy is at hand. For the Guards and manner of
watching, I have discoursed of in the beginning of this Discourse, and more fully in
the latter end of the Discourse of Fortification. I intend in the next Chapter to shew
you the manner of the Swedes Incampings, which I rather affect than this.</p>

Figures to explaine the same.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Swedes</hi> in their late German Warres have been very curious in
their Incampings, in regard of the potency of their enemies, and
the multiplicity of their Armies; and were able by their excellent
order, and good discipline, to performe as great atchievements
with their Army of 16000. Souldiers, as their enemie could with
20000. For that famous Generall never filed his men above six
deep, and never above 126. in a Company (besides the Officers), and in a Regiment
but eight Companies; which he might the better doe, in regard his Souldiers were no
novices, but admirable apt and pregnant in their exercisings and performances: this
was one reason of this his only and peculiar way of imbattelling and incamping.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, the fewnesse of men in his Companies made the more Divisions and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts;
and the more Officers, which he found by experience, stood him in great stead,
and lesse charge to maintain them.</p>
                        <p>His incampments were different both from the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and our modern
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> as you may see by this discription following, how he used to enquarter his
Regiments of Foot; as by the sequent figure you may perceive in the head of the
Quarters nine large Square at the upper end of the figure marked with the letter A.
all which are the due places for the Colonell and Captains to pitch their Tents upon,
where you see the word Colonell written, and the Captains according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in seniority and dignity of Office, as you may perceive by their Hutes or Tents
marked each on the head of his owne Company. The number over the Colonells
Hutes or Tents shew it to be 48. foot broad, <hi>viz.</hi> twice as broad as any of the Captains
Cabbins, which are marked with 24. at each end of these rowes of Squares you see
the number 30. marked, which shews how many foot long each of these great
Hutes are.</p>
                        <p>Now, whereas the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> discipline was usually to have but eight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18615:235"/>
to a Regiment, so many Hutes you see on the top of the Quarter, four on each
side the Colonels.</p>
                        <p>And the reason why this famous Warriour had so few in a Regiment as 1008. and
consequently so few in a private Company as 126. those 1008. being divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
eight Captains, was that he might have the more places of preferment, and the
more Officers to command these few men. This is a greater advantage than our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
were aware of: and it were happy if our <hi>English</hi> Companies were reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
126. men in a Company, and not to be suffered some to be 200. and some 300. and
some 150. which if it must needs bee so, and may not bee altered, then I could wish
all Companies to be only of the extent of 200. and 80. of them to bee Pikemen, and
120. Musketires.</p>
                        <p>The rowes of lesse squares marked on each side of the figure with the letter B. are
the Hutes for the Souldiers to lie in, between the Front of which and the Colonels
ground, you see a large void space or distance, which is twenty foot wide marked
at each end; the use of it is for the drawing up of the Companies or for the Officers
to walk in, and for the Souldiers to speak with them there: this space is marked in the
figure with C.</p>
                        <p>Right under the Colonels Hute, you see another void space as wide as the Colonels
Hute is, and as long as all the Quarter of the common Souldiers, marked with D. the
use of it is for the Officers of the Regiment, commonly called the Officers of the
Staffe, as the Provost-Marshall, the Quarter-Masters of the Regiment, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Of the Quarters of the common Souldiers on either side of this long void space, these
bee the proportions. All the little squares bee Hutes or Cabbins in the longer rowes
marked with the letter M. on the first Hutes are the Musketires lodged; and in the other
rowes marked with P. are the Pikemen lodged: one row of Musketires and one row
of Pikes makes up one complete Bond or Company of 126. men.</p>
                        <p>In the Musketires row are twenty four Hutes, and in the Pikemens but eighteen;
the reason is, because the King by his orders commands that every complete Company
should have three Corporalships of Musketires; foure Files or Rots (as the <hi>Swedes</hi>
terme them) make a Corporalship of Musketires; but of Pikemen three Files or
Rots make a Corporalship: so that twelve Files of Musketires, and nine Files of
Pikes, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty one Files, firemen in depth in each File, is a complete Band of 126.
men, besides the Officers and Serjeants.</p>
                        <p>When his Companies were weak, then hee would have but two Corporalships
of Musketires, and the remainder to be Pikes.</p>
                        <p>Each of these Hutes are nine foorsquare, <hi>viz.</hi> three yards every way; and whereas
one row of Musketires and one row of Pikes belongs to one Company; these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neerer set together than the row of Pikes belonging to severall Companies are for
the Pikes and Musketires of the same Company, are parted with a street but six foot
wide, whereas betwixt the Pikes of severall Companies is a street of eighteen foot
wide, and betwixt the Musketires of severall Companies, a street of twelve foot wide,
and so you see the severall proportions marked.</p>
                        <p>The length of the row of Pikes is but 162. foot, as you see it marked betwixt the
two first rowes of their Hutes. The length of the Musketires row is 216. foot, as is
marked in the margent: the distance of breadth being observed, they amount to 360.
foot, or 72. paces; so broad is the whole Quarter for one intire Regiment.</p>
                        <p>Below all this, in the Rear or lower end of the Quarter, you have a voyd space, 14.
foot of ground running all the breadth of the Quarter, serving for the freedome of
Ayr; this is marked with E.</p>
                        <p>Last of all, you may behold another lowance of ground marked with the letter F.
which is for the Sutlers, Chap-men, Butchers, &amp;c. of the Regiment. Add now the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of length together, and they come to 300. foot, which is the length of the
whole Quarter for one intire Regiment.</p>
                        <p>Now rests the chief point of discipline in the number and order of the placing of the
Hutes, and the men in them. Concerning the number, there be three men to be lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one Hute, as well Pikes as Musketires; so that in 24. Hutes of Musketires of one
Company there bee 72. men; and in the 18. Hutes of Pike-men of one Company there
be but 54. men, which number added together, amounteth to 126. which is a complete
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18615:236"/>
Band. These 72. Musketires are again divided into three Corporalships, and the 54.
Pike-men also into three Corporalships. Four Files or Rots of Musketires goe to one
Corporalship, and of Pike-men but three Files or Rots to a Corporalship. So that
24. Musketires goe to one Corporalship, and of Pikes 18. according to the number
of either of their Cabbins.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, their order being to march six deep in File, therefore in every two
Hutes there is one Rot or File lodged, which presently know how to put themselves
in order.</p>
                        <p>Thus hath every Corporall of Musketires eight Hutes to look unto, and every
Corporall of Pikes six Hutes under him. This certainty and disposing of the numbers
serveth much for private government: this order of quartering, they are opinionated,
is prevalent for the ready resisting of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Whereas you see two rows of Pikes, and two rows of Musketires still together,
with their Cabbin doors inward one to another; this is the use of it. Suppose the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the night falleth upon the Quarters, the Alarme being taken and given by those
of the outmost Guards, out slips the two rows of Pikes into the street or alley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, and presently marching out betwixt the Captains Hutes, they are instantly
in a fair order of Battell.</p>
                        <p>The Pikes being gone, then the two next rows of Musketires joyning together,
march also out upon both sides of the Pikes, where they are ready instantly to flank
them. Thus one Squadron or halfe-Regiment issuing out upon one side of their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
Tent, and the other halfe on the other, presently they draw themselves in complete
Battalia, and find their Colonels and Captains in the head of the Quarter, ready to
conduct them to the Brest-work; thus so soon as the Alarm is given in from the outer
Guards, the Souldiers will bee ready to entertain their assault, every man before his
own Quarter, upon which the enemy falleth before he can possibly (march hee never
so fast) come neer to doe any execution.</p>
                        <p>If you desire to heare how in that huddle of darknesse they can possibly find their
weapons, know that by the order of their standing, every man can at first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
most readily clap his hands upon his owne. To instance in the Pikes for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
The place where they all stand together is upon a thing made after the fashion of
a paire of Gallowes at the head of the Quarter; the upper overthwart beam is for the
Pikes to stay against; then there is another beam lower, for to hang the Corslets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to lean the Muskets against; this is to have a defence over it to defend the
wet. Now when any service or exercise is done abroad, hee that lyeth in the Rear of
the Quarter, by comming in first, setteth down his Armes inmost, and he that commeth
in last leaveth his outmost, which when hee again goeth first out, hee findeth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and when the last man commeth, he findeth his own left, every man keeping
still the same order that was at first appointed; so that the fore-man, the right-hand
man, or the bringer up is the fame ever, and his weapons ever in the same place. Thus
they lye in Battalia being at bed; in Battell array when they rise up, their Arms are
as ready as themselves: so that upon all Alarmes, they are ready in a moment to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
their enemy to their costs. The figure of this discourse you shall find in the
next page: then afterwards we shall describe the figure of the whole Camp, with all
the Fortifications thereunto belonging.</p>

either side or face, be drawn to fall upon the point where the half Redouts and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
meet, as you may perceive by the lines pricked from the extreme of the Curtain

passe out to informe the enemy untill such time as the danger be past. And this shall
suffice for the describing how an Army should be incamped.</p>

                        <p>3. If any shall seem to deride or scorne Gods Word or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and bee taken in the fact, hee shall forthwith bee

or preaching, he shall be brought upon his knees before the whole assembly, and there
crave pardon of Almighty God.</p>
                        <p>5. To the end that Gods Word be by no means neglected, Our will is, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
prayers bee said every morning and evening throughout the whole Camp, at one
time, in every several Regiment, they being called thereunto by the sound of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
or Marshals Trumpets, and the Drums of every private Company and Regiment.</p>
                        <p>6. Whatsoever Minister shall neglect his time of prayer, except a lawfull occasion
hinders him, he shall for every time being absent, pay half a moneths pay.</p>

preaching, in a place convenient, before and after noon; this also to bee done twice

the Token or call to bee given, shall immediately shut up their doors, and so keep
them during the said time of Prayer and Sermon; they that presume in that season to

offender shall for one whole day be put in prison.</p>
                        <p>11. All drinkings and feastings shall in the time of Prayer bee given over, upon
pain of punishment, as is before mentioned in the seventh Article; if any Souldier here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
offends, he shall forfeit half his weeks pay to the poor; and if he be an Officer, hee
shall forfeit what shall be awarded.</p>
                        <p>12. For the explaining of this Article formerly exprest: If there bee none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of these abuses, then shall the Minister himself give notice thereof unto the
Colonell or Captain, and if he shall suffer such abuses to goe unpunished, then shall
he give the Generall notice thereof, who shall doe him right.</p>
                        <p>13. All Priests and Ministers that are to be in our Camp or Leaguer, shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Bishop of the same Diocesse or Land from whence the Souldiers come
whom he is to be among: no Colonell nor Captain shall take what Minister he shall
think good, but shall be content with whom the Bishop shall appoint him.</p>
                        <p>14. To the intent that all Church businesse, as well in the field as otherwhere, may
have an orderly proceeding; We ordain, That there be one Ecclesiasticall Consistory
or Commission in our Leaguer, the President or chiefe person whereof shall bee Our
own Minister, when We our selves are personally present in the field. In Our absence
shall the chiefe Minister to the Generall be the man; his fellow-Commissioners or
ordinary Assessors shall be the chiefe Ministers to every Regiment of Horse and Foot;
unto whom We give full power and authority to be Judges in all Church affaires, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of God and holy Church; what shall be by them decreed, shall
be of as great force and strength, as if it were determined in any other Consistorie
whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>15. No Captain shall have liberty to take any Minister without the consent of his
Colonell, and of the Consistory. Neither again shall he discharge any, but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the Consistory, he having there first shewed, that Minister not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of his Charge.</p>
                        <p>16. If any Minister be found ill inclined to drunkennesse or otherwise; then may
his Colonell or Captain of Horse or Foot complain of him in the Consistory; and if
his fellow-Ministers find him guilty, then may they discharge him of his place. In
such complaints, shall the whole Consistory and the President, severely also repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him, that others of the same calling may take example thereby, and be warned
of such grosse errors, and give good example unto others.</p>
                        <p>17. For that no government can stand firmely, unlesse it be first rightly grounded;
and that the Lawes be rightly observed: We the King of, &amp;c. doe hereby make known
unto all our Souldiers and Subjects, as well Nobles as others; that in our presence they
presume not to doe any unseemely thing: but that every one give us our due honour,
as we ought to receive; who presumes to doe the contrary, shall be punished at our
pleasure.</p>
                        <p>18. Next shall our Officers and Souldiers be obedient unto our Generall and Field-Marshal,
with other our Officers ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

belonging unto our service, upon paine of punishment as followeth.</p>
                        <p>19. Whosoever behaves not himself obediently unto our great Generall, or our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
comming in our absence, as well as if we our selves were there in person pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
shall be kept in irons or in prison, untill such time as he shall be brought to his
answer, before a Councell of Warre; where being found guilty, whether it were wilfully
done or not, he shall stand to the order of the Court, to lay what punishment upon
him they shall thinke convenient, according as the person and fact is.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:18615:239"/>
20. And if any shall offer to discredit these great Officers by word of mouth or
otherwise, and not be able by proof to make it good, hee shall be put to death without
mercy.</p>
                        <p>21. Whosoever offers to lift up any manner of Armes against them, whether hee
doth them hurt or not, shall be punished by death.</p>
                        <p>22. If any offers to strike them with his hand, whether hee hit or misse, he shall
lose his right hand.</p>
                        <p>23. If it falls out that our great Generall in any feast, drinking, or otherwise,
doth offer injury to any Knight, Gentleman or other, which stands not with their
honour to put up; then may they complain to the Commissioners for the Councell
of Warre, where hee shall answer them, and bee censured by them according to the
quality and importance of the fact.</p>
                        <p>24. As it is here spoken of our Generall; so also it is of all other our great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
as Field-Martiall, Generall of the Ordnance, Generall of the Horse, Serjeant-Major
Generall, Quarter-Master Generall, and Muster-Master; all which, if they
commit any such offence through envie or other by-respect, they shall answer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Court of Warre, as is before mentioned.</p>
                        <p>25. As every Officer and souldier ought to be obedient unto our Generall and other
great Officers; so shall they in the under Regiments, be unto their Colonell, Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonell,
Serjeant-Major, and Quarter-Master, upon paine of the same pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
before mentioned.</p>
                        <p>26. If any Souldier or Officer serving either on horse-back or foot, shall offer any
wrong or abuse unto his superiour Officer either by word or deed, or shall refuse any
duty commanded him, tending unto our service, he shall be punisht according to the
importance of the fact.</p>
                        <p>27. If any Colonell, Lieftenant-Colonell, Serjeant-Major, or Quarter-Master,
shall command any thing not belonging unto our service, he shall answer to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
before the Court.</p>
                        <p>28. In like manner if any inferiour Officer, either of horse or foote does challenge
any common souldier to be guilty of any dishonest action; the souldier finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
guiltlesse, may lawfully call the said Officer to make proofe of his words before
the Court as his equall.</p>
                        <p>29. If any souldier either of horse or foote shall offer to strike his officer that shall
command him any duty for our service, he shall first lose his hand, and be then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of the Quarter. And if it be done in any Fort or place beleagured after the
watch is set, he shall lose his life for it.</p>
                        <p>30. And if he doth hurt to any of them, whether it be in the field or not, he shall
be shot to death.</p>
                        <p>31. If any such thing falls out within the compasse of the Leaguer or the place of
Garrison, in any of the souldiers lodgings where many of them meete together, the
matter shall be inquired into, by the Officers of the Regiment, that the beginner of
the fray may be punished according to desert.</p>
                        <p>32. He who in the presence of our Generall shall draw his sword, with purpose
to doe mischiefe with it, shall lose his hand for it.</p>
                        <p>33. He who shall in anger draw his sword while his Colours are flying, either in
Battell or upon the March, shall be shot to death; if it be done in any strength or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed
place, he shall lose his hand, and be turned out of the Quarter.</p>
                        <p>34. He who shall presume to draw his sword upon the place where any Court of
Iustice is holden, while it is holden, shall lose his life for it.</p>
                        <p>35. He that drawes his sword in any strength or Fort to doe mischiefe therewith,
after the watch is set, shall lose his life for it.</p>
                        <p>36. No man shall hinder the Provost Marshall Generall, his Lieftenant or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
when they are to execute any thing that is for our service; who does the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
shall lose his life.</p>
                        <p>37. Leave is given unto the Provost Marshall Generall to apprehend all whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that offends against these our Articles of Warre. All other offenders he may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
apprehend by his owne authority.</p>
                        <p>38. If the Provost Marshall Generall shall apprehend any man by his owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18615:239"/>
he may keepe him either in prison or in irons, but by no meanes doe executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon him after the Court of Warre is ended, without first giving the Generall
notice thereof.</p>
                        <p>39. The Provost Marshals of every Regiment, have also the same priviledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their owne Regiment and Company, that the Provost Marshall Generall hath in
the Leaguer.</p>
                        <p>40. Every Serjeant Major commanding in the whole Leaguer what appertaines
to his Office, shall be obeyed by every man with his best endeavour.</p>
                        <p>41. Whatsoever is to be published or generally made knowne shall be proclaimed
by sound of Drumme and Trumpet, that no man may pretend ignorance in it; they
who after that shall be found disobedient, shall be punished according to the quality
of the fact.</p>
                        <p>42. No souldier shall thinke himselfe to good to worke upon any peece of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
or other place, where they shall be commanded for our service, upon paine of
punishment.</p>
                        <p>43. Whosoever shall do his Majesties businesse slightly or lazily, shall first ride the
wooden horse, and lie in prison after that with bread and water, according as the
fact shall bee adjudged more or lesse hainous.</p>
                        <p>44. All Officers shall diligently see that the souldiers plye their worke, when they
are commanded so to doe; he that neglects his duty therein, shall be punished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the discretion of the Court.</p>
                        <p>45. All souldiers ought diligently to honour and obey their Officers, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
being by them commanded upon service; but if at any time they can on the
contrary discover, that they are commanded upon a service which is to our prejudice
any manner of way; then shall that souldier not obey him what charge soever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from him, but is presently to give notice of it.</p>
                        <p>46. No Colonell nor Captaine shall command his souldiers to doe any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing; which who so does, shall be punished according to the discretion of the
Judges. Also if any Colonell or Captaine or other Officer whatsoever, shall by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
take any thing away from any common souldier, he shall answer for it before
the Court.</p>
                        <p>47. No man shall goe any other way in any Leaguer wheresoever, but the same
common way laid out for every man, upon paine of punishment.</p>
                        <p>48. No man shall presume to make any Alarme in the quarter, or to shoot of his
Musket in the night time, upon paine of death.</p>
                        <p>49. He that when warning is given for the setting of the watch by sound of
Drumme, Fife, or Trumpet, shall wilfully absent himselfe without some lawfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse;
shall be punisht with the wooden horse, and be put to bread and water, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pennance, as the matter is of importance.</p>
                        <p>50. He that is taken a sleepe upon the watch, either in any strength, trench, or the
like, shall be shot to death.</p>
                        <p>51. He that comes of his watch where he is commanded to keepe his Guard, or
drinkes himselfe drunke upon his watch or place of Sentinell, shall be shot to
death.</p>
                        <p>52. He that at the sound of Drumme or Trumpet repaires not to his Colours,
shall be clapt in irons.</p>
                        <p>53. When any march is to be made, every man that is sworne shall follow his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
who ever presumes without leave to stay behind shall be punished.</p>
                        <p>54. And if it be upon mutiny that they doe it, be they many or be they few, they
shall die for it.</p>
                        <p>55. Who ever runnes from his Colours, be he Native or Forreiner, and does
not defend them to the uttermost of his power so long as they be in danger, shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
death for it.</p>
                        <p>56. He that runnes from his Colours in the field shall dye for it; and if any of his
Comrades kill him in the meane time he shall be free.</p>
                        <p>57. Every man is to keep his own ranck and file upon the march, and not to put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from their orders; nor shall any man cast himselfe behind, or set himselfe upon any
waggon, or horse-back; the offenders to be punished according to the time and place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:18615:240"/>
58. Whatever Regiment shall first charge the enemy and retire afterwards from
them before they come to dint of sword with them, shall answer it before our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Marshals Court.</p>
                        <p>59. And if the thing be occasioned by any Officer, he shall be publikely disgraced
for it, and then turned out of the Leaguer.</p>
                        <p>60. But if both Officers and Souldiers bee found faulty alike, then shall the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
be punished as aforesaid. If it bee in the Souldiers alone, then shall every tenth
man be hanged; the rest shall bee condemned to carry all the filth out of the Leaguer,
untill such time as they performe some exploit that is worthy to procure their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
after which time they shall bee cleer of their former disgrace. But if at the first

of necessaries for their life, and bee withall out of hope to bee relieved, and are so
pressed by the enemy, that of necessity they must within a short time give up the Peece,
endangering their lives thereby, without all hope of reliefe: herein shall our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

their merit.</p>

to be done against the enemy.</p>
                        <p>128. If any Souldier or Native subject, desires to bee discharged from the warres,
he shall give notice thereof unto the Muster-masters; who if they finde him to bee
sicke, or maimed, or that hee served twenty yeeres in our warres, or hath beene ten
severall times before the enemy, and can bring good witnesse thereof, he shall be
discharged.</p>
                        <p>129. If any Colonell or Captaine either of Horse or Foot does give any Passe,
otherwise than is before mentioned, he shall be punished as for other Fellonies; and
he who hath obtained the same Passe, shall lose three moneths pay, and be put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for one moneth, upon bread and water.</p>
                        <p>130. No Colonell or Captaine either of Horse or Foot shall give leave to
his Souldiers to goe home out of the Field, without leave of our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
or chiefe Commander; whosoever does the contrary, shall lose three
moneths pay, and be put in prison for one moneth, upon Bread and Water.</p>
                        <p>131. No Captaine either of Horse or Foot shall presume to goe out of any
Leaguer or place of Strength to demand his pay, without leave of the Generall or
Governour; who so doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall be cashired from his place, and put out of the
quarters.</p>
                        <p>132. No Captaine either of Horse or Foot shall hold backe any of his souldiers
meanes from him; of which if any complaine, the Captaine shall answer it before
the Court, where being found guilty, he shall be punisht as for other Felony; also if
any mischance ensue thereupon, as that the Souldiers mutine, be sicke, or endure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or give up any Strength; then shall he answer for all those inconveniences, that
hereupon can or may ensue.</p>
                        <p>133. If any Captaine lends money unto his souldiers, which he desires should
be paid againe; that must be done in the presence of the Muster-masters, that our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
be no way hindred or neglected.</p>
                        <p>134. If upon necessity the case sometimes so falls out in the Leaguer, that
pay bee not alwayes made at the due time, mentioned in the Commissions, yet
shall every man in the meane time, be willing to further our service, seeing
they have victualls sufficient for the present, and that they shall so soone as
may bee receive the rest of their meanes, as is mentioned in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
                        <p>135. Very requisite it is, that good justice be holden amongst our Souldiers, as
well as amongst other our Subjects.</p>
                        <p>136. For the same reason was a King ordained by God to be the Soveraigne Judge
in the field as well as at home.</p>
                        <p>137. Now therefore in respect of many occasions which may fall out, his single
judgement alone may be too weak to discerne every particular circumstance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is requisite that in the Leaguer, as well as otherwhere, there be some Court of
Justice erected for the deciding of all controversies; and to be carefull in like manner,
that our Articles of warre be of all persons observed and obeyed so farre forth as
is possible.</p>
                        <p>138. We ordaine therefore that there be two Courts in our Leaguer; a high Court,
and a lower Court.</p>
                        <p>139. The lower Court shall be amongst the Regiments both of Horse and Foot,
whereof every Regiment shall have one among themselves.</p>
                        <p>140. In the Horse-Regiments the Colonell shall be President, and in his absence the
Captaine of our owne Life-guards; with them are three Captains to be joyned, three
Lieutenants, three Cornets, and three Quarter-masters, that so together with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
they may be to the number of thirteene at the least.</p>
                        <p>141. In a Regiment of Foot the Colonell also shall be President, and his Lieutenant
Colonell in his absence; with them are two Captains to be joyned, two Lieutenants,
two Ensignes, foure Serjeants, and two Quarter-masters; that together with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
they may be thirteene in number also.</p>
                        <p>142. In our highest Marshall Court, shall our Generall be Preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; in his absence our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18615:243"/>
Field-Marshall, when our Generall is present, his asseciats shall be our Field-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
first, next him our Generall of the Ordnance, Serjeant-Major-Generall, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of the Horse, Quarter-Master-Generall; next to them shall sit our Muster-Masters
and all our Colonells, and in their absence their Lieutenant-Colonells, and
these shall sit together when there is any matter of great importance in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
                        <p>143. Whensoever this highest Court is to be holden, they shall observe this order;
our great Generall as President, shall sit alone at the head of the Table, on his right
hand our Field-Marshall, on his left hand the Generall of the Ordnance, on the right
hand next our Serjeant-Major-Generall, on the left hand againe the Generall of the
Horse, and then the Quarter-Master-Generall on one hand, and the Muster-Master-Generall
on the other; after them shall every Colonell sit according to his place, as
here followes; first, the Colonell of our Life-Regiment, or of the Guards of our owne
person; then every Colonell according to their places of antiquity. If there happen to
be any great men in the Army of our subjects, that be of good understanding, they
shall cause them to sit next these Officers; after these shall sit all the Colonells of
strange Nations, every one according to his antiquity of service.</p>
                        <p>144. All these Judges both of higher and lower Courts, shall under the blue Skies
thus sweare before Almighty God, that they will inviolably keep this following oath
unto us: <hi>I. R. W.</hi> doe here promise before God upon his holy Gospell, that I both will &amp;
shall Judge uprightly in all things according to the Lawes of God, of our Nation,
and these Articles of Warre, so farre forth as it pleaseth Almighty God to give me
understand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ng; neither will I for favour nor for hatred, for good will, feare, ill
will, anger, or any gift or bribe whatsoever, judge wrongfully; but judge him free
that ought to be free, and doom him guilty, that I finde guilty; as the Lord of Heaven
and Earth shall help my soule and body at the last day, I shall hold this oath truly.</p>
                        <p>145. The Judges of our highest Court shall take this their oath in the first Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,
where our Campe shall be pitched; our Generall, and the rest appointed to set
with him shall repaire to the place where we shall appoint, before his Tent, or other
where; where an Officer appointed by us, shall first take his oath, and then the
others oathes also.</p>
                        <p>146. When the President of our lower Courts shall heare this foresaid oath read
before them, then shall they hold up their hands, and sweare to keep it; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
so often as any Court is to be holden in any Regiment, the aforesaid oath shall be
read before all them that sit in judgement with him, who shall also hold up their
hands and promise to keepe the oath aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>147. In our highest Court, there shall be one sworne Secretary appointed, who
shall make a diligent record of all the proceedings that shall fall out, either in any
pitcht Battell, Skirmish, Leaguer, or any other peece of service whatsoever; he shall
take the note, both of the day, place, and houre, with all other circumstances that
shall happen; he shall also set his hand unto all sentences signed by our Generall;
he shall have also two Clerkes or Notaries under him, who shall ingrosse all these
passages, and keepe a true Register of all enterprises, that our Generall with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of Warre shall give order to have done; and likewise of what letters be either
written or received.</p>
                        <p>148. In our highest Court there shall be one Vice-President, who shall command
the Serjeant at Armes, whose office is to warne in all the Judges of the Court, that
they may there appeare at the time and place appointed, and also to give the same no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
both unto the Plaintife and Defendant.</p>
                        <p>149. In all lower Courts also, there shall be one sworne Clerke or Secretary who
shall likewise hold the same order that is mentioned in our highest Court.</p>
                        <p>150. Our highest Court shall be carefull also to heare and judge all criminall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and especially cases of conspiracy or treason practised or plotted against us, or our
Generall either in word or deed; secondly, if any gives out dishonourable speeches
against our Majesty; thirdly, or consulteth with the enemy to betray our Leaguer, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
Towne, Souldiers, or Fleet any way whatsoever; fourthly, if any there be partakers
of such treason or treachery, and reveale it not; fifthly, or any that hath held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
and intelligence with the enemy; sixthly, if any hath a spite or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18615:243"/>
malice against us or our Country; seventhly, if any speake disgracefully, either of
our owne or our Generalls person or indeavours; eightly, or that intendeth treachery
against our Generall or his Under-Officers; or that speaketh disgracefully of them.</p>
                        <p>151. All questions in like manner happening betwixt Officers and their Souldiers,
if they suspect our lower Court to be partiall any way, then may they appeale unto
our highest Court, who shall decide the matter.</p>
                        <p>152. If a Gentleman or any Officer be summoned to appeare before the lower
Court, for any matter of importance, that may touch his life, or honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then shall
the same be decided by our higher Court.</p>
                        <p>153. All civill questions that be in controversie in our lower Court, if the debt or
fine extends unto five hundred Dollars, or seventy five pounds or above; if the party
complaines of injustice, they may thence appeale unto the higher Court, if so be they
can first prove the injustice.</p>
                        <p>154. All other occasions that may fall out, be they civill, or be they criminall;
shall first come before the lower Court where they shall be heard: and what is there
by good evidence proved, shall be recorded.</p>
                        <p>155. Any criminall action, that is adjudged in our lower Court, we command, that
the sentence be presented, unto our Generall; we will not have it presently put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
untill he gives command for it in our absence. But our selves being in person
there present, will first take notice of it, and dispose afterwards of it, as we shall think
expedient.</p>
                        <p>156. In our higher Court, the Generall Parforce, or his Lieutenant, shall be the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife,
who shall be bound to follow the complaint diligently, to the end he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
informe our Counsellors who are to doe Justice: if it be a matter against our selves,
then shall our owne Advocate defend our action, before our Court.</p>
                        <p>157. The same power the Parforce of every Regiment shall have in our lower
Court, which Parforce shall be bound, also to give notice of every breach of those
Articles of warre, that the infringer may be punished.</p>
                        <p>158. Whatsoever fine is by the aforesaid Judges determined according to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of warre, and escheated thereupon, shall be divided into three parts. Our owne
part of the fine we freely bestow upon the severall Captains either of Horse or Foot,
which is forfeited by their Officers and Souldiers; &amp; the forfeiture of every Captain, we
bestow upon their Colonell; and the forfeiture of every Colonell we give unto our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.
The other two parts, belonging either to the party to whom it is adjudged, or
to the Court, those leave we undisposed, the point of Treason onely excepted: and this
gift of ours unto our Officers, is to be understood to indure so long as the Army be in
the field, upon any strength or worke, and till they come home againe, after which
time, they shall come under the law of the land like the other inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>159. Whensoever our highest Court is to sit, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> shal be two houres before proclaimed
through the Leaguer, that there is such an action criminall to be there tried, which is to
be decided under the blue skies; but if it be an action civill, then may the Court be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
within some tent, or otherwhere; then shall the souldiers come together, about the
place where the Court is to be holden, no man presuming to come too neere the table
where the Judges are to sit; then shall our Generall come formost of all, and the other
his associats, two and two together, in which order, they all comming out of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls
tent, shall set themselves down in the Court, in the order before appointed; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries
place shall be at the lower end of the table, where he shall take diligent notice
in writing of all things declared before the Court; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall the General Parforce begin
to open his complaint before them, and the contrary party shall have liberty to answer
for himselfe, untill the Judges be throughly informed of the truth of all things.</p>
                        <p>160. If the Court be to be holden in any house or Tent, they shall observe the same
order in following the Generall in their degrees, where they shall also sit as is afore
mentioned.</p>
                        <p>161. The matter being throughly opened and considered upon, according to the
importance of it, and our whole Court agreeing in one opinion; they shall command
their sentence concerning the same action, to be publikely there read in the hearing of
all men, alwayes reserving his Majesties further will and pleasure.</p>
                        <p>162. In our lower Court they shall also hold the same order; saving that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18615:244"/>
Court of every Regiment, shall be holden in their owne quarters.</p>
                        <p>163. In this lower Court, they shall alwayes observe this order; namely, that the
President sits at the bords end alone, the Captaines, Lieutenants, and Ensignes on
either side; so many inferiour Officers also upon each side, that so they may the better
reason upon the matter amongst themselves; Last of all, shall the Clerke or Secretary
sit at the lower end of the Table; the one party standing upon one hand, and the other
upon the other.</p>
                        <p>164. So soone as the sentence is given, the President shall rise up, and all that sit
with him; but doom being given by our Generall, that one of the parties must lose
his head, hand, or the like; then shall they command the Parforce to take him away
to Prison, which done, the Parforce shall send unto the Minister, to desire him to visit
the Party, and to give him the Communion; but if the doom be passed in any low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Court, it shall be signified up unto the Generall in our absence, who shall either
pardon the fact, or execute the sentence.</p>
                        <p>165. No superiour Officer, Colonell or Captain, either of Horse or Foot, shall solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
for any man that is lawfully convicted by the Court, either for any crime, or for
not observing of these Articles of Warre; unlesse it be for his very neere kinsman, for
whom nature compells him to intercede; otherwise the solliciter shall be held as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as the delinquent, and cashierd from his charge.</p>
                        <p>166. Whosoever is minded to serve us in these Warres, shall be obliged to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of these Articles. If any out of presumption, upon any Strength, in any Leaguer,
in the field, or upon any worke shall doe the contrary, be he Native or be he Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Gentleman or other, Processe shall be made out against him for every time, so
long as he serves us in these warres in the quality of a Souldier.</p>
                        <p>167. These Articles of warre we have made and ordained for the welfare of our
Native Countrey, and doe command that they be read every moneth publickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every Regiment, to the end that no man shall pretend ignorance. We fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

all our common souldiers, and all others that come into our Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer

things of great moment to be handled, I must crave your
patience to be somewhat the larger in it, and the rather because
I intend to insert the best instructions that our ablest Generalls both ancient and

                        <p>Our ancient and best experienced Commanders found by their practicall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

                        <p>Fifthly, according as your enemies Army shall consist most, either in Horse or Foot;
the choise of your ground shall be thereafter taken for advantage; viz. if your owne

teeth. Finally, if it cannot be eschewed, but that the Wind must be against you,
then place your own Ordnance wide of the Flanks of your Army, so that the smoke
of them may not blind the Front of your Battell.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, get some convenient hils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either Naturall or Artificiall, for the planting
of Ordnance, to flanker the Army and annoy the enemy; the which must be strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guarded, and intrencht if it possibly may be, for it is the first thing the enemy will
seek to surprize, if he possibly may.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, the orderly disposing of the Carts, Waggons, and Carriages, and all the
impediments of the Army in the Rear, so that the Battell may be strengthned and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled
with them; or if there be any naturall strength, as rivers, woods, hedges, ditches,
and the like for to defend the Rear, then to order and place those carriages and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
on the Flanks, whereby they shall bee impaled and strengthned: but if no
commodious place may bee found to safeguard your Army, then raise intrenchments
upon the Flanks and Rear, and man them with Piks and Muskets, or at least impale
them with Pikes and Muskets.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, by dividing the Army into divers sundry Battalions or Divisions, and so
ordering them, that one Division or Battalia may releeve the other, being overcharged
with the enemy; for there is no greater danger can possibly betide an Army than to
range it so as one Division cannot retire between the other Divisions for safety and
strength. Many have used to frame their Battels but of one intire Front, so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repulst,<note place="margin">The first figure of imbattelling hath three severall Battels, <hi>viz.</hi> the main Battell, the Battel of, succour, and the Rear-Battell.</note> they have no refuge, but to be routed and vanquish'd; but this is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
madnesse: for it is great wisdome and policie to range three severall Battels
to retreat into, but never to order lesse than two: for if there bee Battels of succour for
the main Battell to retrait into, then the Files may be the thinner, as we have formerly
instanced the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who used to range his Battalia's but six men in depth;
so that with ten thousand well-exercised men he could extend the Front of his Army
as broad as the enemy could with fourteen thousand, and make his partie good with
them in regard of his sundry Retreats, which brings fresh hands to fight and weary
out the enemy: as also hee would not misse of places of advantage, environed with
water or marish grounds, &amp;c. so that his Army should not be assaulted upon all sides.
<hi>Sebastian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> when he aided <hi>Mulehamet</hi> in the Wars of <hi>Barbary</hi> against
<hi>Abdimelec</hi> King of <hi>Morocco,</hi>

which was as a wall to defend them.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, a Generall must take this for a Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> to enlarge or strengthen the
Front of his Battell according to the number of his Souldiers, as also according to the
force of his enemies Troops; if the place where you are to imbattell in be narrow, then
of necessity you must straighten your Ranks; and if the place be wide and open, you
must bee very carefull not to extend the Front of your Battell too wide, except your
Army bee of greater potencie than the enemies; then by extending out the Wings of
your Battell, you may gain advantage by over-winging them, whereby you may
charge them both in Flank and Front at once. But hee that shall adventure to charge
an Army upon all sides, either must have four times more men than the enemy, or else
he must be sure to perish for want of discretion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18615:245"/>
Also there is great discretion to be used in ordering of Battels, that they may not bee
plac'd in low grounds neer any hill or high banks, or upon the side of a hill, because
the lower grounds are subject to the enemies Ordnance: if the enemy should have this
advantage, the best way to prevent it, is to march out of distance from such places of
advantage, to cause them to come down to you. But some fondly have maintained the
lower ground to be of greatest advantage, in regard the Muskets will doe more service
in shooting upwards than downwards. To this I answer, it is but a simple opinion;
for it is double advantage to have the higher ground, in regard both Horse and Foot
will soon find to their costs that it is a double pains; besides they come upon them
with a great deal more power down hill, than they can up hill, and a bullet shot from
a side-hill may shoot through two or three Ranks, when as that which is shot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
cannot shoot past through one; as for their bullets rowling out, they are sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
men that charge them the mean time. But this by the way.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, your Battell must bee so ordered and disposed, that the enemy may bee
brought into some stratagem, or made to disorder his Troops; which may be done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies, as by causing your Army orderly to retrait, so that the enemy may disorder
his Ranks in the pursuit, and then to take the occasion to fall on again orderly, and rout
them. The ancient Generals were very politick in this, for when they knew that their
enemies plac'd their greatest strength in any one Point or Wing of the Army, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
they would frame that Point or Wing weakest which was to encounter with
them: their ablest forces they commanded to stand firme, and not seek to repulse the
enemy, but to resist them; and the weakest Battalia's they caused to assault the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<note place="margin">Two great disorders the enemy may bee brought into in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the enemy into two great disorders: the first was, the enemy had his best Souldiers
inclosed betwixt their adversaries Battalia's: the second was, when the enemy thought
they had gotten the victory: their Bands would disorder themselves by pillaging: as
the like hapned at the Battell of <hi>Dreux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where the Lord of <hi>Guise</hi> stood fast
with his Battalia, all the rest being fled from him but the valiant <hi>Switzers,</hi> who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
themselves against all the fury of the enemy. In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>'s
Troops being confident of the victory, some of them following the slaughter, and
others fell to pillaging,<note place="margin">La Nowe pag. 381<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> thus being scattered abroad, the Lord <hi>Guise</hi> finding his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
with those men he had hee marched up to them with a bold countenance, and
overthrew them before they could order themselves in any form to receive their charge.
Likewise <hi>Scipio</hi> plac'd his weakest Forces against <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s best souldiers which hee
had plac'd in the midst of the Battell; and upon each Flank <hi>Scipio</hi> had plac'd his ablest
men. So soon as <hi>Asdrubal</hi> charged <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Battell, they retraited, only the two
Flanks of his strongest souldiers stood firme: <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s souldiers pursuing the retrait,
before they were aware, were gotten between the two Divisions of the Flanks of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
as if they had been in an half-Moon; they there being charged upon both sides
by them, his weakest men being there, were soon vanquish'd, and the rather, because
his chiefest Forces, being plac'd in the midst of his Battell, could not come to fight.</p>
                        <p>Eleventhly, You must know how and when to make use of such instruments as
may hinder the enemies Horse, and disorder and annoy his Foot-troops: and for
this purpose the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> made use of an instrument which he termed a Swines
Spike, formerly used by one of our Kings, whereby he gained a Conquest in <hi>France:</hi> it
was a peece of Ash four foot long, at each end a speared pike of yron; his Musketires
stook this at their girdles, and as they advanc'd forwards to give fire upon their enemy,
every man stook down his instrument aslope into the ground; this hindred the Horse
from charging them. Also many have made use of the Caltrop, it being a small peece
of round wood with pikes sticking up every way;<note place="margin">The use of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments you may read in the discourse of Engines.</note> each souldier having one or two of
these about him, may cast them before the Front and Flanks of the Army: these will
much annoy the enemies Horse.</p>
                        <p>Also your Powder-pots being plac'd in the earth, and fire given unto them just as the
enemy shall be approaching over them, these will infinitely disorder and kill them.</p>
                        <p>Moreover it behooves a Generall to be of a very quick apprehension,<note place="margin">In the discourse of Stratagems you shall find variety for all conditions and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and to forecast
with himself what stratagems will best sute with the condition of the enemy, and the
situation of the place, and how and when to put them in execution, that they may work
their best effect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="58" facs="tcp:18615:246"/>
In the framing of your Battell you must bee mindfull to order the Battalia's so as
there may be a space left of two paces for the Musketires to march down by the sides
of the Pikes after they have given fire upon the enemy; for if the distance should bee
lesse, as divers would have it, the motion of the Battalia's would presently close them up.</p>
                        <p>Also the distances between the Battels of the forlorn hopes and the front of the main
Battel ought to be sixtie paces, or according as the place will admit.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, the distances between the main Battell and the Battell of succour ought
to be fifteen or twenty paces. The like distance is to bee observed between the Battell
of succour and the Rear-Battell.</p>
                        <p>That part of the Battell that cannot be secured by Rivers, Moors, Woods, or the like,
must be impaled either by Intrenchments well man'd, or double or treble Pallizado'd,
and wel man'd with Pikes and Muskets; four Ranks of Pikes, and three Ranks of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
wil be sufficient to make the impalement: one Rank of Musketires may be drawn
under the Pikes to give fire upon their knees; the other two Ranks standing behind
the Pikes, may give fire over their heads, as they stoop to charge to the Horse. These
ought not to give fire at random, but just when the Troops are come almost within
push of Pike, and then but every second Musketire is to give fire, so that they may
without intermission maintain their volley of Shot. These new invented Bow-Pikes
are the properest to impale the Battel withall; and it cannot be amisse to have a Rank
or two of them in the Front of the Battalia's, where they may do good service. There
must be a convenient space between the Wings of the Battell and the Impalements, if
in case the formost Battalia's should retrait into the Battell of succour, &amp;c.</p>

ready to give fire upon the enemy at his next approaches; these field-Peeces being there
plac'd, may bee drawn upon the Flanks, ready to give fire upon the enemy when hee
shall charge the Flanks either with Horse or Foot.</p>
                        <p>The forlorn Hopes, when they are wearied and beaten back by the enemy are to
retrait through the spaces left betwixt the Battalions, and there they are to order them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

cause those Troops before them to open a distance for the Shot, and speedily to fall into
their order againe.</p>
                        <p>No Army is to be ordered so that those Battalia's behind, or in the Rear of the Battel
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not succour &amp; assist those that fight before, for then the greatest part of the Army wil
be unprofitable, and if the enemy be potent, it cannot possibly but suffer an overthrow.</p>
                        <p>The Front of the Battel ought to be entire, only those spaces before spoken of, for they
are only to withstand the first brunt of the enemies Charge: and there ought in this to
be more care taken not to be strucken by the enemy, than it importeth to strike them.</p>
                        <p>The second Battell, called the Battell of succour, is to receive the Divisions of the

or distances for that purpose, and ought alwaies to be of lesse Number than the first
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18615:246"/>
Battell; for there can be no danger betide them, in regard the enemy cannot come to
fight with them, unlesse the formost Battell be joyned with them, and then the enemy
will find the middle Battell far stronger than the formost.</p>
                        <p>The Battel in the Rear ought to have the widest spaces or distances of all,<note place="margin">There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if the enemy should be too powerfull for the main Battell and the Battell of succour,
then these distances receive them, and then with one power they assail the enemy with
all the whole strength of the Army; and now they must stand close and strongly to
their tackling to gain victory: and take this for an observation, that souldiers will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their Ranks, and Files when fear maketh them think of flight; and close then
when valour and resolution maketh them stand firm to resist.</p>
                        <p>If the enemy forceth the main Battell to retrait into the Battel of succour, those that
impale the Flanks ought to keep their ground, if possibly they may, for thereby they
shall have advantage to charge the enemy upon the Flanks as they follow the retrait
of your main Battel; but if they be compell'd to retrait, they may doe it safely, falling
back and doubling their own Ranks from the midst downwards to the Rear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it were very fitting an Army should be exercised in order of Battel, to make them
perfect. And again no Generall ought to use one form of imbattelling alwaies, for fear
his enemy should prove too subtill for him, and foil him in his own play.</p>
                        <p>The best way to save an Army from smal-shot, that will much annoy you, is to come
speedily to the encounter. The Officers of every Band being drawn into Battalia, are to
appoint trusty carefull men to fill the souldiers Bandilires, and to deliver Bullets and
March unto them, that there may be no stay nor want, nor any Powder miscarry.</p>
                        <p>If your Army be compounded of divers Nations,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hannibal</hi> used this policy: he plac'd his aids next the enemy, and behind them his <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> so as they could not fly, but either vanquish or weary the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                           </note> so that some of them are not to bee
trusted; those whose loyalties are not to be trusted, must alwaies be plac'd formost next
the enemy, and the faithfullest ablest men behind them, next unto them; so that having
the enemy before, and a strong Battalia behind them, they must of necessity fight or
perish. The <hi>Romans</hi> used to place their assistants or strangers upon the out-Wings of
the Battell. But if your Army consists of divers Nations that you were confident of
their valour and fidelity, the best way were to order them all in one Front; so that the
jealousie of one anothers forwardnesse and valour might breed such an emulation in
them, that they would doe their best to exceed one the other in prowesse. The King
of <hi>Sweden</hi> made use of this policie many times, and it stood him in gread stead; the
same did <hi>Monsieur de Lautrec</hi> against the Emperors Army in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi>
his Army consisting of divers Nations, as <hi>Italians, Switzers, French-men, Gaescoins, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maignes;</hi>
because none of them should be disparaged, hee plac'd them all in on Front;
for he knew of their great emulation, that one Nation desired to be thought more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
than the other.</p>
                        <p>Now it remains to speak of the Cavialry, how they ought to be plac'd; and in this a
great care and circumspection is to be had: first in ordering them into convenient Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia's,
<note place="margin">The Horse are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be divided, and placed on each Wing of the Battell, unlesse one Wing may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

are to be ranged upon each Wing of the Foot-troops, fifty or sixty paces distant from
the Flanks of the Army, lest by their unrulinesse and disorderly retraiting, they presse
upon your own Troops, and dis-rank them.</p>
                        <p>Many times the Horse-troops are divided into six Battalia's, <hi>viz.</hi> three plac'd upon
one Wing, and three upon the other; the formost Battalia's are to consist of as many

as little as possibly may be from the Wings of the Foot-Battalia's; for most properly
they are to resist and seldome to assaile.</p>
                        <p>The best and safest way both for Horse and Foot,<note place="margin">By this means they will be both in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order and breath. <hi>Bellary</hi> would not have them put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards untill the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were within 30. paces.</note> is to keep their ground untill the
enemy be drawn very near unto your Battell, and then to receive their charge.</p>
                        <p>The Cavalry being ordered (as before) into three severall Battels, <hi>viz.</hi> the main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
which is to consist of Carbines; the Battel of succour is to consist of Harquebuziers,
and the Rear-Battell of Curassiers; and many times the Troops of the Carbines and
Harquebuziers are next in the formost Battel, &amp; are to do the first execution upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
troops, &amp; the Curassiers are to finish what they have begun to ruine &amp; disorder.</p>
                        <p>The Battell of succour is to be in distance behind the main Battel forty or fifty paces,<note place="margin">Vide Liv lib. 8. &amp; Lips. de milit. Rom l l4.</note>
and is to have spaces as the Foot hath, for the Divisions to retrait into: the like must
the Rear-Battell have; and it is to be ordered in distance twice as far behind the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
of succour, as the Battell of succour is from the main Battell, <hi>viz.</hi> 80. or 100. foot,
or more or lesse according to the situation of the ground. If the enemy should charge
your Horses in the Rear, in the time of the conflict, then the Generall must send the
Light-armed Horse to resist them; and there must bee alwaies in a readinesse certain
Maniples both of Pikes and Shot plac'd in the Rear of the Battel, to draw out to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
either the Horse or Foot upon all occasions.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, It remains to speak of the waies and means to encourage the souldiers, and to
breed Spirit in them, making them undervalue their enemies, and to charge them with a
boldnesse: and this is to be done by some pithy Oration and perswasive Speech, which
ancient Generals have found by experience to bee of great efficacie to induce them to
wonderfull performances. The Speech may be according as the Generall shall please,
or as if he should in the head of his Troops pronounce these words.</p>
                        <p>Right valiant Captains and fellow-souldiers, I have here ordered you in forme of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
ready to charge our enemies, and doe require of you in the Name of the Lord of Hosts,
two things especially; namely, the utmost of your Valours, and the truth of your Loves in
obedience. For what man soever doth not use his best indeavours to subdue his enemies, is
not only a murtherer of himselfe but of his dear friends; and by disobedience may bee the
means of the Armies overthrow; for which there can be no plea before Gods Tribunal, but
his just sentence of condemnation, besides the in supportable shame and intollerable servitude
wee bring our selves that shall survive, with our dear friends, into, which though it may
seem as a green wound, only to smart at first, yet at last the reproach and disgrace will gnaw
and fret to the bone. Wherefore, brave Souldiers, let your golden Spirits shine, and your
steely mettalls hew out a Conquest for the glory of our great God, and the honour of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King and beloved Countrey. God would have the Israelites fight valiantly as well
as <hi>Moses</hi> to hold up his hands and pray or else no Conquest could be expected: wherefore let
us performe both that the great God of Hosts may bee propitious unto us, according as hee
hath promised to them that seek him. Wherefore let us be confident of Victory and not seek
our ruines by unbeliefe. Let us call to mind our Ancestors, what noble atchievements their
magnanimous Spirits by Gods assistance, effected, whereby our Nation hath been not only
the Mirrour, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>errour to the world. How did they in <hi>France</hi> at the Battell of <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teirs,</hi>
with an handfull of men confound the mighty Army that would have swallowed
them up? The like at <hi>Agen court,</hi> &amp;c. And how gracious was God to us in 88. to dissipate
and destroy our invincible enemie, by his prospering our poor endevours? Wherfore now let us
not despair of his help, but with one joynt consent let us furiously assault our proud enemies,
that wee may enjoy their riches, and eternize our memories to Posterity. For my own part,
I am confident, that if wee resist but three of their charges, that they shall not dare to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the fourth, but to their utter ruine. Wherefore if there be any man timerous or faint-hearted,
let him depart weth his brand of infamy, to be rewarded by his King and
Countrey according to his demerits. But let all Heroick Spirits
ejaculate their petitions to heaven, and say with
me, <hi>Let God arise, and his enemies
shall bee scattered.</hi>

fight or skirmish.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving collected the best Observations that my poor inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
could attain unto, for the fitting of all thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
before the time of fight; now it remains to discourse
of such necessary principles as are convenient to be used in
the time of fight, so that there may bee nothing omitted
which may bee an inducement or furtherance to a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Wherefore, presupposing that the Battell Standards
are pitcht, and the Army ranged accordingly as before is
shewed; the first thing that is to be done, is to draw out
a certain company of Horse and Foot to surprize the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Ordnance, in which they are not bound to keep any array or order, but to run
disbanded, and fall pell mell upon the enemy, whereby his Ordnance will be disabled
from shooting above once.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Forlorn Hopes, and such disbanded Shot are to skirmish with
the enemy, partly to see if they can disorder any of their Divisions, or gain some priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
whereby the Generall may learn how they are imbattelled, and what Stratagems
they intend to use, with the true number both of their Horse and Foot, so as he may the
better fit himself for them; as also by their first onset to breed courage in his own men,
and to make them disdain their enemy.</p>
                        <p>The Forlorn Hope is duly to bee supplyed with men and munition, either from the
Wings of the main-Battel, or else some Maniples appropriated for that purpose; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they prevail against the enemy, so they are to be strengthned: if the enemy bee
too potent for them, then they are to retrait behind the main-Battell, and when the
two Battels joyn, these are to sally out, and charge the enemies Flanks.</p>
                        <p>Some Stratagem or other ought to bee put in practice at the first encounter; for a
small matter, if it comes unexpectedly, will discourage an enemy.</p>
                        <p>If there be any Ambuscado's secretly laid for to charge the enemies in the Flanks or
Rear, let them execute their charge when the two Battels joyn in fight, whereby they
may be disheartned.</p>
                        <p>If in case the enemy take the charge, and make a retrait, those Officers that lead up
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18615:248"/>
the Forlorn Hopes to skirmish, must not pursue the retrait, nor suffer the souldiers to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the enemy no further, since that this skirmishing is to no other end than to breed
a certain impression and good opinion in the minds of your own souldiers.</p>
                        <p>The absolutest way to disorder the enemies Troops, is to charge their Battalia's ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with your Horse or Foot,<note place="margin">Flank and Rear.</note> both in Flank and Front *; and then having certain
Troops of Horse ready formed in manner of a wedge-Battell, that shall indevour to
enter the point of the Battell, and so disorder their Ranks.</p>
                        <p>The Generall is to cause it to bee given out, in the time of fight, that hee hath a new
supply of men comming unto him; and may make a shew of some matters like a truth
that may signifie his Succours to be neer at hand. This may take effect to discourage
them, so that with little difficulty they may be vanquish'd. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> put all the servants
and labourers belonging to the Army upon beasts unfit for fight, causing them to bee
ranged in such sort, that they seemed afar off to be a great number of Horse-men, whom
he sent up upon a mountain some what neer unto his enemies Army, commanding them
to keep themselves close untill the Battell was begun, and that then they should shew
themselves in many Troops like Horse-men faining to march down to charge the Rear
of the enemies Army: this put the enemy to flight.</p>
                        <p>But if the Countrey be plain, so that no Ambush can be laid, then there must be Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
digged, and men laid privily in them, and covered over with green boughs. Also
such kind of Ditches may be digged, and covered over slightly with boughs, and earth
laid slightly over, and certain firme places bee left betwixt the Trenches, with good
marks for to find them, at which places they may retire that are sent to charge the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
faining to be afraid in their speedy retrait, to cause the enemy to follow them the
faster, and so to fall into the snare.</p>
                        <p>Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that upon the disordering of the enemy, the main-Battell is not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the pursuit, but certain Troops of each Wings, both of the Horse and Foot are
to pursue the victory.</p>
                        <p>If any accident should happen unto the Generall during the Combat, which might
dismay his souldiers, it is a point of great wisdome for to cover it, and to make the best
of it presently; as <hi>Hostilius,</hi> who seeing that his assistants, which should have entred Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
with him, went their waies without striking stroke; hee knowing their departure
would have greatly dismaid his souldiers, caused it to be given out through all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that they went away through his commandement: this did not only appease the
people, but did moreover incourage them, that they were victorious. <hi>Sylla</hi> having part
of his Troop slain, fearing lest his Army should be discouraged, hee said, he sent them of
purpose to be slain, in regard they conspired against him.</p>
                        <p>In the Battell of <hi>Flanders,</hi> when the enemy had cut off the whole Regiment of <hi>Scots,</hi>
that were sent to guard a passage, one only man brings the newes of it; his Excellency
caused him to be slain, lest he should have frighted the Army by the report of so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
an accident.</p>
                        <p>A Generals care must ever be to avoid confusion of fight, which is to begin before your
time; which causeth such inconveniences, as are cause oftentimes of losse. Therefore in
the beginning of your fight, take great heed you invade not, nor fight confusedly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
every part of the Army hath his ordinary time to fight; neither suffer any part of
your Army to fight with your enemy in any other fashion than you appointed them.</p>

                           </note> the Army must give a mighty terrible
shout, to dishearten the enemy: and then afterwards keep great silence, that the sounds
of the Drums and Trumpets may be heard, and distinguished, as also such commands
as Officers shall give.</p>
                        <p>If your Horse-men be oppressed with your enemies Horse-men, send for succour a
supply of Musketires, who may scattering and out of order, as occasion shall
serve, shoot at the oppressors, and upon occasion retire, and returne very often:
to these you may send a guard of Pikes for rescue, the better to bring them off safe. But
if you invade your enemy with Musketires, with your guard of Pikes send some
Horse, so that both may defend them from invasion of the enemies Horse-men. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
to give the enemie his hands full, follow him with a Battalion resolutely, to
put all, or one of his Battalions to rout; and having discomfited any one of
his Battels, send only a small or convenient company to pursue the chase, and with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18615:248"/>
the rest invade quickly some part of his Army fighting with any one of your Battells;
this must of necessity be done; for sundry Victories have been lost upon this occasion,
that when one Battell hath overthrown his first encountred enemies Battell, it hath
immediately followed the chase, and not holpen his own fellowes in danger.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, in your first joyning of Battell, if your Fore-ward gain the Victory, joyne
other Battels immediately whilst comfort is on your side, and your enemies disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
This got <hi>Bucoy</hi> the victory at <hi>Prague.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If your Foot-men be vehemently oppressed with your enemies Foot-men; send your
Horse-men to invade the Flanks of your enemies, and with them some Shot to hold
them play: but if you can plant a Peece of Ordnance against their Flanks; it will gall
them shrewdly.</p>
                        <p>If your enemies main Battell doe urge very valiantly your Fore-ward, and his other
Battels be not ready to help or rescue; cause both your other Battels, one on the one
side, and the other on the other side, freshly to invade your enemies main Battel; and
herein you shall do wisely, imitating our brave <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Poytirs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Generall perceiveth he hath a greater Army than his enemy, minding to
compasse him about before he be aware, let the Front of the Battell be ranged equall to
the Front of the enemies, and so soon as the fight is begun, let him make the Front by
little and little to retire, and the Wings to advance a little forwards, and then charge
the enemy upon the Flanks. By this many Armies have been vanquish'd.</p>
                        <p>It hath been a thing of great importance, whilst the fight continueth, to give out
the word, that the Generall, or some chief Commander of the enemies is slain, or that
one Wing or other of their Army is vanquish'd. Also the Chivalry of the enemies is
to be feared with some strange fights, or by some fire-works, by which they may bee
made unserviceable.</p>
                        <p>Now if the enemy have any Peeces of Ordnance in the Rear of their Army, if their
Battalia's suddenly divide themselves, you are to doe the like, for bee sure, they intend
to discharge upon you.</p>
                        <p>If the enemy should endanger the taking of your Baggage; by no means suffer any
of your Troops, either Horse or Foot, confusedly to run to relieve the same; but advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
send a sufficient Strength to perform that Service when the enemy shall bee most
busie in ransacking the Waggons, whereby they may be easily vanquish'd.</p>
                        <p>Where the enemy comes most potently and furiously upon any part of your Army,
be sure there to discharge your Ordnance at the thickest of them, and being thereby
disperst, let your Horse charge them, taking the advantage of their disorder.</p>
                        <p>If the enemies Horse charge any of your Battalia's in the midst of it, bee ready to
give way to them, by making a passage for them; and as they passe through, charge
them upon either Flank, by which means they will have the worst of it.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, to end with <hi>Machiavils</hi> Rules of Warre which hee hath set down for Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes
to be observed by all Commanders, as followeth.</p>
                        <p>1 The same that helpeth the enemy, hurteth thee; and the same that helpeth thee,
hurteth the enemy.</p>
                        <p>2 He that shall be in the War most vigilant to observe the devises of the enemy, and
shall take most pains to exercise his Army, shall incur least perils, and may hope most
of the victory.</p>
                        <p>3 Never conduct thy men to fight the field, if first thou hast not confirm'd their minds
and knowst them to be without fear, and to be in good order; for thou oughtst never to
enterprize any thing of danger with thy souldiers, but when thou seest they hope to
overcome.</p>
                        <p>4 It is better to conquer the enemy with famine than with yron: in the victory
of which, fortune may doe much more than valour.</p>
                        <p>5 No purpose is better than that which is hid from the enemy until thou hast executed it.</p>
                        <p>6 To know in the Warre how to understand occasion, and to take it; helpeth more
than any other thing.</p>
                        <p>7 Nature breedeth very few strong men; but industry and exercise maketh many.</p>
                        <p>8 Discipline may doe more in Warre than fury.</p>
                        <p>9 When any depart from the enemies side for to come to serve thee, when they be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
they shall be unto thee alwaies great gains, for that the power of the adversaries are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18615:249"/>
more diminished with the losse of them that run away, than of those that are slain,
although that the name of a Fugitive be to new friends suspected, and to old odious.</p>
                        <p>10 Better it is, in pitching the field, to reserve behind the first Front aid enough,
than to make the Front bigger to disperse the Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>11 Hee is difficulty overcome which can know his own power; and the same of
the enemy.</p>
                        <p>12 The valiantnesse of the souldiers availeth more than the multitude.</p>
                        <p>13 Sometimes the situation helpeth more than the valiantnesse.</p>
                        <p>14 New and sudden things make Armies afraid; slow and accustomed things bee
little regarded of them. Therefore make thy Army to practise, and to know with small
fights a new enemy, before thou come to fight the Field with him.</p>
                        <p>15 He that with disorder followeth the enemy after that his Battalia's be broken,
will do no other than to become of a Conquerour a Loser.</p>
                        <p>16 He that prepareth not necessary victuals to live upon, is overcome without yron.</p>
                        <p>17 Hee that trusteth more in Hors-men than in Foot-men, or more in Foot-men
than in Horse-men, must accommodate himself with the situation.</p>
                        <p>18 When thou shalt understand there is a Spie from the enemy come into the
Camp, cause every man to goe to his lodging.</p>
                        <p>19 Change purpose when thou perceivest that the enemy hath fore-seen it.</p>
                        <p>20 Consult with many of those things which thou oughtest to doe; the same that
thou wilt after doe, conferre with few.</p>
                        <p>21 Souldiers, when they abide at home, are maintained with fear and punishment;
after, when they are led to the Wars, with hope and reward.</p>
                        <p>22 Good Captains come never to fight the Field, except necessity constrains them,
and occasion calls them.</p>
                        <p>23 Cause, that the enemy know not how thou wilt order thy Army to fight, and
in whatsoever manner thou ordainest it, make that the first Battell may be received of
the second, and the second of the third.</p>
                        <p>24 In the fight, never make use of the Battell to any other thing than to the same
for which thou hast appointed it, if thou wilt make no disorder.</p>
                        <p>25 The sudden accidents with difficulty are removed, or remedied; those that are
thought upon, with facility.</p>
                        <p>26 Men, yron, money, and bread be the strength of the Warre; but of these four,
the first two bee most necessary: because men and yron find money and bread, but
bread and money find not men and yron.</p>
                        <p>27 The unarmed rich man is a booty to the poor souldier.</p>
                        <p>28 Accustome thy souldiers to despise delicate living, and lascivious apparrell.</p>
                        <p>Thus much I thought good to collect concerning this subject, which I hope will
give any discreet Souldier content.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in the precedent Chapter discourst of such things as are
requisite to be done in the time of Skirmish; in this Chapter
I shal demonstrate what is to be done after a Conquest either
gained or lost. Wherefore the first thing to bee considered, is,
how a General shal demean himself, so that the Forces which
are left may not be quite destroyed, and so the overthrow to
redound to his utter confusion. Wherfore a General must or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his affaires so, that his enemies should not follow his men
to overtake them in their flight from the Battell: and for this
purpose he must use some policy to hinder them, as <hi>Sertorius</hi> practised: <hi>Metellus</hi> having
vanquisht his Army, and knowing it was to no purpose for him to flie, commanded his
Officers to retire unto divers places, as scatteringly and disperst as possibly they could,
(knowing that the enemy would not make pursuit after such disbanded persons,<note place="margin">It is policy for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall not to divide his Army to follow the pursuit, but rather let such small Troops depart quietly. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it good to let the souldiers know the place of meeting before-hand, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the chief Officers.</note> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such as went by Troops) and having first advertised them where every man should
come to his Rendevous and meet again; this was the means of saving most of his men:
but if they should be pursued, then every man must cast such treasure as he hath in the
way as they flie, that the enemy may stay to get it up. King <hi>Mithridates</hi> made use of
this policy to escape from <hi>Lucullus.</hi> Likewise <hi>Frotho</hi> King of the <hi>Danes</hi> being landed in
<hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> deceived the Natives that pursued him; they being laded with the <hi>Danish</hi> goods
and jewels, and scattered about here and there to gather them up, were set upon again by
the <hi>Danes</hi> with some of their forces they had rallyed together, and vanquisht the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
at their pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Many that have been overthrown in Battell, by reason of Woods and other secure
places, have saved themselves, and being come together, have secretly returned in the
night, and charged the enemy who hath thought himselfe secure, and have taken them
so disorderly, that they have routed them.</p>
                        <p>If the Conquerour have taken many prisoners, and the vanquished should rally
his forces againe, thinking to have an advantage to assault the Conquerour; then
there is no way, but every souldier must kill his prisoner, lest they should take an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to resist. If a Battell should be fought, and neither side be utterly vanquisht,
but the darknesse of the night cause them to give over, the best way for him that hath
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18615:250"/>
lost most men in the fight, to cause some of his Souldiers to steale away the bodies of
their owne slaine men, and privately bury them; so that the enemy shall conceive
that he had the worst of the fight, in regard he sees most of his men slaine; this will
make him loth to encounter againe.</p>
                        <p>The victour after he hath discomfited his enemies army, and scattered them about,
ought to send a sufficient number of Horse and Foot, to lye upon some passages, secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the night-time, which leads to some Town or Fort of theirs of greatest strength,
and neerest at hand, where they shall bee sure to entrap all such as shall seek by flight
to save themselves.</p>
                        <p>Likewise when a Generall sees there is no way but to be routed, let him send spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
certain Troops of Horse and Foot to the next straight passage, which may so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for themselves, that they may defend the passage, so as divers of their own souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may safely escape; for an enemy will not divide his Army to weaken it, to follow
the chase of the subdued enemy, much lesse to seek to gain a passage which is fortified,
to hinder their escapes: for he that with disorder followeth the enemy after he is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
will doe no other, than to become of a Conquerour a Loser.</p>
                        <p>Many things more you may expect should have been here inserted; but I have been
plentifull in setting down divers observations most proper to these Discourses, in the
Office of a Generall, and in the Discourse of Marching and Retraiting from an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
In the next place I shall endeavour to portray to your view sundry forms
of Imbattellings, which have been, and now are in use, and some
newly invented; with a demonstration of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of framing them and the
true use of them.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Figure hath before the Front of the Battell foure
Divisions, marked A. which are termed Forlorn Hopes: <hi>viz.</hi>
one Division before the Front of the right Wing, and the other
before the Front of the left Wing of the main Battell. In each of
these Divisions of Forlorn Hopes are foure hundred and fiftie
Souldiers, Pikes and Musketires. There are also two other Divisions
of Forlorn Hopes plac'd in the midst before the Front of the main
Battell, containing likewise four hundred and fifty in each of them: these Forlorn
Hopes are advanc'd before the main Battell an hundred paces, or as much more as the
Generall pleaseth. These are first to make loose skirmishes with the enemy, to draw
them within distance of the Ordnance; they are gently and orderly to retrait: the
two Divisions of Forlorn Hopes next each Flank are to fall back and joyn with the
same. The two Forlorn Hopes in the midst are to fall back into the space in the midst
of the main Battell.</p>
                        <p>But first the Ordnance, after they have performed their duties, are to bee drawn
back through this broad distance or space, and are to be plac'd before the Front of the
Battell of succour.</p>
                        <p>The Forlorn Hopes are to have certain Troops of Carbines to be flankered twenty
two paces or more, side-waies from them, <hi>viz.</hi> on either Wing two hundred and fiftie,
marked B. these are to make light skirmishes with the enemies Horse, and likewise to
view what advantages may be taken by the ill ordering of the enemies Array.</p>
                        <p>Before the Front of the main Battell are planted divers Field-Peeces, marked C.
there are two others on each side of the Forlorn Hopes, marked D. these are to scowre

to have a sufficient Guard both of Horse and Foot; and are to command and scowre
the Plaines within distance of their Shot. These are likewise to be drawn back upon
the enemies approaching, and to be plac'd at the point of the Flank of each Wing of
the main Battell, ten or twelve paces wide.</p>
                        <p>The main Battell consists often Maniples or Battalia's, marked F. <hi>viz.</hi> five towards
the right Flank, and five towards the left.</p>

In the midst is a broad space or distance of ground containing forty two
paces, for the Artilery to bee drawn to and fro, as also for the two middle
Divisions of the Forlorne Hopes to retrait through for their safety, behind the
main Battell.</p>
                        <p>Likewise through this distance or space divers loose Shot may sally out and give
fire upon the enemies Battalia of Pikes. Also divers Souldiers with fire-works and
Granado's, are to goe and come, to cast them against the enemies Troops, which will
be a great annoyance unto them.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, under the Front of the Pikes are divers Fire-locks or Musketires to be
placed,<note place="margin">Short Swords and Targets are excellent to line the Front of Pikes, to cut off the enemies Pikes heads.</note> that shall play upon the enemies Pikes, when the enemy shall bee approacht
within twenty of forty paces of your main Battell; <hi>viz.</hi> five hundred Shot.</p>
                        <p>The Ordnance that before were drawn down from before the main Battel, unto the
Front of the Battell of succour, are (when the enemy is within twenty paces of your
foremost Battels) to be levelled right up this broad space or distance, and having given
fire in a right line upon the enemy, those of the Forlorn Hope that retraited into that
space, being ordered and ranged 37. in Rank, and ten deep in File, and plac'd behind the
Battalia, upon the right side, marked P. and 38. in Rank plac'd behind the middle Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,
on the left side, at Q. <hi>viz.</hi> three hundred and seventy even behind the Maniple or
Battalion of the right side of the said space, and three hundred and eighty souldiers
behind the Battalia of the left side: so soon as the Shot is past, the three hundred and
seventy souldiers are to face to the left hand, and the three hundred and eighty to
the right; and so advancing forwards into the midst of the space or division to their
even distance; they are again to face towards the Front of the main Battell, and are
speedily to march up and joyn with them, whereby the whole body will be strong and
firm to receive the enemies charge.</p>
                        <p>Likewise the severall distances betwixt every Maniple or Battalia of this main
Battel,<note place="margin">Note, each Battalia of this main Battell contains 1000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> is<note n="*" place="margin">If the partition should be lesse than 2. paces, they would close up in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Army.</note> two paces; and this is for the Shot, after they have given fire, to march down
into the Rear.</p>
                        <p>Behind this main Battel is the Battell of succour, consisting of six Divisions or Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia's
marked H. these are ranged, in distance from the Rear of the main Battel,
twenty or thirty paces.</p>
                        <p>The space or distance of these Battalia's betwixt Flank and Flank, from one

the Battell of succour marked I. the space or distance of ground between these
Maniples or Battalia's are three hundred thirtie six paces: the reason is, because if
the enemy should still over-charge the former principall Battels, then they are to
make their last retrait betwixt these divisions or spaces; <hi>viz.</hi> whereas before there
retraited into the Battell of succour four Maniples or Battalia's, and the first Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
unto the Flank of the right Wing, as also the other four Battalia's retraited
into the spaces upon the left side of the Battell of succour, and the fift Battalia upon
the out-side of the Flank of the left Wing of the same: so now there must retrait
six Battalia's into the spaces between the Battalia's of the rear-Battell, and two
Battalia's upon the out-side of the Battalia of the right Wing; and also the other six
Battalia's retraiteth into the spaces upon the left side, and two Battalia's upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Battalia of the left Wing. Likewise the middlemost Battalia is to retrait
into the space in the midst, so that by this means there shall bee brought two thousand
four hundred fresh souldiers more to joyn with the rest to fight.</p>
                        <p>By this means the enemy will bee wearied,<note place="margin">The rear-Battel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of 2000. souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>viz. 500.</hi> in each Battalia.</note> and also over-winged, by reason this
Battell at the last retraiting is as broad again as it was at first. Thus it will
come to passe that the enemy shallbe charged both in Front and Flank, whereby hee
shall surely be routed.</p>
                        <p>The Flanks of this Battell are to be impaled on either side with four hundred eighty
five Pikes, &amp; two hundred ninety one Musketires; because the distance from the Front

new fashioned Pikes with Bowes annexed to them are the best for Impalement: also
they may doe much good to bee plac'd in the first and second Ranks of the main-Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
in the Front thereof, to gall the enemies Horse. This Impalement is to bee set a
pretty distance from the Flanks, that the Battalia's upon their retrait may have room
to fall in betwixt the Flanks and the Impalement. The Impalement in the Rear, is
to be made of the Carts and Carriages, or some Intrenchments, if occasion bee. The
Rear of this Battell extends it selfe seven hundred paces wide from the Flank of the
right Wing to the left, and without Intrenchments, or Carriages, Carts and Waggons
fastned with chaines together; it would take up a quarter of the Army to impale it so
strongly as the Flanks are.</p>

for their Armes, which would be but little burthen to them, and these would help
to defend the Carriages in the Rear, with the help of a small quantity of Pikes
and Muskets: so that if there bee two Pikes and three Musketires to guard the

                        <p>Note that when the maine Battell retreats into the Battell of succour, the impale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Flankes are to stand firme if they can possibly, and are to charge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
on the Flankes: but if the two first Battells retreat into the Reare Battell, they
must of necessity then fall backe, and halfe of them strengthen the Reare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Front of the Battell then will extend it selfe so wide that the impalements of
the Flanks must give way to the Battalia's that shall retreate, and so they will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
from the impalement in the Reare, which places bein not fortified by these
Souldiers, there will be an advantage for the enemy to breake in upon the Reare of
the Battell with his Horse.</p>
                        <p>The residue of the Horse troopes are to be imbattelled in severall Battalia's downe
by the Flankes of the wings of the Army, and wide in distance from them sixty paces
or more: the Carbines or Harquebuziers are to maintaine skirmish with the enemies
Troopes, and if it chance they make any breach into any of the Foot-Battalia's, by
charging them in Front and Flanke, then the Curassiers are to second them, and to
breake into their Ranks.</p>

a square forme before the points of the Wings of the maine Battell, as well to secure
them from danger of having their Rancks broken, as also upon occasion to rescue the

                        <p>The rest of the Horse are to be ranged upon the Wings of the Army in three severall

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this second figure following you may perceive a very strange
forme of Imbattelling, very apt for the drawing an enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a stratageme, whereby of necessity they must be disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and routed.</p>
                        <p>First, the Forlorne Hopes consisting of 1500. Pikes and
Musketiers in either grand division marked A, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
200. paces before the first Battell, which is plac'd for
their succour; these are first to skirmish with the enemy, and
then orderly to retreat even with the said Battell of succour, when the enemies troopes
are at push of Pike with them, and eagerly pursuing them untill they are come within
the distance of the first stratageme; then fire is to be given to the traines, and upon
the disorder they are to advance forwards, and furiously to charge the enemy in the
Front, and the Horse on either Flanke.</p>
                        <p>But if the enemies discomfiture be not so great but that they take heart of grace,
and stand so firmely to their tackling that they are too prevalent for you, then the
Forlorne Hopes and the Battell of succour are to retreat betweene the divisions of the
maine Battell, the enemy then pressing forwards within the distance of the second
stratageme; then fire being given to the traines, the whole strength of the Army will
be in a readinesse to take the advantage to charge the enemy in his disorders, as before
is specified; and also then the Field-peeces shall have freedome immediately to play
upon the enemies Troopes.</p>
                        <p>If the maine Battell should retreat (except upon a wonderfull occasion of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity)
it will be most dangerous; for if any of the divisions of the two Wings or of

forwards and joyne with the maine Battell; and then manfully to encounter

enemy upon any place of advantage.</p>
                        <p>But let me request you to observe how either of the Forlorne Hopes consists of a
thousand men marked A, the first Battell of succour being foure Battallia's marked B,
have in each of them 600. men.</p>
                        <p>The maine Battell marked C consists of eight Battells, and each of them containes

upon both Wings there are 1100. men.</p>
                        <p>There are also 600. Shot which are to joyne with three hundred Carbines; these
are to surprize the enemines Ordnance as you may see marked at F and G, (viz.)
300. Shot on each Wing with 150. Horse; these are to use all celerity and diligence
to surprise, or at least to hinder the enemy from shooting with his Ordnance against
your Troopes.</p>
                        <p>There is also 600. men to guard your owne Ordnance, least the enemy surprise
them, and two hundred horse to assist them; (viz.) on either wing are 300. Foot and

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE figure of the Battell following is invented for the safe retire of the
Shot, being over-powred and repulsed by the Horsemen of the enemy;
or otherwise, who may at eight severall places retire into these Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
which stand in the proportion of a Fortresse.</p>
                        <p>There are thirty seven Maniples of Shot orderly plac'd, the distance
betwixt each are three paces; in every Maniple are contained 130. Shot,
which amounts to in grosse 4810. the residue being 190. are equally plac'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Ordnance being 23. at each Platforme; so there is only six remaines to be
imployed upon messages, or to guard the Powder.</p>
                        <p>These Maniples or Battalia's of Shot, are Impaled with the Pikes, which are thus
ordered; each Flanke hath 850. also the Front and Reare takes up 800. each corner
takes up 425. these amount to 5000. Pikes, being ordered ten deep in file.</p>
                        <p>In either corner of this Battell are two spaces for the Shot to sally out upon the
enemy, and to retreate in againe for their safety.</p>
                        <p>The Ordnance being discharged upon the enemies Troopes are to be drawne in at
these spaces, and plac'd within the Reare of the Pikes; so that when the enemy charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
the Pikes may close themselves into one maine Square by causing the Flanks to
March up to the corners of the Squares, which as occasion shall offer, may disclose
againe, and let out the Shot to skirmish with the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The Squares of Pikes at each corner, doth much strengthen the Battell, especially
if the enemy chargeth it on Front and Flanke at once; it is all in all to strengthen the
corners of any Battell whatsoever, for in the corners lyes all the weaknesse.</p>
                        <p>Moreover if the enemy chargeth upon two sides at once, yet those passages furthest
from them may have Shot sally out and give fire upon them, and safely retrait in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
There is no wise Generall will adventure to charge such a Battell as this is upon
all foure sides at once, except his Army were foure times stronger in men and horse.</p>
                        <p>If need be, Shot may be drawne continually round under the Pikes, which may
give fire upon the enemy and so fall in againe, and be continually releeved.</p>
                        <p>The Horse are to be ranged upon each Flank or Wing in indifferent small Battalia's,
and are to be lined with Musketiers; these may do great execution when the Ordnance

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N Marshalling this Battell, this course is to bee observed; the Pikes
consisting of 4000. must be ranged into eight Battalia's; each Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
hath 460. Pikes, (viz.) 46 in ranke, and 10. deep in file,
which amounts to in the whole summe 3680. so there remains 320.
Pikes of the 4000. which are thus disposed of; upon the right
Sleeve in the Front is 120 Pikes, which are either to guard the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
or to assist the Horse, as occasion shall serve; likewise there is
as many on the left Sleeve to be imployed as the former; in the Reare are 80. more
plac'd for the guarding of the Ordnance, as you may see at each Platforme 40.</p>

                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:18615:254"/>
In the next place the foure thousand Shot are thus to bee Marshalled; each
Flanke of the Pikes hath six hundred twenty foure Shot ranged eight in depth, and
seventy eight in Ranke or Brest; that is one thousand two hundred forty eight upon
both Sleeves; for from the Front of the Pikes to the Reare is fifty two paces, and the
spaces or distances betwixt each Battalia is five paces, and the three Battalia's oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupieth
forty two paces of ground, (viz.) in each Battalia fourteene paces, so that
every souldier occupieth seven foot of ground betwixt Ranke and Ranke, which
makes fifty two paces.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>In the next place there is thirty six Squadrons of Shot, each Squadron containing
seventy men; in the Front there are twenty one Squadrons, and in the Reare fifteene;
the whole number amounts unto two thousand five hundred and twenty Shot, so their
remaines still three hundred and twenty Shot, of which are plac'd on each Sleeve or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18615:255"/>
Wing, above in the Front by the Pikes one hundred and twenty; these are to joyne
with those Squadrons of Pikes that attend the Ordnance, and upon all occasions
they may be drawne out to assist the Horse, if the enemy should over-powre them;
also in the Reare each Platforme of Ordnance hath forty Shot to aide the Pikes for
the securing of the same.</p>
                        <p>The two hundred Horse are plac'd upon each Flanke in three severall Battalia's;
the first Battell consists of three hundred, the second being Curassiers hath foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
the third being Carbines hath as the first had three hundred, so that in all there
is two thousand; the Horse are to charge the enemies Horse, and being put to retreat
by them, those loose Shot and Pikes are to be in a readinesse to give fire upon them,
which being disordered by them the Horse are immediatly to recharge them; if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
be still to strong, then let the foure hundred Curassiers being fortified on each
Flanke with the Harquebuziers and Carbines, charge them all on brest, these Horses
being sufficiently lined with shot; and in the meane time the Squadrons of Shot must
disband themselves and give fire upon the enemy, and if need be, those Squadrons in
the Reare may easily releeve them in the Front through those passages of the Pikes.</p>
                        <p>If all resistance be to no purpose but the Shot must retreat into those spaces, and so
to order themselves in the void space in the midst of the Battalions of the Pikes; then
after their retreat the Battalia's must close themselves, making a firme Front every
way; and the Impalement or Wings of Shot must be drawne round under the Pikes,
which being so drawne will make just foure rankes; they must discharge upon their
knees and so safeguard themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Horse must secure themselves on the Flanks or in the Reare.</p>
                        <p>So soone as the enemy is driven to retreat, then the Pikes are to open their divisions
and let out the Shot to assaile them, in the same manner as before.</p>
                        <p>This forme of Imbattelling hath beene used in former times, and questionlesse it
may be very prevalent in two necessities; as in the night, when a Generall knowes
not in what kinde or manner the enemy will assaile him; or if his Army should be
weake in Horse, and his Army should be suddenly set upon by them upon some spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ground, which should be advantagious for the enemies Horse to surprise them,
then this forme of Imbattelling may be very defensive.</p>
                        <p>From this forme of Imbattelling, as also from all other, if the Generall sees rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he may alter it into what order he pleaseth; this very subject deserves a discourse
by it selfe, the which if I should here treat of, it would be too tedious; but any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Souldier at the first view, will conceive how to transmute any Battell decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered
into any other forme the condition of the Battell will best admit; and thus
much for this.</p>

and have also in each of them 500. a piece, with Musketiers advanc'd before them;
these are for seconds, as you may perceive them Martialled just against the Intervalles
or Spaces of their opposite Battallions; these Spaces are 200. foote distance in breadth,
so that the said foure Battalions may passe through them; these likewise have Shot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <p>These with the rest may March forth to skirmish with the enemy, or stand firme

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His figure following represents to your view an excellent forme of
imbattelling, very strong and secure: the principall Strength of the
Armie are brought to fight at the first encounter.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore first observe the main-Battell to consist of five Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia's;
in each of them are one thousand six hundred Pikes and
Muskets: the Muskets are orderly ranged before the Pikes; each
Battalia hath one hundred and sixty Files, and ten deep, which amounts unto, in all
the five Battalia's, eight thousand men.</p>
                        <p>After the main-Battell is a second Battell plac'd, which is termed the Battell of
succour; and that consists of four lesser Battalia's, and hath in each of them seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18615:257"/>
Pikes and Shot. Betwixt the said Battalia's there is a convenient space or distance
of ninety six paces, for the main Battalia's to retrait into, when they shall be overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The manner of retraiting is thus; all the first five Battalia's are evenly and easily
to retrait, with their face towards the enemy, holding them play with their Shot; upon
the right and left Flank of the second Battell, are the two outter most Battalia's of the
first Battell to retrait on; also the other three Battalia's are to enter into the spaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the four Battalia's of the second Battell, and there to stand even with them in
Front, whereby there will be nine Battels to re-charge the enemy afresh; for these two
thousand eight hundred fresh men will bee a great heartning and strengthning of the
rest which were wearied and discomfited in the first encounter.</p>
                        <p>But if it should so happen that the enemy should over-wing your Battell at the first
encounter, then this second Battell of succour must advance up between the distances
in the main Battell, whereby the Front of it will be extended so much the wider. But
by the way, you must not make your Front wider than the impalement of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douts
and the Trenches of fire will permit; for those that shall retrait beyond those
Redouts and Trenches, are but as lost men, unlesse if occasion were, they should joyn
with the Horse-Troops, to assist them.</p>
                        <p>Note, if the main Battell bee advanc'd towards the enemy beyond the limits of the
Redouts, and if the Wings should stretch out wider than the impalement, then if it be
driven to retrait, those out-parts of the Wings must first fall back, and order themselves
in the second Battell, as they were before; or otherwise some of them may be plac'd to
secure the Flanks or the Rear, or otherwise, as the Generall shall think fit.</p>
                        <p>In the next place is the Battell in the Rear to be considered, which consists only of
three Battalia's, and in each of them are foure hundred men; they have also sufficient
large spaces to receive the two former Battels, and this is the last hopes the Army can
expect. Wherefore the Redouts must manfully bestir them, to give continuall vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of shot upon the enemies Flanks, which will lie naked unto them.</p>
                        <p>The Ordnance, after they have done their service, must be with-drawn, and plac'd
before the Battalia's of succour, where they may give fire once again upon the enemy
after the main Battell shall be retraited into the second Battell; and then they are to be
with-drawn again into the Rear, or else to bee plac'd upon the Flanks between the
Redouts. In each of the Redouts are two hundred men; they are to secure the Flanks
and the Rear of the Battell: beyond these Redouts you may perceive two Ditches
made, the earth thrown up in way of a Brest-work towards the Flanks of our own
Troops; the breadth of them may be five or six foot: these are to bee filled with Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
Straw, and other combustible stuffe: the outmost next the enemy is first to bee
set on fire. The next Ditch is to bee made more neer to the Flanks of the Battell by
eight or ten paces; in all things like the first it is to be ordered: this last is to bee fired
a good while after the first, so that they may indure burning the time of the fight. But
a principall respect is to be had to the Wind, lest it should drive the smoke and fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your own Troops: in a calme day it can doe no hurt to your selves, but is very
prevalent against the enemies Horse, and will much strengthen the Redouts: besides,
it will bee as a Pound to keep your own men from running away.</p>
                        <p>The Horse are ordered in five Battalia's, upon either Wing along beyond the fiery
Trenches, being in each Battell five hundred Horse. The first Battell being Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers,
are to charge the enemies Horse, and the second are to releeve them or rescue
them, and so are the rest; only the last Battell, being Curassiers, are to charge the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Flanks whilst their Horse are in action; or if the enemies Horse flie, then they
are all of them to charge the Foot of the enemy, and also to secure their own Foot-Troops
from being charged.</p>
                        <p>In the Rear of these Horse-Troops are plac'd on either Wing five hundred Pikes
and Muskets; these are to aid the Horse, and to line them with the Shot, if need be, or
to be imployed in charging the enemies Flanks. View the following Figure.</p>

                        <p>This kind of impaling with Redouts and firie Trenches is to be only practised when
the enemy is farre stronger than your selfe; so that your men cannot bee spared to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale
your Battell, neither is there any place of refuge to secure any part of the Battell;
for if there be, then be sure to impale one of your Wings after this manner, so that the
Wind may convey the smoke &amp; sparks into the enemies teeth, to their great annoyance.</p>

                        <p>Before the main Battell there are seven field-Peeces placed, which are to scowre the

then they are to give fire again, and immediately to be drawn in the Rear of all, and
there to be placed upon some hill, so that the Battell stooping, they may shoot over

then the Shot may joyn together again.</p>
                        <p>The Forlorn Hope is continually to bee supplied with fresh Troops of Shot from
the Flanks or Wings, and those Troops of the Forlorn Hope that have given fire, are
to retrait betwixt the Wings of the Battell, and the Troops of Horse that are plac'd
along by the Wings. So maintaining alwaies the Flanks furnished, by this means
they may maintain skirmish continually with fresh men, and the Battell never the

                        <p>But after the enemies Battell begins to approach neer your own forces, then the
Forlorn Hope must withdraw themselves, and the formost Battell must bear the brunt.</p>

to be drawn back into the space betwixt the two Battalia's or may be drawn into the

                        <p>But if the first main Battell should miscarry in the first encounter, so that their

of the second Battell to retrait into, and there to make head, and freshly to re-charge
the enemy again: betwixt each Battalia in the Rear there must retrait two Battalia's

invented to deceive the enemy: for whereas it seemeth of narrow
Front at the first view, yet the formost Battell being retraited within
the second Battell, and the Impalements upon each Flank, with the
Forlorn Hopes being doubled one Rank into another, makes the
Front of a farre larger extent: so that the enemy having framed his
Battell answerable, as he may suppose to encounter with this forme, hee shall find it
otherwise: for this Battell will over-Wing his, and the Forlorn Hope being strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Shot, and fortified with a competencie of Pikes, will soon hemm in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Battalia's on the Flanks, before they bee aware of it; which by the help of those
Troops of Curassiers, and seconded by the Carbines, will endanger to rout them.</p>
                        <p>The order observed in Marshalling this Battell, is in this manner; first, there is
on each Wing, before the Front of the main Battell, two Battalia's of Horse; each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of 252, which makes forty two Files, being ranged six deep; so that in the four
Battels are contained 1008 Horse.</p>
                        <p>The next is the main Battell of Foot, consisting of five Divisions; which hath
in each five hundred and ten Pikes and Shot; in all the five Battalia's are contained
2550 men.</p>
                        <p>The distance betwixt each Battalia or Division is 5 paces in breadth, and they have
51 in Rank or Brest, and 10 deep in File; the breadth of the whole Front from side to
side of either impalement (the distances being added betwixt each Division) is 1560
paces broad.</p>
                        <p>Next are three Battalia's plac'd 25 paces behind the first main Battell; these have
contained in each of them 510, as the former had: so that the three Battalia's have
1530 souldiers in them.</p>
                        <p>You may delude the enemy in making him beleeve your Forces are more than they
are, by causing your second Battalia's to open their Files to their open order; and then
they will seem as many men in the second Battell as is in the first.</p>
                        <p>The Rear-Battel is likewise ordered 25 paces behind the second Battell, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
only of 2 Battalia's, and are plac'd upon the Flank, as by the Figure you may see,
having a broad space to receive the two former Battels, if they should be constrained to
retrait: these two last consist of 1020, <hi>viz,</hi> 510 souldiers in each; these two Rear-Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
may open their Files to their double distance, to make them seem farre more than
they are: but when they are ready to charge the enemy, they must fall into their order
of three foot.</p>
                        <p>The Impalements of each Flank of the Battell marked with the figures of 1 and 2,
consist of 5 in Brest, &amp; 153 in depth, so that each Wing of Impalement hath 665 Pikes.</p>
                        <p>Likewise by the outside of the Pikes are the same quantity of Muskets ordered 5 in
Brest, and 153 in depth, which amounts likewise to 665 Shot; it is marked with the
figure 2. This Division of Shot is to be plac'd 5 paces from the Pikes: they must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
open their Files very wide, that they may seem to equall the Front of the Battell;

                        <p>Next this impalement the Forlorn Hope is plac'd, along by the side of it, marked with
the figures 3 and 4; and these are to consist of Shot and Pikes as the figures 1 &amp; 2 did:
and first, the Shot hath 8 in Rank, and 153 in depth, so that each Wing takes up 1224
Shot; the Pikes you are to suppose, are ranked next the Shot the outside 5 paces
from the Shot; they are 5 in Front or Brest, and 153 in depth, which amounts to in
each, 665: these are to dilate their Files as the former.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the Forlorn Hope are plac'd 700 Curassiers, ten paces from the former, as

                        <p>The Shot belonging to the main Battell are placed before the Pikes to shelter
them, and to hide the Ordnance amongst them. When the enemy are within
distance, then those Files of Shot which stand before the Ordnance are to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon either hand, so that the Ordnance may suddenly give a volley upon the
enemies Troops; and when they have done their best, they are to be drawn into the
Rear of the Battell. View the Figure following.</p>

                        <head type="sub">A forme of imbattelling containing 15000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, with twenty field-Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Pikes girdled with two Ranks of Musketires round about; the residue of
the Shot are ordered in 188 Maniples.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this forme of imbattelling you may perceive the Pikes to be drawn
into twentie four Divisions, each Division or Battalia containing
three hundred souldiers, with convenient distances betwixt them.
They are first impaled, or girdled round under the Pikes with one
hundred and eighty Shot, which makes two Ranks: these are to
give fire upon their knees, if the enemies Horse should offer to charge
the Battell of Pikes: at a convenient distance beyond this girdling, all the residue of the
Shot are ranged in small Maniples, of thirty in each. Before the Front of Pikes you
see twenty two Maniples of Shot, which are to disband themselves, and give fire upon
the enemy, and are to be supplyed from those Maniples plac'd in the Wings.</p>
                        <p>These Maniples of Shot are thus ordered, for two reasons: For in the first place,
the enemy cannot possibly assault the body of Pikes, but these Maniples of Shot are
ready to give fire upon them: and the Pikes are so sheltered and shadowed from
the enemy, that they cannot receive any dammage: for indeed, so long as the Pikes
stand firme, although the Shot should be routed, yet it cannot be said the Field is won;
for the whole strength of an Army consists in the Pikes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, these Maniples may very easily bee drawn on a sudden into greater
Divisions, and as occasion shall bee offered, may bee joyned with the Pikes; and
the Pikes suddenly drawn into any forme the Generall shall conceive best of;
they being ordered in apt Divisions, with convenient distances betwixt each Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
for that purpose. And if so bee this Battell bee pitcht in such an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
ground that the enemies Horse may not have too much freedome to wrong
the Shot, this forme, questionlesse, is very prevalent. Wherefore these Shot
ought to have each man his Swines-Pike at his girdle, to stick down against the
Horse: upon each corner of the Impalement is plac'd a Maniple of fiftie Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires.
The Horse upon the out-Wings of the Shot are ranged in three grand Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's,
one a good distance before the other: in the formost is three hundred Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers;
in the second, five hundred Carbines; and in the last, two hundred Curas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers:
these upon occasion may march up together, and make one intire Front.</p>
                        <p>The Ordnance are guarded upon each Wing with three hundred and fiftie Shot,
and one hundred and fiftie Pikes: These Ordnance are plac'd upon places of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to scowre the enemy in what manner soever he shall make his approaches.</p>
                        <p>It would bee too tedious to discourse of the sundry forms this or any other forme
of Battell may be translated into: but the ingenious souldier, like that famous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> must by his ingenuity frame in his imagination all kind of forms which
may sute with the place they are to be fought in, and may bee most prevalent against
the enemy hee hath to deale withall. But this you must take for a Maxime, as Sr.
<hi>Francis Bacon</hi> well observed (in his advancement of Learning) that no massie bodie
can possibly be moved without a kind of trepidation; and it holds good in this: for it
is very dangerous to move or alter a forme of Battell, not only to avoid fear, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
Yet I confesse divers Generals have done it, as <hi>Caesar</hi> cast his forme of imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
into a halfe-Moon: but extremity drove him unto it. The Figure hereof
followeth upon the next Page.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>For otherwise, if a Generall orders his men in one kinde of forme to delude his
enemy, and to cause him to order his Battell thereafter, yet he must be sure to Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphise
it into that forme he intends, before the enemy drawes to neere, least confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
follow.</p>
                        <p>To avoide tediousnesse, these formes before demonstrated shall suffice. In the next

yet I shall shew the good use of them, by paralelling them
with the light-armed used in former ages, what strange conquests
have beene gained by them, as Historians have observed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must first compare the body of an Army to the body of a
Man that is compact of severall parts, of which some parts are of more use than other;
some parts being able to performe their function without the help of the other parts,
and againe some, except the other parts helpe, can doe nothing to purpose of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>The armed are the strength of the Battell, and are the refuge for the rest in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
wherefore our Generalls in this latter age joyne the Shot on each Wing of the
Pikes for their safety, <note place="margin">Aelian pag 65 cap. 17. Xenoph. Cyro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tacticks learnedly discusses; and <hi>Xenophon</hi> sayes, let there be never so many light-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
yet dare they not stand and abide the assault of a few armed; in which respect
a place fit hath beene sought for their service, to secure them from the accesse of the
Horse, or of the enemy armed; wherefore Generalls in former ages plac'd them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
behind their Phalange of Pikes, or else in the Wings betwixt the Horse and the
armed Pikes, as these figures by me described shewes; or if they skirmished loose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Front, and chanced to be oppressed with the enemy, then they were to retreat
into the Intervalls and so convayed themselves behind the Phalange in safety: and
as <hi>Leo</hi> reports, <note place="margin">Leo c. 14. sect. 105.</note> the securing of the light-armed in some place of strength either naturall
or artificiall, will be most prevalent and advantagious; as namely some strong inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers
being well, Hedged and Ditched, Rocks or steepie Hills, or the banks of Rivers
or the like.</p>
                        <p>How did the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> being to fight with the whole power of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi>
fortifie his light-armed, and safeguarded them with Hedges and Ditches, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Strengths; so that the <hi>French</hi> Horse finding no accesse to disorder them, were
overwhelmed with their stormes of Shot, which those Maniples so plac'd, showred
upon them?</p>
                        <p>At the Battel of <hi>Agencourt</hi> there were two thousand <hi>English</hi> Shot placed in a Medow
fenced with a deep Ditch, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth at the Battell of <hi>Agencourt.</hi>
                           </note> from whence they so galled the <hi>French,</hi> which occasioned
the Victory. The residue of the Shot had Stakes armed with yron pikes, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them from the fury of the Chivalrie, by which means they gained that famous
Victory. By this you may see, that light-armed souldiers, although they be divided
from the body of Pikes, may be very efficacious to gain a Victory.</p>
                        <p>Further, there is no inticing or training an enemy from his place of advantage, but
by small Troops of Shot, which are to make a bravado, to toule them into some place
of advantage: as <hi>Alexander</hi> did practise against the <hi>Tryballs,</hi> who had hid themselves
in Woods; He sent his light-armed from the body of his Pikes, and trained out the
Barbarians; they being shrewdly wounded with their Shot in the Woods, threw
themselves out to fall upon the Archers: <hi>Alexander</hi> immediatly commands <hi>Philotus</hi>
with the Horse of upper <hi>Macedonia</hi> to charge the enemies right Wing, upon which
part they cast themselves out farthest; and <hi>Heraclides</hi> and <hi>Sopolis</hi> with the Horse of
<hi>Baeotia,</hi> and <hi>Amphipolis</hi> the left; hee having roughly charged them, put the <hi>Tryballs</hi> to
flight, and vanquish'd them.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, <note place="margin">Leo cap. 14. sect. 104.</note> it is <hi>Leo</hi> his own advice; if the Army hath light-armed men enough,
(namely Shot) let them (saith he) before the Army joyns, send their Shot furiously
at the enemy; <note place="margin">How the Shot ought to bee used in the time of giving Battel.</note> but after the fight of the armed is begunne, then pay their Flanks
with your missive weapons; that at once both their Flanks may bee assaulted.
And indeed, in all ages, the Shot were the first that did begin the Battell, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18615:263"/>
for the most part, the chiefest meanes to gaine victory at last.</p>
                        <p>Further, the nature of Shot is to wound afar off. Wherefore a Generall, if hee
desires not to come neer to joyn Battell, hee may annoy his enemy afar off, without
endangering his own forces; <note place="margin">Liv. decad. 4. lib. 8. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </note> as <hi>Livie</hi> makes mention of <hi>Cn. Manlius Volso,</hi> he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
against the <hi>Gallo-Grecians</hi> that fled into the mountains, attending the <hi>Romans</hi>
comming, and there defending themselves by the advantage of the place; he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
great plenty of Darters, Archers, and Slingers, and leaving his Legionary soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
behind, led his light-armed against the enemy, that possessed certain Straights
by which his Army must of necessitie passe; after a small skirmish, the <hi>Gallo-Grecians</hi>
being not sufficiently armed to defend the fury of their Shot, the light-armed of the
<hi>Romans</hi> forc'd the Passage, and followed them to their Camp; the Legionary souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
being marcht unto them for their aid, they wonne the Camp also.</p>
                        <p>Of how much more efficacie are our Muskets at this day to performe greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements,
if they be skilfully marshalled? wherefore upon many occasions, our
Shot may be dis-joyned from the armed Pikes, and placed according to the wisedome
of the Generall. For, as formerly I have said, so long as the body of Pikes stands in
array, and remains stedfast in good order, no victory can bee gotten against it: but
if the Pikes should bee dis-banded or dis-joynted from their proper place, there is
nought else but an overthrow to bee expected.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it cannot chuse but bee very good to place Shot before the Battalia's
of Pikes, to shelter them; as you may see the like in some of those Battels which I
have described: where the pricks stand for Musketires, and certain field-Peeces
placed amongst them to annoy the enemy. But this is best to be done when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is a good distance from you; otherwise it may bee hurtfull: for when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is ready to come to handy blowes, then the Battalia's of Pikes must stand and
endure the showring Shot of the light-armed, and the Shot must shelter themselves
amongst the Pikes.</p>
                        <p>You may further observe the strange Conquests which have been atchieved by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Maniples of Shot which have been imployed against the body of the Pikes, as
appeares by the example of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in <hi>Crassus</hi> his Battell; who after the defait
of part of his Army, <note place="margin">Xenoph. Cyro <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>. 7. 178.</note> yet he would not yeeld to King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> although in all likelyhood
he had got the victory: wherefore <hi>Cyrus</hi> was first constrained to charge the Rear of
their Battalia's of Pikes with his Horse, and being not able to break them, he had no
way to perfect his Conquest, but by drawing his light-armed or Shot, to direct their
Volleys at them; the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> being wounded, and many souldiers lost, they were
constrained to yeeld themselves to the mercie of the enemy. By this you see that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples
of Shot are very prevalent.</p>
                        <p>But it may bee objected, that light-armed (as the Shot) of themselves are not able
to repulse the Horse, but are subject to their furie, unlesse they bee strengthned with
Pikes, or have some convenient place of retrait, for their refuge and safetie; as by the
example of <hi>Crassus</hi> in <hi>Parthia,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Plutarch in Crasso.</note> how the light-armed were beaten in by the <hi>Parthian</hi>
Horse, and through their discomfiture the Battalias of Pikes were likewise disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And likewise <hi>Antonies</hi> retrait out of <hi>Persia;</hi> his light-armed were constrained
to shrowd themselves from the <hi>Persian</hi> Horse within the Phalange of the armed.</p>
                        <p>This Objection is true and undenyable; for the Shot of themselves are too weak
for to resist the Horse, unlesse the wisdome of the Generall place them in such places
of advantage in which they might secure themselves; or as in former times they did
use to line their Horse-Troops with Shot, and then they wrought wonders: for it is
impossible the enemies Horse being so charged, <note place="margin">Hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reporteth of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that hee having but a small number of Horse, and his Foot-Troops
as few, was set upon by his enemy, who had lined his Horse-Troops with light-armed
<hi>Numidians:</hi> when the souldiers of <hi>Caesar</hi> advanc'd forwards to charge them, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horse gallop'd away, and the Foot that lined them stood fast, and gave their Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes
at them, untill their Horse, with a full Career, returned to their rescue: this kind
of fight did much perplex <hi>Caesar,</hi> and would have confounded him, had he not retrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the next hils from the fury of the enemies Horse.</p>
                        <p>Certainly there is no absolute way to secure the body of Pikes, but by impaling
them with a quantitie of Shot: for whereas in former ages they used Lances, and then
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18615:264"/>
the Pikes could make their parties good with them. But in these our dayes, Pistols,
Carbines, and Harquebuzes being in use, the Horse-Troops may advance up to the
Pikes, and discharge upon them, and so fall off again in safety, were it not for the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Musketires about them.</p>
                        <p>It may bee further objected, that the light-armed are not able to grapple with the
armed Pikes, but that they will soon come within their Shot, and so confound them
having spent their breath and powder.</p>
                        <p>To this I answer, There is no fear of any dammage the Pikes can doe to the Shot of
themselves, without the aid of Horse; because the light-armed are nimble and quick,
and seeking alwaies advantage by changing of ground, whereby they cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bee forced by the armed Foot, they being wearied and laden with their heavie
Corslets and Pikes: neither can they make any great speed to come up to handie-blowes
with the Shot, but they must run themselves into ruine by disorder. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Shot need fear nothing but the Horse to trouble them. And by the way, it is
to be supposed, the Horse are to bee imployed against their adversaries Troops, and
shall not be at all turns at freedome to attend the excursions and dis-bandings of the
Shot, but that the Shot will find time and fitting opportunity to work their effects,
either against the Foot or Horse of their enemies, unlesse their own Troops serve them
as <hi>Pompies</hi> did at the Battell of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lucans Pharsalia.</note> who fled before they received a charge from
<hi>Caesars</hi> Troops.</p>
                        <p>I may well compare a pitcht Battell to a game at Irish; each Gamester must have
a speciall eye, not only of his own, but of the adverse Tables, how he disposeth his men,
what hits may be given, and how to bring home your own men in safety; and if a
fore game cannot possibly be attained, then the wise Gamesters seek by policie to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
their men so that they may bee hit, which in the winding up many times turns
the wheel of Fortune, so that hee that had lost, in all likelyhood, hath now gained an
after-game beyond releefe: for as in this game there are two principall things which
attend the winner, <hi>viz.</hi> Cunning in handling his Dice, and Judgment in placing his
men: so it is in a well fought Battell to atchieve the victory. For I must compare
Shot to the Dice, which by their cunning and quick discharge, and the multiplicitie
of volleys that one side gives more than the other, is for the most part a principall
cause of victory. Wherefore, where most Shot are, or may bee brought to fight, there
is the most likelyhood of successe.</p>
                        <p>What wonderfull effects hath Shot wrought by discovering of suspected places,
and by laying of Ambushcadoes? there being two kinds of Ambushments; as first,
those that are cunningly laid to endammage the enemies Battell in time of fight,
which are to be compounded both of Pikes and Shot, and many times Horse are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with them. These have fallen upon the Flanks or Rear of the enemies Troops,
and have much dismaid them: Or such Ambushes as are laid in Woods, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Forrests, Rocks, Banks of Rivers, Caves, hollow Pits, Hils, deep Waies, and
the like; these are usually either Muskets or Fire-locks, and are fittest for that service;
because their quicknesse and expedition giveth them advantage to assail their enemies,
although the ground be never so unequall.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, for the stopping guarding, or securing any Passage which the enemy may
take for his advantage, if it bee of any far distance from the Army, there are none so
fit as the light-armed (unlesse you have some Troops of Dragones) for they may soon
travell a long way riding behind the Horsemen, which most usually are sent with
them for their succour: these may with far more speed and ease be conveyed than the
Pikes, in regard their Armes are more cumbersome, and cannot but make great noise
by their clattering, whereby the designe may be discovered.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore let us conclude, that Shot are the principall members (as the armes
are to the body) of an Army, if they bee wisely and advantagiously plac'd and

fear the rest; for he that first flieth is surest to perish; for then every cowardly Curre
will run after, and worrye a whole flock of Sheep, which so long as they face him, and
keep their standings, dares do nought but bark at them. And as formerly I have said,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18615:264"/>
that at the famous Battell of <hi>Dreux</hi> a Battalia of valiant <hi>Switzers,</hi> which stood to
their tackling, after all the rest of their Army was routed, taking their opportunitie,
charged their enemy, and gained the victory. And thus much concerning this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
of the use and commodity of Maniples of Shot: the next Chapter shall more
largely treat of all kinds of Battels, with such observations as the famous Generals
in former ages observed as most advantagious.</p>

                        <head type="sub">Divers and severall Observations of the ancient Grecians in framing of Battels, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
uses and circumstances belonging to them: as also the order and rules, by going
paces to know any seat or peece of ground, how to imbattell either Horse or Foot thereon
according to the proportion thereof.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Having formerly treated of divers things considerable, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after Battell, and having described both by Word and
Figure, severall Formes: In this Chapter I intend to discourse
more fully of the Nature of framing of Battels, with severall uses
and circumstances belonging unto them. And by the way, I shall
touch such kind of Battels as the Ancients did frame for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to oppose one the other. And although (in this later age) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath found out stranger weapons than former ages were acquainted with, as
the Musket and great Ordnance, and wee have rejected the ancient Bowes and Bils,
whose forme to imbattell them, was far different from ours; yet wee must retain their
policie in distinguishing which form of Battell is most prevalent to oppose any kind
of Figure that shall be by the enemy marshalled against us.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, first, take speciall observation, that there is no kind of imbattelling,
but upon some speciall occasion, may bee suddenly reduc'd and framed, into another
forme; and so haply from one forme into divers. Now the learned Generall is not to
seek his principall skill when hee should make use of it: and (as before I have said) if
I should discourse of these severall wayes of reducing one forme into another, it
would deserve a Treatise by it selfe. Wherefore let us be content to be as briefe as the
subject shall permit, in discoursing of the advantages one kind of forme of Imbattelling
may have of another.</p>
                        <p>Now both reason and experience tels us, that if a Battell be so framed that it may
over-Front the enemies, <note place="margin">Pag. 149. cap. 50.</note> there is great advantage in it, as <hi>Aelian</hi> in his Tacticks doth
plainly shew: <note place="margin">The over-Fronting Battell is termed by the <hi>Grecians, Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalanges.</hi>
                           </note> and this may bee performed two wayes especially: as first, if the
breadth of the formost or main Battell extends its Wings wider than the enemies; then
it is easie either for the body of the main Battell to retrait orderly, and the two Wings
to stand firme, whereby the enemy may bee intrapt unawares: or otherwise, the
Wings advancing forward; and this likewise may be two wayes performed: either
by having the outmost Maniples of the Wings double, the depth in File to the Body,
which being advanc'd forwards towards the Flanks of the enemy, there will bee ten
Ranks before the Body, which may charge the enemy upon the Flanks: or else being
of an even depth with the Body, the File-leader of the outmost File of each Wing is to
advance a distance before the File-leader of the second File, and so the second before
third, and the like of the rest of the Files inwards, towards the Body of the Battell,
which causeth them to stand in apt form to charge the enemies Flanks. So that reason
shewes, the charging an enemy in Front and Flank is ods, two to one.</p>
                        <p>A second ods the <hi>Grecians</hi> found out, <note place="margin">The over-Winging Battell is termed of the <hi>Grecians, Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerasis.</hi>
                           </note> by framing their Battel called <hi>Hyperkerasis,</hi> and
this only differs from the former, in that they advance forwards only but one Wing,
which chargeth the enemy upon the Flank; and this is thus performed in a double
respect, either because there is a want of men to extend the Front of the Battell in such
breadth, as that they may over-Front them on both the Wings; or haply the situation
will not permit them. But this, questionlesse, is a great advantage, and ought not to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18615:265"/>
be neglected, if it possibly may be put in execution. These two are the only forms for
advantage against a Battel meerly of one Front.</p>
                        <p>A third ods the <hi>Grecians</hi> found out; <note place="margin">The Battell called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                                 <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </note> wherefore they invented a Battell according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and termed it the <hi>Cyrte,</hi> it being a convex Battell: the intent of it was to delude
the enemy: for it made a semblance of small Forces, by reason of the convexitie of the
Figure, it being a Maxime in Philosophie, that all round things seem far lesse than
they are in compasse; but being extended in length, they prove as much more as they
seemed to be; because the rotunditie of the fore-part obscureth the exteriour from the
eye. And indeed it is the perfection of skill in a Generall, to have so much art in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelling,
that he shall make shew but of few Forces, but bring as many more hands
to fight.</p>
                        <p>A fourth ods the <hi>Grecians</hi> found out, <note place="margin">The Battell termed <hi>Epicampios.</hi>
                           </note> which was a form of imbattelling they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Epicampios;</hi> and this was to oppose the former deluding forme, it being a figure
most apt to oppose the same: for as the former was a convex Battell, this was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave;
and no lesse deception to the eye, in regard the circumduction of the Front is
like an embowing; for this Figure opening it selfe, will easily receive the orball form
of the other into its concavitie; or otherwise dilating it selfe on either Wing, the Front
of it will equallize the former Battell in all respects. And this latter they made use
of to entrap the Battell called the Horsemans <hi>Rhombe;</hi> for soon they would wrap them
into their voyd space of their Front, as they charged them, and so galling them upon
all sides, soon vanquish them.</p>
                        <p>A fifth advantage they found out, <note place="margin">The Battell called <hi>Amphistomus.</hi>
                           </note> to oppose their enemy that charged them in
the Front and Rear at once. Wherefore they framed their Battel sixteen deep in File: so
that the halfe Files to the Rear did but face about, and they were ready to entertain
the enemy both waies at their first approach; and this they termed the <hi>Phalange
Amphistomus,</hi> having respect to the two Fronts: this kind of forme was principally
to entertain the charge of Horse.</p>
                        <p>A sixth forme of imbattelling they invented, which they termed <hi>Antistomus,</hi> and
this did not much differ from the former; <note place="margin">The Battell called <hi>Antistomus.</hi>
                           </note> only this receives the charge upon either
Flank, and the former upon the Front and Rear.</p>
                        <p>A seventh form of imbattelling they invented, <note place="margin">The Battell termed <hi>Diphalange Antisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
                           </note> very advantagious to be opposed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Horse-Battell, called the Wedge, and this they termed <hi>Diphalange Antisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
The manner of the Battell called the Horsemans Wedge, was to charge the
Foot in the Front with such furie, that they would pierce and enter the most strong
resistance: for the prevention thereof, they plac'd the ablest men in their middlemost
Files; so that when the Horse charged them, each Flank divided it selfe by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost
File, faceing each towards other, and so made a lane for those Horses to passe
betwixt them without any dammage to themselves; yet they galled the Horse on both
sides in their violent passage; the Foot standing on either side like two walls faceing
inwards, gave them a fruitlesse passage: for otherwise a square Battell of Pikes were
not able to resist the furie of this wedge-Battell.</p>
                        <p>The eighth forme of imbattelling which they invented, <note place="margin">The Battell termed <hi>Diaphalange Peristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
                           </note> was of great advantage to
be opposed against the square Battell; and this they termed <hi>Diaphalange peristomus:</hi>
the manner of it was thus. The two Wings opened themselves like a paire of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,
or otherwise dividing themselves into such a sufficient distance, as they might
intrap and inclose the square Battell betwixt them. The square forme of Battell fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be inclosed betwixt them, transforme themselves into two marching Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and being thus divided, they direct one against the right, the other against the
left Wing of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, if they did expect a charge upon both their Flanks, then they wisely
provided for it; for they divided their Troops into two Phalanges, one sequenting
the other; the first had all the Leaders in a right-hand deduction, and the following
Phalange in a left-hand deduction: one having their Commanders in the right
Flank, and the other in the left Flank: this forme of imbattelling they termed <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terostomos:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Battell called <hi>Heterostomos,</hi> used upon a March.</note> that is when the Phalange proceedeth in a Wing, not by File but by Rank.
These kind of Phalanges may march in a double, treble, or quadruple side, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the place and part suspected, where the enemy should fall on. These deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Paragogies, if they begin the fight in Flank, doe make their Front or length
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18615:265"/>
double to their depth: this last they invented to teach their souldiers to receive heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
the charge on all parts; and it was used most upon a March: for accordingly
they demeaned themselves as they understood the enemies manner of approaching:
for if the enemy marched his Army in a right deduction, <hi>viz.</hi> when the March
extendeth it selfe out into a Wing, having the depth much exceeding the length;
Then they invented another forme of Battell which was advantagious to bee oppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
against the former; <note place="margin">The Battell called <hi>Coelembolos,</hi> or hollow Wedge.</note> and they termed it <hi>Coelembolos</hi> or hollow wedge-Battell;
and their framing of it was after this manner: <hi>viz.</hi> when the <hi>Antistomos Dipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange</hi>
or double <hi>Phalange</hi> dis-joyneth and divideth the Wings in the Front; the Rear
being still closed in manner of the letter V, the advantage is this; when the enemy
approacheth with his right induction and chargeth at the midst of the aforesaid Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
it suddenly opens its Front in the midst as before is demonstrated, and frustrates
the charge of the enemies Front, clasping them in, and circumventing the flanks of the
enemies right induction.</p>
                        <p>Then to prevent this great advantage; <note place="margin">The Battell termed <hi>Triphalange.</hi>
                           </note> they devised another form of Imbattelling
which should over-march this; and they termed it a <hi>Triphalange,</hi> or treble <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange.</hi>
The manner of framing it was thus; they divided their forces into three
<hi>Phalanges;</hi> two of them marching up in an even Front: But having both in
their Front and Rear as large a division betwixt them as the Front of the Battell
<hi>Coelembolos</hi> or hollow wedge-Battell; these two <hi>Phalanges</hi> charge the two Wings
of the <hi>Coelembolos,</hi> and the third <hi>Phalange</hi> standeth with its Front even at the
Rear of the two former <hi>Phalanges,</hi> ready to advance up in the space betwixt
them; this last waiteth onely for a time of advantage to give an onset, and they
termed it the forbearing <hi>Phalange;</hi> this questionlesse, hath much advantage of the
former.</p>
                        <p>Lastly they invented a forme of imbattelling called <hi>Phalagiophalange,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The Battell called of the <hi>Greeks Phalagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalange.</hi>
                           </note> which
they made use of to oppose the Horse-Battell termed <hi>Hetromekes,</hi> or the <hi>Herse,</hi> of
Horse; this <hi>Herse</hi>-Battell had the depth double to the length or breadth, and was
profitable in many respects: for seeming to carry so few in so small a breadth, it
deceiveth the enemy; and it did easily break the force of the Foot, with the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and strength of the imbattelling; and it might be led through straight passages
without perceiving.</p>
                        <p>The Foot-Battell before named which was to encounter with this Horse-Battell,
did extend its Front very wide, and was very slender in depth; So that when the
Horse did charge them, they could doe no great dammage if they brake through the
midst of them: for there could nothing bee lost but a little of the depth; the furie
of the Horse could not be resisted by the multitude of Foot; but running through the
midst of them, they spoyled some few men, and immediately were carried through
them into the open field: and for this cause was the length much exceeding the
depth. And now of latter dayes our modern Commanders have thought square
forms of Battalia's to bee fittest, and most proper and easie to bee reduced into any
other forme.</p>
                        <p>These examples of the Grecian Generals shall suffice to give a tast and light to
the ingenious souldier how hee may best contrive any forme of imbattelling into
what other forme hee pleaseth that may seeme advantagious to entrap an enemie:
and indeed, this ought to bee the studie of all Generals and Commanders, to have
at their fingers ends a forme of imbattelling that shall not only oppose, but bee pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
for advantage against any forme of Battell the enemy shall be able to marshall.
In the next Chapter I shall speak of such Orders and Rules which are to be used in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of ground, whereby may be known how to imbattell an Army thereupon, bee
they either Horse or Foot.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW for conclusion of this tedious Worke which I have taken
in hand to finish; There now only remains to speak of the
Orders and Rules which are to bee used by a Commander in
pacing of ground, whereby may bee known how to imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
his men thereupon, whether they bee Horse or Foot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of the same, which by Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Rules are to be written.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore it is necessary that the skilfull Commander do
acquaint himselfe with pacing the measure called the Geometricall pace; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
five foot of length, and every foot is divided into twelve ynches: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often practised by ordinary going paces, whereby may bee known how many
steps make this pace after five foot to it: This being observed, it will prove very
easie to know how many men may be imbattelled upon such a quantitie of ground,
or what quantitie of Horse, or both, it being presupposed, they are not ignorant
what due proportions and order is to be allowed to the said Men and Horse. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it being usuall to allow to every Pike-man standing in forme of Battell, three
foot of ground in breadth, and seven foot of ground in depth; that is to say, three
foot before him, three foot for behind him, and one foot of ground for his owne
station.</p>
                        <p>Likewise for every Horse there is to bee allowed five foot for breadth, ten
foot for depth.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore for examples sake, let us further suppose that wee are constrained to
make choice of a peece of ground to imbattell our Army upon, containing in breadth
four hundred and eight going paces, which after the rate of two going paces to one
Geometricall pace (containing five foot) doe make two hundred and four paces
Geometricall.</p>
                        <p>Likewise this peece of ground contains in depth one hundred seventy eight going
paces, which makes eighty nine Geometricall paces, as by this subsequent Figure
plainly appeares.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Now to know how many Battalia's may bee plac'd a brest or breadth in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18615:266"/>
main Battell, and how many in the Battell of succour, and how many in the
Rear-Battell.</p>
                        <p>Next we are to consider the distances or spaces which are to bee left betwixt each
Battalia as they stand in Brest, and also the distances or spaces of ground betwixt the
Rear of the main Battell and the Front of the Battell of succour, and also betwixt
the Rear of the Battell of succour, and the Front of the Rear-Battell.</p>
                        <p>Then next is to be considered what quantity of men is sufficient to impale this peece
of ground for the defence of the Foot from the enemies Horse.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, there is to be considered what quantity of Horse may conveniently be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon the Flanks or Wings of this Battell. Wherefore observe, the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Battalia's is ten foot; the ground each souldier occupies in Brest is three foot,
and in depth seven foot: The distance betwixt the Rear of the main Battell and the
Front of the second Battell is at least twenty paces. The distance betwixt the Flanks
of the Foot-Battell and the Horse is twentie paces at the least.</p>
                        <p>The ground each Horse occupies in Rank or Brest is five foot, and in depth ten foot.</p>
                        <p>Now having past the ground as aforesaid, and as this precedent Figure demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;
you are in the next place to bring those paces into feet: which you may do
by multiplying the said paces by 5, and the product is 1020; then this 1020 feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divided by 3 (which is the just distance each souldier takes for his station in Rank
or Brest) the product is 340 men in Rank, for the Front of the main Battell.</p>
                        <p>The ground being likewise eighty nine paces deep, there may be ranged three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
one behind another, <hi>viz.</hi> the main Battell, and twenty paces behind that the
Battell of succour is to bee plac'd; and twenty paces behind the Battell of succour
the Rear-Battell is to be plac'd: and lastly there is seven paces allowed for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
to be plac'd in.</p>
                        <p>The Battels are ranged but ten men in depth: Wherefore observe that you are
to multiply 10 by 7 (for so many feet is allowed to each souldier to occupie his Arms
in) the product is 70 feet: this 70 being again divided by 5 (for so many feet goe to
a Geometricall pace) the quotient will be 14 paces; and so many paces ten men oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie
in depth or File.</p>
                        <p>Next you must observe the Battell of succour is ranged twenty paces behind the
former, and is likewise ten deep in File, which takes up as much ground as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
did: the Rear-Battell likewise is twenty paces behind the second Battell, and
takes up as much ground as the former did in depth. And lastly, the seven paces of
ground for the placing of the Carriages, being added to the former distances, make
just eighty nine paces, which is the depth of the field.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Impaling of this Battell both in Flanks and Rear, we are first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the quantitie of paces the Flanks are in depth, which we find to be eighty nine;
this being multiplied by 5, the product will bee 445 feet; this being divided by 3,
the quotient will bee 148 and a little odd; this will impale one Rank down the side
of the Flank of this Battell.</p>
                        <p>And if you would have the impalement to consist of seven Ranks, then multiply
the 148 by 7, and the product will be 1036: so many men must be imployed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale
one of the Flanks seven deep: then again multiply 1036 by 2, and there will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
2072 men, the just number to impale both the Flanks with seven Ranks of Pikes
and Shot.</p>
                        <p>The Rear of this Battell is 143 paces in breadth from the inmost Flanks of each
impalement of the Wings: this 143 must be brought into feet by multiplying it by
5, which amounts to 715 feet; this 715 being likewise divided by the quantity of
ground each souldier takes in Brest or Rank, being 3 foot, the quotient is 238 and
one odd; this being multiplyed again by 7 (for so many Ranks they must bee in
depth) the quotient will bee (adding the 7 odd men) 1673: For so many men the
Rear will take up to impale it with seven Ranks.</p>
                        <p>Now in regard it is at the Generals pleasure to order his forme of imbattelling
after what manner he sees best: therefore to shew you a more plain example of this
former discourse, let us suppose our strength of Foot to bee 8000 Pikes and Shot, and
300 Horse, and that the space of ground before specified, is the field wherein I must
order this Battell. And seeing it is the Generals pleasure to divide the main Battell (in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18615:267"/>
regard of the straightnesse of the ground) into three grand Battalia's, distinguish'd
by the name of the right Wing, the Battell, and the left Wing: or Van, Battell, and
Rear-ward.</p>
                        <p>These grand Battalia's are to bee divided into lesser Battalia's or Squadrons; as
namely, the right Wing into two Squadrons, the Battell into four, and the left Wing
into two; for the straightnesse of ground will not admit of more.</p>
                        <p>The distances betwixt these Battalia's or Squadrons must be understood; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
betwixt the two Squadrons of either Wing is two paces distance, for the Shot to
fall off into the Rear.</p>
                        <p>The distance likewise betwixt the two Wings, and the Battell must bee wider than
the former, to distinguish betwixt them, which you may suppose to be three paces. The
distance likewise betwixt the four Squadrons that the Battell is composed of, hath the
same distance of two paces betwixt each, for the Shot to fall off into the Rear, as the
Wings had.</p>
                        <p>Betwixt the outmost File of each Wing, and the Impalement is likewise two paces;
in both, four. Also the ground which the Impalement occupies being seven Ranks, is
nine paces and odd feet; so that the ground which both the Impalements on each side
takes up, comes to nineteen paces, adding thereto the odd feet.</p>
                        <p>Betwixt the Impalement and the Horse upon the right Wing, is ten paces: also the
distance betwixt the left Wing and the Horse, is likewise ten paces.</p>
                        <p>The Space of ground the Horse takes up for their station, they being ranged but ten
in Rank or Brest, is ten paces, allowing five foot for every Horse: upon both Flanks
they take up twenty paces; and the space for their falling off, when they have dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
must be one pace at least, on both the Wings two paces.</p>
                        <p>Now these distances being accounted and summed up together, we may presently
see how many souldiers may bee plac'd in Rank or Brest in the formost main Battell;
the ground being but 204 paces broad. You having taken a survey of the distances
betwixt each Squadron or Battalia, with the ground the Impalement of Shot and
Pikes takes up, and the space between the Impalement and the Horse, with the ground
the Horse takes up for their stations; you shall find it to be 81 paces, (being the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
distances that possibly can be allowed, in regard of the narrownesse of the ground).
Now if you deduct 81 paces from 204, (which is the bredth of the ground) there will
remain 123 paces, for to place their formost main Battell in.</p>
                        <p>These 123 paces being brought into feet by multiplying them by 5; the product
will be 615. This again being divided by 3, (being the space each souldier takes to use
his Armes in) the quotient shewes that 205 men may stand in Rank or Brest in the
formost main Battell. This 205 being also multiplyed by 10 (for so many men each
File must have in depth) the product shews that the main Battell must consist of 2050
souldiers. These 2050 souldiers being divided by 8, (being the number of Battalia's in
the main Battell) the quotient doth shew there is 256 in each Battalia; only two odd
men are to be joyned with 30 Souldiers more, and to bee distributed amongst the 8
Battalia's, <hi>viz.</hi> four men in each Battalia, to make the Files even, so that then there
will be in each Battalia 260 souldiers, as the Figure demonstrates.</p>
                        <p>Now it is to be supposed that there is depth enough in this peece of ground to imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
two such Battels more, one in the Rear of another, and may bee allowed 20 paces
in distance betwixt each Battell; and 7 paces in depth besides, for the Carriages to be
plac'd in, as I shall shew you.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore observe, the formost Battell hath ten men deep in File: this 10 must be
multiplyed by 7 (the space of ground each souldier occupyeth with his weapons before
and behind him) and the product amounts to 70 foot; the two next Battels being of
the same depth in file, takes up 210 foot of ground. To bring this into paces, you must
divide the 210 by 5, (for so many foot goes to a pace) and the quotient will shew you
it to be 42 paces, these three Battels take up in depth: then to this 42 paces you must
add the distance of 40 paces, which the two Battels towards the Rear are allowed
them between the Rear of one Battell and the Front of the other, and 7 paces for the
Carriage to bee plac'd in, and you shall find the 89 paces in depth of ground just
taken up.</p>
                        <p>In the next place you may observe, that the second Battell (which is called the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18615:267"/>
of succour, and is plac'd 20 paces behind the formost or main Battell) is divided
into three grand Battalia's having in each Battalia 340 men, <hi>viz.</hi> in all three 1020:
and are so plac'd with convenient distances for the formost Battalia's to retrait be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; it being supposed that many of them will be slain before they be driven
to make a retrait, whereby those distances will easily contain them.</p>
                        <p>In the Rear Battell there is only 800 which are divided into two grand Battalia's of
400 in each, with a large space for the former Battels to retrait into.</p>
                        <p>The Impalements, as before is shewed, hath in the Rear 1633, and upon each Flank
1036; <hi>viz.</hi> in both Flanks 2072. All these being summ'd up together, you shall find
7605 men plac'd in all the Battalia's with the Impalement.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, there remains 400 wanting five men, which may be imployed to line the
Horse, or to surprize the enemies Ordnance, or for what other purposes the Generall
shall think fit. Thus you see 8000 men marshalled in Battalia upon this peece
of ground.</p>
                        <p>The Horse are 300, divided into six Troops; <hi>viz.</hi> upon each Flank three Troops,
and in each Troop 50 Horse; as before is shewed.</p>
                        <p>If you desire to know how many Horse may bee ranged a Brest in Battalia upon
this peece of ground; by the precedent Rule, you cannot erre. And for explaining
what hath been discoursed of, I hold it not amisse to exemplifie it by Figure, as
followeth.</p>

                           <p>THis precedent Table is divided into seven Columes, each Colume having its
proper use set above it.</p>
                           <p>In the first Colume towards the left hand, you shall find the number of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Geometricall <hi>(viz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>In the second Colume you shall find the just number of men which those paces may
contain in Brest or Rank, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>cording as the first Colume shall point to you, <hi>viz.</hi>
each man taking up three foot for his particular station.</p>
                           <p>In the third Colume you shall find our ordinary way of placing our men 10 deep in
File, fit for skirmish.</p>
                           <p>The fourth Colume points to you the whole number of men being ordered 10 deep
in File.</p>
                           <p>The fifth Colume shews how many Horses may bee plac'd upon so many paces of
ground, as the Colume of paces demonstrates; <hi>viz.</hi> each Horse takes up five foot
for his station in Rank.</p>
                           <p>The sixth Colume shews the manner of placing of them six deep in File.</p>
                           <p>The seventh Colume shews the just number of Horse being ordered six deep in File. As
for example; You have paced out 1002 Geometricall paces, which is 2004 of
your ordinarie going paces (taking but two foot and an halfe to each step.) Now if
you would know how many men these forenamed paces may contain in Rank,
you must first enter the Table, and in the first Colume of the last Table-Page, right
under the superscription of <hi>Paces Geometricall,</hi> you shall find 1002, and just against
it, in the second Colume towards your right hand, you shall find that 1670 men
may be plac'd in Rank or Brest; and in the next Colume, being the third, you shall
find they are plac'd 10 deep in File; then casting but your eye into the fourth Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
you shall find the whole number of them to be 16700 men.</p>
                           <p>Likewise if you would know how many Horses may be plac'd in Brest or Rank upon
the fore-named quantitie of paces, by casting your eye into the fifth Colume you
shall find 1002 Horses; and if they be ordered six deep in File, then look into the
seventh Colume, and you shall find the whole number to bee 6012 Horses: after
the same manner you may find out any other number.</p>
                           <p>If you intend to order your Horse but five deep in File, then to know how many bee
of the whole number, you must multiply the number in the fifth Colume by 5, and
the product is the whole number.</p>
                           <p>After the same manner, if you intend to impale the Flanks or Rear of your Battell,
after you know the number of paces, as for example, Suppose it to be 801 paces; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Colume of paces, and you shall find that 801 paces must have 1335 men to
make one Rank for the Impalement; now if you would have seven Ranks, then
you must multiply 1335 by 7, and the product will be 9345, the just whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that the Impalement will take up, being it consists of seven Ranks.</p>
                           <p>The reason why I have set down the paces Geometricall in the first Colume, after a
progressionall way, one number exceeding another by three, is because it fits even
with the quantitie of feet each Foot-man and Horse-man occupyeth for his proper
station in Rank or Brest: otherwise there would be odd feet, as in 2 paces (which
consists of 10 feet) there can bee but 3 Foot-men plac'd, who must take up but 9
feet; so that there is an odd foot remaining, which would put all out of order. But
in 3 paces there is 15 feet contained, wherein may be 5 men plac'd. Also in 3 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
