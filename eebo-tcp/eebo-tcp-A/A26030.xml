            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T having pleaſed the Lord once more to bring you together by a wonderful hand of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, contrary to the expectation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of very many, and to put a price into your hands (if you have hearts to it) of being repairers of our breaches, and reſtorers of paths to dwell in, of healing theſe bruiſed, broken, diſtracted, and almoſt deſtroyed Nations; and I looking upon you as the onely viſible Authority amongſt us, able to relieve the ſufferings of the diſtreſſed, not doubting of your mercy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the merit of the cauſe and innocency of the perſons; in all humility make bold to lay before you greater abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then ever I have heard or known acted in ſo ſhort a time, and in ſo ſmall a place as the Iſland of <hi>Jerſey.</hi>

            <p>It pleaſed this honourable Aſſembly in the place of <hi>Colonel Robert Gibbon</hi> to give a Commiſſion, <hi>June</hi> the 28. laſt, ſigned by the Right Honourable the Speaker to <hi>John Maſon,</hi> to be a Colonel and Governour of that Iſland, he was called there the Baylies, and Dr. <hi>Cartarets</hi> Governour, by whoſe eminent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with the late Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> I verily believe he obtained that preferment, ſuppoſed by them a fit inſtrument to countenance and ſmother their illegal actings there. I have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45183:3"/>
often admired how Dr. <hi>Cartaret</hi> crept into a place of ſuch truſt, as Judge Advocate of <hi>England,</hi> being not only dipt poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, but being by birth a <hi>French</hi> man, who naturally ſucks in with his mothers milk a hatred to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> but ſhall wonder much more if he continue in that honourable employment, having been ſo active of late for the Army, againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſuppoſed to be the Penman of moſt of the papers printed to beſpatter them, and having declared his judgement publickly, that if the Army were worſted, it was their intereſt to declare for King <hi>Charles,</hi> rather then let the Parliament ſit againe.</p>
            <p>His Governour <hi>Maſon</hi> was of late years an apprentice to Mr. <hi>Iohn Wedge,</hi> a Coach-harneſſe-maker at the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and <hi>Hoop</hi> in <hi>Cow-lane,</hi> which I ſhould account no diſgrace, but rather an honour, had his actions of courage and valour diſcovered that a generous and noble ſoul lodged under his mechanicks lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apron, but how ſparing of his fleſh and blood, and how careful he hath been all along the Wars to preſerve his life, I have been informed by ſeveral Members of the Army, and I have obſerved that they who have fought leaſt have gained moſt; thoſe Officers who have loſt their blood and eſtates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill by degrees weeded out of the Army by an inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, undermining Generation, who were within theſe twenty years the very ſcumme of the Nation, and all this under a knack and pretence of Reformation and Religion. However Governour he was, and Captain <hi>Richard Yardley</hi> a diſcreet, honeſt, and valiant Gentleman, and of a conſiderable eſtate, who had adventured both it, and his life in ſeveral engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>England,</hi> and reducing that Iſland, immediately laid down his Commiſſion, though courted by the late Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to have it renued, ſuppoſing it much below him to be Deputy to ſo inferior a perſon.</p>
            <p>Not long after Dr. <hi>Cartarets</hi> wife, the late Colonel <hi>Hewſons</hi> daughter arrives in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> as the ſo erunner of our new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, her party monopolize all the news to themſelves, having taken care ſince the death of <hi>Oliver</hi> Protector to ſtop the moſt of the Letters directed to the commiſſion Officers, as I have found out ſince I came to <hi>London;</hi> the moſt that we heard was, that they would whip all the Officers our of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45183:3"/>
Iſland (for that was the diſgraceful terme they uſed) but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially my ſelf to propagate their Church with the more facility: for at their firſt meeting in Saint <hi>Obins</hi> Fort, their exerciſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, and Miſtris <hi>Cartaret</hi> perceiving their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be very ſmall, demanded whether there were all their number, and whether their friends had not increaſed in her abſence, reply was made, they were never like to encreaſe as long as Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> ſtaid in the Iſland, thereupon they voted my removal as ſoone as they could effect it, and in order thereto whiſpered that ſome miſdemeanours were put in againſt me at <hi>Wallingford</hi> houſe.</p>
            <p>Not long after, to wit <hi>July</hi> the 16. laſt, about nine of the clock at night, our expected Governour arrived at <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Caſtle, accompanied with Mr. <hi>John Goſnold,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Pennel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Miller,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rutlidge</hi> (whoſe principles and practiſes follow) news being ſent to Saint <hi>Hillaries</hi> next day, that there would be a Sermon in the Caſtle at the opening of the Bridge in the afternoon, very many flocked thither both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Iſlanders to ſee the new Governour, and to heare his Chaplain, he courteouſly, and with a ſmiling countenance, and very faire words ſaluted the Officers and chief of the Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which put many in a confidence that a ſweet diſpoſition lodged under ſo promiſing a countenance, but ſince we have had reaſon to recant our errour, and to apply that of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 21. <hi>The words of his mouth were ſmoother then butter, but war was in his heart: his words were ſofter th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Should I trouble your Honour with the firing of the great Guns in the Caſtles, and Pariſhes for joy of his arrival, or with the ſumptuous feaſting of him, I ſhould probably diſcourage you in reading what follows. I cannot forget theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His party laid it as a groſſe ſcandal upon us, that we feaſted up and down the Iſland, and they in two moneths feaſted at more places then we did in ſix years, for Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> ſcarce eat ſix fet meals in his own lodgings all that time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They laid it as a groſſe ſcandal upon us, that we kept the Cavaliers of the Iſland company, and Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> eat and drank with thoſe that we did, and with thoſe that we never eat
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45183:4"/>
and drank with, witneſſe Mr. <hi>Bagot</hi> a caſheered Jurate, and Mr. <hi>Hilgrove,</hi> who was in armes againſt Colonel <hi>Heane</hi> when he reduced the Iſland, and ſtill hath been the moſt inveterate enemy againſt the Engliſh of any man in the Town, as Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Heane,</hi> Colonel <hi>Gibbon,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Yardley</hi> alwayes found.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> reſolved ſpeedily to reduce Lieutenant <hi>Joſeph Underwood</hi> from the Government of <hi>Orguile</hi> Caſtle, yet he was graciouſly pleaſed before he did it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to feaſt him and his followers, which put him to conſiderable charges.</p>
            <p>Hitherto all ſeems to be quiet and ſerene, but within a few dayes Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> pickes up a ſociety of Engliſh and Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſuch a pack as no man living can equalize in all the Iſland (their names, principles and practiſes follow) who being his privy Councel, he drives on furiouſly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>July</hi> the 23. he caſheered Captaine <hi>Hugh Gerhard</hi> by his ſole power, and charged Lieutenant <hi>Joſeph Underwood</hi> to keep him out of <hi>Orguile</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Within a few dayes after he caſhered <hi>Anthony Reade,</hi> an old ſouldier, who had adventured his life in <hi>England,</hi> and an eſtate worth fourty or fifty pounds a year, and was a Trooper under the valiant Colonel <hi>Heane</hi> at the reducing of <hi>Jerſey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He impriſoned them both a conſiderable time, and releaſed them by his ſole power, never giving a reaſon of any of theſe actions, nor calling a Court Martial, which is humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be contrary to the Lawes and Ordinances of Warre.</p>
            <p>But alas this is nothing to what follows, he begins with the ſouldiers but his aime is at the Officers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſends for Lieurenant <hi>Joſeph Underwood</hi> from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in <hi>Orguile</hi> Caſtle to Saint <hi>Hillaries</hi> Town, a Gentleman ingaged in the Wars from the beginning, in defence of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament, in the capacities of Captain Lieutenant of Horſe, Cornet, and Lieutenant of Foot, in all which he had been faithful, and adventured his life both in ſeveral engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>England,</hi> and reducing the Iſland of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> had loſt in the Wars, with <hi>Holland</hi> as many goods as coſt him two
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45183:4"/>
hundred &amp; fourſcore pounds, part being taken by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and part being caſt away, notwithſtanding all this, he diſmiſſes him of his command and Lieutenants place, gives poſſeſſion of the Caſtle to brother <hi>Meech,</hi> a creature of his own judgement, denies the Lieutenant the liberty to go into the Caſtle to remove his moneys and goods, or to go into <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Caſtle, or Saint <hi>Obins</hi> Fort, keeps him in the Iſland as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſeveral weeks, charges him to provide himſelf to go out of the Iſland when he went, and not to return without his paſs, carries him in the nature of a priſoner to St. <hi>Malo's</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and thence to <hi>England,</hi> promiſes him he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Commiſſion renewed for <hi>Jerſey,</hi> or as good employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment elſewhere: but inſtead of this he ſtops all his arreares to ſatisfie an old debt due to Major <hi>Salwey,</hi> and although his wife came to <hi>London</hi> a hundred miles, and ſolicited his favour with much diligence, the beſt anſwer ſhe received was, that ſhe was engaged to him, that he did not hang her husband, for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and it was in his power to hang him; in a word, the poor Gentlewoman having waited and wept a week in Town, had wanted moneys to have carried her to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> being denied her husbands expected pay, had not Colonel <hi>Maſons</hi> favourite, Mr. <hi>Pennell</hi> ſolicited earneſtly for a moneths pay, which with ſome difficulty he obtained, and when Colonel <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> paid it, he told her he beſtowed it clearly out of charity, for her husband was never to have any account of his pay. This he dealt with a faithful and honeſt Lieutenant, never bringing him to any legal trial, though he petitioned him ſeveral times to do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

               </gap>ober perſon, ingaged for the Parliament from the beginning of the Wars, for whoſe ſervice he hath ſet out three Dragooners, and a great horſe, and lent a conſiderable ſum of money, as will appear by his publick bills yet unſatisfied, and loſt a very great eſtate at ſea by the enemies of the Common-wealth; yet Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> diſmiſſes him of his place of Commiſſary and provoſt Marſhal in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> which he had diligently and faithfully diſcharged, and would not ſuffer him to go over to perfect his accounts untill he went thither himſelf, which is likely to prove very much to his damage: he put one <hi>Thomas Cooch</hi> into his place Mr. <hi>Sowtons</hi> Deputy to gratifie him for his intended perjury againſt me (as will appear hereafter) and all this he did by his own ſole power, without any order at all, for no cauſe that ever I heard, but becauſe Mr. <hi>Sowton</hi> went not over with him into <hi>Jerſey,</hi> although he was at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to have waited on him at his punctual appointed time, but Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> was gone before he came thither.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He diſmiſſes Mr. <hi>Robert Sidney,</hi> Corporal of the Horſe, who had adventured his life in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and reducing the Iſland of <hi>Jerſey</hi> in the capacities of Captain of Foot, and Cornet of horſe, had loſt a conſiderable eſtate in the rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Gentleman beloved by all Officers, Souldiers and others who knew him, being as civil, courteous, loving and ſweet diſpoſitioned perſon as treads upon the earth, of a ſtrict and unblamable converſation, a conſtant obſerver of his duty, who had continued in <hi>Jerſey</hi> above ſeven years after it was reduced (which <hi>I</hi> believe no Officer beſides himſelf did) his horſe being old and unfit for the States ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he ſold him by the Governors order, and by the ſame order came over to buy another, and to diſpatch ſome other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions he had, the Lord viſited him with ſo ſore a ſickneſs that he was generally ſuppoſed a dead man, he was newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered when Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> went over Governour into <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> of whom he requeſted leave to ſtay till the next Convoy to

diſpatch his buſineſs, which his ſickneſs had hindered, which he granted, but upon his return, he addreſſing himſelf to know his Commands, he plainly told him he was reſpited the Muſter Roules for abſence, and that another was put in his place, although Corporal <hi>Sidney</hi> urged that his ſickneſs put him in an abſolute incapacity of returning ſooner, and that he had both his own and his Predeceſſors leave, Colonel <hi>Gibbon</hi> to ſtay ſo long, yet there was no remedy but out he muſt, Corporal <hi>Sidney</hi> perceiving it in vain to conteſt with ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a man at that time, deſired his pay, of which ſum he gave him a clear and punctual account, notwithſtanding which one <hi>Ladington</hi> a brother of his profeſſion, whom he ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as Enſign into <hi>jerſey,</hi> and intruſted with five moneths pay for the Garriſon, cheats him of a moneths pay, which he puts into his own pocket, in which Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> hath ſo much incouraged him that Corporal <hi>Sidney</hi> hitherto hath not had one farthing refunded, although he hath cleared the matter, and petitioned Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> ſeveral times for Juſtice: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> refuſed to pay him his due, unleſs he went to <hi>Winchester</hi> for it, which he was forced to do, and to hire a horſe, which with his charges in that journey amounted to neer fifty ſhillings. Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> promiſed to conſider his extraordinary charges by every ones contributing according to what money he received which J urged, and according to my proportion of forty ſix pounds, left five ſhillings in his hands to that purpoſe, which he kept in his own hands, and never allowed Corporal <hi>Sidney,</hi> nor the reſt ingaged in that jorney any conſideration at all. The Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> hath ſent into this honeſt and worthy Gentlemans place one of Colonel <hi>Maſons</hi> Judgement, or whom I have received this information, that he is the moſt debauched perſon that ever came into the Iſland, being almoſt every day drunk: In one of his fits of drunkenneſs he drew his knife againſt one of the beſt Gentlemen in the Iſland, and ſwore by the Lord God he would ſtab him: In another fit he was ſo ſawcy that Maſter <hi>George Pinſon</hi> was forced to give him due correction, which I hear he did with ſuch diſcretion, that the Gentleman retired himſelf, and kept out of company ſeveral dayes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although he had promiſed Mr. <hi>William Swan</hi> to aſſiſt his friends at <hi>London</hi> in procuring his Commiſſion of Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter

How faithfull he hath been in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and how generally beloved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, all men there know. Notwithſtanding all his good ſervice and great ſufferings, Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> (not ſatisfied with the innocent blood of his eldeſt daughter, Mrs. <hi>Bridget Aſhton,</hi> whom he hath moſt barbarouſly murthered, as I have before related, which hath almoſt brought both him and his poor weak aged wife to their graves with ſorrow) that he might ruine Captain <hi>Swan,</hi> and his family, and break his wifes heart as he did mine, ſent for him over, and had undoubtedly outed him, as he did the reſt by his arbitrary ſole power, and (as 'tis reported) procured his place for Mr. <hi>Francis Cartaret</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Captain, had the Army been able to perſiſt in their late defection. From ſuch cruel blood thirſty perſons good Lord deliver us. O <hi>let the wickedneſs of the wicked come to an end, but eſtabliſh the juſt, for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins,</hi> Pſal. 7. 9.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> having been ſo great a Perſecutor of thoſe who have adventured their lives and fortunes in the ſervice of the Common-wealth, it cannot be expected he ſhould be a greater favourer of the publick body, then he hath been of the Members of it: His ſpirit hath ſufficiently appeared ſince the laſt interruption of the Parliament in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45183:11"/>
1. He conſtantly ſate among the Councel of Officers at <hi>White-Hall</hi> and <hi>Wallingford</hi> houſe in oppoſition to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was accounted by all I met with a moſt active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in perſwading the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to continue to the laſt what he had begun, being not only exceedingly intimate with him, but the moſt rigid and rigorous Anabaptiſt in all the Army.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was appoiunted by the Committee of Safety, one of the Commiſſioners for regulating the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Westminſter,</hi> for the Army againſt the Parliament, in which I believe it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon examination and enquiry he was ſufficiently active.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His hand is at all or moſt of the papers ſent to the ſeveral Regiments to move them to engage for the Army againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſent Letters to <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Garnzey</hi> (Colonel <hi>Bingham</hi>'s command) by which he procured the ſubſcriptions of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers in both Iſlands, for the Army againſt the Parliament, trepanning many honeſt hearted and true friends to the Common-wealth, who knew no more of affaires in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> then he writ in his miſ-informing letters.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He abjured the Parliaments Commiſſion ſigned by your Honour, and received Commiſſions for himſelf and his new Officers in <hi>Jerſey</hi> from the late Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> which he hath carried over with him, and I am bold to affirme, he would, if he durſt, keep that Iſland for the Army againſt the Parliament, but I believe he will not adventure to do it, being a man of ſmall courage and valour.</p>

            <p>Firſt, they who came over with him out of <hi>England</hi> were,</p>

he was extreamly weary of the Iſland, and earneſt to be in <hi>England,</hi> and that he might ſhift off preaching deſigned to take a voyage to <hi>Malo's</hi> in <hi>France</hi> (as he called it) but was prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpeedy arrival of the Convoy which carried us away: although I perceived by his diſcourſe that it was his judgement not to hear any one preach except he were of his perſwaſion, yet I found by his own preaching, that he had read the Sermons of others, and got them without book, the heads and illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his firſt Sermon at <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Caſtle on <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Onely let your converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> I found when I was on board the <hi>Kent</hi> Frigot in Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on that Text, entituled <hi>Goſpel Converſation.</hi> The heads and illuſtrations of his ſix Sermons preached in St. <hi>Hillaries</hi> Town are known very well to be ſtollen out of Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> fifteene Sermons on the ſame Text, being 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Wherefore the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> By theſe I gueſſe where the reſt were ſtollen, I cannot ſay but he added many extravagant expreſſions of his own, I know (ſaid he) a thouſand ſouls in hell, who have been brought thither by the evil example of others. I hope he was never there, although he affirmed the matter upon his certain knowledge, I omit the reſt for brevity ſake: he had an excellent faculty in condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his adverſaries to the torments of the bottomleſſe pit, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hell with Prieſts ſculls, ſentencing Sir <hi>George Boothe,</hi> &amp; his Countrey-men to do die without mercy, and palliating the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of his brethren with the candid Characters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and ſlips.

in <hi>London</hi> to preſent it with his own hands, however between them two it was never delivered. As to the principles of Mr. <hi>Pennels</hi> religion, I am apt to believe they are uncertain, he's a Presbyterian in the morning, an Independent at noon, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal man in the evening, and at midnight a Quaker, as to his education and converſation, he was an Apprentice to a Chirurgion in <hi>Germany,</hi> thence he went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he practiced the profeſſion of a Barber-Chirurgion, there he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled the Gentlewoman he lives with, he carried her from place to place, at laſt to <hi>London,</hi> where he practiſed the Barber and Tooth-drawer, and ſet up Bills to cure ſeveral diſeaſes, at laſt procured a commiſſion to be Chirurgion in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he left his reputed wife in a moſt miſerable poor condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>London,</hi> likely to be ſtarved, his former carriage had made her diſtracted two or three times before that; he came into <hi>Jerſey,</hi> talked much of Chirurgery and Phyſick, and yet he is neither Anatomiſt, Ghymiſt, Herbaliſt, nor Latiniſt, by his faire ſpeeches he crept into the Officers favour, he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his family into <hi>Jerſey,</hi> for which he provides moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, he abuſes, kicks and pinches his reputed wife, as civil and good a Gentlewoman as lives, he haunts Taverns and Tipling houſes day and night, is a common curſer, a common drunkard, a common ſwearer (for which I have often reproved him) and ſome in <hi>London</hi> have ſaid they can prove he's a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, he hath uſed his Apprentice, Mr. <hi>Robert Horton</hi> liker a dog then a Chriſtian, not allowing him either meat, drink or cloathes convenient, although he had a conſiderable ſumme of money with him, more-over at Mr. <hi>Pennells</hi> coming out of <hi>Jerſey</hi> laſt, he went about to procure ſubſcriptions from ſeveral perſons againſt the young Gentleman, and took the hand of <hi>Edmund</hi> his other Apprentice, hopeing (as he ſaid himſelf) to prove a forfeiture of his Indentures, and to recover a hundred pounds from his father: he hath abuſed his beſt friends, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the worſhipful Captain <hi>Richard Yardley,</hi> who out of meer Chriſtian charity, conſidering his great charge, had mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered one of his men in the party of Horſe, and done him all the favours imaginable, yet the beſt language he had for him when he came into <hi>Jerſey</hi> with Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> was, <hi>Yardley</hi> is out, he will never be any thing again, Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> cannot

abide him, will not let him come near him, I believe he will be ſequeſtred, and the like. Once more Mr. <hi>Pennel</hi> hath told ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons of quality near <hi>London,</hi> that he was never married to the Gentlewoman by whom he hath foure children now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and that ſhe is none of his wife, but his whore. O abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable adultery! my heart trembles to think of it, and yet this is he that bragged when he was laſt in <hi>London,</hi> that all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Officers were turned out except himſelf, and that he only was Colonel <hi>Maſons</hi> favourite, and good reaſon too, for I believe he can ſcarce finde ſuch a toole for his turn in all the three Nations and their Dominions. But enough of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Millar,</hi> a rebaptized brother, and one of the Protectors ſect, and then of the Parliaments Life-guard, this fellow told Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> all that he ſaw, heard, or knew, and a great deal more, if a man did but break wind backward the Governour ſhould know it for fear of a plot, as to his converſation, he loved a glaſs of wine very well, which he would take of ſoundly; in that ſhort time of his ſtay in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> he was once ſo drunk at one of their feaſts, that coming home he was not able to guide his horſe, but road through the hedges, and tore his hand almoſt from about his neck, Colonel <hi>Maſon</hi> promiſed to make this hopeful blade his Captain Lieutenant, but he went into the North with the late Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> in that expedition againſt General <hi>Monk</hi> and ſince I heard nothing of him, his wife here in <hi>London</hi> runs out ſufficiently againſt Colonel <hi>Maſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Rutlidge</hi> of the ſame principle, and in the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as the former, he was the only perſon I looked upon among all that Generation there, as a down-right, honeſt-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſincere, upright man, if I be miſtaken I hope I ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for my charity.</p>

(2) An Inne-keeper in <hi>London</hi> told one whom I can produce, that Enfign <hi>Meech</hi> was the beſt gueſt that ever he had in his life, for he would ſit up and drink all night, if any one would ſit with him, and that many times he had much ado to get out of his company.

               <p n="3">(3.)

His wife was always eſteemed in <hi>England</hi> to be a grain too light, ſhe followed a Sarjeant up and down night and day, and (as he ſaid) would not let him be quiet, how familiar one <hi>Scot</hi> was with her in <hi>Jerſey</hi> is publickly known, once ſhe and ſeveral others drank at <hi>Tizards</hi> in St. <hi>Hillaries</hi> three or four pints a ſack a piece, till they were ſo drunk that they knew not the reckoning, but quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled about it, and threw the pots up and down the room.
