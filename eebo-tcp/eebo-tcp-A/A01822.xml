            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In countries which for their common drinkes do vſe wine and water, they alway do mingle things for the ſight in wine, and not in water: for wine in truth is a fitter li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor to receiue the qualities and to carry the ſame to the eyes, then water: which thinges they do put in the muſte, and ſo let it ſtand, vntill the wine be ripe, and ready to be drunken, and ſo do vſe it.</p>

taking to euery gallon of the drink a great handfull of the herbe,<note place="margin">The quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright to the drinke.</note> and bind it together, or put it in raw and thinne tinſell of ſilke, and ſo tie the ſame by a ſtring to the tap of the veſſell, that the herbe may hang in the middeſt of the drinke, not too low in the ground, neither to high in the barme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into the drinke when it is newlie clenſed: let all worke togither vntill the drinke be cleare and ripe, to be drunken according to the common vſe, and then ye may drinke of it at pleaſure in the morning faſting, and at meate alſo if you will, and can well like thereof; and moſt men may like to drinke it, becauſe this herbe doeth yeeld no vngratefull taſte, but rather with a pleaſant ſapour doth commend the drinke. It were not amiſſe, to avoide windines, to euery handfull of the herbe to adde two drammes of fenell ſeeds,<note place="margin">Fenell ſeeds.</note> well duſted, and a little bruiſed. As I doe put this for more proportion to beginne with-all, that the ſtomacke be not at the firſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſtrangeneſſe: So after a time, yee may increaſe the quantitie, and put to euery gallon of the drinke, two handfuls of the herbe, wherein yee may beſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the taſte, that the herbe ſhall

            <p>I can witnes,<note place="margin">The effect confirmed by examples.</note> that many by this ſimple compoſition of eiebright and fenell ſeeds, haue found great good for their ſight, not onely to continue in good eſtate, but alſo that ſome haue found remedie againſt the dimnes and other impediments, growing in their ſight. In truth once I met an old man in Shropſhire, called <hi>M.

one ounce make a <hi>Colirium,</hi> or with two ounces of the ſame water make a <hi>Collirium liquidum</hi>: a litle of the Muſcilage is to bee preſcribed becauſe it doth quickly grow ſower.</p>
            <p>And now I aſke whether your <hi>Colliriae</hi> are to bee diſtilled into the eyes as hot as may be ſuffered? as it liketh <hi>Scribonius</hi>: or cold as it pleaſeth <hi>Meſue,</hi> or luke warme according to <hi>Galen</hi>: But in my opinion they are to be inſtilled luke warme, vnleſſe the affect do require ſome other thing, for in eyes that be exceedingly inflamed and burning, wee drop it in cold; but in very cold affects wee droppe it in very warme, otherwiſe meanely warme doth alwaies ſerue the turne.</p>
            <p>Now to proceed to cure thoſe diſeaſes whereof wee haue already ſpoken: euery diſtemperature is cured by his contrary: as eyes that bee inflamed and ouer-hot, ſhall be cooled with the dayly waſhing of them with cold thinges, or with the waters of Roſes and Plantaine: but if the diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be cold, we warme the eyes with put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the waters of Eyebright, Fennell, Rue, Celendine, waſhing them often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: if the eyes bee ouer-moiſt wee dry

            <p>If the eyes ſhall be greater or leſſer then they ſhould be from their firſt conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all remedies are vnprofitable: if they happen ſo by accident, as by ſome fluxe from the braine, all the body is often to be purged, the moiſt eyes are to be dryed, we muſt looke to the head that is ouer-moiſt with <hi>Cephalicall</hi> thinges.

Now to proceed in order to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15317:29"/>
the cure: firſt you muſt purge the braine, with pils that are proper for that purpoſe, and giue them to the patient, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you begin your cure: then the next day following, about nine of the clock in the morning, the patient yet faſting, (prouided that the cataract be ripe, and confirmed) cauſe him to ſit ouert: vhart a ſtoole, in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſhione, and ſit on the ſame ſtoole face to face, and make the parient to hold his ſound eie cloſed with his hand, and in that ſort charge him to ſit ſteadfaſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtarting, or ſtirring in any-wife: let an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other alſo ſtand behind him, and hold his head very ſtedfaſt: this done, firſt with your owne hand lift vp the ouer-eie-lid, and then with thy other hand put in thy needle, made for that purpoſe in at the greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the eie, and finely trilling the tunicle called ſaluatella, or ſaluatrix, writh alwaies thy finger to and fro, till thou touch with the point of thy needle the corrupt water, which is indeed the cataracte: and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by little and little, to remoue that water from before the ſight, to the corner of the eie, and keepe it there with the point of your needle; the ſpace of three minuts of an houre, and then remoue your needle ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15317:29"/>
from it, and if it happen to riſe againe, bring it back the ſecond time: but this you muſt beware of, that when the needle hath touched the catarract, you doe not writh it about with your fingers to and fro, till it be ſet in his place before named, but to draw it thither gently, and when you haue it there, trill the needle about vntill it hath gathered the water about it, and then pull it out: when this is done cauſe him to ſhut cloſe his eie, and apply therevpon a plaſter of flaxe, and the white of an egge, and cauſe him to lie in his bed nine daies together, remouing the plaſter three times in the day, and ſo many times in the night, without any other ſtirring of it, and prouide alſo that hee lie in a very darke place, and let him be kept in a thin diet, as reare egges and white bread: and if hee be young, and of ſtrength, let him drinke Barly water, but otherwiſe let him drinke ſmall ale, and wine delayd with water, for truely too much nouriſhment would offend, in procreating too much bloud in the eie, which is very hurtfull in the beginning of the cure.
