            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Was very glad to hear yeſterday of your intentions of giving me an anſwer to the Letter I wrote to you five days ago; I did expect I ſhould find ſomething extraordinary, and ſome reaſons or arguments of ſtrength ſufficient to convince the world, that even the <hi>demonſtrative argument</hi> from <hi>Iſidore</hi> ought to be ſet aſide, ſince you could produce evidences as ſtrong and as poſitive on the other hand; and therefore as ſoon as I heard it, I reſolved with my ſelf not to be obſtinate in the defence of my <hi>charge</hi> againſt you, but fairly and honeſtly to own my miſtake, if you did bring on your ſide any thing ſtronger and more rational than what had been produced againſt you.</p>
            <p>But when I this day had <hi>your Anſwer</hi> from the Preſs; the firſt peruſal of <hi>it</hi> ſufficiently informed me, that you had not done that thing, which indeed my private reaſon (I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) did aſſure me that you could not, I mean that you had not given any thing of moment in defence of your ſelf.</p>
            <p>One thing I muſt own I was ſurpriſed at, the great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your ſtyle betwixt your <hi>two Letters. This</hi> is as bluſtring and abuſive, as the <hi>other</hi> was calm; you reflected in your Letter to <hi>the Honourable Lord</hi> on the <hi>inſulting</hi> and <hi>ſcurrilous lauguage</hi> of the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but for your ſelf you ſaid, <hi>far be it from me even to return</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Letter to a Peer, <hi>pag.</hi> 9.</note>
               <hi>the like, we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither hath the Church of God: Truth</hi> (ſay you) <hi>would bluſh to be defended by ſuch unwarrantable arms:</hi> but it ſeems your mind is altered ſince, and now Truth will not bluſh to be ſo defended, and you can make uſe of <hi>harſher words</hi> (which others call inſolent language) <hi>in the defence</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi>

                  </gap>.</note>
               <hi>of Truth:</hi> but I muſt do you this juſtice to own, that you have not quitted the reſolutions of the <hi>former Letter,</hi> ſince what you ſet your ſelf ſo angryly to defend here is <hi>no Truth</hi> but a <hi>groſs Errour,</hi> as I ſhall very quickly ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63877:3"/>
You begin your Letter in a victorious ſtile, and reaſon good, ſince you ſay you have <hi>the Opinion of all men of ſenſe</hi> that your <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Peer</hi> of <hi>the Church of England hath cleared</hi> you <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of the miſtake</hi> I <hi>charged</hi> you <hi>with.</hi> I muſt confeſs I dare not deny what you ſay here, ſince I have not ſpoken with the hundredth part of the <hi>men of ſenſe</hi> in the Town to know whether it be Truth that you write here: however thus far I dare ſpeak, that I do not believe it, ſince I am afraid that by the ALL MEN of SENSE here is meant no more than SOME of your own party.</p>
            <p>It was not from an <hi>inconſiderate itch of Scribling</hi> (as you word it <note n="c" place="margin">Reply, p. 2.</note>) that I reflected upon <hi>that paſſage</hi> in your <hi>introduction</hi> to your <hi>Sermon</hi> at <hi>Cheſter.</hi> I was provoked to it from that paſſage's being ſo much cryed up, boaſted of, and inſiſted upon as if <hi>it</hi> had been a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt genuine and a moſt conſiderable Teſtimony (about <hi>Praying to the Virgin Mary)</hi> from St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince I was quickly ſatisfied that the <hi>Sermon,</hi> out of which <hi>it</hi> was taken, was not St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, I looked upon it as a duty I owed to the world, and particularly to the <hi>Nobility of the Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (ſome of <hi>whom</hi> had been urged much with that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage) to publiſh it to the whole Nation [in that page that was empty at the end of my Book] that <hi>that Sermon</hi> de Sanctis out of which <hi>it</hi> is taken, was not, nor could be St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reaſons</hi> I uſed there have been the ſubject of this Letter-Controverſie betwixt us, and though you be <hi>reſolved never to take any</hi> [farther] <hi>notice of ſuch unknown perſons, who conceal their names,</hi> yet I am reſolved to defend my firſt Letter to you, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall convince the world in it, that you ought to make ſome other Reply than you hitherto have, to the <hi>Demonſtrative Argument</hi> from <hi>Iſidore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt and leaſt conſiderable Reaſon that I urged againſt the Sermon was from the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>it.</hi> About this we have had the moſt ado, though I hinted in my Letter to you that the ſtreſs of the Controverſie did not at all depend upon it. But you are reſolved to inſiſt upon this, and in your <hi>Reply</hi> you have marſhal'd my reaſonings for that proof firſt into a <hi>new Errour, next</hi> into <hi>a falſe Inference, then</hi> into <hi>a plain cheat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are very <hi>hard words,</hi> and therefore I come now to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how I deſerve <hi>them:</hi> 'Tis <hi>an Errour</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that there</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63877:3"/>

The Authours named in that Paragraph <note n="e" place="margin">Letter to a Peer, <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note>you refer to are [the Suppoſititious <hi>Sermon</hi> of] St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> St. <hi>Hephonſus</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">I can meet with no Authour of this name either in your or our Criticks. I ſuppoſe you mean St <hi>Ildephonſus;</hi> if you did, you ſhould ſurely have corrected in your Reply the errour in your <hi>Letter.</hi>

               </hi> but theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the men to ſhew the <hi>General pious Belief of the Aſſumption</hi> in St. <hi>Auſtin's time,</hi> ſince you ſay you <hi>find</hi> in <hi>them,</hi> that <hi>they doubted of; or disbelieved</hi>

               <hi>her</hi> [the B.

To paſs them therefore, who are either not to the purpoſe here, or againſt your aſſertion; there are but <hi>two Authours</hi> more in the <hi>Paragraph,</hi> St. <hi>Mellion's Sermon</hi> [which in your <hi>Reply</hi> hath changed both <hi>its name,</hi> and is called St. <hi>Melitons</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 3.</note>
               <hi>Book]</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus:</hi> And now I would fain know of you, Sir, how either of theſe Authours prove what you aſſert a <hi>General pious Belief of the Aſſumption in St. Auſtin's time:</hi> as for <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> he lived not till almoſt a <hi>Thouſand years</hi> after St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> ſo that he is a moſt unfit Witneſs for ſuch a purpoſe: but here you will tell me that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> is urged by you onely, to ſhew, that <hi>Juvenal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Hieruſalem proved the Truth of this Myſtery to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of very Ancient Tradition before Marcian the Emperour.</hi> To this I anſwer, that <hi>Juvenal</hi> lived after St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s time and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be no Witneſs as to <hi>his time:</hi> but paſſing this, the Credit of all this ſtory depends upon <hi>Nicephorus Calliſtus,</hi> who is of no Authority herein, not onely becauſe <hi>he</hi> lived not till the <hi>fourteenth Century,</hi> but becauſe <hi>he</hi> is a moſt fabulous Writer. I have not time to inſiſt on or urge what <hi>Monſieur Launoy</hi> hath offered againſt this Story, eſpecially what he ſays <note n="i" place="margin">

               </note>about the <hi>ſilence</hi> of the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> who lived <hi>in, near,</hi> or <hi>ſince that time</hi> down to <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> who is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> Authour (according to him) that broached that fable about <hi>Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Marcian</hi> the <hi>Emperour.</hi> I have one argument to urge againſt your <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and that is, that it is impoſſible <hi>he</hi> could ſhew any <hi>ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tradition</hi> for the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> ſince it is granted that the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63877:4"/>
Writers of the Church before <hi>him</hi> never mentioned any ſuch thing, and which is more ſince, this <hi>very Doctrine</hi> about <hi>Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was condemned in the <hi>ſame Century</hi> in a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Gelaſius</hi> Pope with 70 other <hi>Biſhops.</hi>

            <p>What I urge here concerns your Authour St. <hi>Melito,</hi> the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious book under whoſe name was condemned as <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal.</hi> But pray, Sir, how do you prove to us that <hi>this Book</hi> under St. <hi>Melito</hi>'s name was before St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s time? the firſt news we hear of <hi>it</hi> is not till above 60 years after St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s time, and the ſame time that we hear of the <hi>Book,</hi> we hear of <hi>its</hi> being condemned as an <hi>Apocryphal thing:</hi> Yet I will grant to you (what I do not believe) that the book was older; will any man of tolerable ſenſe argue from this Book a <hi>General Pious Belief of the Aſſumption</hi> in St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s time, when <hi>this</hi> very Book that taught it was condemned as Apocryphal at <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſame Century <note n="k" place="margin">Liber qui appellatur Tranſitus, id eſt, Aſſumptio Sanctae Mariae, apocryphus.

            <p>I cannot but ſtay here to wonder a little at your ſaying there, that IF <hi>this Sermon be not S. Melito's Genuine work, it muſt be of ſome other Authour nigh thoſe times.</hi> I can be no longer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that you ſhould ſtand up ſo obſtinately for the 35<hi>th. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon de Sanctis,</hi> when I find you at moſt but dubious whether <hi>that Book</hi> (for ſo I would call it) under <hi>Melito</hi>'s name be genuine or no; Whereas all the men of Learning in the <hi>Church</hi> have long ſince thrown it up as ſpurious and Apocryphal; I have already ſhown how it was condemned by a <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Council</hi> as Apocryphal twelve hundred years ago: Not long after that our Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> fell moſt ſeverely upon it, and lays to the charge of the Authour of it <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>downright lying:</hi> ſo that <hi>De La Bigne</hi> was about ſtriking it out of his <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum;</hi> but though he ſatisfied himſelf with ſome reaſons for his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it there, yet this is his Concluſion about it; <hi>notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what hath been ſaid above, it is</hi>

               <hi>certain that this Book is falſely aſcribed to S. Melito, that it is Apocryphal, and of no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to be altogether rejected for its mixtures,</hi> [of Truth and falſhood.] He then tells us that the <hi>Spaniſh Index Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorius</hi> have ordered the <hi>whole</hi> of <hi>the Book</hi> from the 8<hi>th.</hi> Chapter to be <hi>expunged:</hi> and I can aſſure you that the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63877:4"/>
               <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is the ſubject of <hi>thoſe Chapters</hi> which the <hi>Index</hi> hath ordered to be ſtruck out: And yet you, Sir, after all this (and more which I could add) are not ſatisfied of that Book's being ſpurious: Which thing among <hi>Learned Men</hi> I am ſure will not add any Luſtre to one who writes himſelf of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> but will ſatisfie the World, what ſort of an <hi>Adverſary</hi> I have to deal with.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewn that your <hi>Melito</hi> and your <hi>Nicephorus</hi> are of no Credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there being no other Authours offered for my Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I pray Sir, where and how have you ſhewn the <hi>General pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous belief of the Virgin's Aſſumption in St.</hi> Auſtin<hi>'s time:</hi> And what ground had you for your charge of a <hi>new Errour</hi> in me, when you are not able to evince the thing; all ſee at leaſt that you did not doe it there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next charge is a</hi> falſe Inference; <hi>my words upon which you ground it are theſe,</hi> if the Day of Aſſumption do not ever ſignifie the day of a Saints Death, why may not this be the exception? <hi>Upon this you charge me with inferring that if</hi> Aſſumption do not always ſignifie the Death of a Saint, therefore here it may ſignifie the Corporal Aſſumption of the bleſſed Virgin, therefore it doth. <hi>I own that this laſt,</hi> [therefore it doth] <hi>is not onely a</hi> falſe <hi>but a</hi> ſilly inference, <hi>but I am ſure it is not mine, I onely ſaid,</hi> why may not this be the Exception. <hi>I appeal to my</hi> words <hi>juſt put down, and to all</hi> Scholars <hi>whether</hi> this <hi>be</hi> ingenuous dealing; <hi>ſo that your ſecond charge is fallen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before you paſs to your <hi>third</hi> great charge, you accuſe me of a <hi>wilfull miſtake</hi> in making you ſay <hi>that in the ancient Writings Feaſt or Day</hi> of <hi>Aſſumption when applyed to Saints did onely almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifie the day of their Death.</hi> Well, Sir, and did not you ſay ſo your ſelf in your <hi>firſt Letter;</hi> is not the <hi>almoſt</hi> of your own putting in there. Theſe are the <hi>very words</hi> you uſed there; <hi>as if Feaſt or Day of Aſſumption in the Writings of Ancients, did</hi> AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOST EVER <hi>ſignifie any thing elſe but the</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Letter to a Peer, <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note>
               <hi>Day of a Saints Death.</hi> I muſt confeſs, Sir, that I thought I had to doe with <hi>one</hi> who would admit of his <hi>own words,</hi> and not charge them upon his <hi>Adverſary,</hi> as if they were <hi>his;</hi> with one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Engliſh:</hi> but I muſt now take my Lot, what ever it is.</p>
            <p>Your next charge is of a Cheat in endeavouring to inſinuate that the 35th <hi>Sermon</hi> did not ſpeak of the <hi>Virgin's Death,</hi> but of <hi>her Aſſumption</hi> in the Vulgar ſenſe of the word. But wherein
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63877:5"/>
is the Cheat, I put down there the <hi>very words</hi> of the <hi>Sermon;</hi> well but, ſay you, <hi>Aſſumption</hi> here does only ſignifie her <hi>Death,</hi> and you quote a paſſage of the <hi>Sermon</hi> for it, which is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately <note place="margin"> You have twice tranſlated in this ſhort paſſage <hi>Catholica Hiſtoria</hi> the Catholick Church.</note>tranſlated: I am not throughly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of this, and my reaſon is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as I was, before I ſaw <hi>your Letter,</hi> ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that there was not a neceſſity of taking <hi>Aſſumption here</hi> in the <hi>Vulgar ſenſe,</hi> ſo I was fully aſſured that the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Sermon</hi> hath determined for <hi>neither ſenſe,</hi> but hath left it <hi>doubtfull</hi> whether ſhe were <hi>aſſumed Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally</hi> or no <note n="n" place="margin"> Vera autem de ejus Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ſententia haec eſſe probatur ut ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Apoſtolum, ſive in corpore, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve extra corpus Ignorantes, aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam ſuper Angelos eam eſſe credamus. <hi>Sermo 35. de Sanctis.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>You next take me to task about the miſtake you made in quoting the 14th <hi>Sermon de Sanctis;</hi> and you adviſe me to be <hi>leſs raſh in my Rhetorical Declamations.</hi> But I cannot ſee my fault here: You did quote the 14th <hi>Sermon de Sanctis,</hi> I went thither, and when I could not find <hi>it</hi> there, I lookt into thoſe <hi>Sermons</hi> I mentioned in my <hi>Letter,</hi> and not finding it in <hi>any</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> I concluded it to be <hi>your miſtake,</hi> and did believe that ſome body had impoſed upon <hi>you:</hi> I afterwards looked over <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Sermons de Sanctis,</hi> and not finding <hi>it</hi> any where, I thought you had been deceived, and I hope it was no fault to tell you ſo, as I then did. But you will have it that I was <hi>reſolved to miſtake you, that I might fanſie ſomething to object againſt. There are</hi> (ſay you) <hi>but two</hi> 14th <hi>Sermons de Sanctis, that of the firſt ancient Collection, and that in the other Compilation of Seventeen made by the Divines of Paris.</hi> I am not, Sir, to be frighted or born down with dint of Confidence. I ſay that it is falſe that there are two 14th <hi>Sermons de Sanctis;</hi> the <hi>Sermons de Sanctis</hi> are a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>one</hi> and <hi>fifty Sermons,</hi> and when any one talks of or quotes ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Sermon de Sanctis,</hi> we know readily whither to go. The <hi>Sermons</hi> added by the <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> are not intituled <hi>de Sanctis</hi> either in the <hi>Louvain Edition</hi> that I uſe, or in the <hi>Benedictine:</hi> And therefore when the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines</hi> put <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Paris Sermons</hi> down in <hi>their Volume</hi> they tell us in the <hi>Margin</hi> that it is the 5th or 7th, for example, <hi>inter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditos à Pariſienſibus,</hi> whereas when <hi>they</hi> put down <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons de Sanctis, they</hi> always tell us there that it is the 24th or 42d, for example <hi>de Sanctis:</hi> So that you cannot avoid ſeeing how you have run your ſelf into a new miſtake by reſolving to defend an old one. I am afraid you are not ſo much verſed in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63877:5"/>
as your <hi>Sermon</hi> made ſhew of, and therefore I will give you this piece of advice, that when you meet with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons de Sanctis</hi> quoted in your <hi>Authors,</hi> you would not quickly ſwallow, but would examine a little, and be carefull, ſince of the 51 <hi>Sermons de Sanctis</hi> the <hi>Benedictines</hi> have rejected <hi>one</hi> and <hi>forty</hi> as <hi>ſpurious,</hi> and none of St. <hi>Auſtins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now come to the next Argument from the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</hi> againſt the <hi>Sermon.</hi> I charged you with having ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>Benedictine Manuſcripts</hi> which give us <hi>no Author</hi> of <hi>that Sermon,</hi> you tell us that my charge herein is <hi>ridiculous;</hi> and you indeavour to illuſtrate your anſwer, or rather to anſwer by a <hi>Similitude</hi> taken out of the <hi>Law Courts;</hi> but ſo ill applyed as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe, for what is poſſeſſion, in this caſe, muſt a <hi>Book</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways belong to ſuch an <hi>Author,</hi> becauſe once in his <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> it ſeems the world have wronged <hi>Arnobius</hi> in vindicating <hi>Octavius</hi> to its <hi>true Maſter;</hi> what ſay you, was it not in his Poſſeſſion; did not the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> give it to <hi>Arnobius?</hi> or how came he to have it? what if ſome <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> name no Author for it? This how ridiculous ſoever is all you would ſay here; and yet you pity my weakneſs <hi>and paſs it by, becauſe you love, not to inſult on an erring Adverſaries patent miſtake:</hi> forgetting in the mean time that while you would make what I ſay <hi>ridiculous,</hi> you fall foul upon thoſe <hi>Benedictines</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> (whom I had it from) whoſe Learning is as much known as admired, and the world too much indebted to them for their excellent pains upon St. <hi>Auguſtine, whom they</hi> have publiſhed, and upon St. <hi>Ambroſe whom</hi> they are now a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the <hi>Preſs,</hi> to think <hi>their arguments ridiculous,</hi> becauſe <hi>you</hi> think them ſo.</p>
            <p>You next charge me with <hi>Diſingenuity</hi> and <hi>real forgery</hi> in inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, That <hi>this Sermon bears not his (St.</hi> Auſtine<hi>'s) name either</hi> in the <hi>Manuſcripts uſed by the</hi> Louvain <hi>Divines,</hi> or by the <hi>Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, when I own my ſelf that the</hi> Louvain <hi>Divines onely ſay it is not in ſeveral of their Manuſcripts.</hi> Would any one but look into that <hi>Paragraph</hi> of <hi>my Letter,</hi> whence you quote <hi>this,</hi> he will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee that the <hi>Louvain Manuſcripts</hi> I ſpeak of here are <hi>thoſe</hi> that <hi>intituled this Sermon to Fulbertus.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> that gave it to <hi>Fulbertus</hi> are <hi>thoſe</hi> I had in my eye there, when I ſaid that the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> uſed by the <hi>Louvain</hi> Divines, give it to <hi>Fulbertus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of St. <hi>Auſtine.</hi> I did not ſay all their <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> gave it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63877:6"/>
againſt St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> but that the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> ſpoken of at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Paragraph</hi> did give it for <hi>Fulbertus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You next ask me whether <hi>I do not egregiouſly deſtroy my own cauſe in appealing to moſt ancient Manuſcripts,</hi> [my <hi>appeal</hi> was to the <hi>moſt</hi> as well as to the <hi>beſt Manuſcripts] and the known ſtile of the Author.</hi> I think, Sir, that I do not, and ſhall think ſo till you ſhew me not only that the <hi>ſtile</hi> of <hi>this Sermon</hi> is purely St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine's</hi> but that it is attributed to him in the MOST, and BEST <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi> Theſe things you ſhould regularly have done here, but inſtead of offering at <hi>one word</hi> of this nature for my Conviction: You think you anſwer me enough in asking me whether St. <hi>Thomas was not better acquainted with St.</hi> Auſtine's <hi>ſtyle, than I dare preſume to be: and whether he had not as great a plenty, He and all his Contemporaries, and of freſher Manuſcripts?</hi> [here muſt be added, for not onely the <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> requires it, <hi>as I have.]</hi> But had you added <hi>this</hi> as the <hi>ſtyle</hi> requires it, every one would have ſeen the great weakneſs of it: I have not onely told you, but proved it to you in my <hi>firſt Letter,</hi> that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was no <hi>Critick:</hi> But as to <hi>your queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> you cannot be ignorant that I did not rely on my <hi>own ijudgment,</hi> or pretend to have MSS. by me. What I have ſaid about theſe things hath the aſſiſtance not onely of the <hi>Benedictine,</hi> but <hi>Louvain</hi> Divines, and the <hi>Queſtions</hi> you put to <hi>me</hi> do as much concern <hi>them</hi> as <hi>me,</hi> nay more: for <hi>they</hi> had thoſe MSS. I inſiſted on, and therefore for the future pray lay your accuſation right; and ſince the <hi>Louvain</hi> Divines are in their Graves, write a ſharp reproof to thoſe impudent <hi>Benedictines,</hi> who have dared to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s <hi>ſtyle as well</hi> or better than <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and have had the face to pretend to ſuch MSS. as do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to deprive St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of that 35<hi>th</hi> Sermon <hi>de Sanctis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this skirmiſhing hitherto, we are arrived at the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> from S. <hi>Iſidore.</hi> I urged that it was certain the 35<hi>th.</hi> Sermon <hi>de Sanctis</hi> could not be St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, ſince <hi>Iſidore was quoted in it, who lived not till two hundred years after St.</hi> Auſtin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your anſwer was, that the</hi> Iſidore <hi>quoted in the</hi> Sermon <hi>could not be</hi> he <hi>that lived in the</hi> Seventh Century, <hi>and your proof was from a paſſage in the</hi> Sermon <hi>it ſelf, in which the</hi> Authour <hi>of the</hi> Sermon <hi>ſaid that,</hi> In our time no Authour among the Latins can be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63877:6"/>
found [is found, <hi>ſaith the</hi> Sermon] who treating of the bleſſed Virgin's Death, hath been poſitive and expreſs, <hi>or as I ſhall tranſlate it,</hi> to have ſpoken any thing expreſly concerning her Death; <hi>whereas</hi> no one <hi>(you add)</hi> could be ignorant of what ſo famous an Authour as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> had in his Hiſtory plainly and fully written in the ſixth Age.</p>
            <p>This I anſwered in my <hi>laſt,</hi> by telling <hi>you</hi> that the <hi>Authour</hi> of this <hi>Sermon might either not know, or not regard</hi> Gregory <hi>of</hi> Tours; and urged the inſtance of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who notwithſtanding <hi>Gregory</hi>'s <hi>moſt full account</hi> of the <hi>Aſſumption, either doubted</hi> or <hi>disbelieved</hi> it; upon which I concluded that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> as well as the <hi>Authour</hi> of the 35th <hi>Sermon</hi> de Sanctis <hi>did either not know, or not regard</hi> Gregory <hi>of</hi> Tours. Againſt this plain and full anſwer you have made <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral objections:</hi> firſt you ſay, <hi>no one could be ignorant of what</hi> Gregory <hi>of</hi> Tours <hi>had written in the ſixth Age;</hi> This is, Sir, affirming without proving; and though a contrary affirmation is ſufficient againſt ſuch a proof, yet I gave you there not onely the <hi>Inſtance</hi> of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> of <hi>this Sermon,</hi> which I can certainly prove to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much after <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time, but the <hi>Inſtance</hi> of St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> I will add but <hi>one</hi> more to them, which I queſtion not will ſatisfie all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil</hi> lived in the beginning of the <hi>ſeventh Century,</hi> and is allowed by all to have lived at the beginning of <hi>it,</hi> and to have been not onely near <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tour</hi>'s time, but near his <hi>Countrey,</hi> and therefore to have had the beſt opportunities of knowing this <hi>famous Hiſtory,</hi> you ſo much inſiſt on: and yet theſe are his words at the end of his account of the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>no Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry informs us particulary that</hi> Mary <hi>ſuffered Martyrdom by the Sword, nor is her Death</hi> ANY WHERE READ <hi>of, nor her Burial</hi>

               <hi>to be found any where.</hi> As this Inſtance ſhews that <hi>Iſidore</hi> was ignorant of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tour</hi>'s writing [and therefore no wonder that <hi>others</hi> were, who lived farther from his time,] ſo it holds as ſtrong againſt the forged <hi>Melito</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom:</hi> and ſhews that <hi>Iſidore</hi> was equally ignorant of <hi>them all,</hi> or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>them</hi> as ſo <hi>very fabulous</hi> and <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> that not <hi>one</hi> of <hi>them</hi> did deſerve the name of an <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63877:7"/>
what was written was not true, <hi>is a very great miſrepreſentation of my words: I did inſiſt there upon</hi> Fulbertus<hi>'s</hi> not knowing, <hi>as well as</hi> not regarding <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours.

               </hi> that there were <hi>ſeveral Iſidores</hi> before St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and that the <hi>Iſidore</hi> quoted here in the 35<hi>th</hi> Sermon muſt be <hi>one</hi> of <hi>them:</hi> to which I anſwered, that <hi>though there were never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Iſidores <hi>before St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>yet can you, or dare you offer to ſhew that any of them were Writers?</hi> All the Anſwer you give in your <hi>Reply</hi> to this is, that <hi>it is childiſh.</hi> But is it, Sir, really ſo? the <hi>Iſidore</hi> quoted was a <hi>Writer;</hi> I demanded of you to ſhew that any <hi>Iſidore</hi> before St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was a <hi>Writer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I do not wonder at your being diſordered
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63877:7"/>
at this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> though all the World cannot but ſee how very fair and reaſonable: but the miſchief is, neither St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> nor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> make mention of any ſuch a <hi>Writer</hi> before St. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> and therefore it was the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>beſt</hi> anſwer that could be given to ſay <hi>mine</hi> was <hi>childiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I might drive you from ſo weak a pretence, I told you that <hi>we are certain that the</hi> Iſidore <hi>quoted in the Sermon is He that lived in the Seventh Century; and that if you did look into the</hi> Louvain <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when you wrote your Letter to the Peer, you could not have miſs'd ſeeing what Book of his the Paſſage is taken from.</hi> Your Reply to this is very ſhort, you ſay <hi>it was anſwered in your firſt Letter;</hi> what? anſwered before it was objected, I ſaid not a ſyllable in my <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,</hi> nor you in <hi>your Letter</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> about what <hi>Book</hi> of St. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> this paſſage is taken from, or that the <hi>Book</hi> was mentioned in, and might be ſeen in the <hi>Louvain Edition;</hi> and yet you tell me that <hi>you</hi> have anſwered this in <hi>that Letter.</hi> But I eaſily ſee what it is that you mean by the <hi>Anſwer;</hi> it is, I ſuppoſe, that which you next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on in the <hi>Reply, that the citation of</hi> Iſidore <hi>could not be made out to be taken out of the Book cited by the</hi> Louvain <hi>Divines, the doubt there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed being obvious, having been made</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note>
               <hi>before St.</hi> Auſtin<hi>'s time by St.</hi> Epiphanius. I would fain know, Sir, what we muſt gather hence, is it, that becauſe the doubt was made by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> before St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s time, therefore it was not made by <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who lived ſo long after St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s time: or is it becauſe the doubt was made then by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> therefore <hi>it</hi> could not be made by <hi>Iſidore</hi> afterwards. Either I ſee no <hi>Logick,</hi> or no <hi>ſenſe</hi> here; and certainly, Sir, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconſiſtent, nor impoſſible, nor improbable that <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſhould in the <hi>ſeventh Century</hi> make ſuch a doubt about the words of <hi>Simeon,</hi> as St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had made in the <hi>fourth.</hi> But all this illogical flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering is to no purpoſe, our debate is not about the <hi>doubt</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>paſſage,</hi> but <hi>whence</hi> the <hi>paſſage</hi> it ſelf is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; out of <hi>what Authour,</hi> and out of <hi>what Book</hi> the words in the 35<hi>th</hi> Sermon <hi>de Sanctis</hi> are borrowed; and here, that I might put an end to the Excurſions about things of no moment to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and fix you, I did refer you to the <hi>Book, Chapter</hi> and <hi>Page</hi> in <hi>Iſidore</hi> out of which <hi>the paſſage</hi> in the <hi>Sermon</hi> is taken. But to this I find not a ſyllable of anſwer made, nor the leaſt notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it; ſo that I ſhould have ſuſpected that your <hi>half hour</hi> had been out, which you were <hi>willing</hi>

            <p>I can ſee no place left now for Cavil, but this one, That the Words here put down are not exactly the ſame in the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and in the Book: But ſuch a Cavil will neither be offered at, nor admitted by any Perſon of Learning, ſince every learned Man knows that it is the frequent practice of thoſe who cite other Mens Works, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to keep exactly to the words of the Authour cited, ſometimes to contract them, and ſometimes to give onely the Senſe of them: The <hi>Authour</hi> of this <hi>Sermon</hi> is an inſtance of this laſt Method, who tho' he hath contracted and partly changed the Words of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> yet he hath given us the Senſe of them; which no body can deny to be that ſet down in the <hi>Sermon, That it is uncertain whether by the Sword</hi> which <hi>Simeon ſaid ſhould pierce through the Virgin</hi> Mary<hi>'s Soul, is meant the Sword of the Spirit, or the Sword of Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope Sir, that after ſuch invincible evidence againſt the <hi>Sermon's</hi> being St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, you will at laſt forſake your wilfull miſtake; if ſuch Arguments cannot perſwade you, it muſt be becauſe you are reſolved not to be perſwaded herein. I muſt, before I end this, take notice of your <hi>laſt Charge</hi> againſt me of <hi>impoſing upon unthinking Readers when I repreſent that your Aſſertion was falſe,</hi> when <hi>you</hi> ſaid that the <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Louvain did aſſert to</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the 18th. <hi>Sermon de Sanctis.</hi> I do own my words there, and ſince you will force me, I do affirm it a ſecond time that <hi>Your Aſſertion</hi> is <hi>falſe:</hi> and my far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon for it I will now give you here. The <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain</hi> in <hi>their Cenſura generalis</hi> [which you may find on the back of their <hi>Title page</hi> to the <hi>Tenth Tome</hi> of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Works] have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed all the <hi>Sermons</hi> of <hi>that Volume</hi> into <hi>three ſorts:</hi> in the firſt ſort they reckon <hi>thoſe Sermons</hi> which did certainly appear to be St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, and <hi>them</hi> they put in the <hi>Volume</hi> with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>them.</hi> They next reckon <hi>thoſe Sermons</hi> which are certainly not his, theſe Sermons they caſt into the <hi>Appendix</hi> as ſpurious: their third ſort are <hi>thoſe</hi> which are doubtfull, which they leave in the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,</hi> but without St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s name to <hi>them</hi> to diſtiuguiſh <hi>them</hi> from the <hi>certain ones.</hi> With this information therefore <hi>we</hi> will look for the 18<hi>th. Sermon,</hi> we find it indeed in the <hi>Volume,</hi> but without St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s <hi>name to it;</hi> ſo that it is certain from this very <hi>Circumſtance</hi> that the <hi>Louvain Divines</hi> looked upon it as <hi>dubioas,</hi> and therefore did not prefix St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s name to <hi>it,</hi> but put that <hi>note</hi> before <hi>it</hi> which I mentioned: I need add no more to ſo plain a proof; as to your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering me <hi>Natalis Alexandre</hi>'s Opinion, I have here proved that if <hi>he</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63877:9"/>
did aſſert the <hi>ſame thing, he</hi> was then as much miſtaken as <hi>you.</hi> But pray, Sir, how come you to urge me with <hi>N.

            </p>
            <p>You are ſo angry at parting that I cannot but take notice of it; and therefore will be carefull to avoid a thing ſo indecent. If I have but given you hard Arguments for your hard Words, I have gained my Deſign. I am,</p>
