            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>IN <hi>Nottingham</hi> there lives a jolly Tanner,</l>
            <l>with a hey down down a down down,</l>
            <l>his name is <hi>Arthur a Bland,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>There is ne're a Squire in <hi>Nottingham-shire,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>dare bid bold <hi>Arthur</hi> to stand.</l>
            <l>With a long Pike-staff upon his shoulder,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>so well he can clear his way,</l>
            <l>By two and by thrée he makes them to flée,</l>
            <l>for he hath no list to stay.</l>
            <l>As he went forth on a Summers morning,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>in the Forrest of merry <hi>Sherwood,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To view the red Déer that range here and there,</l>
            <l>there met he with bold <hi>Robin Hood.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As soon as bold <hi>Robin</hi> he did him espy,</l>

               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c</hi>
            </l>
            <l>he thought some sport he would make,</l>
            <l>Therefore out of hand he bid him to stand,</l>
            <l>and thus to him he did speak.</l>
            <l>Why, what art thou, thou bold fellow,</l>
            <l>with a hey, &amp;c.</l>
            <l>that ranges so boldly here,</l>
            <l>Insooth to be brief, thou look'st like a Thief,</l>
            <l>that comes to steal the Kings Deer.</l>
            <l>If thou béest a Kéeper in this Forrest,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>the King puts me in trust,</l>
            <l>To look to his Déer that range here and there,</l>
            <l>therefore stay thee I must,</l>

            </l>
            <l>and hast such a great command,</l>
            <l>Then thou must have more partakers in store,</l>
            <l>before thou mak'st me to stand.</l>
            <l>Nay, I have no more partakers in store,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>nor any that I do need.</l>
            <l>But I have a Staff of another Oak-graff,</l>
            <l>I know it will do the deed:</l>
            <l>For thy sword &amp; thy bow I care not a straw,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>nor all thy Arrows to boot,</l>
            <l>If thou get a knock upon the bare scop,</l>
            <l>thou canst as well shite as shoot,</l>
            <l>Speak cleanly, speak cleanly, said jolly <hi>Robin,</hi>

               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>and give better terms to me.</l>
            <l>Else I'le thee correct for thy neglect,</l>
            <l>and make thee more mannerly.</l>
            <l>Marry gip with a winnion, qd. <hi>Arthur a Bland,</hi>

            <l>art thou such a goodly man?</l>
            <l>I care not a fig for thy looking so big,</l>
            <l>mend thou thy self where thou can.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Robin Hood</hi> he unbuckled his belt,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey, &amp;c.</hi>
            </l>

            <l>For I have a staff of another Oak-graff,</l>
            <l>not half a foot longer than thine.</l>
            <l>But let me measure, said jolly <hi>Robin,</hi>

            </l>
            <l>before we begin our fray,</l>

            <l>my staff is of Oak so free,</l>
            <l>Eight foot and a half, it will knock down a Calf,</l>

            <l>the blood came trickling down.</l>

               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>as soon as he saw his own blood,</l>

            <l>as though he had been stacking of wood.</l>
            <l>And about, and about, and about they went,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>

            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>&amp; live in the green woods with me,</l>
            <l>My name is <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> I swear by the wood,</l>
            <l>I will give thee both gold and fee:</l>
            <l>If thou be <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> bold <hi>Arthur</hi> reply'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>as I think well thou art,</l>
            <l>Then here's my hand, my name's <hi>Arthur Bland</hi>
            </l>
            <l>we two will never part.</l>
            <l>But tell me, O tell me, where is little <hi>John</hi>?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>of him fain would I hear,</l>
            <l>For we are Ally'd by the Mothers side,</l>
            <l>and he is my Kinsman near.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Robin Hood</hi> blew on his bugle horn,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>he blew both loud and shrill,</l>
            <l>And quickly anon, appear'd little <hi>John,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>come tripping over the Hill.</l>
            <l>O what is the matter, then said little <hi>John,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>Master I pray you me tell,</l>
            <l>Why do you stand with your staff in your hand,</l>
            <l>I fear all is not well,</l>
            <l>O man I do stand, and he makes me to stand,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>the Tanner that stands thee beside,</l>
            <l>He is a bonny blade, and master of his trade,</l>
            <l>for soundly he hath tann'd my hide,</l>
            <l>He is to be commended, then said little <hi>John,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>if such a feat he can do.</l>
            <l>If he be so stout, we will have a bout,</l>
            <l>and he shall tan my hide too.</l>
            <l>Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said <hi>Robin Hood</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>for as I do understand,</l>
            <l>He is a Yeoman good, and of thy own blood,</l>
            <l>for his name is <hi>Arthur a Bland.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then little <hi>John</hi> threw his staff away,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>and as far as he could it sling,</l>
            <l>And ran out of hand to <hi>Arthur a Bland,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>and about his neck did cling.</l>
            <l>With loving respect there was no neglect,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>they was neither nice nor coy,</l>
            <l>Each other <hi>did</hi> face with a lovely grace,</l>
            <l>&amp; both <hi>did</hi> weep for joy.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Robin Hood</hi> took them both by the hand,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>&amp; Danc't about the Oak-tree,</l>
            <l>For three merry men, and three merry men,</l>
            <l>and three merry men we be.</l>
            <l>And ever hereafter as long as we live,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>with a hey,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            <l>we three will be all as one,</l>
            <l>The wood shall ring, and the old wife sing,</l>
            <l>of <hi>Robin Hood, Arthur</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
