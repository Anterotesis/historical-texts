         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He induſtrious policy, or rather poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
induſtry of the Roman Clergie,
for advancing their cauſe, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Papiſticall Hierarchy, is as
much (if not more commendable)
then was that of the injuſt Steward,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 8. did it not croſſe the word,
or Law of God, (which is the rule of righteouſneſſe) and
breake the bond of charity, which is the complement and
perfection of that Law. For what pains doe they not take?
How doe they ſtretch their wits? What Countries peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
or worthy to be knowne or inhabited, have they not
peragrated? to accompliſh their deſignes, and zealous (if
I may ſo call them) devotions.</p>
            <p>So that if their cauſe were good, and their laborious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to manage that cauſe guided by a good Spirit, or
ſquared to the rule of Juſtice, they ſhould certainly be no
leſſe then that which they call themſelves and pretend to
be, (namely) The onely true Catholike Church of Chriſt,
that Royall Prieſthood, and choſen Generation mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But true wiſedome (which is from above) is onely ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by her children, who doe judge and eſtimate things,
(eſpecially in matters of Religion and Divine worſhip)
not as men value them, but as God eſteemeth them, For
God ſeeth not as men ſee; man oftentimes (by reaſon of
the corruption of his heart, weakeneſſe of judgement, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97625:4"/>
of will, and imperfection of knowledge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding)
may both deceive &amp; be deceived; but ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
God, who being all eye, eſtimateth and knoweth all
things perfectly, and eſſentially, (as they are) as having
within himſelfe the expreſſe and true paterne and Ideas of
all things that ever have beene, are, or ſhall be.</p>
            <p>That therefore men, (I meane onely Chriſtian men who
are within the Pale. of Gods Church) may be the better
ſetled and perſuaded in the truth of that Religion which
they doe profeſſe. It will be moſt neceſſary and profitable
for them, to take ſpeciall notice of ſome markes and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
whereby the true and orthodoxe Religion or
Church of Chriſt may be diſtinguiſhed and diſcerned
from all falſe, Antichriſtian, phanaticall, inventions, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
enthuſiaſmes, and in a word, from all hereticall,
pragmaticall, ſchiſmaticall or diabolicall opinions, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
doctrines and profeſſions in the world: which
for brevities ſake, and that I may ſooner come to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſcope, I will onely at this time name, leaving the
more large explication of them unto ſome other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.</p>
            <p>1 The firſt is the purity, or rather (as I may ſay) the
ſpirituality of a Religion, as it is cleanſed from the droſſe
of externall ceremonies and exorbitant ſuperſtitions, for
Almighty God loveth beſt that Religion or manner of his
worſhip, which is moſt like himſelfe, and agreeable to his
word, who being a Spirit, will be worſhipped in Spirit
and truth, the more therefore that a Religion hath of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and gaudy Pompes and Ceremonies (to dazle and
delude the fancies, eyes, and affections of the ingorant and
ſimple) it is the farther from the nature of God, the more
contrary to his will, it hath more droſſe, and is the more
to be ſuſpected of falſhood, and to be Antichriſtian and
idolatrous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97625:4"/>
2 Secondly, the more that the grounds, doctrine, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
&amp; tenets of a Religion, are adverſe or to do croſſe
the corruption of nature, the impurity of mans life and
manners, the fulfilling and executing of a mans own exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
luſts and deſires, I ſay, that that Religion is the more
like to be orthodoxe and ſound, my reaſon is, becauſe
God (being of pure eyes, with whom dwelleth no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
is a God of order, both inwardly in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and outwardly, in reſpect of his creatures; inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in reſpect of himſelfe, there is a prioritie of order of
the Father before the Sonne, of the Sonne before the Holy-Ghoſt;
outwardly, and in reſpect of the creatures, God
made all things in order and meaſure, yea in ſuch order and
meaſure, that each creature keepeth its owne courſe and
ſtation, (I ſpeake not in regard of corrupted, but created
nature) for the mutuall comfort and conſervation one of
another: the more then that we croſſe order and meaſure,
the more I ſay that wee are exceſſive and exorbitant in our
affections and actions (eſpecially in matters &amp; exerciſes of
Religion and Divine worſhip) the greater cauſe have we
to ſuſpect our ſelves, and that Religion which we profeſſe,
or which teacheth or warranteth us ſo to doe; for what is
ſinne, but an obliquity in our affections and actions, and
what is holineſſe, or true Religion? but a conformity and
rectitude of both theſe being ſutable to Gods revealed will,
which is the rule of righteouſneſſe, that Religion therefore,
whoſe doctrine teacheth us moſt conformitie and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in our affections and actions to Gods word, muſt
of neceſſity be a true and ſound Religion: this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>3 A third marke of true Religion is, when the doctrins, &amp;
practice thereof doe tend more to the advancement of the
honour and glory of Chriſt then our owne worldly or
private profit and advantage, and when they doe affect us
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97625:5"/>
with a ſenſe &amp; feeling of our owne wants and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſo that we are ready to ſay (not with the Phariſee,
I am not like this man, I have done thus and thus) nor
with the Papiſt, I have performed this worke of condigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that of congruity, a third of ſupererogation, by the
working or doing whereof, I have deſerved eternall life,
both for my ſelfe and others) but rather confeſſe with the
Apoſtle, <hi>Non ſunt condignae,</hi> theſe our momentary ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
are not worthy of that glory that ſhall be revealed,
and with that good Martyr, onely Chriſt, onely Chriſt,
or with that worthy Father, <hi>Meritum meum miſerationes
Domini,</hi> onely the Lords mercies are my chiefeſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly, that is ſurely a ſound and warrantable
Religion, wherein moſt comfort is afforded and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to a diſtreſſed and perplexed conſcience, through the
aſſured confidence of Gods love in our owne Election,
eſpecially at the approach of death. For (whereas ſome
falſe and pretended Religions, for ſiniſtrous and bad ends,
teach, that it is great and damnable preſumption, to
beleeve or be certainely perſwaded, that God hath elected
us to ſalvation, or that wee can have in this life any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
feeling of Gods love in the pardon of our ſinnes;
True and pure Religion exhorteth us with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to
give diligence to make our owne calling and election ſure,
&amp; no wayes to doubt, but to beleeve, (for he th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t doubteth
beleeveth not, and maketh God a lyar) to beleeve I ſay, and
be perſwaded with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that nothing can ſeparate us
from his love, but that Chriſt ſhall bee both in life and
death our advantage.</p>
            <p>5 I could alſo mention a fifth marke of true Religion,
which is this, namely when the principles and doctrines
thereof doe not onely teach, but move the profeſſors
thereof (although, in reſpect of perſons innumerable, yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97625:5"/>

Now amongſt the reſt, and a little before the deceaſe of
the Illuſtrious Prince Duke <hi>Chriſtopher Radzivil,</hi> of moſt
honorable and bleſſed memory, who departed this life in

was moſt magnificently buryed at <hi>Vizounka</hi> twenty miles
diſtant from the aforeſaid Citty, in the great Dukedome
of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> upon the twelfth of February laſt, whereof
the Authour was an eye-witneſſe; a little I ſay before his
departure, there was alſo within the aforeſaid Citty, a faire,
ſpacious, and ſtrong Church which belonged to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
whom they call <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and whoſe Church by
the Romaniſts is termed in deriſion by the name of <hi>Zbor,</hi>
or Congregation, whereunto alſo is adjoyned a Dutch
Church, both built of freeſtone, and environed with a
high, ſtrong and thick ſtone-wall, guarded alſo with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of Musketiers and Souldiers, whom the aforeſaid
Prince continually kept in pay for the ſafety of the ſaid
Churches and Profeſſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe two Churches were ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
within the heart as it were, or middle of the Citty,
and were inveſted with many priviledges and liberties, as
any Papiſt Church in <hi>Poland,</hi> which were alſo eſtabliſhed
and confirmed by many Kings and Parliaments ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
unto theſe two Churches, (the one Poliſh, and the
other Dutch) belonged three Miniſters, the two Poliſh
Miniſters were, Maſter <hi>Balthazar Labenski,</hi> and Maſter
<hi>Yeurski,</hi> the Dutch Miniſter Maſter <hi>Andreas,</hi> who were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by <hi>George Hartibius,</hi> Rector of the Proteſtant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
a man of ſound learning, and unſpotted converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as appeareth by the teſtimony of his very adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
given unto him in divers places.</p>
            <p>But becauſe theſe Churches and Miniſters, being ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as is ſaid, and the Miniſters were in great repute, and
much frequented by Proteſtant Noblemen and Gentlemen,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97625:7"/>
who reſorted unto their Sermons in great Aſſemblies, from
all places of the Country, they could not chuſe but be a great
eye-ſore unto their neighbours the Jeſuits, Prieſts, &amp; Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
whoſe Churches, Cloiſters, Monaſteries &amp; Colledges,
were contiguous, and did incompaſſe them on every ſide.</p>
            <p>Behold therefore what helliſh tricks and ſtratagems,
theſe Jeſuits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Popiſh Prieſts and Schollars uſed for the
aboliſhing of theſe Churches, and utter ſuppreſſing the
exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion, and Colledge within
the aforeſaid Citty.</p>
            <p>Upon the fifth of October 1639. a certaine Poliſh
Gentleman named <hi>Paul Piekarski,</hi> with his ſervant <hi>Ioſeph
Rakouski,</hi> being at gueſt in the houſe of one <hi>Naborowuski,</hi>
cloſe adjoyning to the Proteſtant Church, about three
of the clocke in the afternoone (amongſt other paſſages
and exerciſes of mirth and jollity) did ſhoot ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
at a bird or fowle, which they perceived to be upon
the top of the ſteeple of the Proteſtant Church, two of
which Arrowes, (there blowing then much wind) were
driven to a Popiſh Church neere joyning, called Saint
<hi>Michaels,</hi> and lighting at the weſt end thereof, ſtucke into
the leg of the woodden image of an Angell. Now within the
Church-yard of this Church, was and is a great Monaſtery
of Franciſcans, ſome whereof iſſuing out of their Cloiſter,
perceived theſe Arrowes ſticking in the leg of the image,
which being ſo neere the Proteſtant Church, and they alſo
ſo deſirous to pick a quarrell againſt the Proteſtants, did
ſtraight-way conceive and affirme, that theſe Arrowes
were ſhot out of the Proteſtant Church by the Evangelick
Miniſters, or by their appointment, and approbation in
deſpight and contempt of their Romiſh Religion.</p>
            <p>The Friars acquainted the Jeſuites and Prieſts therewith,
who burning with malice againſt the Proteſtants, and daily
ſeeking ſome occaſion to doe them miſchiefe, gave order
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97625:8"/>
to their Schollars and Students, to fall upon theſe hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Churches, pull them down to the ground, and (if they
could) apprehend, or kill these Calviniſt Miniſters, whom
they would needs have to be the authors of that riot; to the
performance wherof, theſe devote and well diſciplined
Schollars were not ſlacke, but ſtraightwayes iſſued out of
their Schooles and Colledges like a hive of Bees aſſiſted
and accompanied with ſome thouſands of Prieſts, Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Serving men who in great furie addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto the aforeſaid Churches, with ladders, ſhovels,
mattoks, and other inſtruments, beginning to undermine
the wall, and uncover the roof of the Proteſtant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>But there being at that inſtant (through Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
many Proteſtant Noble-men, and Gentlemen with
their ſervants, preſent at the Chriſtning of one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
children, there being alſo a Garriſon of Souldiers,
which the aforeſaid Duke kept continually in pay for the
ſafeguard of his Churches, the Souldiers and ſervants let
flie a volly or two of ſhot amongſt them, ſeeing they
could not by any faire meanes be removed; this confuſed
Army being hereby terrified, was preſently disbanded;
and perceiving they could not accompliſh their deſignes
againſt the Proteſtant Churches, like theeves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
more then like Chriſtians and Schollars, being led
by the Devill their Patron, they betooke themſelves to
the ſhops and houſes of the Scots, French, and Dutch
Merchants there inhabiting, who for the greateſt part are
Proteſtants, breaking open their doores, Truncks, and
Cupbords, but eſpecially the houſe &amp; ſhop of one <hi>Iacob de
Seans,</hi> a French Merchant and Elder of the Proteſtants
Church, from whom they tooke above thirty thouſand
Florens in goods and money.</p>
            <p>The day following, Duke <hi>Radzivil</hi> came to Towne,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97625:8"/>
who being for the time <hi>Viovode</hi> or Governour of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and being alſo well informed in the buſineſſe, did firſt
ſend for, and examine theſe two Gentlemen formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that had ſhot the Arrowes; who ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
in the Tribunall before the Judges, that they did
ſhoot theſe Arrowes, but not from the Proteſtant Church,
but from the houſe of one <hi>Naborouski</hi> where they were at
gueſt, nor did they ſhoot them at the Popiſh Church, nor
in deſpight of the Romiſh Religion, but at a bird or fowle,
which was upon the top of the Proteſtant Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
contrary to their expectation, they were driven
by the wind, as is aforeſaid, whereupon they were ready
to depoſe their oath; yet did they hereupon order theſe
two Gentlemen to be committed cloſe priſoners, but the
one of them <hi>viz.</hi> Maſter <hi>Piekarski,</hi> eſcaped and fled into
the Countrie.</p>
            <p>Then did Duke <hi>Radzivil</hi> deale with the Biſhop and the
Jeſuites, to keepe in and repreſſe their Schollars, leaſt they
ſhould breake foorth into ſome further outrage againſt the
Proteſtants, this he obtained with much adoe, and letters
Patents affixed on all the gates and publick places of the
Citty to this purpoſe.</p>

his majeſtie to know the true information and ſtate of the
buſineſſe, the Papiſt Biſhop againe (whoſe name was <hi>Abrah
Voyna</hi> or <hi>Warre)</hi> is very ſutable to his nature, exaſperating
his Majeſtie by many untruths, reproachfull ſpeeches and
blaſphemies, which he ſurmiſed againſt the Proteſtants,
but eſpecially their Miniſters, (onely to put them out of
the favour of the King and fellow-ſubjects) alledging,
though moſt impudently and falſely, that a little before
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97625:9"/>
the fact of the premiſſes, <hi>viz,</hi> the ſhooting of the Arrowes,

drawne the Crucifixe or picture of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
crucified, by the feet through the ſtreets, as alſo the
Image of the bleſſed Virgin, ſpitting upon and dawbing
them with dirt and mire, thinking thereby to diſgrace the

            <p>But the Kings Majeſtie, ſuſpecting herby the malice of his

greater credit unto the Duke <hi>Radzivils</hi> information,
and deferred the buſineſſe to the next Parliament, which
was held at <hi>Warſovia.</hi> In the moneth of June following, in

the aforeſaid Citty, to the Jeſuites, Prieſts, Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Colledges there, giving them ſome private checks
for their unjuſt proceedings, and promiſing unto them
the continuance of his Royall favour, and an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their immunities &amp; priviledges, if they would but

thinke it high time to muſter up all their forces, and ſtrain

            <p>Thus Engliſhed.
<q>The Kings ſacred Majeſtie, in the declaration of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
doth command &amp; charge, that theſe perſons that ſhall
be convicted by the Nuns, be liable to the puniſhment of
the Law, which every Magiſtrate whom it doth concerne,
preſently after their conviction, ſhall execute under paine
of contempt. And for as much as the ſcituation of the
Proteſtant Church, (being amongſt the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
Churches) hath given occaſion, not onely of this,
but alſo of many former ryots, and likewiſe the Kings
Majeſty is by his Royall oath obliged to prevent, &amp; cut off
all occaſions, that may either diſturbe, or breake the peace
of his ſubject in point of Religion; His Majeſtie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by vertue of this Decree, doth altogether prohibite
and aboliſh all kind of exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion,
as well private as publicke, from that place for ever; as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97625:11"/>
alſo the names <hi>Zbor,</hi> or Congregation, their Schooles
likewiſe and Alme-houſes, changing the yards and buildings
thereof into dwelling houſes or private ground, reſerving
the poſſeſſion thereof, to ſuch to whom they doe lawfully
appertaine; and this ſhall be performed within ſix weekes
after the conviction, under paine of infamy, nor ſhall the
aforeſaid Proteſtants (under the aforeſaid penalty) ever
have or ſtirre up exerciſe or uſe of their Religion,
Schoole, or Hoſpitall within the walls of the Regall Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Wilde,</hi> ſtrangers and Travellers excepted, that are
confederate with us; howſoever they ſhall have toleration
and licence (in reſpect of the league aforeſaid) and no
otherwiſe, to have the exerciſes of their Religion in their
buriall place, for the further ratification whereof this
preſent Decree is given under the Seale of the Great Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> Dated in the Parliament at <hi>VVarſo,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Decree of his Majeſtie was ſeconded by an oath
which ſeven Nunnes, (ſuborned by the aforeſaid Biſhop
and Jeſuites) made at the <hi>Wilde</hi> 21 July 1640.</p>
            <q>We <hi>A. B. C. D, &amp;c.</hi> Doe ſweare by the holy Trinity,
that by the knowledge or approbation of the Proteſtant
Miniſters and gueſts, dwelling with them, arrowes were
ſhot out of a Bow from the Proteſtant Church, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and contempt of the Roman Catholicke Church,
but eſpecially by one <hi>Iohn Yeurski,</hi> who at that time had a
child chriſtned, alſo by <hi>Balthaſar Labenski,</hi> the eldeſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of that Congregation, and <hi>George Hartlibius</hi> Rector
of their Colledge who all (dwelling within the walls of the
aforeſaid Church) doe better know, and can tell the names
of the other delinquents, but that this our oath, which we
take againſt theſe men, as the principall authors of that
fact is true and lawfull, ſo helpe us God and his holy
Evangell.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97625:12"/>
Now by the way, and before I goe any further, let me
beſeech the Reader to obſerve a wonderfull expreſſion of
Gods Juſtice, for within ſome few houres after this oath
was taken, one of theſe perjured Nunnes was ſuddenly
ſtroken with death, and fell downe dead before ſhe could
recover her owne Cloiſter.</p>
            <p>And that this oath which theſe Nunnes tooke, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
falſe, doth appeare evidently by the contrary
oath of the two above named Gentlemen, <hi>Paul Piekarski,</hi>
and <hi>Ioſeph Rakowski,</hi> who not long after, in the City of
<hi>Novogard,</hi> ſwore before the whole Tribunall or Bench,
that they and none other were the men that ſhot theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
and that the Proteſtant Miniſters were cleare of
that fact; neither knew any thing thereof, nor were they
ſhot from their Church, but from the dwelling houſe of one
<hi>Naborowski,</hi> nor did they any wayes ayme at the Papiſt
Church to diſgrace that Religion, but in ſport and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they ſhot at a bird which was upon the top of the
Proteſtant Church, although (contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
their Arrowes were driven aſide by the wind: yet
behold, good Reader, what a great fire a ſmall ſparkle kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth,
what a great miſchiefe did inſue upon ſo ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;
For that nothing might bee wanting to expreſſe
the fury and malice of the Romiſh Prelate of the <hi>VVild</hi> and
Jeſuites, againſt their innocent and harmeleſſe brethren,
(Although they knew their cauſe to be unjuſt, and the
oath which the Nunnes had taken to be falſe, yet did they
proceed to irritate and exaſperate the Judges to execute
the Sentence, according to the former Decree, which in
the moneth of Aprill 1641. followed in this manner,
viz.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That for as much as the parties convicted, were not
only guilty of the aforeſaid ryot as turbule<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t perſons, and
breakers of the peace of the Kingdome, but alſo by their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97625:12"/>
hereticall preaching, diſputations and conferences, did
ſeduce and draw away many from the Catholicke faith,
that therefore they eſteemed them guilty of death, yea
more worthy of puniſhment, then the moſt wicked male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>
               <p>It is therefore ſentenced by this honorable Bench, that
the delinquents ſhall be taken to the market place of the
City of <hi>Vilna,</hi> the City where the fact was committed,
and there be executed publickly as Traitors to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
and troublers of the publicke peace (the manner of
their death to be left to his Majeſties pleaſure) their lands
and goods to be confiſcated to the uſe of his Majeſtie or
Aſſignes.</p>
               <p>Item, that the exerciſes of the Proteſtant Religion, ſhall
altogether ceaſe and be ſuppreſſed within the walls of the
Royall Citty of <hi>Vilna,</hi> and that the Churches where theſe
exerciſes were had, ſhall bee converted altogether into
dwelling houſes, or to ſome other civill uſe, and that upon
no pretext or cauſe whatſoever, there ſhall be preaching in
that place, or any where elſe within the ſaid Gity, under
the penalties formerly mentioned.</p>

            <p>The Illuſtrious Duke <hi>Radzivil,</hi> perceiving the injuſtice,
malice, and cruelty of theſe Romaniſts, and condoling the
eſtate of his diſtreſſed ſervants and Miniſters, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the publication of the Sentence, about midnight, ſent
for them to his Palace, where after ſome houres private
conference, he wrote letters commendatory to the Duke
of <hi>Pruſia,</hi> and having furniſhed them with money, and a
guard of a hundred Tartarian horſemen, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the Town of <hi>Keydan;</hi> from whence within 2 or 3
dayes after they departed to the <hi>Tilz,</hi> from thence to the
firſt great Caſtle &amp; Town in <hi>Pruſia,</hi> belonging to the Duke
of <hi>Pruſia,</hi> from whence ſhortly after the death of the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
old Duke <hi>Radzivil,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brandeburgh,</hi> this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97625:13"/>
Duke of <hi>Pruſia</hi> his father, who both dyed in one moneth,
viz. in the moneth of Auguſt 1640; fearing further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
they were removed to the Towne of <hi>Memble,</hi> a
great ſtrength upon the Sea ſide under the Duke of <hi>Pruſia,</hi>
nor long after unto <hi>Konisberg,</hi> and at length unto <hi>Dantsk,</hi>
where they remaine unto this day, being baniſhed from
their places, Countries and families, without mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and ſeparated from all hope of future reliefe, unleſſe
the Lord worke it by the charitable care and affection of
their reformed brethren, as appeareth more fully, by that
moſt unjuſt Decree of proſcription, ſince publiſhed
againſt them, the coppy whereof ſhall God willing be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Neither can I omit in this Hiſtoricall Relation, that
barbarous cruelty of the Jeſuites Scollars in the <hi>Wilde,</hi> in
the day of the aforeſaid tumult, againſt that good man
Maſter <hi>George Hartlib</hi> Rector of the Proteſtant Colledge,
a man for learning, innocence and integrity, famous and
excellent, yea, the Popiſh Biſhop of the <hi>VVilde,</hi> his great
enemy, in a publicke meeting, did not onely acknowledge
his worthineſſe, but alſo with great griefe, (although it
was too late) condole his diſtreſſe more then any of the
others. Moreover one of theſe Jeſuites, travelling lately
through <hi>Dantsk</hi> into <hi>Germanie,</hi> did confeſſe, that hee was
innocent, and the reaſon why he was condemned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
ſince, was no otther, but that hee diſputed in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke
againſt the Popiſh Religion, and ſeduced the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry committed to his truſt; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they eſteemed him to be more worthy of puniſhment
then any malefactor. This good man, I ſay, walking
peaceably from the Proteſtant Colledge unto his owne
houſe, was by theſe Catholicke Chriſtian Schollars, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
as a thiefe, beaten with trees, buffered, and moſt
dangerouſly wounded with ſtones in foure or five places
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97625:13"/>
of the head: not contented with this, as if it had beene too
gentle a puniſhment, they threw him over a bridge into a
deep river, from whence (having once eſcape) they threw
him in againe, &amp; at laſt perceiving that hee had eſcaped the
ſecond time, and that they could not thereby take away
his life, they followeth him into a Bathſtove or hothouſe,
where ſome pittifull-hearted men and women, (although
Papiſts) commiſerating his condition, had ſheltered him,
and aſſaulted his life, and thoſe that tooke his part, with
moſt inhumane and diabolicall fury, but he being hidden
by a good old woman under a waſhing tub, continued
there untill midnight, and at laſt, taking upon him the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of that woman, by Gods providence he eſcaped their
outrage.</p>
            <p>Moreover (as if theſe things were too little to expreſſe
their inſolencies againſt the Evangelick Proteſtants) they
have proceeded further, and that by the ſame aforeſaid
meanes, namely by cavils, tricks of Law and perjury, to
aboliſh and take away all the Proteſtant or Evangelick
Churches, that were and are within the Kings Regall
Townes and chiefeſt Citties throughout the whole Realme
of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſuch as were the Church of <hi>Krakovia, Poſenania,
Looblene, Sendomerzee, Polocia, Bresta,</hi> all great and Regall
Townes and chiefeſt Citties of the Kingdome, beſides that
of the <hi>VVilde,</hi> formerly mentioned. So that now there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
no more Proteſtants Churches throughout the
whole Kingdome of <hi>Poland,</hi> except two in the Citty of
<hi>Dantsk,</hi> &amp; the Duke of <hi>Brandeburg</hi> Church in his <hi>Konisbergh,</hi>
called the <hi>Sole,</hi> &amp; ſo it may well indeed, for there is no more
in all the Citty of <hi>Konisbergh,</hi> and the Lutherians will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no more, but the Church of <hi>Vitepſia,</hi> the Church of
<hi>Minski,</hi> the Church of <hi>Novoguard</hi> and the Church of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyn,</hi>
all which alſo the Popiſh Jeſuites and Prieſts are daily
plodding to take away. So that unles it pleaſe the Lord to uſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97625:14"/>
ſome meanes to prevent their Jeſuiticall enterpriſes, the
whole number of Proteſtant Churches, and conſequently
the whole publicke exerciſe of our reformed Religion,
throughout the whole Kingdome of <hi>Poland</hi> within few
yeares, is like to be extirpated and extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>To conclude, of late and ſince the death of our Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Patron Duke <hi>Chriſtophe Radzivil</hi> formerly mentioned,
the pride and inſolency of Jeſuites and Papiſts is growne
to ſuch a heigth, that they ſpare not to perſecute and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
our Miniſters and Profeſſors in the open ſtreets, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
them with opprobrious ſpeeches, and ſometimes
with blowes, yea, often wounding them with gunnes, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
clubs or ſtones, as they lately did two of our Dukes
Miniſters in the <hi>Wilde,</hi> about the moneth of December
laſt (one whereof, a learned and Reverend Divine) Maſter
<hi>Iacobus,</hi> they afflicted with three ſeverall wounds, one in the
arme, another in the left cheeke, and a third on the backe
of the left hand, whereof I my ſelfe was an eye-witneſſe, ſo
that they are now forced to forſake their Miniſteriall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
and goe like Merchants or Souldiers, with coloured
clothes and weapons.</p>
            <p>The truth whereof, I my ſelfe have lately experienced,
having beene two ſeverall times in great danger of my life,
once, namely about the latter end of February laſt, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
peaceably in my ſled, from <hi>Keydan</hi> the place of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,
unto <hi>Rogola,</hi> which is foure Poliſh miles diſtant,
I was ſet upon in the high-way by a Poliſh Boyarne or
Gentleman, who asked me what Biſhop I ſerved under,
but becauſe <hi>I</hi> could not anſwer him in his owne language
ſo well as he expected, or perhaps, by my habit, ſurmiſed
me to be one of Duke <hi>Radzivils</hi> Miniſters, ſtroke at me
moſt deſperatly with his ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble or Poliſh ſword three or
foure ſeverall times, wounded me in the head, and had I not
warded two or three of his blowes, with a thick Cane,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97625:14"/>
which <hi>I</hi> then had in mine hand, and which he did almoſt
cut through, he had certainely bereft me of my life.</p>
            <p>Not long after, being in the Towne of <hi>Kowan</hi> ſix Poliſh
miles from <hi>Keydan,</hi> walking in the ſtreets about nine of
the clocke in the morning, going to buy ſome neceſſaries,
becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſaluted not the Crucifix, which was then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
by me in proceſſion, and encountred me unawares;
the Jeſuite Schollars accompanyed with two Capuſhine
Fryars fell upon me, and aſſaulted me ſo fiercely, firſt
with words, and then with blowes and ſtones, that <hi>I</hi>
was forced to make more then ordinary haſte to my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
            <p>Thus have <hi>I</hi> diſcharged my duty to my Illuſtrious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
diſcovered unto you the afflicted eſtate of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches under the Crowne of <hi>Poland,</hi> and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the world, the treacherous practices, malicious
tyrannie, unreconciliable hatred, unlimited and unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ambition of the Romiſh Prelats and their aſſociates
within the aforeſaid Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>I</hi> would not hereby abſolutely and totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the Romiſh Church (as it is a Church, and a part
or member, although a diſeaſed and rotten one) of the
true Catholicke Church of Chriſt, and as it beleeveth,
approveth and maintaineth with Chriſts Apoſtles and us,
many eſſentiall and Orthodoxe points of truth, both in
doctrine and diſcipline, agreeable to the word of God
and the analogy of f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith. Nor would <hi>I</hi> diſcourage too
much the modeſt and better ſort of Papiſts, who living in
ſimple ignorance, make innocencie and charity, the
touchſtone of their Religion. For I am very confident,
that he that cannot try the truth of his Religion by theſe
two, let him be Proteſtant or Papiſt, or of whatſoever
other Religion he will, all that he beleeveth, knoweth or
profeſſeth of that Religion cannot profit him to ſalvation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97625:15"/>
but is as founding braſſe, or a tinckling Cymball, becauſe
the faith or knowledge which he profeſſeth or pretendeth
to have, is meerely notionall and ſpeculative, reſiding
onely in the braine, and ſhewing it ſelfe onely by words
or outward poſture, but not inwardly affecting or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the heart, with a deſire to doe good, or frame our
actions according to our profeſſion. For that Religion
that muſt ſave us, muſt be a practicall Religion, that faith
that muſt juſtifie us before God, muſt be an effectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
faith, which worketh by love, and that knowledge
of God and of his Sonne Chriſt, that knowledge, I ſay,
of Religion, and Divine worſhip, which is true and able
to doe us good, and bring us to life eternall, muſt bee
ſuch a knowledge, ſaith <hi>Pet. Mart. Quia ita mutamur, ut
quae ſcimus, opere conemur exprimere, P. M. inloe. com,</hi> otherwiſe,
the better our Religion is, and the more that we know of
it, or are leaned in it, it will be the worſe for us, for <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
potenter torquebuntur,</hi> that ſwimming learning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which we have, will but aggravate our condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for according to our talent of knowledge, doth
God expect from us a correſpondent reckoning of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
whereas he doth not ſo to ſuch unto whom he hath
not ſhewed himſelfe ſo bountifull a Creditor.</p>
            <p>But firſt, I would hereby admoniſh and give notice unto
all the ſimpler and more ignorant ſort of Papiſts, who
either have beene lately ſeduced by theſe Romiſh impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
or have not as yet taken deepe footing, and are but
newly entred into that Antichriſtian Laborynth, that
they would in time, and before they paſſe too farre, retire
and withdraw themſelves, leaſt in the end, they provoke
the Lord to complaine of them as he did of thoſe in the
fourth <hi>Pſalme, O yee ſonnes of men, how long will you follow
after vanities and ſeeke after leaſings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I would hereby bewayle and condemne <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97625:15"/>
illam, &amp; ſupinam Pontificiorum ignorantiam,</hi> that moſt
groſſe, or rather wilfull and obſtinate ignorance of the
Roman Prelates and Church-men, who I am perſwaded
in my conſcience, beleeve in their hearts, know with their
underſtanding, diſcerne by their judgement, although they
will not confeſſe with their mouthes, moſt, if not all of
theſe, humane inventions, unneceſſary traditions, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
ſuperſtitions, falſe, cruell, treacherous and ungodly
practices, doctrines, devices and machinations, wherein
they differ from us, and from that truly antient, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
and Apoſtolike doctrine, profeſſed and beleeved in
the purer times of the Church, many hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever there was the leaſt mention of the Popes holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and by Gods grace, is continued, beleeved, and
maintained by us in this Angel-like Monarchy, I ſay, it
is not poſſible, but that they muſt needs know theſe things
which they teach, write, profeſſe, and maintaine, for the
grounds of their Religion, and maintaining, improving,
and advancing of their Hierarchy to be unjuſt, falſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
and hereticall, and blaſphemous: did they not
(by reaſon of that <hi>Regnum ignorantiae &amp; erroris)</hi> that is, of
that kingdome of ignorance that is amongſt them, ſhut
up the gates of truth, that is, of holy Scriptures, (which
is the rule and ground of truth) from themſelves and their
people. <hi>Haeretici Sacerdotes claudunt Ianuam veritatis,</hi> the
hereticall Prieſts ſhut the gates of truth, becauſe they know,
that if the truth were knowne, their Religion ſhould be
forſaken, and they caſt downe and debaſed from their
Pontificall dignity, into the meane condition of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
people, yea, I ſhould rather have ſaid, did not the
Prince of this world, which ruleth in the hearts of the
children of diſobedience ſhut their eyes that they ſhould
not ſee, ſtop their eares, that they cannot heare, harden
their hearts, that they ſhould not underſtand nor diſcerne
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97625:16"/>
the wayes of truth wherein they ſhould walke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no marvell, that God hath given them over, to
a reprobate ſenſe, to be like other Sectaries and heretiks,
obſtinate in their errors, to beleeve ſtrong deluſions, and
to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would hereby incourage my Brethren and
Country-men, whether in this Kingdome or elſe-where,
to ſtand firme and conſtant in the truth of their profeſſion,
and not to be moved and-ſhaken with every winde of
doctrine; nor by their Sects, Schiſmes, ſeparations, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and confuſed opinions or Aſſemblies, rend the
unſeamed Coat of their Redeemer, or thereby teare that
part of his myſticall body, which hee doth graciouſly
pleaſe to continue in this Kingdome, but to agree rather
in one conſent to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the
bond of peace to follow after peace with all men, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
yea to forbeare one another in love, and to follow
after the truth in love, with peaceable and loving affections,
not with hot and furious diſtempers, as ſome of us ſeeme
to doe, who thinke they cannot be religious enough, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they be enemies to peace, and that there can be no
better patterne of wholeſome doctrine, to hold faſt, keep,
and frame their faith by, then that which is of their owne
weaving. I tell you (good Brethren) this patterne of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which is maintained, and I hope ſhall be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in theſe Kingdomes, is good enough, yea ſo good, that
I know none in the world better (and I am ſure I have read,
heard, knowne and ſeene as much of the world, almoſt, as
any other of my Coate and calling within this Iland) yea,
I ſay, there is none ſo good, none ſo neare that patterne
which <hi>Paul</hi> commended to <hi>Timothie,</hi> therefore keep it faſt,
which you cannot doe unleſſe you love the truth and
peace. Say not one of you, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another I am of
<hi>Apollos,</hi> a third, I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> a fourth, I am of Chriſt:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97625:16"/>
Let me intreat you (for Chriſt his ſake) not to deceive
your ſelves, for Chriſt neither will not can be divided,
nor will he ever ſend his Spirit into you, to illuminate or
inſpire you with the truth, if hee ſee you inclined or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to ſchiſme or faction, for <hi>in malevolam animam non
introibit ſapientia,</hi> Heavenly wiſedome and truth, will not
enter into ſoules, that through fraction; contention,
ſchiſme, or ſeparation, are divided and diſſipated, <hi>Vna eſt
Columba mea,</hi> ſaith Chriſt of his Spouſe the Church,
My Dove is one, and as his Church is one, ſo is his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which once deſcended upon him in the likeneſſe of
a Dove, to teach all poſterities, that he will never ſend
his graces, but into dove-like ſoules, that is, into men
and women, that are of a dove-like, innocent, humble and
loving heart. Certainely that knowledge which they have
or profeſſe of Gods worſhip (that are otherwiſe) cannot
be true and good, it cannot I ſay, be true, unleſſe it make
them one with their brethren, as Chriſt is one with the
Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 20.</p>
            <p>Be not therefore divided, give not the Papiſts occaſion
to ſay, (as I have heard ſome of them lately ſay to my
ſelfe) The Proteſtants have ſo many Sects amongſt them,
that they know not what to embrace, nay ſaid one, there are
in this City (for the preſent) above ninety ſeverall Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
each one differing from another, nay each one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing,
excommunicating and ſeparating themſelves from
other. O let not this be heard in <hi>Gath,</hi> nor publiſhed
in the ſtreets of <hi>Askalon:</hi> For ſhame, for ſhame, give
not this occaſion to the adverſary, forſake not Chriſts
Spouſe for her blacke ſpots, nor his true Reformed
Church in this Land for her imperfections: what?
would you have a Church Militant, to be Triumphant?
or doe you dreame of, or ſeeke for a Church in this life
that hath no blemiſh? ſuch men as theſe had beſt buy

which (if wee will beleeve Poets) is altogether free from
ſtormes and tempeſts, ſure I am beneath the Moone, there
is no man, no Religion, no Church free from blemiſhes,
nor poſſibly can be. Seeing that of the Apoſtle is as true
of all the Church, as of one of the Church, here we ſee
darkely through a glaſſe, we know but in part, but then
we ſhall know as we are knowne; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Let us not
ſay, in matters of Religion, draw backwardly or contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes, that were bound together tayle
to tayle, for then can follow nothing but jars, contention,
combuſtion and tumultuous confuſion, but let us be rather
like the Cherubins, having our faces looking one towards
another, that is, let us all with one conſent and unity of
mind, eſpecially in matters of faith and Religion, joyne
together in love, opinion, judgement, and affection, to
embrace, beleeve, and practice ſuch a forme of doctrine,
diſcipline and government, as hath been ever ſince Chriſt,
or at the leaſt, in the purer times after Chriſt received and
followed in the Chriſtian Church, and as I hope (through
Gods goodneſſe and providence, ſhall ſhortly be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in this Kingdome, by the religious care and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of our King and Parliament; which I am perſwaded
will be no other then ſuch as ſhall be moſt pleasing unto
God, juſtifiable and harmeleſſe to the people, ſutable to
the Scriptures, and moſt approveable and comfortable to
mens conſciences. Such, I ſay, as ſhall have for their
ground and warrant, not mens inventions, humane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
and traditions, but abſolutely and immediatly Gods
inſpired Scriptures, which are ſufficient, in all things to
inſtruct, reprove, correct in righteouſneſſe, and to make
the man of God perfect, furniſhed throughly to every
good work; in a word, ſuch as ſhall moſt conduce for the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97625:17"/>
advancement of Gods glory, and depreſſing the pride and
ambition of mens hearts, ſuch as are moſt contrary to the
corruption of mans life &amp; manners, ſuch as are moſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
&amp; ſutable to the nature of God, who is a Spirit, and will
be worſhipped in ſpirit &amp; truth: finally ſuch as can afford
moſt comfort and eaſe, unto troubled and perplexed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
if, I ſay, ſuch doctrines, diſcipline, and manner
of Government be admitted &amp; eſtabliſhed in our Church,
(as I make no doubt they ſhall) and alſo if all the people
from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> both in City and Country, from
all places, and corners of the Land, joyne together, as is
aforeſaid, without contention, prepoſterous zeale, ſchiſme,
and ſeparation; to approve, beleeve, receive and practice
the ſame, then ſhall our Church, like <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, flouriſh
to all poſſible perfection, even to the aſtoniſhment and
admiration of all her enemies, being as Mount <hi>Sion</hi> which
cannot be removed, but remaineth for ever: as the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

from henceforth, and for ever, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 150.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, let theſe and ſuch like treacherous
practices of Jeſuites and Papiſts abovementioned, be a
<hi>foelix quem faciunt,</hi> or warning-peale unto all the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe

(not only hate and abhorre all Popiſh and Antichriſtian

of a Papiſticall Hierarchie, leaſt (if they doe) their ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the father, and his diſtreſſed Miniſters, and are like to do

<hi>Ianuſſius,</hi> unleſſe the Lord provide ſome remedy to the
contrary.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially, let them take notice of this unto whom
both God and his Anointed our Soveraigne, hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and graciouſly granted all ſort of power, right, Law,
and prerogative to execute, eſtabliſh and reforme matters
tending to the preſervation and welfare of this Kingdome,
for whom (as true and naturall ſonnes of this <hi>Sion)</hi> let us
be carefull in our beſt devotion and prayers to ſollicite

of the Almighty, who hath the hearts of Kings and
great men in his hands, turning them (like the rivers of
water) which way he liſteth; That he may be pleaſed ſo to

Magiſtrates of this Land, that they may ſpeedily bethinke

conſcience, and affection, to embrace, profeſſe,

moſt conſonant and agreeable to Gods revealed will,
loving the truth and peace, and following after the truth
