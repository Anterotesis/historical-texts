            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince our drawing back to</hi> Reading, <hi>we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied our ſelves with all diligence to frame and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten an entire body of all the particular Propoſals which we would tender to the Commiſsioners of Parliament reſiding with the Army, to be treated on in purſuance of thoſe generall deſires expreſt in our former Declarations, and Papers, for ſecuring of the common rights and liberties, and a preſent ſettling of the peace of the Kingdome. In which buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (notwithstanding the many interruptions and disturbances, with daily advertiſements of the indirect and treacherous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and preparations of the Committee of Militia, and others, in and about the city of</hi> London, <hi>and elſewhere, tending to a new warre, have occaſioned to the diverting or retarding of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings therein, yet) we have made a progreſſe, as ſpeedy as the nature and weight of ſuch a work would admit, and having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſame, we have delivered in an abſtract of the heads thereof unto the ſaid Commiſsioners of Parliament to be treated upon. But the late pernicious engagement ſet on foot in the City; and (much more) that prodigious violence done to both Houſes of Parliament on Monday laſt, having wholy taken us off for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49153:3"/>
and rendred all proceeding in the way of Treaty thereupon, merely vain and hopeleſſe, untill it ſhall pleaſe God the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be righted and vindicated againſt that violation done to it, and reſtored to a condition of freedome, ſo as unquestioned Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it may repair together, with ſafety, and proceed according to their juſt freedome. We have thought good in the mean time, to make this publick tender of the heads of the ſaid Propoſals to the conſideration of the whole Kingdome, wherein though all circumstances requiſite to be determined in an actuall ſettlement, be not ſo fully and perfectly expreſsed, as upon the Treaty inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (if not interrupted as before) they might ſpeedily have been; yet all men may ſee and understand in theſe, the effect and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our deſires, whereupon we have ſincerely ſtudied that a preſent Peace might be ſettled, which ſame thing (with and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch vindication of the Parliament as may again render it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a capacity to establiſh the ſame) we ſhall still faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to the utmoſt of our power, and accordingly ſhall expect the chearfull and hearty concurrence of all thoſe, who are or ſhall be ſatisfied, concerning the integrity of our intentions to the peace and welfare of the Kingdome in theſe our propoſals; or who ſhall (for the main) deſire or approve of the ſame things with us, in order to a ſettlement.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49153:3"/>
ſo eſsentiall to peace, as neceſsary to precede to the ſettling of it, yet) being matters of very publick, and (most of them) of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall grievance to the Kingdome (which we every where find the outcryes of) and being contained in, or purſuant of the ſame things expreſſed in our former Repreſentation and papers, We ſhall deſire that the Parliament being ſet free, no time may be loſt for a ſpeedy conſideration of them, ſo as the former things for a preſent ſettling of Peace be not delayed thereby.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. That the oppreſſions and encroachments of Forreſt Laws, may be prevented for future.</p>

            <p n="4">4. That a courſe may be taken and Commiſſioners appointed to remedy and certifie the inequality of Rates, lying upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Counties, and ſeverall parts of each County, in reſpect of

others, and to ſettle the proportion for Land, Rates to more equality throughout the Kingdome: In order to which, we ſhall offer ſome further particulars which we hope may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The preſent unequall troubleſome and contentious way of Miniſters maintenance by Tythes to be conſidered of, and ſome remedy applied.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="7">7. That Priſoners for debt or other debtours (who have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to diſcharge them) may not by embracing Impriſonment, or any other wayes, have advantage to defraud their Creditors, but that the Eſtates of all men may be ſome way made liable to their debts, (as well as Tradeſmens are by Commiſſion of Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt) whether they be impriſoned or not, and that ſuch priſoners for debt, who have not wherewith to pay, or at leaſt do yield up what they have to their Creditours, may be freed from impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or ſome way provided for, ſo as neither they nor their Families, may periſh by their impriſonment.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Some proviſion to be made, that none may be compelled by penalties, or otherwiſe to anſwer unto Queſtions tending to the accuſing of themſelves, or their neareſt relations in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſes, and no mans life to be taken away under two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p n="9">9.

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49153:9"/>
III.

            <p n="4">4. That (according to the ſeaventh Head in the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration) an effectuall courſe may be taken, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be righted and ſatisfied in point of Accounts for the vaſt ſummes that have been levied.</p>

That proviſion may be made for payment of Arrears to the Army, and the reſt of the Souldierie of the Kingdome, who have concurred with the Armie in the late deſires and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings thereof.
