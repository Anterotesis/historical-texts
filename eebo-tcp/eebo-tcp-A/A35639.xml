            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>KING <hi>JAMES</hi> by Charter in the Fourth Year of his Reign incorporated the Inhabitants of St. <hi>Edmunds-Bury,</hi> by the name of Alderman and Burgeſſes, and thereby erected an Alderman, 12 Capital Burgeſſes, and 24 Burgeſſes of Common Councel for the Government of that Corporation: And by Charter in the 12th. year of his Reign Ganted that there ſhould be two Burgeſſes ſent to Parliament for the ſaid Borough, to be Elected by the Alderman, 12 Capital Burgeſſes, and 24 Burgeſſes of Common Councel.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Hervey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jermyn</hi> Elected by the Alderman, 12 Capital Burgeſſes, and 24 Burgeſſes of Common Councel, according to the Charter, 12 <hi>Jac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rotheram</hi> (Elected by ſome of the Freemen onely, and not the general Inhabitants) endeavoured to make out a Right in <hi>Bury</hi> to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament by Preſcription.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rotheram</hi> urged that <hi>Bury</hi> was a Borough by Preſcription; and offered a Record whereby <hi>H.</hi> 1. granted to the Burgeſſes of <hi>Bury</hi> ſeveral Priviledges.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rotheram,</hi> to prove <hi>Bury</hi> ſent Burgeſſes to Parliament by Preſcription, offered 4 Records, 30 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>

            <p>From this Mr. <hi>Rotheram</hi> would infer that Precepts were ſent to the Borough of St. <hi>Edmund</hi> which they were not, but to the Bailiff of the Liberty of St. <hi>Edmund,</hi> which was 7 Hundreds and a third part of the County, and in the Schedule to the Writ of the 30 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. the Sheriff ſo expreſſes it in theſe words, <hi>Feci praeceptum hujus brevis Seneſcallo Libertatis Sancti</hi> Edmundi, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Note</note>The Writs offered by Mr. <hi>Rotheram</hi> have all their Schedules annexed to them (except onely that of 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which is loſt off) and do expreſs what places in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> ſent Burgeſſes in thoſe times, and who were ſent, and who their Manucaptors: But <hi>Bury</hi> is not named in any of them, that it would have appeared in the very Records produced by Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theram</hi> had he brought them intire, That in thoſe times <hi>Bury</hi> ſent no Burgeſſes to Parliament.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rotheram</hi> would have Precepts to chuſe an Evidence of Right, though no Records of any Burgeſſes ever elected, and cited <hi>North-Allerton</hi> and <hi>Heydon,</hi> both in <hi>Yorſhire,</hi> as having but one Precept, and no Return till lately; and yet ſend Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Allerton</hi> ſent Burgeſſes to Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 26 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. namely, <hi>Stephen Maunſell</hi> and <hi>John le Clerke,</hi> and their Manucap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>John le Norris,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heydon,</hi> a late Borough, and ſends Burgeſſes to Parliament by a late Charter, had no Precept in ancient time: But there was a Precept to <hi>Hodon,</hi> a Liberty, 50 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which may be the Error.</p>
            <p>If the Precepts had gone to the Town of <hi>Bury,</hi> (as they did not) yet no Evidence of a Right, there being no Election: For <hi>Baſingſtoake</hi> had 4 Precepts, <hi>viz.</hi> 33 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Aulton</hi> had 3 Precepts, 33 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Odiham,</hi> 2 Precepts, 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> 1 Precept, 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> 1 Precept, 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. beſides <hi>Herteſmere, Blyton,</hi> and St. <hi>Etheldred,</hi> in the very Records produced by Mr. <hi>Rotheram,</hi> and yet none of theſe Places ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, or pretend thereunto.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rotheram</hi> urged that the men of <hi>Bury</hi> were bound to the Abbot not to claim a Community, and ſo loſt their Right of ſending Burgeſſes to Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw</note>The Abbot could not make the Town renounce that Right; The King and People both had an Intereſt in it; That were for the Abbot to exeute a Juriſdiction over the Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Rotheram</hi> urged that the Clauſe in the Charter, 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> limiting the number of Electors, was void: For that the King might then create 300 Corporations ſending Burgeſſes to Parliament, and that one of His naming ſhould chuſe them; ſo in effect there would be 600 of the King's naming. And the King might make as many Lords as he pleaſed; and the Conſequences thereof would be plain.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw</note>This Power hath been agreed to the King in all Ages, in Originals, Grants, (as that of <hi>Bury</hi> is) as appeares by <hi>Coke</hi> 4.<hi>Inſt.</hi> 49. 2 <hi>Co.</hi> 121. <hi>Hobart,</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Rolls,</hi> 2.<hi>part,</hi> 197, 198. and 'twould be hard to take it away upon Preſumption that the King may uſe it ill: ſuch Proceedings may be dangerous to many Members of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bury</hi> never ſent Burgeſſes to Parliament till the Charter of 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> and ever ſince hath ſent Burgeſſes to Parliament, and elected them as that Charter directs, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The Committee voted and agreed Sir <hi>Thomas Hervey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jermyn</hi> duely elected.</p>
