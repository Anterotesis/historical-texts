            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>ALthough, as <hi>Citizens,</hi> wee are <hi>reduced</hi> to a <hi>neceſsity</hi> of Violence; and as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> obliged to the <hi>Exercize</hi> of it; Vnleſs we will rather proſtitute our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Reputations;</hi> Nay, our very <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> to the Luſts of a <hi>Barbarous,</hi> and <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> Enemy: Wee have yet ſo great a tenderneſſe for Chriſtian bloud, as to leave unattempted no means, of probability to ſave it. This is it which hath prevayl'd with us to Declare, Firſt, to the World, what wee <hi>Propoſe,</hi> and <hi>Reſolve,</hi> ere we proceed to further Extremities: and to <hi>Satisfie</hi> the <hi>Publique,</hi> as well in the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of our Vndertakings, as to <hi>Juſtifie</hi> our <hi>Selves,</hi> in the <hi>Menage</hi> and <hi>Event</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>We find, in the Midſt of us, <hi>the Houſe of Prayer converted into a Den of Theeves:</hi> Our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> Affronted by Armed <hi>Troups,</hi> our <hi>Fellow Citizens knock'd on the head, like Doggs,</hi> at their own doors, for not ſo much as <hi>barking;</hi> Nay, tis become Death, now, to deſire to Live; and Adjudg'd Treaſon, but to Claim the benefit of the Law againſt it. Witneſſe thoſe <hi>Infamous Murders</hi> committed, but Monday laſt, upon our <hi>unarmed Friends:</hi> and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Inſolencies</hi> of that <hi>Rabble,</hi> towards ſuch of the reſt, as they ſeized, and carried away. But this is nothing: to make us a Compleat <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> we are to be <hi>Burnt</hi> too: a thing, not only <hi>Threatned,</hi> in the Paſſion of the Tumult, but Soberly <hi>intended;</hi> for they have layd in their Materials for the work already: a <hi>Prodigious Quantity of Fire-Balls in Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Greſham Colledge.</hi> Briefly, We are deſign'd for <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> and <hi>Pillage:</hi> and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us now, to look a little better to our <hi>gratious Guards.</hi> Not to inſiſt upon the loſſe of Trade; how many Thouſand Families have nothing now to do, but <hi>Begg,</hi> and <hi>Curſe</hi> theſe wretches? the <hi>Honour</hi> and the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> lies at ſtake: and God ſo bleſſe us as wee'll fall together. We will not live to ſee our Wives, and Daughters raviſh'd: our Houſes Rifled, and our Children Beggars, that ſhall only live to Reproach their cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Fathers: and all this done too by a People, which we can as <hi>eaſily deſtroy,</hi> as <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> by a Party, ſo <hi>barbarous,</hi> and ſo <hi>Inconſiderable together,</hi> that, certainly, no creature can be <hi>mean</hi> enough, either to <hi>ſuffer</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> the <hi>other.</hi> In this Exigency of Affairs, we have found it both our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Intereſts</hi> to <hi>Aſſociate;</hi> and we deſire a Bleſſing front Heaven upon us, no otherwiſe than as we do <hi>vigorouſly</hi> and <hi>faithfully</hi> purſue what we here Remonſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, We do engage our Selves, in the preſence of Almighty God, with our lives and fortunes, to defend the Rights and Liberties of the City of</hi> LONDON; <hi>and if any perſon that ſubſcribes to this Engagement, ſhall be moleſted for ſo doing; We will unanimouſly, and without delay, appear as one Man to his Reſcue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, we demand, that all ſuch <hi>Troups,</hi> and <hi>Companies,</hi> as do not properly belong to the Guard of the City, nor receive <hi>Orders</hi> from the <hi>lawfull Magiſtrates thereof;</hi> that ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>withdraw</hi> themſelves from the Liberties, within 12. hours after the Publication of This: upon pain of being deemed <hi>Conſpiratours,</hi> and <hi>of being Proceeded againſt accordingly,</hi> (for to this extent, both of Iudgement, and Execution, is every Individual qualified in his own defence.)</p>
            <p>We are next to demand the Inlargement of our Fellow Citizens, which were taken away by Force, and in a tumultuons manner, contrary to the known Lawes of the Place and Nation.</p>
            <p>This being performed, we ſhall acquieſce, in the Enjoyment of thoſe Liberties, which we will not loſe, but with our Lives. In fine, to remove all Impediments of the peace we deſire: We do undertake, both as Men of Credit, and Iuſtice; that ſuch of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as will betake themſelves to honeſter Imployments, ſhall receive their Arreares from the City, and ſuch a further care of their future well-being, as is ſuitable to the Neceſſities of the one part, and the Charity of the other.</p>
