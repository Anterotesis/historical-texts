         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>TO recommend theſe Sermons to the World were to
write a Panegyrick upon Light, and to attempt to
make that amiable to the Spectator, which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
acceptance by its own brightneſs. The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
Pearl needs not the flattering praiſes of the greedy Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
nor the Stone that is digg'd out of the Mines of <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda</hi>
the faint Encomium's of the crafty Merchant.</p>
                  <p>The Author of theſe Diſcourſes, as his Wit lay out of the
common road, ſo this genuine off-ſpring of his fertile brain
ſoars above the common level of Eccleſiaſtical Orations.
Death ſeemed to envy the vaſt parts of ſo great a man, and
in the aſcent of his Age, ſnatch't him away, when the learned
world expected ſome of his greateſt attempts, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes.
As he valued no notions, that were mean and trivial,
ſo thoſe, he hath ſent abroad, ſavour of a more than ordinary
genius. His Soul ſeemed to be ſpun of a finer thread than
thoſe of other mortals, and things look'd with another face,
when they paſſed through the quicker fire of his Laboratory.</p>
                  <p>Some curious Artiſts, though their work is materially the
ſame with that of meaner Artificers, yet the ſhape they give
it, and the neatneſs of the Fabrick, makes it ſeem a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of different ingredients.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53432:3"/>
Even the moſt obvious truths, when coming from our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
received a greater Luſtre; and that meat, which fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
made in a manner nauſeous to ſome nicer Pallats, when
dreſs'd with his Sauce, became more pungent, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more acceptable.</p>
                  <p>And though I am not able to bring in a liſt of the perſons,
who have been effectually wrought upon by his Sermons, and
become eminent Saints under his Miniſtry, Yet Charity bids
us believe, that not a few by his means turned Proſelytes of
Righteouſneſs; though if his pains had proved unſucceſsful,
it could have been no diſparagement to his glory.</p>
                  <p>Providence is ſometimes pleaſed for reaſons beſt known to it
ſelf, to caſt mens lots in places, where they cannot boaſt of many
converts made by their Preaching, and I have been acquainted
with ſome, who have ſpoke it with Sorrow, that in ten years time
they could not ſay, that any of their conſtant hearers had come
to them to beg directions, how to perfect holineſs in the fear
of God. One would admire that men of that life and power
(as I have known ſome to be) ſhould work no greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
and yet we have not a few parallel examples in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:
and when the Son of God himſelf, could make no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upon the men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> we need not marvel, if his
ſervants meet ſometimes with the like repulſes; but this doth
not leſſen their reward, no more than the ineffectual attempts
of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> made him ſhine with leſs brightneſs in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of Heaven. And where ſuch labours are loſt, they
do indeed aggravate the hearers guilt, but do not fruſtrate the
Labourer of his recompence.</p>
                  <p>To continue barren under ſuch Thunders, is to prepare for
the ſcourge of Scorpions, and where men remain unmoved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſound and affectionate, teaching, they make way for their
greater Agonies.</p>
                  <p>His Sermons as they were very ſolid, ſo they were (which
is the grace and life of them) pathetick, and by his zeal and
fervour one might gueſs, how big his deſire unto God for <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53432:3"/>
was, that they might be ſaved; Though he met ſometimes
with diſappointments, yet he remembred he was a Chriſtian.
And as he was not without his croſſes, ſo he carried himſelf
under them like a true Philoſopher. His mind ſeemed to be
ſerene, when things went moſt contrary to his wiſhes: and
whatever ſtorm the inconſtancy and ſickleneſs of ſublunary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
threw upon him, within ſtill he felt a calm, beyond that
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> when the ungrateful <hi>Athenians</hi> ſent him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
draught to drink his death and ruine.</p>
                  <p>He had a mind fitted for Contemplation, and his thoughts
could dwell on a Divine Object, till he had ſuck't out the Cream
and Marrow. His Divinity like his Philoſophy was free
from Dogmatizing, and while he tyed himſelf to no <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
he arrived to a clearer apprehenſion of truth and errour. The
Divine <hi>Plato</hi> was ſomewhat dearer to him than the ſubtiler
<hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and it cannot be otherwiſe, where ſouls long to be
transformed into the Image of the Deity. Nothing ſeemed
to ingroſs his deſire ſo much as the reformation of an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
world, and indeed there were few men fitter for that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
God having bleſſed him with a conſiderable ſtock both
of Reaſon and Eloquence. To a clarified mind the groſs
Atheiſtical ſurmiſes of Modern Wits, muſt needs be exceeding
fulſome: and no marvel if Souls ſo fine, break forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into very ſevere Satyrs, to laſh this petulant humour.
If any thing could raiſe his paſſion, it was the non-ſenſical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of <hi>DEISTS</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Infidels,</hi> and he thought
he might be juſtly angry with ſuch wretches, that like the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
of old, durſt make War with Tremendous Omnipotence.</p>
                  <p>He loved not to invelop Theological Doctrines in myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
phraſes, and ever thought that Divinity beſt agreed with
the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, that was expreſſed in rational
and intelligible propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>He was never any great Admirer of our Modern <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi>
and he counted that diſcourſe but little better than Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,
which affected to recommend it ſelf to the admiration of
<pb facs="tcp:53432:4"/>
the hearer by its not being underſtood: Where his Reaſon
tyred, and could give him no direction, he was willing to take
Faith for his Guide; and though he confeſſed, that not a few
things in Scripture were altogether unaccountable to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
yet he doubted not, but they would all be made
clear in that State, where we ſhall know even as we are known.
This puts me in mind of the Motto, which a Friend of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Mr. <hi>Culverwell</hi> hath added to his Sermons, and which
may ſerve as an Epilogue to this Preface,</p>

                        <p>(I) An Anſwer imply'd; <hi>ſtrait is the Gate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(II) A duty expreſt, <hi>ſtrive to enter.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>By the <hi>Gate,</hi> we may underſtand the entrance,
and all the <hi>way of Happineſs,</hi> and that is, <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
By the <hi>ſtraitneſs</hi> of it; the <hi>Difficulties</hi> we
are to encounter. By <hi>ſtriving;</hi> earneſt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<hi>endeavour:</hi> By <hi>ſeeking;</hi> an <hi>imperfect ſtriving.</hi>
And from the words thus briefly explain'd, Theſe
Propoſitions offer themſelves to our Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p>I. There are many and great difficulties in
Religion, <hi>The Gate is ſtrait.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>II. The difficulties may be overcome by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<hi>Strive to enter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>III. There is a ſort of ſtriving that will not
procure an entrance, <hi>For many will ſeek to enter in,
and ſhall not be able.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I begin with the Firſt in order, <hi>viz. That there
are many and great difficulties in Religion;</hi> And to
what I have to ſay about it, I premiſe this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Conſideration: That,</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Difficulties</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> do not lye in the
<hi>Underſtanding. Religion</hi> is a <hi>plain</hi> thing, and eaſie
to be <hi>underſtood.</hi> 'Tis no <hi>deep</hi> ſubtilty, or <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd</hi>
notion; 'tis no <hi>gilded</hi> fancy, or <hi>elaborate</hi>
exerciſe of the brain; 'Tis not plac'd in the <hi>clouds</hi>
                           <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53432:7"/>
of Imagination, nor wrapt up in <hi>myſtical</hi> cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
But 'tis <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>familiar, eaſie</hi> and <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible;</hi>
Firſt preach't by <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks,</hi>
without pomp of ſpeech, or height of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
addreſt to <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Plebeian</hi> heads; and
intended to govern the <hi>wills</hi> of the <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere;</hi>
and not to exerciſe the <hi>wits</hi> of the <hi>notional,</hi>
and <hi>curious.</hi> So that we need not mount the
<hi>wings</hi> of the <hi>wind</hi> to fetch <hi>Religion</hi> from the <hi>ſtars;</hi>
nor go down to the <hi>deep</hi> to fetch it <hi>up</hi> from
thence; For 'tis <hi>with us,</hi> and <hi>before us,</hi> as <hi>open</hi>
as the <hi>day,</hi> and as <hi>familiar</hi> as the <hi>light.</hi> The <hi>great
Precepts</hi> of the Goſpel are cloathed in Sun-beams,
and are as viſible to the <hi>common</hi> eye, as to the <hi>Eagle</hi>
upon the higheſt perch. 'Tis no piece of <hi>wit</hi>
or <hi>ſubtilty</hi> to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> nor will it require
much ſtudy, or learned retirement to <hi>underſtand</hi>
the Religion we muſt practiſe. That which
was to be <hi>known</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> was <hi>manifeſt</hi> to the very
Heathen, <hi>Rom. 1. 19. The Law is light,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 6. 13. And 'tis not only a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
paſſing glance on the eye; but 'tis <hi>put into the
heart,</hi> and the promiſe is, that <hi>we ſhall all know
him, from the greateſt to the leaſt.</hi> Our duty is ſet
up in open places, and ſhone upon by a clear
Beam; 'Twas written of old upon the plain
Tables of <hi>Habakkuk, Hab.</hi> 2. 2. So that the <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Eye</hi> might <hi>ſee and read:</hi> And the <hi>Religion</hi> of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53432:7"/>
the H. <hi>Jeſus,</hi> like <hi>himſelf,</hi> came into the world
with <hi>Rays</hi> about its Head.</p>
                        <p>Religion, I ſay, is <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and what
is not <hi>ſo,</hi> may concern the <hi>Theatre,</hi> or the <hi>Schools;</hi>
may entertain mens <hi>Wits,</hi> and ſerve the Intereſts
of <hi>Diſputes;</hi> but 'tis nothing to <hi>Religion,</hi> 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of mens Souls.</p>
                        <p>Religion was once a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> but the Myſtery
is <hi>revealed;</hi> And thoſe things that we yet count
<hi>Myſteries,</hi> are <hi>plainly</hi> enough diſcover'd as to their
<hi>being ſuch</hi> as we believe them, though we cannot
underſtand the <hi>manner how;</hi> and 'tis no part of
<hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>enquire</hi> into <hi>that;</hi> but rather <hi>It</hi> injoyns
us meekly to acquieſce in the plain declarations
of Faith without <hi>bold</hi> ſcrutiny into <hi>hidden things.</hi>
In ſhort I ſay, the <hi>difficulties of Religion are not in
the Underſtanding; In prompto &amp; facili eſt aeternitas,</hi>
ſaid the Father; The affairs of eternity depend
on things <hi>Eaſie</hi> and <hi>Familiar.</hi> And I premiſe this
to prevent dangerous miſtakes.</p>
                        <p>But though Religion be ſo facile and plain a
thing to be underſtood, yet the <hi>way</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> is
no <hi>broad,</hi> or <hi>eaſie Path;</hi> The <hi>Gate is ſtrait</hi> enough
for all that; and I now come to ſhew what are
the <hi>real difficulties</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and whence they
ariſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53432:8"/>
I. One great Difficulty ariſeth from the <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
of our <hi>Natures.</hi> The Scripture intimates,
<hi>That we are conceived in ſin,</hi> Pſalm 55. 5. <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours
from the Womb,</hi> Iſaiah 48. 8. <hi>Children of
Wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3. And we find by <hi>Experience</hi>
that we bring <hi>vile</hi> Inclinations into the World
with us. <hi>Some</hi> are <hi>naturally</hi> Cruel, and Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
Proud, and Imperious; Luſtful, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful;
<hi>Others,</hi> Covetous, and Unjuſt; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourfome,
and Diſcontented; Treacherous,
and Falſe: And there is ſcarce an inſtance of <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi>
vice, or villany, but ſome or other are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to it by their <hi>particular Make and Natures:</hi>
I ſay, their <hi>Natures,</hi> for certainly it is not true
what ſome affirm, to ſerve their Opinions, in
contradiction to Experience; That <hi>Vices are not
in Mens natural Propenſions; but inſtill'd by corrupt
Education, evil Cuſtomes and Examples:</hi> For we ſee
that thoſe whoſe <hi>Education</hi> hath been the <hi>ſame,</hi>
do yet <hi>differ</hi> extreamly from each other in their
<hi>inclinations;</hi> And <hi>ſome</hi> whoſe Breeding hath been
<hi>careleſs,</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> who have ſeen almoſt nothing
elſe but Examples of <hi>Vice;</hi> and been inſtructed
in <hi>little,</hi> beſides the arts of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure;</hi>
I ſay, there are <hi>ſuch</hi> who notwithſtanding theſe
their <hi>unhappy</hi> circumſtances, diſcover none of
thoſe <hi>vile</hi> Inclinations, and Propenſions, that are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53432:8"/>
in <hi>others,</hi> whoſe <hi>Education</hi> hath been very <hi>ſtrict,</hi>
and <hi>advantageous.</hi> This I think is enough to ſhew
that many of our evil habits are from <hi>Nature,</hi> and
not from <hi>Cuſtom</hi> only.</p>
                        <p>And yet I cannot ſay that <hi>Humane nature</hi> is <hi>ſo</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht,
that <hi>every Man</hi> is inclin'd to <hi>every Evil</hi> by
<hi>it:</hi> For there are <hi>thoſe,</hi> who by their <hi>Tempers</hi> are
<hi>averſe</hi> to ſome kind of Vices, and <hi>naturally</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the <hi>contrary Vertues; ſome</hi> by their <hi>Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are inclined to <hi>hate Cruelty, Covetouſneſs, Lying,
Impudence</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice;</hi> and are by <hi>Temper, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Liberal, Modeſt, True</hi> and <hi>Juſt.</hi> There are <hi>kinds</hi>
of <hi>Vices</hi> which our Natures almoſt <hi>univerſally</hi> riſe
againſt, as many <hi>Beſtialities,</hi> and ſome <hi>horrid Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
and <hi>all</hi> men, except <hi>Monſters</hi> in Humane
form, are diſpoſed to <hi>ſome</hi> Vertues, ſuch as <hi>Love</hi>
to <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> to <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Benefactors.</hi>
All this I muſt confeſs and ſay, becauſe <hi>Experience</hi>
conſtrains me; and I do not know why <hi>Syſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Notions</hi> ſhould ſway more than <hi>that.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But notwithſtanding <hi>theſe</hi> laſt conceſſions, 'tis
evident enough that our Natures are much <hi>vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and <hi>depraved;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> makes our buſineſs in
the way of Religion, <hi>difficult.</hi> For our work is,
to <hi>cleanſe</hi> our <hi>Natures;</hi> and to <hi>deſtroy</hi> thoſe <hi>Evil
Inclinations;</hi> to <hi>crucifie the Old Man;</hi> Rom. 6. 6. and
to <hi>purge out the old Leven;</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7. <hi>This is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and the <hi>Way</hi> of Happineſs, which muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53432:9"/>
needs be very <hi>difficult,</hi> and <hi>uneaſie.</hi> For the vices
of <hi>Inclination</hi> are very <hi>dear,</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> to us;
They are our <hi>Right Hands,</hi> and our <hi>Right Eyes,</hi> and
eſteemed as <hi>our Selves:</hi> So that to <hi>cut</hi> off, and
<hi>pluck</hi> out <hi>theſe,</hi> and to bid defiance to, and wage
War againſt our ſelves; to deſtroy the firſt-born of
our Natures, and to lop off our own Limbs;
This cannot but be very <hi>Irkſome</hi> and <hi>Diſpleaſant</hi>
Imployment; and this is one chief buſineſs; and
a conſiderable thing that makes <hi>Religion difficult.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>II. Another <hi>Difficulty</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>Influence</hi>
of the <hi>Senſes.</hi> We are Creatures of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
things do moſt powerfully move us; we
are born <hi>Children,</hi> and live at firſt the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Beaſts:
That</hi> Age receives <hi>deep</hi> Impreſſions; and thoſe are
made by the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> whoſe Intereſt grows <hi>ſtrong,</hi>
and eſtabliſht in us before we come to the <hi>uſe</hi> of
<hi>Reaſon;</hi> and after we have arrived to the exerciſe
of <hi>that,</hi> ſenſible objects ſtill <hi>poſſeſs</hi> our <hi>Affections,</hi>
and <hi>ſway</hi> our <hi>Wills,</hi> and <hi>fill</hi> our <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
our <hi>Underſtandings;</hi> ſo that we <hi>love,</hi> and
<hi>hate;</hi> we <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>chooſe;</hi> we <hi>fancy,</hi> and we <hi>diſcourſe</hi>
according to thoſe <hi>Impreſſions;</hi> and hence it is that
we are <hi>enamour'd</hi> of <hi>Trifles,</hi> and <hi>fly</hi> from our <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;</hi>
and <hi>purſue Vexation,</hi> and <hi>embrace Miſery;</hi>
and <hi>imagine Perverſely,</hi> and <hi>reaſon Childiſhly:</hi> for the
influence of the Body and its Senſes are the chief
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53432:9"/>
Fountains of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>Temptation:</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which accounts it was that the <hi>Platonical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>
declaim'd ſo <hi>earneſtly</hi> againſt the <hi>Body,</hi> and
aſcrib'd all <hi>Evils</hi> and Miſchief to it; calling <hi>vice</hi>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>corporeae Peſtes, material Evils,</hi> and <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Plagues.</hi> And the Apoſtle that underſtood it
better, calls <hi>Sin</hi> by the name of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 17.
<hi>Works of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 19. <hi>Law of the Members,</hi>
Rom. 7. 23. and cries out upon the <hi>Body of this
Death,</hi> Rom. 7. 24.</p>
                        <p>And now this is our <hi>natural</hi> Condition, a <hi>ſtate</hi>
ſubject to the <hi>prevalent</hi> influences of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and by
this means to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Temptation;</hi> and 'tis our
<hi>Work</hi> in Religion, to <hi>mortifie</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> Rom. 8. 13.
<hi>and to ceaſe from making proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> Rom.
13. 14. <hi>and from fulfilling the Luſts thereof,</hi> Gal. 5.
14. To render our ſelves <hi>dead</hi> to the prevalent
life of Senſe, and Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 8. and 11. 5. and
to <hi>ariſe</hi> to a <hi>new Life,</hi> Rom. 6. 4. The <hi>Life</hi> of
<hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> Hab. 2. 4. A <hi>Life</hi> that
hath other <hi>Principles,</hi> and other <hi>Pleaſures;</hi> other
<hi>Objects,</hi> and other <hi>Ends,</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> as neither <hi>Eye
hath ſeen,</hi> nor <hi>Ear heard,</hi> nor any of the Senſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Yea, <hi>this</hi> is a Life that is exerciſed in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi>
to the Judgements of <hi>ſenſe.</hi> Its <hi>Joy,</hi> is
<hi>Tribulation;</hi> Jam. 1. 2. Its <hi>Glory, Reproaches;</hi>
2 Pet. 4. 14. Its <hi>Height</hi> is <hi>Lowneſs;</hi> Luke 14.
11. Its <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> in being <hi>Meaneſt;</hi> Matth. 20. 27.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53432:10"/>
And its <hi>Riches,</hi> in having <hi>Nothing;</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10.
To ſuch a Life as <hi>this,</hi> Religion is to raiſe us;
and it muſt needs be <hi>difficult</hi> to make <hi>us,</hi> who are
<hi>ſo</hi> much <hi>Brutes,</hi> to be <hi>ſo</hi> much <hi>Angels; us,</hi> who
ſeem to live by nothing <hi>elſe</hi> but <hi>ſenſe,</hi> to live by
<hi>nothing leſs;</hi> This with a witneſs is an <hi>hard,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie</hi>
Work, and another <hi>difficulty</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>III. A <hi>Third</hi> proceeds from the natural <hi>Diſorder</hi>
and <hi>Rage</hi> of our <hi>Paſſions.</hi> Our Corrupt Natures
are like the <hi>troubled Sea,</hi> Iſa. 57. 20. And our
<hi>Paſſions</hi> are the <hi>Waves</hi> of that Ocean, that tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſwell, and keep a mighty noiſe; they
daſh againſt the Rocks, and break one againſt
another; and our Peace and Happineſs is ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt
by them. <hi>Our Paſſions make us miſerable.</hi>
We are ſometime <hi>ſtifled</hi> by their <hi>Numbers,</hi> and
<hi>confounded</hi> by their <hi>Diſorders,</hi> and <hi>torn</hi> to pieces by
their <hi>Violence;</hi> mounted to the Clouds by <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and thrown down to the <hi>deep</hi> by <hi>Deſpair;</hi>
ſcorcht by the <hi>flames</hi> of <hi>Luſt,</hi> and <hi>overwhelmed</hi> by
the <hi>Waters</hi> of unſtable <hi>Deſire; Paſſions</hi> fight <hi>one
againſt another,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> againſt reaſon; they prevail
over the Mind, and have <hi>uſurpt</hi> the Government
of our Actions, and involve us in continual Guilt
and Miſery. This is the <hi>natural</hi> State of Man; and
our <hi>work</hi> in the way of <hi>Religion,</hi> is to <hi>reſtrain</hi> this
<hi>Violence,</hi> and to <hi>rectifie</hi> theſe <hi>Diſorders,</hi> and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi>
                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53432:10"/>
thoſe <hi>Rebellious</hi> Powers under the Empire and
Government of the <hi>Mind,</hi> their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> And
ſo to <hi>regain</hi> the Divine <hi>Image,</hi> which conſiſts much
in the <hi>order</hi> of our <hi>Faculties;</hi> and the <hi>Subjection</hi> of
the <hi>Brutiſh,</hi> to the <hi>reaſonable</hi> Powers. <hi>This,</hi> I ſay,
Religion aims at, to raiſe us to the <hi>perfection</hi> of
our Natures, by <hi>mortifying</hi> thoſe <hi>Members,</hi> Col. 3.
5. our <hi>unruly Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Deſires;</hi> and <hi>crucifying</hi>
the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> with its <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Luſts;</hi> Gal. 5. 24.
And thereby to make us <hi>humble</hi> in <hi>Proſperity, quiet</hi>
in <hi>Adverſity; meek</hi> under <hi>Provocations, ſteady</hi> amidſt
<hi>Temptations, modeſt</hi> in our <hi>Deſires, temperate</hi> in our
<hi>Injoyments, conſtant</hi> to our <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> and <hi>contented</hi>
in all <hi>Conditions:</hi> Here is our great Buſineſs, and
our <hi>Work is this:</hi> And certainly 'tis no <hi>eaſie</hi> thing
to bring <hi>order</hi> out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> and to ſpeak a <hi>Tempeſt</hi>
into a <hi>Calm;</hi> to <hi>reſiſt</hi> a <hi>Torrent,</hi> and to <hi>ſtop</hi> and <hi>turn</hi>
the <hi>Tyde;</hi> to <hi>ſubdue</hi> a <hi>Rebellious</hi> Rabble, and to
change them from <hi>Tyrannical</hi> Maſters, to <hi>Modeſt</hi>
and <hi>Obedient</hi> Servants: Theſe, no doubt, are works
of <hi>difficulty</hi> enough, and theſe muſt be our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in the way of <hi>Religion;</hi> and on this ſcore
alſo, the <hi>Gate is ſtrait.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IV. Our <hi>Work</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is yet more <hi>difficult,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> to which we are ſubject,
and by which we are ſwayed much. <hi>This</hi> is vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid to be <hi>another Nature,</hi> and the Apoſtle calls
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53432:11"/>
it by <hi>that</hi> name, 1 Cor. 11. 14. <hi>Doth not Nature it
ſelf teach you, that if a Man have long Hair, it is a
ſhame unto him?</hi> By the word <hi>Nature,</hi> the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
ſay only <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is meant; ſince <hi>long Hair</hi>
is not declared <hi>ſhameful</hi> by the Law, and Light
of Nature, taken in its chief and propereſt ſenſe:
For then it had never been permitted to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites:</hi>
But the <hi>contrary cuſtom,</hi> in the Nations that
uſed it not, made it ſeem <hi>ſhameful and indecent.</hi>
There are other places in Scripture and ancient
Authors, wherein <hi>Nature</hi> is put for <hi>Cuſtom:</hi> But
I muſt not inſiſt on <hi>this;</hi> the thing I am about is,
that <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is very <hi>powerful;</hi> and as it makes a
kind of Nature, ſo, many times it <hi>maſters</hi> and
<hi>ſubdues</hi> it. Wild Creatures are hereby made
gentle and familiar; and thoſe that naturally
are tame enough, are made to degenerate into
wildneſs by it.</p>
                        <p>And now beſides the <hi>original</hi> depravities of
our Natures, we have <hi>contracted</hi> many <hi>vitious
habits</hi> by <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> uſages; which we were
drawn into at firſt by pleaſure and vanity in our
young and inconſiderate years, while we were
led by the directions of ſenſe: <hi>Theſe,</hi> by <hi>frequent</hi>
acts, grow at laſt into <hi>habits;</hi> which though in
their beginning they were <hi>tender</hi> as a Plant, and
eaſie to have been cruſht or blaſted, yet <hi>time</hi> and
<hi>uſe</hi> hardens them into the firmneſs of an <hi>Oak,</hi> that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53432:11"/>
braves the Weather, and can endure the ſtroak of
the Ax and a ſtrong Arm.</p>
                        <p>Now to deſtroy and root up theſe obſtinate <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary</hi>
evils, is another part of our Work. And
Religion teacheth us to <hi>put off concerning the Old
Converſation, the Old Man,</hi> Eph. 4. 22. and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>new Impreſſions</hi> and <hi>Inclinations;</hi> to be <hi>renewed</hi>
in the <hi>ſpirit of our Minds,</hi> 5. 23. and to <hi>put on the
New Man,</hi> 5. 24. To make us <hi>new Hearts,</hi> Ezek.
18. 31. and to <hi>walk in newneſs of Life,</hi> Rom. 6. 4.
<hi>This</hi> we are to do, and this we may well ſuppoſe
to be <hi>hard</hi> work; the Scripture compares it to the
<hi>changing</hi> the <hi>Skin</hi> of the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> and the <hi>Spots</hi> of
the <hi>Leopard,</hi> Jer. 13. 23. and elſewhere. <hi>How
can they do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil?</hi> Jer.
13. 23. 'Tis <hi>hard,</hi> no doubt; and this is another
<hi>difficulty</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. The Power that <hi>Example</hi> hath over us,
makes the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Religion difficult. Example</hi> is more
<hi>prevalent</hi> than <hi>Precept,</hi> for Man is a Creature given
much to <hi>Imitation,</hi> and we are very apt to follow
what we <hi>ſee others do,</hi> rather than what we <hi>ought to
do our ſelves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now the Apoſtle hath told us, That <hi>the
whole World lies in Wickedneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 19. and we
ſadly find it: we cannot look out of doors, but we
ſee <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Folly, Senſuality and Forgetfulneſs</hi> of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53432:12"/>
God; <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs, Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
and all other kinds of Evils: Theſe we
meet with every where, in <hi>Publick</hi> Companies,
and <hi>Private</hi> Converſations; in the <hi>High Ways,</hi> and
in the <hi>Corners</hi> of the <hi>Streets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Sum is, <hi>Example</hi> is very <hi>powerful,</hi> and <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>Vice</hi> are always in our Eyes; we are apt to
be reconciled to <hi>that</hi> which <hi>every one doth,</hi> and to
do like it; we love the <hi>trodden Path,</hi> and care
not to walk in the <hi>Way</hi> which is gone in but by
a <hi>few.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is our <hi>Condition,</hi> and our <hi>work</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi>
is, to <hi>overcome</hi> the ſtrong Biaſs of corrupt <hi>Example;</hi>
to <hi>ſtrive</hi> againſt the <hi>Stream,</hi> to learn to be <hi>good,</hi>
though <hi>few</hi> are <hi>ſo,</hi> and not to follow <hi>a Multitude
to do Evil,</hi> Exod. 23. 2. <hi>This</hi> is our <hi>Buſineſs;</hi> and
<hi>this</hi> is very <hi>Difficult.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>VI. The laſt <hi>Difficulty</hi> I ſhall mention, ariſeth
from <hi>Worldly Intereſts</hi> and <hi>Engagements.</hi> We have
many <hi>Neceſſities</hi> to ſerve, both in our Perſons,
and our Families. Nature excluded us <hi>naked</hi> into
the World, without <hi>Cloathing</hi> for <hi>Warmth,</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature</hi>
for <hi>Defence;</hi> and <hi>Food</hi> is not provided to
our Hands, as it is for the Beaſts; nor do our
<hi>Houſes</hi> grow for our Habitation, and comfortable
abode. Nothing is prepared for our uſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our Induſtry and Endeavours. So that by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53432:12"/>
the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>this State,</hi> we are engaged in <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Affairs: Theſe, Nature</hi> requires us to mind, and
<hi>Religion</hi> permits it; and nothing can be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our <hi>Care;</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> would be very <hi>troubleſome,</hi>
if there were not ſome <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Objects</hi> we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
our Cares upon: Hence it is, that <hi>ſome Cares</hi>
about the things of <hi>this</hi> world, and <hi>Love</hi> to them
is allowed us; and we are commanded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the <hi>Calling wherein God hath ſet us,</hi> 1 Cor.
7. 20. and are warned that we be not <hi>ſlothful in
Buſineſs,</hi> Rom. 12. 11. We may take <hi>ſome delight</hi>
alſo in the Creatures that God gives us, and
love them in their <hi>degree:</hi> For the <hi>animal</hi> Life
may have its <hi>moderate Gratifications; God made all
things, that they might enjoy their Being.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now, notwithſtanding all <hi>this,</hi> Religion
commands us to <hi>ſet our Affections upon things above,</hi>
Col. 3. 2. not to <hi>love the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. to
be <hi>careful for nothing,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. to take no <hi>thought
for to morrow,</hi> Mat. 6. 34. The meaning of which
Expreſſions is, That we ſhould <hi>love God</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things,</hi> in the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>firſt place;</hi> and avoid
the <hi>immoderate Deſires</hi> of <hi>Worldly Love</hi> and <hi>Cares.</hi>
This is our <hi>Duty:</hi> and 'tis very <hi>difficult:</hi> For by
reaſon of the <hi>hurry</hi> of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Paſſions</hi>
that <hi>Earthly</hi> Engagements excite; we <hi>conſider</hi> not
things as we ſhould, and <hi>ſo,</hi> many times perceive
not the <hi>Bounds</hi> of our <hi>Permiſſions,</hi> and the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53432:13"/>
of our <hi>Reſtraints;</hi> where the <hi>allowed</hi> Meaſure
<hi>ends,</hi> and the <hi>forbidden</hi> Degree <hi>commenceth:</hi> what is
the difference between that <hi>Care</hi> that is a <hi>Duty,</hi> and
<hi>that</hi> which is a <hi>Sin; Providence</hi> and <hi>Carking;</hi> and
between <hi>that Love</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> which is <hi>Neceſſary</hi>
and <hi>Lawful,</hi> and that which is <hi>Extravagant</hi> and
<hi>Inordinate?</hi> I ſay, by reaſon of the hurry we are in,
amidſt Buſineſs and worldly Delights, we many
times <hi>perceive not our Bounds,</hi> and ſo ſlide eaſily
into <hi>Earthly-mindedneſs</hi> and <hi>anxiety.</hi> And it is hard
for us, who are engaged ſo much in the World,
and who need it ſo much, who converſe ſo
much with it and about it, and whoſe time and
endeavours are ſo unavoidably taken up by it;
I ſay 'tis hard for us, in ſuch Circumſtances, to
be <hi>crucified to the World,</hi> Gal. 6. 14. and to all <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Affections</hi> to it: to live <hi>above</hi> it, and to ſettle
our <hi>chief</hi> Delights, and Cares on things at great
<hi>diſtance</hi> from us, which are <hi>unſutable</hi> to our <hi>corrupt</hi>
Appetites, and <hi>contrary</hi> to the moſt <hi>reliſhing Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of <hi>Fleſh;</hi> which <hi>Senſe</hi> never <hi>ſaw</hi> nor <hi>felt,</hi> and
which the <hi>Imagination</hi> it ſelf could never <hi>graſp.
This,</hi> no doubt, is <hi>hard Exerciſe,</hi> and this muſt be
done in the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and on this Account
alſo, it is very <hi>difficult.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus of the Firſt <hi>Propoſition, That there are great
Difficulties</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> I come now to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53432:13"/>
II. THat thoſe Difficulties may be overcome by
ſtriving; <hi>which imports both the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
<hi>and the</hi> Means; <hi>That</hi> they may be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht,
<hi>and</hi> how.</p>
                        <p>(1.) That the <hi>Difficulties may be ſubdued,</hi> is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough implyed, in the <hi>Precept;</hi> we ſhould not
have been commanded to <hi>ſtrive,</hi> if it had been
<hi>impoſſible</hi> to overcome. God doth not put his
Creatures upon <hi>fruitleſs</hi> Undertakings: He never
requires us to do any thing in order to <hi>that,</hi> which
is not to be <hi>attained.</hi> Therefore when he was
reſolved not to be intreated for that ſtubborn
and rebellious Nation; He would not have the
Prophet pray for them, <hi>Jer. 7. 16. Pray not for
this People, for I will not hear thee.</hi> He would not be
<hi>petitioned</hi> for <hi>that,</hi> which he was determined
not to <hi>grant.</hi> He puts not his Creatures upon
any <hi>vain</hi> Expectations and Endeavours; nor
would he have them deceive themſelves by fond
Dependences. When one made this Profeſſion
to our Saviour, <hi>Lord, I will follow thee whither ſoever
thou goeſt; Chriſt</hi> tells him, that he muſt expect
from him no worldly Honours or Preferments;
no Power or ſenſual Pleaſure, no, not ſo much
as the ordinary Accommodations of Life: <hi>The
Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Neſts,
but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head,</hi> Luk.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53432:14"/>
9. 5, 8. He would not have the man that likely
might look for <hi>theſe,</hi> upon the opinion of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſenſe, one that ſhould
at laſt, whatever the meanneſs of his Condition
was at preſent, appear as a <hi>Mighty,</hi> and <hi>Triumphant
temporal Monarch;</hi> I ſay, our Saviour would not
have the Man follow him for <hi>that,</hi> which he had
not to beſtow upon him. Since then that he who
would not put us upon <hi>fruitleſs</hi> labours, hath <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
us to <hi>ſtrive</hi> to enter; 'tis evident, that an
entrance may be procured into the Gate by <hi>ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
and that the <hi>Difficulties</hi> may <hi>be overcome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next thing in my Method is to ſhew,
<hi>How;</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> is <hi>implyed</hi> in the <hi>Text;</hi> and <hi>expreſt</hi>
in the <hi>Propoſition, viz.</hi> By <hi>ſtriving;</hi> and by <hi>this,</hi>
is meant, a <hi>reſolute</hi> uſe of thoſe means that are the
Inſtruments of Happineſs. They are three, <hi>Faith,
Prayer,</hi> and <hi>active Endeavour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(I.) <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>chief</hi> Inſtrument, for the <hi>overcoming</hi>
the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of our way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> Faith <hi>in the</hi> general, <hi>is the</hi> belief <hi>of a</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
Divine Faith <hi>the belief of a</hi> Divine <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and the chief things to be believed, as</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
<hi>and</hi> means <hi>for a Victory over the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in Religion, are</hi> theſe; That God is reconciled to us
by his Son; That he will aſſiſt our weak endeavours by the
Aids of his Spirit; That he will reward us if we ſtrive as we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53432:14"/>
ought, with immortal Happineſs in a World of endleſs Glory.</p>
                        <p>By our belief of God's being <hi>reconciled,</hi> we are
ſecured from thoſe <hi>fears,</hi> that might diſcourage
our approaches and endeavours, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> By the <hi>Faith</hi> of his
<hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> all the <hi>objections</hi> againſt our <hi>ſtriving,</hi> that
ariſe from the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and the
<hi>diſproportionate ſmallneſs</hi> of our <hi>Strength,</hi> are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And from our believing <hi>eternal rewards</hi> in
another World, we have a mighty <hi>motive</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
our utmoſt diligence, to conteſt with all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
that would keep us from it.</p>
                        <p>What <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> is there, ſaith the believer, in
the <hi>gratification</hi> of my <hi>corrupt Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Senſes,</hi>
in compariſon with <hi>that,</hi> which ariſeth from the
<hi>favour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in his <hi>Son?</hi> What dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in my <hi>Duty, too</hi> great for <hi>Divine</hi> Aids?
What <hi>pains</hi> are we to undergo in the <hi>narrow</hi> and
<hi>difficult</hi> way, that the <hi>Glory</hi> which is at the end of
it, will not <hi>compenſate?</hi> What is it to <hi>deny</hi> a <hi>baſe</hi>
Inclination that will undo me; in <hi>obedience</hi> to him
that <hi>made,</hi> and <hi>redeemed</hi> me; and to deſpiſe the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
things of <hi>preſent</hi> ſenſe, for the hope of <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enjoyments; Trifling</hi> pleaſure, for <hi>Hallelujahs?</hi>
What were it for me to ſet <hi>vigorouſly</hi> upon thoſe
<hi>Paſſions</hi> that degrade my noble Nature, and make
me a <hi>ſlave</hi> and a <hi>beaſt,</hi> and will make me <hi>more</hi>
vile, and <hi>more</hi> miſerable; when the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53432:15"/>
moſt High is at my <hi>right</hi> hand to aſſiſt me? Why
ſhould my noble Faculties, that were deſigned
for glorious ends, be led into infamous practices
by <hi>baſe Uſages,</hi> and <hi>diſhonourable Cuſtoms?</hi> What is
the <hi>example</hi> of a <hi>wicked, ſenſual, wretched</hi> World, to
<hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Holy Jeſus;</hi> and all the <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Prophets,
Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs?</hi> What is there in the <hi>World,</hi>
that <hi>it</hi> ſhould be <hi>loved</hi> more than <hi>God?</hi> and what
is the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that it ſhould have <hi>more</hi> of our <hi>time</hi> and
<hi>care,</hi> than the great intereſts of our Souls?</p>
                        <p>Such are the <hi>Conſiderations</hi> of a mind, that <hi>Faith</hi>
hath awakened; and by <hi>them</hi> it is prepared for
<hi>vigorous ſtriving.</hi> So that <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>all;</hi>
and <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the other two <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of our
<hi>Happineſs.</hi> Beſides which, it is acceptable to God,
in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and ſo diſpoſeth us for his <hi>gracious helps,</hi>
by which we are enabled to overcome the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of our way. While a man conſiders the
<hi>Difficulties</hi> only, and weighs them againſt his
own <hi>ſtrength,</hi> let him ſuppoſe the <hi>Liberty</hi> of his
<hi>Will</hi> to be what he pleaſeth, yet while 'tis under
<hi>ſuch</hi> diſadvantages, <hi>that</hi> will ſignifie very little;
and he that ſees no <hi>further,</hi> ſits down in diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement;
But when the mind is fortified with
the firm belief of <hi>Divine help,</hi> he attempts then
with a <hi>noble vigour,</hi> which cannot <hi>miſcarry,</hi> if it
do not <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>faint.</hi> For <hi>he that endures to the end,
ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mat. 24. 13. Thus <hi>Faith</hi> ſets the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53432:15"/>
other Inſtruments of Happineſs on work, and
therefore 'tis deſervedly reckoned as the <hi>firſt;</hi>
and 'tis <hi>that</hi> which muſt always accompany the
<hi>exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and give them <hi>life</hi> and
<hi>motion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(II.) <hi>Prayer</hi> is another <hi>means</hi> we muſt uſe, in
order to our <hi>overcoming</hi> the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of the way.
Our own meer, natural <hi>Strength</hi> is <hi>weakneſs;</hi>
and without <hi>ſupernatural</hi> helps thoſe Difficulties
are not to be ſurmounted. <hi>Thoſe Aids</hi> are <hi>neceſſary,</hi>
and <hi>God</hi> is <hi>ready</hi> to beſtow them on us; For <hi>He
would have all men to be ſaved,</hi> and <hi>to come to the
Knowledge of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. But for <hi>theſe
things he will be ſought unto.</hi> And 'tis very <hi>juſt,</hi> and
<hi>fit</hi> that we ſhould addreſs our ſelves to him by
<hi>Prayer,</hi> to acknowledge our own <hi>inſufficiency,</hi> and
<hi>dependence</hi> on him for the mercies we expect;
and thereby to own <hi>Him</hi> for the <hi>giver</hi> of <hi>every good</hi>
and <hi>perfect gift;</hi> and to inſtruct our ſelves how his
favours are to be <hi>received</hi> and <hi>uſed, viz.</hi> with
<hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving:</hi> This, 'tis highly <hi>fit</hi>
we ſhould do; and the doing it <hi>prepares</hi> us for
his bleſſings; and he fails not to <hi>beſtow</hi> them on
thoſe that are <hi>prepared</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer; For
he giveth liberally and upbraids not;</hi> And our <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
are required, not as if they could <hi>move</hi> his
<hi>will,</hi> which is <hi>always</hi> graciouſly <hi>inclined</hi> to our <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53432:16"/>
But as it's <hi>that tribute</hi> which we owe our
<hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Benefactor;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> without which
'tis not ſo <hi>fit</hi> he ſhould beſtow his <hi>particular</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
on us. For it by no means becomes the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majeſty, to vouchſafe the <hi>ſpecialties</hi> of his
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to thoſe, that are not <hi>ſenſible</hi>
they <hi>want</hi> them; and are not <hi>humbled</hi> to a <hi>due</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of their <hi>weakneſs</hi> and dependence.
But for ſuch as are <hi>ſo,</hi> and expreſs their humble
deſires in the <hi>Ardours</hi> of <hi>Holy Prayer,</hi> God never
<hi>denies</hi> them the <hi>aſſiſtances</hi> of his <hi>Spirit: For if ye being
evil</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>know how to give good
gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your
Father which is in Heaven give good things to thoſe that
ask Him?</hi> Mat. 7. 11.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Theſe Divine Helps</hi> obtain'd by <hi>Faith and
Prayer,</hi> and join'd with our <hi>active conſtant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
will not fail to <hi>enable</hi> us to <hi>overcome</hi> the <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,</hi>
and to procure us an entrance at the <hi>ſtrait
Gate.</hi> And ſo I come to the <hi>Third Inſtrument</hi> of our
<hi>Happineſs,</hi> which is implyed in <hi>ſtriving,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p>(III.) <hi>Active Endeavour,</hi> in which <hi>Repentance</hi>
and the <hi>fruits of</hi> it are implied; Both <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Prayer</hi> are in order to <hi>this;</hi> and without it neither
can turn to account. For <hi>Faith without works is
dead,</hi> Jam. 2. 20. and <hi>Prayer, without endeavour,
fruitleſs;</hi> yea indeed, in the Divine Eſtimate, it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53432:16"/>
is <hi>none at all:</hi> 'Tis <hi>bodily</hi> exerciſe; <hi>no Prayer.</hi> For
when we invoke <hi>Gods help,</hi> we <hi>deſire</hi> it, that we
may <hi>uſe</hi> it; <hi>Divine Grace is not a Treaſure to lay up
by us, but an Inſtrument to work with;</hi> and when
we pray that God would <hi>aſſiſt</hi> us in our <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
and <hi>endeavour not at all,</hi> we <hi>mock</hi> God, and
<hi>trifle</hi> with him in our Prayers: <hi>Endeavour</hi> then is
<hi>neceſſary,</hi> and neceſſary in a degree ſo eminent,
that <hi>this</hi> is always included in <hi>Faith</hi> when 'tis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the <hi>higheſt</hi> and nobleſt <hi>Evangelical ſenſe,</hi> viz.
for the <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>juſtifies</hi> and <hi>ſaves;</hi> for <hi>that</hi>
comprehends <hi>all</hi> thoſe <hi>endeavours,</hi> and their <hi>fruits,</hi>
whereby we are made happy.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not expect that God ſhould do <hi>all
(excluſively</hi>) in the work of our Salvation. He
doth <hi>his</hi> part, and we muſt do <hi>ours;</hi> (though we
do <hi>that,</hi> by his help too.) <hi>He that made us without our
ſelves, will not ſave us without our ſelves,</hi> ſaid the Father.
We are commanded to ſeek, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. To <hi>Run,</hi>
1 Cor. 9. 24. To <hi>fight,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 12. To <hi>give diligence,</hi>
2 Pet. 1. 10. <hi>Theſe all</hi> import <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Endeavour.</hi>
And that endeavour muſt not be only a <hi>faint</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
or <hi>formal</hi> ſervice; but it muſt be imployed in
the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Diligence. The Kingdom
of Heaven ſuffereth violence,</hi> Mat. 11. 12. and this
violence muſt not be uſed in an <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>ſudden</hi>
fit <hi>only,</hi> that <hi>cools</hi> and <hi>dies,</hi> and contents it ſelf with
having been <hi>warm</hi> for a time: But it muſt be a

                           <hi>ſteady</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> courſe of <hi>Activity,</hi> a continual
<hi>ſtriving</hi> to overcome the remaining <hi>difficulties</hi> of
the <hi>way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We muſt <hi>endeavour vigorouſly</hi> and <hi>conſtantly;</hi> and
in <hi>that,</hi> (after our <hi>Faith</hi> is ſtrengthened by <hi>deep
conſideration,</hi> and <hi>Divine aſſiſtance</hi> implored by <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Prayer</hi>) our courſe is,</p>
                        <p>(1.) <hi>To abſtain from all the outward actions of Sin,</hi>
and <hi>to perform the external acts of the contrary Vertues.
To ceaſe to do evil,</hi> Iſa. 1. 16. is the firſt ſtep. When
the <hi>Publicans</hi> askt <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> Luke 3. 12.
what they ſhould do; His direction was, that
they <hi>ſhould not exact,</hi> verſ. 13. and to the <hi>Souldiers,</hi>
asking the ſame queſtion, he anſwers, <hi>Do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to no man,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Theſe</hi> were the ſins of
their <hi>particular</hi> Profeſſions, which were to be <hi>quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
before any thing could be done <hi>higher.</hi> We
have ordinarily more power over our <hi>actions,</hi>
than our <hi>habits,</hi> and therefore we ſhould <hi>begin</hi>
here, and reſolve deeply, by divine help, to cut
off thoſe <hi>ſupplies</hi> that feed <hi>vitious inclinations;</hi> for
<hi>wicked habits</hi> are maintain'd by <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
when <hi>they</hi> ceaſe, the <hi>inclinations</hi> grow more
<hi>faint,</hi> and <hi>weak:</hi> and when we are come but <hi>thus far,</hi>
to have <hi>confined</hi> our <hi>luſts,</hi> we ſhall be encouraged
to proceed to deſtroy them. 'Tis ſaid, There is no
great diſtance between a <hi>Princes Priſon</hi> and his
<hi>Grave;</hi> The ſaying is moſt true in the caſe of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53432:17"/>
                           <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Uſurpers;</hi> and the <hi>habits</hi> of ſin are
<hi>both;</hi> when they are <hi>reſtrain'd,</hi> they are not far
from being <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> if we imploy our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and the divine aids, as we ought.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This</hi> then muſt be done <hi>Firſt,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> part
of the advice muſt be taken with it, <hi>viz.</hi> we <hi>muſt
practiſe the outward actions of the contrary Vertues.</hi>
We <hi>muſt do well,</hi> when we <hi>ceaſe to do evil.</hi> When
we turn from darkneſs, it muſt be to light, <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 18. Not from <hi>one</hi> kind of <hi>darkneſs</hi> to <hi>another.</hi>
When we <hi>ceaſe</hi> to <hi>oppreſs,</hi> we muſt be <hi>charitable;</hi>
when we leave to <hi>tyrannize</hi> over our <hi>inferiours,</hi>
we muſt be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>helpful</hi> to them. When we
forbear to <hi>ſlander,</hi> we muſt <hi>ſpeak</hi> all the <hi>good</hi> we can
of our Neighbour.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>outward</hi> actions of Vertue are in our <hi>power;</hi>
and 'tis ſomewhat to come ſo far as <hi>this:</hi> What is
<hi>more,</hi> viz. The <hi>inward love and delight in goodneſs,</hi>
will ſucceed in time, if we perſevere. 'Tis not
ſafe for us to propoſe to our ſelves the greateſt
heights at firſt; if we do, we are diſcouraged,
and fall back. God accepts even of that <hi>little,</hi>
if it be in order to <hi>more.</hi> He deſpiſeth not the
<hi>day of ſmall things,</hi> Zech. 4. 10. <hi>If thou doſt well,
ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> Chriſt <hi>loved</hi> the <hi>young man</hi>
who had kept the <hi>external</hi> part of the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
Mark 10. 12. If he had had the courage to
have proceeded; what he had done, would have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53432:18"/>
ſteaded him much. The <hi>inward</hi> love of <hi>Vertue</hi> and
<hi>Holineſs</hi> is promoted by the <hi>outward</hi> exerciſes of
them, and hereby the <hi>contrary</hi> evils are both <hi>pined</hi>
and <hi>thruſt out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus of the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing that <hi>Endeavour</hi> implies;
upon this muſt follow,</p>
                        <p>(2.) <hi>An attempt upon evil habits,</hi> viz. <hi>Thoſe</hi> that
have been ſuper-induced on us by <hi>Careleſneſs</hi> and
<hi>Temptation,</hi> bad <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>evil Company. Every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
is a means to another; we</hi> grow <hi>ſtronger,</hi> and
the <hi>enemy weaker</hi> by it. To have overcome the
<hi>outward</hi> acts of ſin, is a <hi>beginning</hi> in our <hi>ſpiritual</hi>
warfare; but our <hi>chief</hi> enemies are the <hi>habits;
theſe</hi> muſt be attempted alſo, but with <hi>Prudence;</hi>
wild <hi>Beaſts</hi> are not to be dealt with by <hi>main
ſtrength;</hi> Art and Stratagem muſt be uſed in this
War; and 'tis <hi>good policy,</hi> I think here, to fight
the <hi>leaſt</hi> powerful foes <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>contracted</hi> habits,
before we fall on the <hi>inbred natural</hi> Inclinations.
While our forces are weak, 'tis dangerous ſetting
upon the ſtrongeſt holds, <hi>viz.</hi> the vices of
<hi>Complexion,</hi> which are woven into our <hi>very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
If a man apply all his <hi>force</hi> where he hath
not <hi>reſolution</hi> enough to go through with what
he undertakes, he receives a foyl, and 'tis odds
but he ſits down and faints. <hi>Prudence</hi> therefore is
to be uſed, where we diſtruſt our ſtrength:
Fall upon <hi>Sin,</hi> where 'tis <hi>weakeſt,</hi> where it hath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53432:18"/>
                           <hi>leaſt</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and leaſt of <hi>Temptation;</hi> and
where we have arguments from <hi>Reputation</hi> and
<hi>worldly Intereſts</hi> wherewith to war againſt it. If
we <hi>prevail,</hi> we are heartned by the <hi>ſucceſs:</hi> Our
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reſolution</hi> will grow <hi>ſtronger</hi> by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
when we have triumph't over the ſins
of <hi>evil Cuſtom, Example,</hi> and <hi>ſenſual Indulgence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when that is done, we muſt remember
that 'tis not enough that thoſe <hi>habits</hi> are thruſt
out; <hi>others</hi> muſt be planted in their <hi>room:</hi> when
the foyl is <hi>prepared,</hi> the <hi>ſeed muſt</hi> be ſown, and the
<hi>ſeeds</hi> of vertuous <hi>habits,</hi> are the <hi>actions</hi> of vertue.
Theſe I recommended under the laſt head, and
ſhall ſay more of the introducing of <hi>habits,</hi> under
<hi>one</hi> that follows on purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>(3.) The next advance in our endeavours, is,
In the Strength of God, and in the Name of his
Son, to aſſault the greater Devils, and to ſtrive
to caſt out them; I mean the <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>Complexion,</hi>
and <hi>particular</hi> Nature. This is a <hi>great</hi> work, and
will require <hi>ſtrong Faith,</hi> and <hi>many Prayers,</hi> and
<hi>much Time,</hi> and <hi>great Watchfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>invincible
Reſolution:</hi> Imploy <hi>theſe heartily;</hi> and though thou
now and then mayſt receive a foyl, yet give not
off ſo, but riſe again in the ſtrength of <hi>God,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<hi>new</hi> aid, and fortifie thy ſelf with <hi>more</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
and <hi>deeper</hi> reſolves; and <hi>then</hi> renew
the <hi>Combat</hi> upon the <hi>encouragement</hi> of <hi>Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,</hi>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53432:19"/>
and <hi>Chriſt's Merits</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> and the
<hi>promiſe</hi> that ſin <hi>ſhall not have dominion over us,</hi> Rom.
6. 14.</p>
                        <p>Remember, that <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>great</hi> work, and the
biggeſt <hi>difficulty;</hi> if this be not overcome, all our
<hi>other labour</hi> hath been in <hi>vain,</hi> and will be <hi>loſt.</hi>
If this <hi>root</hi> remain, it will ſtill bear <hi>poyſonous</hi>
fruit, which will be <hi>matter</hi> for <hi>Temptation,</hi> and
occaſion of <hi>continual falling;</hi> and we ſhall be in
danger of being reconciled again to our <hi>old</hi> ſins,
and to <hi>undo</hi> all; and ſo <hi>our latter end will be worſe
than our beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20. Or, at leaſt,
though we ſtand at a ſtay, and ſatisfie our ſelves
with <hi>that;</hi> yet though we are <hi>contented,</hi> our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not <hi>ſafe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we will endeavour to any purpoſe of <hi>duty,</hi>
or <hi>ſecurity,</hi> we muſt <hi>proceed</hi> ſtill after our <hi>leſſer
conqueſts,</hi> till the <hi>ſins</hi> of <hi>Complexion</hi> are laid <hi>dead</hi> at
our feet. <hi>He that is born of God, ſinneth not, and
he cannot ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. Till we come to <hi>this,</hi>
we are but <hi>ſtrugling</hi> in the <hi>Birth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such a <hi>perfection</hi> as is <hi>mortifying</hi> of <hi>vitious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
is I hope <hi>attainable,</hi> and 'tis no doubt that
which <hi>Religion</hi> aims at; and though it be a <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
height,</hi> yet we muſt not ſit down this ſide: At
leaſt we muſt be always preſſing on to this Mark:
if Providence <hi>cut</hi> off our days before we have
arrived to it, we may expect acceptance of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53432:19"/>
the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of our endeavours, upon the account
of the <hi>merits</hi> of our Saviour: For he hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
favour for thoſe <hi>ſincere</hi> Believers and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers,
whoſe Day is done before their work is
compleated; <hi>this</hi> I mean, of ſubduing the <hi>darling</hi>
ſins of their <hi>particular Natures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But then if we <hi>reſt,</hi> and pleaſe our ſelves with
the <hi>little Victories</hi> and Attainments, and let theſe
our <hi>great Enemies</hi> quietly alone, 'tis an argument
our <hi>endeavours</hi> are not <hi>ſincere,</hi> but much ſhort of
that <hi>ſtriving,</hi> which will procure an <hi>entrance</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>ſtrait Gate.</hi> The next thing (and 'tis
the laſt I ſhall mention) which is implyed in
<hi>ſtriving,</hi> is,</p>
                        <p>(4.) <hi>To furniſh our ſelves, through Divine Grace,
with the Habits and Inclinations of Holineſs and Vertue.</hi>
For <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to become a kind of <hi>Nature</hi> to the
Soul, is an <hi>height</hi> indeed; but ſuch a one as <hi>may</hi> be
reacht: the new Nature, and New Creature, <hi>Gal.</hi>
6. 15. are not meer names.</p>
                        <p>We have obſerv'd that ſome men are of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Generoſity, Veracity</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs;</hi> and they
<hi>cannot</hi> act contrary to theſe <hi>Native</hi> Vertues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a mighty <hi>Violence:</hi> why now ſhould not the
<hi>New Nature</hi> be as <hi>powerful</hi> as the <hi>Old?</hi> And why
may not the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> working by an active
Faith and Endeavour, fix <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi>
on the Soul, as prevalent as <hi>thoſe?</hi> No doubt, it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53432:20"/>
                           <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>doth,</hi> upon the Diviner Souls: For whom
to do a <hi>wicked,</hi> or <hi>unworthy Action,</hi> 'twould be as
<hi>violent</hi> and <hi>unnatural,</hi> as for the <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
temper to <hi>butcher</hi> the <hi>innocent;</hi> or for him,
that is <hi>naturally juſt,</hi> to <hi>oppreſs</hi> and make a <hi>prey</hi> of
the <hi>Fatherleſs</hi> and the <hi>Widow:</hi> I ſay, ſuch a <hi>degree</hi>
of <hi>perfection</hi> as this, ſhould be aim'd at, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1.
and we ſhould not ſlacken or intermit our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
till it be attain'd.</p>
                        <p>In order to it, we are to uſe frequent <hi>meditation</hi>
on the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> of Vertue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and <hi>earneſt Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Grace</hi> of God;
and <hi>diligent attendance</hi> upon the <hi>publick worſhip;</hi> and
<hi>pious</hi> Company and Converſes: For this great
<hi>deſign,</hi> theſe helps are requiſite, and if we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
our ſelves in them as we ought, they will
<hi>fire</hi> our Souls with the <hi>love</hi> of God and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and ſo at laſt, <hi>all</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Vertues</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as <hi>natural</hi> to us, as <hi>ſin</hi> was before. And to
<hi>one</hi> that is ſo <hi>prepared,</hi> the <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> will
be <hi>open,</hi> and of <hi>eaſie</hi> entrance; the <hi>difficulties</hi> are
<hi>overcome,</hi> and from henceforth the <hi>way</hi> is <hi>pleaſant</hi>
and plain before him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have ſhewn, that the <hi>formidable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
may be <hi>overcome,</hi> and <hi>How:</hi> 'tis a <hi>plain courſe</hi>
I have <hi>directed,</hi> that will not puzzle mens <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings</hi>
with <hi>needleſs niceties,</hi> nor <hi>diſtract</hi> their <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi>
with <hi>multitudes.</hi> Let us walk in this way,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53432:20"/>
and do it <hi>conſtantly,</hi> with <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>alacrity;</hi> and
there is no fear, but in the <hi>Strength of</hi> God, through
the <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>mediation</hi> of his Son, we ſhall <hi>overcome,</hi>
and at laſt <hi>enter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I had now done with this <hi>general</hi> Head, but
that 'tis neceſſary to note three things more.</p>
                        <p>(1.) Thoſe <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of our Happineſs which
we muſt uſe in <hi>ſtriving,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith, Prayer,</hi> and
<hi>active Endeavour, muſt all of them be imployed.</hi> Not
any <hi>one</hi> ſingly, will do the great work; nor can
the <hi>others,</hi> if <hi>any one</hi> be wanting. If we <hi>believe,</hi>
and do not <hi>pray;</hi> or <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>do not endeavour;</hi>
or <hi>endeavour,</hi> without <hi>thoſe,</hi> the <hi>Difficulties</hi> will
remain, and 'twill be impoſſible for us to
<hi>enter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2.) <hi>We muſt be diligent in our courſe:</hi> If we
do not exerciſe <hi>Faith vigorouſly,</hi> and <hi>pray heartily,</hi>
and <hi>endeavour with our whole might,</hi> the means will
not ſucceed; and 'tis as good not at all, as not
to purpoſe. The Difficulties will not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by <hi>cold Faith,</hi> or <hi>ſleepy Prayers,</hi> or <hi>remiſs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours:</hi>
A very <hi>intenſe degree</hi> of theſe is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3.) <hi>Our ſtriving muſt be conſtant;</hi> we muſt
not <hi>begin,</hi> and <hi>look back,</hi> Heb. 10. 38. or <hi>run</hi> a
while, and <hi>ſtop</hi> in <hi>midd</hi> courſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. and
content our ſelves with <hi>ſome</hi> attainments, and
think we have <hi>arrived,</hi> Phil. 3. 14. If we do ſo,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53432:21"/>
we ſhall find our ſelves dangerouſly miſtaken.
The <hi>Crown</hi> is at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Warfare,</hi> and the <hi>Prize</hi>
at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Race.</hi> If we will ſucceed, we muſt
hold on: <hi>The life of one that ſtrives as he ought, muſt
be a continual motion forwards;</hi> always <hi>proceeding,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>growing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we <hi>ſtrive thus,</hi> we cannot <hi>fail;</hi> if any of theſe
<hi>qualifications</hi> be wanting, we <hi>cannot but</hi> miſcarry.
And hence no doubt it is, that many that <hi>ſeek</hi> to
<hi>enter, ſhall not be able,</hi> and the preſumed ſons of
the Kingdom are ſhut out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 12. They <hi>ſeek,</hi>
and are very deſirous to be admitted; They do
<hi>ſome</hi> thing, and <hi>ſtrive;</hi> but their <hi>ſtriving</hi> is <hi>partial,</hi>
or <hi>careleſs,</hi> or <hi>ſhort;</hi> by reaſon of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
they <hi>do</hi> not <hi>overcome,</hi> and <hi>ſhall</hi> not <hi>enter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a <hi>dangerous</hi> Rock, and perhaps there
are as many undone by <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>half ſtriving,</hi> as
by not <hi>ſtriving at all.</hi> He that hath done <hi>ſome</hi>
thing, <hi>preſumes</hi> he is <hi>ſecure;</hi> He goes the round of
ordinary Duties, but advanceth nothing in his
way; He <hi>overcometh</hi> none of the great <hi>Difficulties,</hi>
none of the <hi>Habits</hi> or <hi>depraved Inclinations;</hi> He is
contented with <hi>other</hi> things that make a more <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſhew;</hi> though they <hi>ſignifie leſs;</hi> and perhaps
deſpiſeth <hi>theſe,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Morality;</hi> and
ſo preſuming, that he is a <hi>Saint too ſoon,</hi> he never
comes to be <hi>one at all:</hi> ſuch are the <hi>Seekers that
ſhall not be able to enter:</hi> Their <hi>ſeeking</hi> imports
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53432:21"/>
                           <hi>ſome ſtriving;</hi> but 'tis <hi>ſuch,</hi> as, though it be <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi>
yet it is <hi>imperfect,</hi> and will not ſucceed. And
hence the <hi>Third Propoſition</hi> ariſeth, that I propoſed
to diſcourſe,</p>
                        <p>(III.) THat there is a ſort of Striving that will not
procure an entrance: <hi>implyed in theſe
words,</hi> For many will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not
be able.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a dangerous thing to be flattered into a
<hi>falſe peace;</hi> and to take up with <hi>imperfect Godlineſs;</hi>
to reconcile the <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> to our <hi>beloved
ſins,</hi> and to judge our condition <hi>ſafe</hi> upon <hi>inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
grounds. This</hi> multitudes <hi>do,</hi> and 'tis the great
danger of our days; Men cannot be <hi>contented</hi>
without doing <hi>ſomething</hi> in Religion; but they
are <hi>contented with a little.</hi> And then they reckon
themſelves <hi>godly,</hi> before they are <hi>vertuous;</hi> and
take themſelves to be <hi>Saints,</hi> upon ſuch things

                        </p>
                        <p>We ſeek after <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and would
be glad to know, <hi>how</hi> we might try our ſtate:
The thing is of great importance; and if the
<hi>Signs</hi> we judge by are either <hi>falſe,</hi> or <hi>imperfect,</hi>
we are deceived to our undoing. Meer <hi>Speculative</hi>
miſtakes about Opinions, do no great hurt: but
errour in the <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Meaſures</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is
deadly. Now there are ſundry things common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53432:22"/>
taken for <hi>ſigns</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> which though
they are <hi>ſomething,</hi> yet they are not <hi>enough;</hi> They
are <hi>hopeful</hi> for <hi>beginnings,</hi> but nothing worth when
they are our <hi>end</hi> and <hi>reſt.</hi> They are a kind of
<hi>ſeeking</hi> and <hi>imperfect ſtriving;</hi> but not <hi>ſuch</hi> as <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh</hi>
the <hi>difficulties</hi> of the way, or will procure
us an <hi>entrance</hi> at the <hi>Gate.</hi> Therefore to diſable
the <hi>flattering, inſufficient Marks</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> I ſhall
diſcover in purſuance of the <hi>Third Propoſition,
How far a man may ſtrive in the exerciſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet be found at laſt among thoſe ſeekers that
ſhall not be able to enter.</hi> And though I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
ſomething of this in the general before,
yet I ſhall now more particularly ſhew it in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi>
that follow. And in theſe I ſhall diſcover
a <hi>Religion</hi> that may be called <hi>Animal,</hi> to which the
<hi>natural</hi> man may attain.</p>
                        <p>(1.) A Man may believe the Truths of the Goſpel, and
aſſent heartily to all the Articles of the Creed: <hi>and if he</hi>
proceeds <hi>not, he is no further by</hi> this, <hi>than the</hi> faith <hi>of</hi>
Devils, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                        <p>(2.) He may go on, <hi>and have a great thirſt to be
more acquainted with Truth;</hi> he may ſeek it diligently
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> and good <hi>Books,</hi> and
<hi>knowing Company;</hi> And yet <hi>do this,</hi> by the <hi>motion</hi>
of no <hi>higher Principle,</hi> than an <hi>inbred</hi> Curioſity,
and <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and many times this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53432:22"/>
                           <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> after <hi>Truth,</hi> proceeds from a <hi>proud af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation</hi>
to be wiſer than our Neighbours, that we
may <hi>pity</hi> their <hi>darkneſs;</hi> or the itch of a diſputing
humour, that we may out-talk them; or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to carry on, or make a party, that we may
be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or ſerve an Intereſt: and the
<hi>zeal</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> that is ſet on work by ſuch motives,
is a <hi>ſpark</hi> of that <hi>fire</hi> that is from <hi>beneath:</hi> 'Tis
<hi>dangerous</hi> to a <hi>mans ſelf,</hi> and to the <hi>publick Weal</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>mankind,</hi> but the man proceeds,
and is,</p>
                        <p>(3.) <hi>Very much concern'd to defend and propagate
his Faith;</hi> and the Phariſees were ſo in relation
to theirs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 15. and <hi>ſo</hi> have been many
Profeſſors of <hi>all</hi> the Religions that are, or ever
were. Men <hi>naturally</hi> love their <hi>own</hi> Tenents,
and are ambitious to mould <hi>others judgements</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>theirs.</hi> There is <hi>glory</hi> in being an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor</hi>
of other men; and turning them to <hi>our
ways</hi> and <hi>opinions:</hi> So that here is nothing yet <hi>above</hi>
Nature; nothing but what may be found in <hi>many</hi>
that <hi>ſeek,</hi> and are <hi>ſhut out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(4.) <hi>Faith</hi> works greater effects than <hi>theſe,</hi> and
<hi>Men offer themſelves to Martyrdom for it; This,</hi> one
would think, ſhould be the <hi>greateſt</hi> height, and
an argument that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>difficulties</hi> of the way,
are <hi>overcome</hi> by one that is <hi>ſo reſolved;</hi> and that
the <hi>Gate</hi> cannot but be <hi>opened</hi> to him. And ſo, no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53432:23"/>
doubt, <hi>it is, when all things elſe are ſutable;</hi> But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>theſe</hi> conſequences by no means follow. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſuppoſeth that a man may give his <hi>Body to be
burned,</hi> and not have <hi>Charity,</hi> without which his
<hi>Martyrdom</hi> will not profit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. For one to
<hi>deny</hi> his Religion, or what he believes to be <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and of <hi>greateſt conſequence,</hi> is <hi>diſhonourable</hi> and
<hi>baſe:</hi> and <hi>ſome</hi> out of principles of meer <hi>natural
bravery,</hi> will <hi>die</hi> rather than they will do it; and
yet, upon other accounts be far enough from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>heroically vertuous.</hi> Beſides, the deſire of the
<hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Martyrdom</hi> and <hi>Saintſhip</hi> after it, may in
<hi>ſome</hi> be <hi>ſtronger</hi> than the <hi>terrours</hi> of <hi>Death:</hi> and we
ſee frequently, that men will ſacrifice their <hi>lives</hi>
to their <hi>Honour</hi> and Reputation; yea to the moſt
contemptible <hi>ſhadows</hi> of it. And there is no <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
in us ſo <hi>weak,</hi> no <hi>luſt</hi> ſo <hi>impotent,</hi> but hath, in
many inſtances, prevail'd over the <hi>fear of dying.
Every Appetite</hi> hath had its <hi>Martyrs;</hi> and all <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
theirs;</hi> and though a man give his Body to
be burnt for the <hi>beſt,</hi> and have not <hi>Charity,</hi> viz.
<hi>Prevalent love to God and Men,</hi> it will not ſignifie:
So that <hi>Martyrdom</hi> is no infallible <hi>mark,</hi> nor will
it avail any thing, except <hi>ſincere endeavour</hi> to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
the greater <hi>difficulties,</hi> have gone before it.
Thus far <hi>Faith</hi> may go without effect: and yet
one ſtep further.</p>
                        <p>

(5.) <hi>Men may confidently rely upon Chriſt for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and be firmly perſwaded that he hath juſtified, and
will make them happy.</hi> They may <hi>appropriate</hi> him
to themſelves, and be pleaſed mightily in the
opinion of his being <hi>theirs.</hi> And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this confidence may be in the number of
thoſe <hi>ſeekers</hi> that ſhall not <hi>enter.</hi> For Chriſt is
the Author of <hi>Eternal life,</hi> only <hi>to thoſe that obey
him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. and to <hi>obey</hi> him, is to <hi>ſtrive vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly</hi>
and <hi>conſtantly,</hi> to <hi>overcome</hi> all our <hi>ſinful Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
and <hi>Habits.</hi> And thoſe that <hi>truſt</hi> he will
ſave them, though they have never ſeriouſly ſet
about <hi>this work,</hi> deceive themſelves by vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
and in effect ſay, that he will diſſolve
or diſpenſe with his Laws in their favour. For
he requires us to <hi>deny our ſelves,</hi> Mar. 8. 34. <hi>To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the body,</hi> Rom. 8. 13. <hi>To love enemies,</hi> Mat. 5.
44. <hi>To be meek,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. <hi>and patient,</hi> Jam. 5. 8.
<hi>and humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. <hi>and juſt,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. <hi>and
charitable,</hi> Heb. 13. 16. <hi>and holy, as he that called
us is holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15. And he hath promiſed to
ſave upon no other terms; For all <hi>theſe</hi> are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in <hi>Faith,</hi> when 'tis taken in the <hi>juſtifying</hi> ſenſe;
and <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Salvation:</hi> If
we walk not in <hi>this,</hi> but in the paths of our own
chooſing, our <hi>relying upon Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>mockery,</hi> and will
deceive us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53432:24"/>
We <hi>may</hi> indeed be <hi>confident,</hi> and we <hi>ought,</hi> that
he will <hi>ſave</hi> all thoſe that <hi>ſo believe</hi> as to <hi>obey</hi> him;
but may not truſt that he will ſave us except we
are ſome of thoſe. To <hi>rely upon Chriſt for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
muſt follow our ſincere and obedient ſtriving, and
not go before it.</hi> The miſtake of this is exceeding
dangerous, and I doubt hath been fatal to many.
The ſum is, to <hi>rely on Chriſt,</hi> without a <hi>reſolute</hi> and
<hi>ſteady</hi> endeavour to overcome every ſin and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
will gain us nothing in the end but
ſhame and diſappointment: <hi>For 'tis not every one
that ſaith unto him, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into Heaven,
but he that doth the will of his Father which is in Heaven,</hi>
Mat. 7. 21. The fooliſh Virgins relyed upon
him, and expected he ſhould open to them;
<hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> Mat. 25. 11. but he kept
them out, and would not <hi>know</hi> them, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thus of the</hi> Firſt <hi>imperfect</hi> Mark <hi>of</hi> Godlineſs;
A man may upon the account of meer Nature, arrive
to all the mentioned degrees of Faith; and yet, if his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
in the practice of Chriſtian vertues be not ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he will certainly come ſhort at laſt.</p>
                        <p>(II.) A man may be very <hi>devout,</hi> given much
to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and be very <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> in <hi>it;</hi>
He may have the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>expreſſing</hi> himſelf <hi>fluent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
without the help of <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Meditation;</hi> yea,
and ſo <hi>intent</hi> and taken up in theſe exerciſes, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53432:24"/>
he may as it were be raviſh't out of himſelf by
the <hi>fervours</hi> of his <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſo that he really kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
very <hi>high Affections</hi> as well in others, as in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
And yet if he <hi>reſts</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> and ſuch like
things, as <hi>Religion,</hi> and reckons that he is accepted
of God for it; if he allow himſelf in any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified</hi>
luſts, and thinks to <hi>compound</hi> for them by
his <hi>Prayers,</hi> he is <hi>an evil man</hi> notwithſtanding, and
one of thoſe <hi>ſeekers</hi> that ſhall <hi>not be able to enter.</hi>
The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> we know, were <hi>much given</hi> to
<hi>Prayer:</hi> They were <hi>long</hi> in thoſe <hi>Devotions,</hi> and
very <hi>earneſt in them,</hi> often repeating the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
out of vehemence. <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi>
founder of the Jeſuites, was a man almoſt <hi>ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
in his <hi>Prayers;</hi> and <hi>Hacket</hi> the Blaſphemer,
executed in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was a
perſon of <hi>Seraphical Devotion,</hi> and would <hi>pray</hi>
thoſe that heard him even into <hi>tranſports. Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides</hi>
the cruel Duke of <hi>Moſco,</hi> is ſaid to have his
hands almoſt continually lifted up in Prayer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
when they were imployed in ſome barbarous
and bloody Execution: And we have <hi>known</hi> and
<hi>felt</hi> one not much unlike him. There are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
inſtances in our days of this <hi>dangerous</hi> ſort of
<hi>evil men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And we may learn hence, that the greateſt gift
of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> in it, is no
good <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> except it be attended
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53432:25"/>
with <hi>ſincere, conſtant</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> endeavours.</p>
                        <p>For ſome men have a <hi>natural ſpice</hi> of <hi>Devotion</hi> in
<hi>a Religious Melancholy,</hi> which is their temper; and
<hi>ſuch</hi> have commonly <hi>ſtrong Imaginations</hi> and <hi>zealous
affections,</hi> which when they are heated, <hi>flame forth</hi>
into great <hi>heights</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi> of <hi>Devotion:</hi> The
<hi>warm Fancy</hi> furniſheth <hi>words</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> readily and
unexpectedly, which many times begets in the
man a conceit that he is <hi>inſpired,</hi> and that his <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
are the <hi>breathings</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> or at leaſt,
that he is <hi>extraordinarily</hi> aſſiſted by it; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
kindles his affections yet <hi>more,</hi> and he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
beyond himſelf, even into the <hi>third Heavens,</hi>
and <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> as he fancies, and <hi>ſo</hi> he
makes no doubt, but that he is a <hi>Saint</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi>
rank, and ſpecial favourite of Heaven; when all
this while, he may be really a <hi>bad</hi> man full of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
and <hi>Malice; Pride</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs; Scorn</hi> and
<hi>ill Nature; contempt of his Betters,</hi> and <hi>diſobedience to
his Governours:</hi> And while it is <hi>ſo,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe <hi>glorious</hi> things, he is no further than the
<hi>Phariſee. Hearty</hi> and <hi>humble deſire,</hi> though <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi>
expreſt, and without this <hi>pomp,</hi> and thoſe
<hi>wonders,</hi> is far more acceptable to God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
not in the <hi>exerciſes</hi> of <hi>meer Nature,</hi> Pſal. 147.
10. but is well pleaſed with the expreſſions of
<hi>Grace</hi> in thoſe that fear him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53432:25"/>
So that a <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>lowly-minded</hi> Chriſtian that
talks of no <hi>immediate</hi> incomes, or <hi>communications;</hi>
and perhaps durſt not, out of <hi>reverence,</hi> truſt to
his own preſent conceptions in a work ſo <hi>ſolemn,</hi>
but uſeth the help of ſome <hi>pious form</hi> of words
ſutable to his <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>wants,</hi> who is duly <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of his <hi>ſins,</hi> and the neceſſity of <hi>overcoming</hi> them;
and is <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>earneſtly</hi> deſirous of the Divine
<hi>aids,</hi> in order to it: ſuch a one as <hi>this</hi> prays by
the Spirit, and will be aſſiſted by it; while the
<hi>other</hi> doth all by <hi>meer Nature</hi> and <hi>Imitation,</hi> and
ſhall not have thoſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> aids which he never
<hi>heartily deſires</hi> nor <hi>intends</hi> to <hi>uſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This, I think, I may <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>ſafely</hi> ſay: But
for the Controverſie between <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Conceived
Prayers,</hi> which of them is <hi>abſolutely beſt,</hi> I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
nothing of it here. And indeed I ſuppoſe
that in their own nature, they are alike indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and are more or leſs accepted, as they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
more or leſs of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> viz. of
<hi>Faith, Humility</hi> and <hi>holy deſire</hi> of the good things
we pray for; and a man may <hi>have theſe</hi> that prays
by a <hi>Form;</hi> and he may <hi>want</hi> them that takes the
<hi>other</hi> way, and thinks himſelf in a diſpenſation
much above it. So that my buſineſs is not to ſet
up one of theſe ways of Devotion againſt the
other, but to ſhew, that the <hi>heights</hi> and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of many <hi>warm</hi> people in their <hi>unpremeditated</hi>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53432:26"/>
Prayers, have nothing in them <hi>ſupernatural</hi> or
<hi>Divine;</hi> and conſequently, of themſelves, they
are no <hi>marks</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs:</hi> which I hope no one
thinks I ſpeak to diſcredit thoſe <hi>pious</hi> ardours that
are felt by <hi>really devout</hi> Souls, when a <hi>vigorous</hi>
ſenſe of God, and Divine things, doth even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tranſport them; Far be it from me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
any thing ſo <hi>impious;</hi> my aim is only to note,
that there are <hi>complexional heats</hi> raiſed many times
by <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>ſelf-admiration,</hi> that look like <hi>theſe,</hi> in
perſons who really have little of God in them;
and we ſhould take care that we are not deceived
by them. <hi>Thus far</hi> alſo thoſe may go that <hi>ſhall not
enter.</hi> I add,</p>
                        <p>(<hi>III.</hi>) A man may endeavour ſomewhat, and ſtrive in
ſome degree, and yet his work may miſcarry, and himſelf
with it.</p>
                        <p>(1.) There is no doubt, but that an evil
man may be <hi>convinced</hi> of his <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>vileneſs,</hi>
and that even to <hi>anguiſh</hi> and <hi>torment.</hi> The
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 2. 14. which
have not the Law, ſhew the works of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their Hearts, their thoughts in the mean time
accuſing, or excuſing one another.</hi> Conſcience of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſtings and diſquiets the vileſt ſinners; and
ſometimes extorts from them <hi>lamentable confeſſion</hi>
of their ſins, and <hi>earneſt declamations</hi> againſt them.
They may <hi>weep bitterly</hi> at their remembrance, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53432:26"/>
be under great heavineſs and dejection upon their
occaſion. They may <hi>ſpeak vehemently</hi> againſt
ſin themſelves, and love to have others to handle
it ſeverely. All this bad men may do upon the
ſcore of <hi>natural fear</hi> and <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and the <hi>apprehenſion</hi>
of a <hi>future judgement.</hi> And now ſuch <hi>convictions</hi> will
<hi>naturally</hi> beget ſome <hi>endeavours:</hi> A <hi>convinced under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi>
will have ſome influence upon the <hi>will</hi> and
<hi>affections.</hi> The <hi>mind</hi> in the <hi>unregenerate,</hi> may luſt
againſt the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> doth againſt <hi>it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that (2.) ſuch a meer <hi>animal man</hi> may <hi>promiſe,</hi>
and <hi>purpoſe,</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> in ſome conſiderable
meaſure; but then, he goes not on with <hi>full</hi>
Reſolution, but <hi>wavers</hi> and ſtops, and <hi>turns about</hi>
again; and lets the <hi>law</hi> of the <hi>members,</hi> that of
<hi>death</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> to prevail over him. His <hi>endeavour</hi> is
<hi>remiſs,</hi> and conſequently <hi>ineffectual;</hi> it makes no
<hi>conqueſts,</hi> and will not <hi>ſignifie.</hi> He <hi>ſins on,</hi> though
with <hi>ſome regret;</hi> and his very unwillingneſs to
ſin, while he commits it, is ſo far from <hi>leſſening,</hi>
that it <hi>aggravates</hi> his <hi>fault:</hi> It argues that he ſins
againſt <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>conviction;</hi> and that <hi>ſin</hi> is ſtrong
and reigns.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis true indeed, St.</hi> Paul, <hi>Rom. 7. makes ſuch
a deſcription ſeemingly of</hi> himſelf, <hi>as one might
think concluded him under this ſtate; he ſaith
verſ.</hi> 8. That ſin wrought in him all manner of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence:
<hi>verſ.</hi> 9. That ſin revived, and he died: <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53432:27"/>
That he was carnal; <hi>and again,</hi> ſold under ſin: <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.
That ſin dwelt in him, and wrought that which he would

captivity to the law of Sin: <hi>and verſ.</hi> 25. That he
obeyed the law of ſin.</p>
                        <p>If this be <hi>ſo,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>regenerate man,</hi> was
in <hi>this</hi> ſtate, it will follow, that <hi>ſeeking</hi> and <hi>feeble
endeavour,</hi> that overcometh no difficulty, may yet
<hi>procure</hi> an <hi>entrance,</hi> and he that is come hitherto,
<hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>endeavour,</hi> is <hi>ſafe</hi> enough though he do not
conquer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This objection</hi> preſſeth not only againſt <hi>this head,</hi>
but againſt my whole Diſcourſe, and the Text it
ſelf. Therefore to anſwer it, I ſay, That the
St. <hi>Paul</hi> here is not to be underſtood of <hi>himſelf;</hi>
He deſcribes the <hi>ſtate</hi> of a convinced, but <hi>unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
man,</hi> though he ſpeaks in the firſt perſon;
a <hi>Figure</hi> that was ordinary with <hi>this</hi> Apoſtle, and
<hi>frequent</hi> enough in common ſpeech: Thus we
ſay, <hi>I am thus,</hi> and <hi>thus,</hi> and did <hi>ſo,</hi> and <hi>ſo,</hi> when
we are deſcribing a ſtate, or actions in which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
we, in perſon, are not concerned.</p>
                        <p>In this ſenſe the beſt Expoſitors underſtand
theſe expreſſions, and thoſe excellent Divines of
our own, Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and
others have noted to us, That this <hi>deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is directly contrary to all the <hi>Characters</hi> of a
<hi>regenerate man,</hi> given elſewhere by <hi>this,</hi> and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53432:27"/>
other Apoſtles. As he is ſaid to be <hi>dead to ſin,</hi>
Rom. 6. 11. <hi>Free from ſin,</hi> and the <hi>ſervant of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
Rom. 6. 18. That <hi>he walks not after the
Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>That the law of
the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made him free from
the Law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. <hi>That he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
the world,</hi> Joh. 5. 4. <hi>He ſinneth not,</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 6. <hi>He hath crucified the fleſh with its affections and
luſts,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. Which <hi>Characters</hi> of a <hi>truly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi>
perſon, if they be compared with thoſe
above-cited out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. it will appear, that
they are as contrary, as 'tis poſſible to ſpeak, and
by this 'tis evident that they deſcribe the <hi>two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſtates.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For can the <hi>regenerate</hi> be <hi>full</hi> of all <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence,</hi>
and at the ſame time be <hi>crucified to the
Fleſh,</hi> and its <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>luſts? one</hi> in whom <hi>ſin
revives while he dies;</hi> and yet one that is <hi>dead to ſin?
carnal,</hi> and yet <hi>not walking after the fleſh, but after
the Spirit? ſold under ſin,</hi> and yet <hi>free from ſin? Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſin dwelling in him; and a captive to ſin; and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law of ſin;</hi> and yet <hi>free from the law of ſin and
death?</hi> how can theſe things conſiſt? To tell us,
<hi>'Tis ſo,</hi> and <hi>'tis not ſo,</hi> and to twiſt ſuch <hi>contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
into <hi>Orthodox Paradoxes,</hi> are pretty things to
pleaſe <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> but <hi>wiſe men</hi> care not for
<hi>riddles</hi> that are not ſenſe. For my part I think it
clear, that the Apoſtle in that miſtaken Chapter,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53432:28"/>
relates the <hi>feeble, impotent condition</hi> of <hi>one</hi> that was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi>
and <hi>ſtrove a little,</hi> but not to <hi>purpoſe.</hi> And
if we find our ſelves compriſed under that <hi>deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi>
though we may be never ſo ſenſible of the
<hi>evil</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of a <hi>ſinful courſe,</hi> and may <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
ſome ſmall matter, but without <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> we
are yet under <hi>that evil,</hi> and <hi>obnoxious</hi> to <hi>that danger:</hi>
For he that <hi>ſtrives</hi> in <hi>earneſt, conquers at laſt,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth
ſtill,</hi> though all the <hi>work</hi> be not <hi>done at once.</hi>
So that if we <hi>endeavour</hi> and <hi>gain</hi> nothing, our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
is <hi>peccant,</hi> and wants <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> for
<hi>Divine aids,</hi> or <hi>conſtancy,</hi> or <hi>vigour;</hi> and ſo, <hi>Though
we may ſeek, we ſhall not be able to enter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But (3.) an <hi>imperfect Striver</hi> may <hi>overcome</hi> ſin
in <hi>ſome</hi> Inſtances, and yet in <hi>that</hi> do no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
neither, if he <hi>lies down,</hi> and goes no <hi>further:</hi>
There are <hi>ſome</hi> ſins we outgrow by <hi>age,</hi> or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed
to them by <hi>bodily infirmity,</hi> or diverted by
<hi>occaſions,</hi> and it may be by other ſins; and <hi>ſome</hi>
are contrary to <hi>worldly Intereſts,</hi> to our <hi>credit,</hi>
or <hi>health,</hi> or <hi>profit;</hi> and when we have in any
great degree been hurt by <hi>them</hi> in <hi>theſe,</hi> we fall
out with <hi>thoſe</hi> ſins, and <hi>ceaſe</hi> from them, and ſo
by <hi>reſolution</hi> and <hi>diſuſe,</hi> we maſter them at laſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
which, if we went on, and attempted upon
all the reſt, were ſomething: But when we ſtop
ſhort in theſe <hi>petty</hi> victories, our <hi>general ſtate</hi> is not
<hi>altered;</hi> He that conquers <hi>ſome</hi> evil appetites, is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53432:28"/>
yet a ſlave to <hi>others,</hi> and though he hath <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
over <hi>ſome difficulties,</hi> yet the <hi>main ones</hi> are yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
                        <p>Thus the <hi>imperfect Striver</hi> maſters, it may be,
his beaſtly appetite to <hi>intemperate</hi> drinking, but is
yet under the power of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>vain
Pleaſure.</hi> He ceaſeth from open <hi>debauchery,</hi> but
entertains <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſs</hi> in his heart: He will
not <hi>Swear,</hi> but will <hi>backbite</hi> and <hi>rail:</hi> He will not be
<hi>Drunk,</hi> but will <hi>damn</hi> a man for not being of <hi>his
opinion:</hi> He will not <hi>prophane the Sabbath,</hi> but will
<hi>defraud</hi> his Neighbour.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe <hi>half</hi> conqueſts, when we <hi>reſt</hi> in
<hi>them,</hi> are as good as <hi>none</hi> at all. <hi>Then ſhall I not
be aſhamed, when I have regard to all thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
ſaith the Kingly Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. 'Tis <hi>ſhameful</hi> to give off, when our work is but
<hi>half</hi> done; <hi>what</hi> we <hi>do,</hi> caſt the greater reproach
upon us for what we omit. To <hi>ceaſe to be prophane,</hi>
is ſomething as a <hi>paſſage,</hi> but nothing for <hi>an end.</hi>
We are not <hi>Saints</hi> as ſoon as we are <hi>civil.</hi> 'Tis
not only <hi>groſs ſins</hi> that are to be <hi>overcome:</hi> The
<hi>wages of ſin is death,</hi> not only of the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,</hi>
but of the <hi>ſmalleſt,</hi> if they are indulged. The
<hi>Phariſee</hi> applauded himſelf, that he was not like
the <hi>Extortioners, Adulterers</hi> and <hi>Unjuſt,</hi> nor like
the <hi>Publican,</hi> that came to pray with him, <hi>Luk.</hi>
18. 11. and yet he went away never the more
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53432:29"/>
                           <hi>juſtified.</hi> The <hi>unwiſe Virgins</hi> were no <hi>profligate Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
and yet they were <hi>ſhut out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He that will enter, muſt ſtrive againſt <hi>every</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
appetite and inclination. A <hi>leſs</hi> leak will
ſink a Ship, as well as a <hi>greater,</hi> if no care be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of it. A <hi>Conſumption</hi> will <hi>kill,</hi> as well as the
<hi>Plague;</hi> yea ſometimes the <hi>leſs</hi> Diſeaſe may in the
event prove more deadly, than the <hi>greater;</hi> for
ſmall diſtempers may be neglected, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>incurable;</hi> whenas the <hi>great</hi> ones awaken us
to ſpeedy care for a remedy. A <hi>ſmall</hi> hurt in the
finger <hi>ſlighted,</hi> may prove a <hi>Gangreen,</hi> when a
<hi>great wound</hi> in the <hi>Head</hi> by ſeaſonable applications
is <hi>cured.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis unſafe then to content our ſelves with
<hi>this,</hi> that our ſins are not <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>great; thoſe</hi> we
account <hi>little ones,</hi> may prove as <hi>fatal,</hi> yea, they
are ſometimes more <hi>dangerous:</hi> For we are apt to
think them <hi>none at all,</hi> or <hi>Venial infirmities</hi> that may
conſiſt with <hi>a ſtate of Grace,</hi> and Divine favour:
we <hi>excuſe</hi> and make Apologies for them; and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion</hi> are
atonements enough for <hi>theſe.</hi> Upon which accounts
I am apt to believe, that the leſs notorious Vices
have ruined as many as the greateſt Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Hell doth not conſiſt only of <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and
<hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>Sabbath-breakers:</hi> No, the <hi>demure
Phariſee,</hi> the <hi>plauſible Hypocrite,</hi> and <hi>formal Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53432:29"/>
have their place alſo in <hi>that lake</hi> of fire. The
<hi>great</hi> impieties do often <hi>ſtartle</hi> and <hi>awaken</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and beget ſtrong convictions, and ſo
ſometimes excite reſolution and vigorous ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
while men hug themſelves in their <hi>leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
ſins,</hi> and carry them unrepented of to their
Graves.</p>
                        <p>The ſum is, we may <hi>overcome ſome ſins,</hi> and turn
from the <hi>groſſer ſorts</hi> of <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and yet if we
endeavour not to ſubdue the <hi>reſt,</hi> we are ſtill in
the condition of <hi>unregeneracy</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and though
we <hi>thus ſeek,</hi> we ſhall not <hi>enter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(4.) A man may perform many duties of Religion,
and that with reliſh and delight, and yet miſcarry. <hi>As,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1.) He may be <hi>earneſt</hi> and <hi>ſwift</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> and
follow Sermons conſtantly from one place to
another, and be exceedingly pleaſed and affected
with the Word, and yet be an <hi>evil Man,</hi> and in a
<hi>bad ſtate. Herod heard John Baptiſt gladly,</hi> Mark 6.
20. and he that received the ſeed into ſtony
places, received it <hi>joyfully,</hi> Mat. 13. 20. <hi>Zeal</hi> for
<hi>hearing</hi> doth not always ariſe from a <hi>conſcientious</hi>
deſire to learn in order to <hi>practice,</hi> but ſometimes
it proceeds from an itch after <hi>novelty</hi> and <hi>notions,</hi>
or an ambition to be <hi>famed</hi> for <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> or the
<hi>importunity</hi> of natural <hi>conſcience,</hi> that will not be
ſatisfied except we <hi>do ſomething;</hi> or a deſire to get
matter to <hi>feed</hi> our <hi>opinions,</hi> or to furniſh us with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53432:30"/>
                           <hi>pious</hi> diſcourſe? I ſay, <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> ariſeth
very often from ſome of theſe; and when it
doth <hi>ſo,</hi> we gain but <hi>little by it:</hi> yea, we are
dangerouſly tempted to take this for an <hi>infallible
token</hi> of our <hi>Saintſhip,</hi> and ſo to content our ſelves
with this <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Ear,</hi> and to diſturb every
body with the abundance of our <hi>diſputes</hi> and <hi>talk,</hi>
while we neglect our own <hi>Spirits,</hi> and let our
<hi>unmortified affections</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> reſt in quiet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſhadow of theſe <hi>ſpecious</hi> ſervices.</p>
                        <p>So that when a great <hi>affection</hi> to <hi>hearing</hi> ſeizeth
upon an <hi>evil man,</hi> 'tis odds but it doth him <hi>hurt;</hi>
it puffs him up in the <hi>conceit</hi> of his <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and
makes him <hi>pragmatical, troubleſome</hi> and <hi>cenſorious;</hi>
He turns his <hi>food</hi> into <hi>poyſon: Among bad men, thoſe
are certainly the worſt, that have an opinion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
godly;</hi> and ſuch are thoſe that have <hi>itching ears,</hi>
under the power of <hi>vitious habits</hi> and <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Thus an <hi>earneſt diligent</hi> hearer, may be
one of thoſe who <hi>ſeeks,</hi> and is <hi>ſhut out.</hi> And
ſo may</p>
                        <p>(2.) He that <hi>Faſts</hi> much, and <hi>ſeverely:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi>
were exceedingly given to <hi>faſting,</hi> and they were
very ſevere in it. They abſtained from all things
pleaſant to them, and put on <hi>ſackcloath,</hi> and <hi>ſowr
looks,</hi> and <hi>mourned bitterly,</hi> and <hi>hung down</hi> the head, and
<hi>ſate</hi> in <hi>aſhes;</hi> ſo that one might have taken theſe for
very <hi>holy, penitent, mortified people</hi> that had a great <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi>
                           <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53432:30"/>
againſt their <hi>ſins,</hi> and <hi>abhorrence</hi> of <hi>themſelves</hi> for
them: And yet God complains of theſe <hi>ſtrict ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Faſters,</hi> Zach. 7. 5. <hi>That they did not Faſt unto
him;</hi> but faſted for <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>debate,</hi> Iſa. 58. 4.
Their <hi>Faſts</hi> were not <hi>ſuch as he had choſen, to looſe
the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burden, and
to let the oppreſſed free,</hi> verſ. 6. But they continued,
notwithſtanding their <hi>Faſts,</hi> and God's admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by his Prophets, to <hi>oppreſs the Widow, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs,
and Poor,</hi> Zach. 7. 10.</p>
                        <p>Thus meer <hi>natural</hi> and evil men ſometimes
put on the garb of <hi>Mortification,</hi> and exerciſe <hi>rigors</hi>
upon their <hi>Bodies</hi> and external perſons, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for the <hi>indulgences</hi> they allow their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>appetites;</hi> and while the ſtrict Diſcipline reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no further, though we <hi>keep days,</hi> and <hi>Faſt</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
yet this will not put us beyond the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who <hi>faſted twice in the week,</hi> as
himſelf boaſted, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 12. And,</p>
                        <p>(3.) <hi>An imperfect ſtriver may be very much given
to pious and religious diſcourſes:</hi> He may love to be
talking of Divine things; eſpecially of the <hi>love</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>ſinners,</hi> which he may frequently ſpeak
of with much <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> and have
that <hi>dear name</hi> always at his tongues end to <hi>begin</hi>
and <hi>cloſe</hi> all his ſayings; and to <hi>fill</hi> up the <hi>void</hi>
places, when he wants what to ſay next; and
yet <hi>this</hi> may be a <hi>bad</hi> man, who never felt thoſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53432:31"/>
Divine things he talks of; and never <hi>loved Chriſt</hi>
heartily as he ought.</p>
                        <p>'Twas obſerved before, that there are ſome
who have a ſort of <hi>Devoutneſs,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in
their particular <hi>Complexion;</hi> and if ſuch are <hi>talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
(as many times they are) they will eaſily
run into <hi>ſuch</hi> diſcourſes, as <hi>agree</hi> with their <hi>temper,</hi>
and take pleaſure in them for <hi>that</hi> reaſon; As alſo
for <hi>this,</hi> becauſe they are apt to gain us reverence,
and the good opinion of thoſe with whom we
converſe. And ſuch as are by nature diſpoſed
for this faculty, may eaſily get it by <hi>imitation</hi> and
remembrance of the <hi>devout forms</hi> they hear and
read: ſo that there may be nothing <hi>Divine</hi> in <hi>all
this;</hi> nothing but what may conſiſt with <hi>unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
luſts and affections: And though ſuch talk
earneſtly of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and expreſs a
mighty love to his <hi>name,</hi> yet this may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any real conformity unto him in his <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Laws.</hi> The Jews ſpake much of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
in him they <hi>believed,</hi> and in him they <hi>truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
John 5. 45. His <hi>name</hi> was a <hi>ſweet</hi> ſound
to their ears, and 'twas very <hi>pleaſant</hi> upon
their <hi>Tongues;</hi> and yet they <hi>hated</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and had no love to thoſe Laws of his which
condemned their wicked actions. And we may
ſee how many of thoſe <hi>love Chriſt,</hi> that ſpeak of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and affectionately of him, by obſerving how
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53432:31"/>
they <hi>keep his Commandments,</hi> John 14. 15. eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>thoſe</hi> of <hi>Meekneſs, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>univerſal
Love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>imperfect Strivers</hi> may imploy themſelves
in the <hi>external offices</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> I have inſtanced
only in <hi>Three,</hi> the like may be ſaid of the reſt. And
to this, I add,</p>
                        <p>(IV.) <hi>That they may not only exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the</hi> outward <hi>matters of duty, but</hi> may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to ſome things that are accounted greater heights,
and are really more ſpiritual, and refined. <hi>To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1.) They may have <hi>ſome love</hi> to <hi>God, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and <hi>good Men.</hi> The Soul naturally loves
<hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Perfection;</hi> and all mankind appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<hi>God,</hi> to be of all <hi>Beings,</hi> the moſt <hi>beautiful</hi>
and <hi>perfect;</hi> and therefore muſt needs have an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
love</hi> for him: The reaſon that <hi>that love</hi>
takes no hold of the <hi>paſſions</hi> in <hi>wicked</hi> men, is,
partly becauſe they are <hi>diverted</hi> from the thoughts
of Him, by the <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>Senſe;</hi> but chiefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they conſider him as their <hi>enemy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can have no <hi>complacency</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> in him, who
they think hath nothing but thoughts of <hi>enmity,</hi>
and diſpleaſure againſt them. But if once they
come to be perſwaded (as many times, by ſuch
falſe marks, as I have recited, they <hi>are</hi>) that God
is their <hi>Father,</hi> and peculiar <hi>Friend;</hi> that <hi>they</hi> are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53432:32"/>
his <hi>choſen,</hi> and his <hi>darlings,</hi> whom he loved from
<hi>Eternity,</hi> and to whom he hath given his <hi>Son</hi> and
his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and will give <hi>Himſelf,</hi> in a way of
the fulleſt enjoyment; Then the <hi>Love</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was only an <hi>eſteem</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> doth
<hi>kindle</hi> in the <hi>affections</hi> by the help of the <hi>conceit</hi>
of <hi>Gods loving them ſo dearly,</hi> and the <hi>paſſion</hi> thus
heated, runs out, even into <hi>ſeraphick,</hi> and <hi>rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
Devotions;</hi> while yet all <hi>this,</hi> is but <hi>meer ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
love,</hi> excited chiefly, by the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>our ſelves,</hi>
not of the <hi>Divine Perfections.</hi> And it commonly
goes no further, than to <hi>earneſt</hi> expreſſions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
love to God in our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,</hi>
while it appears not in any <hi>ſingular obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to his <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>univerſal love</hi> to
mankind: which are the ways whereby the true
<hi>Divine Love</hi> is expreſt: for, <hi>This is the love of God,
that we keep his Commandments,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3. And as to the <hi>other, thus, If we love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us,</hi>
1 Joh. 4. 12. And on the contrary, <hi>If a man ſay I love
God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar,</hi> John 4. 20.
<hi>Charity</hi> then <hi>and univerſal obedience</hi> are the <hi>true</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and expreſſions of our love to God; and
<hi>theſe</hi> ſuppoſe a <hi>victory</hi> over corrupt <hi>inclinations</hi> and
<hi>ſelf-will.</hi> But the other love which ariſeth from
the conceit of our <hi>ſpecial dearneſs</hi> to God upon <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient</hi>
grounds; <hi>that</hi> goes no further than to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53432:32"/>
ſome <hi>ſuavities,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant fancies</hi> within our ſelves;
and ſome <hi>paſſionate</hi> complements of the <hi>Image</hi> we
have ſet up in our imaginations. <hi>This</hi> Love will
conſiſt with <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of all that are not
like our ſelves; yea, and it will produce it:
thoſe poyſonous fruits, and <hi>vile</hi> affections may
be incouraged, and cheriſh'd under it. So that
there may be <hi>ſome love to God</hi> in <hi>evil</hi> men: But
while ſelf-love is the <hi>only motive,</hi> and the more
<hi>prevalent</hi> paſſion, it ſignifieth nothing to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                        <p>And as the <hi>imperfect ſtriver</hi> may have ſome <hi>love</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> ſo he <hi>may</hi> to <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>vertue:</hi> every man
loves theſe in <hi>Idea.</hi> The vileſt ſinner takes part
in his <hi>affections</hi> with the <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>religious,</hi>
when he ſeeth them deſcribed in <hi>Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;</hi>
and hath a deteſtation for <hi>thoſe,</hi> who are
character'd as <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>immoral. Vertue</hi> is a great
<hi>Beauty,</hi> and the mind is taken with it, while 'tis
conſider'd at a diſtance; and our corrupt <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,</hi>
and ſenſual <hi>affections</hi> are not concern'd. 'Tis
<hi>Theſe</hi> that recommend <hi>ſin</hi> to our <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>choice,</hi>
while the <hi>mind</hi> ſtands on the ſide of vertue: with
<hi>that we ſerve the Law of God,</hi> but with the <hi>fleſh the
Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7. 25. So that moſt <hi>wicked</hi>
men, that are not degenerated into meer Brutes,
have this <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>intellectual</hi> love to <hi>goodneſs:</hi>
That is, they <hi>approve,</hi> and <hi>like</hi> it in their <hi>minds,</hi>
                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53432:33"/>
and would <hi>practiſe</hi> it alſo, were it not for the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi>
biaſs of <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And hence it will follow likewiſe, That the
<hi>ſame</hi> may <hi>approve</hi> and <hi>reſpect good men;</hi> They may
reverence and love them for their <hi>Charity, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> though themſelves
are perſons of the <hi>contrary Character;</hi> yea, they
may have a great and ardent affection for thoſe
that are eminently <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>devout,</hi> though they
are very <hi>irreligious</hi> themſelves. The <hi>conſcience</hi> of
<hi>vertue,</hi> and of the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this in the meer <hi>natural</hi> man, who is under
the <hi>dominion</hi> of <hi>vile inclinations</hi> and <hi>affections;</hi> and
therefore, neither is <hi>this</hi> a good <hi>mark of godlineſs.</hi>
Our <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> will not ſtead us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be <hi>prevalent.</hi> And as the <hi>love</hi> deſcribed, may
be <hi>natural,</hi> and a <hi>meer animal</hi> man may arrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: So,</p>
                        <p>(2.) He may to <hi>an extraordinary zeal for the
ſame things that are the objects of his love. Hot</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are <hi>eager,</hi> where they take either kindneſs or
diſpleaſure. The natural man that hath an <hi>animal
love</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> may be violent in ſpeaking, and
acting for things appertaining to <hi>it.</hi> If his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
be <hi>devotional</hi> and paſſionate, he becomes a
mighty <hi>zealot,</hi> and fills all places with the <hi>ſame</hi> of
his <hi>godlineſs:</hi> His natural <hi>fire</hi> moves this way, and
makes a mighty <hi>blaze. Ahab</hi> was very <hi>zealous,</hi> and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53432:33"/>
'tis like 'twas not only his own intereſt that made
him ſo, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 16. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
people, and certainly their <hi>zeal</hi> was not always
<hi>perſonated,</hi> and put on, but real; though they
were Hypocrites, yet they were <hi>ſuch,</hi> as in many
things deceived <hi>themſelves,</hi> as well as <hi>others.</hi> They
were <hi>zealous</hi> for their <hi>Traditions,</hi> and they believ'd
'twas their duty to be ſo. St. <hi>Paul</hi> while a <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi>
was <hi>zealous</hi> againſt the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and he <hi>thought
he ought to do many things againſt that name.</hi> And
our Saviour foretells, that thoſe <hi>zealous Murderers</hi>
that ſhould kill his <hi>Saints,</hi> ſhould think, <hi>They did
God good ſervice in it,</hi> John 16. 2. So that all the
zeal of the natural man is not <hi>feigning,</hi> and acting
of a part; nor hath it always <hi>evil</hi> objects. The
Phariſees were zealous againſt the <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of
the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners. Zeal,</hi> and that in <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi>
and for Religion may be in <hi>bad</hi> men. But
then, this is to be noted, that 'tis commonly about
<hi>opinions</hi> or <hi>external rites,</hi> and <hi>uſages,</hi> and ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as appertain to <hi>firſt</hi> Table Duties, while uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the ſame men are very <hi>cold,</hi> in reference to
the <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>Second:</hi> And when <hi>Zeal</hi> is <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
and ſpent about the little things that tend not
to the overcoming the <hi>difficulties</hi> of our way, or
the <hi>perfecting</hi> of <hi>humane nature,</hi> 'tis a meer <hi>animal</hi>
fervour, and no <hi>Divine</hi> Fire. And the <hi>natural</hi>
man, the <hi>Seeker</hi> that <hi>ſhall not enter,</hi> may grow up
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53432:34"/>
to another height that looks <hi>gloriouſly,</hi> and ſeems
to ſpeak mighty things. As,</p>
                        <p>(3.) <hi>He may have great comforts in religious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and that even to rapturous exceſſes.</hi> He may
take <hi>theſe,</hi> for <hi>ſweet Communion</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and the
<hi>joys</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>earneſt</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> and be
lifted up on high by them, and enabled to ſpeak in
<hi>wonderful raviſhing ſtrains;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding
be an <hi>evil</hi> man, and in the ſtate of ſuch as ſhall be
<hi>ſhut out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For this we may obſerve, That thoſe whoſe
<hi>complexion</hi> inclines them to <hi>devotion,</hi> are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
much under the power of <hi>melancholy;</hi> and they
that are <hi>ſo,</hi> are moſtly very <hi>various</hi> in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
ſometimes <hi>merry,</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> to <hi>exceſs;</hi> and
<hi>then</hi> plung'd as deep into the other extream of
<hi>ſadneſs</hi> and <hi>dejection;</hi> one while the <hi>ſweet humours</hi>
enliven the imagination, and preſent it with all
things that are <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>agreeable;</hi> And <hi>then,</hi>
the black blood ſucceeds, which begets clouds
and darkneſs, and fills the fancy with things <hi>fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
and <hi>uncomfortable:</hi> And there are very few but
feel ſuch varieties, in a degree, in themſelves.
Now while the <hi>ſweet Blood</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi> prevail,
the perſon whoſe complexion inclines him to
Religion, and who hath arrived to the degrees
newly diſcours'd of (though a meer <hi>natural</hi> man)
is full of inward <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction;</hi> and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53432:34"/>
at this turn, that he is much in the <hi>favour</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and a ſure <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Glory;
which muſt needs excite in him many <hi>luſcious,</hi>
and <hi>pleaſant</hi> thoughts: and <hi>theſe</hi> further warm his
<hi>imagination,</hi> which, by <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>taking</hi> ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſtill raiſeth the <hi>affections more;</hi> and ſo the
man is as it were <hi>tranſported</hi> beyond himſelf; and
ſpeaks like one <hi>dropt</hi> from the <hi>Clouds:</hi> His tongue
flows with <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Glories,</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> and
<hi>Revelations,</hi> and <hi>Incomes;</hi> and then, believes that
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of all <hi>this,</hi> and that
God is <hi>in him of a Truth,</hi> in a ſpecial way of <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation</hi>
and <hi>Vouchſafement.</hi> But when <hi>melancholick</hi>
vapours prevail again; the <hi>Imagination</hi> is <hi>overcaſt,</hi>
and the <hi>Fancy</hi> poſſeſt by <hi>diſmal</hi> and <hi>uncomfortable</hi>
thoughts; and the man, whoſe head was but
juſt before among the <hi>Clouds,</hi> is now grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the <hi>Duſt:</hi> He thinks <hi>all</hi> is loſt, and his
condition miſerable; He is a <hi>caſt-away,</hi> and
<hi>undone;</hi> when in the mean while, as to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
favour, he is juſt where he was before, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a <hi>better</hi> ſtate, ſince 'tis <hi>better</hi> to be humbled
<hi>with</hi> reaſon, than to be lifted up <hi>without it.</hi> Such
effects as <hi>theſe</hi> do meer <hi>natural paſſions</hi> and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
produce, when they are tinctured and
heightned by <hi>religious melancholy.</hi> To <hi>deny</hi> ones <hi>ſelf,</hi>
and to <hi>overcome ones paſſions,</hi> and to <hi>live</hi> in a courſe
of a <hi>ſober Vertue,</hi> is much more <hi>Divine</hi> than <hi>all this.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53432:35"/>
'Tis <hi>true</hi> indeed, and I am far from denying
it, that holy men feel thoſe <hi>joys</hi> and <hi>communications</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> which are <hi>no fancies;</hi> and the
Scripture calls them <hi>great peace,</hi> Pſal. 119. 165.
and <hi>joy in believing,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. and the <hi>peace
of God that paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. But
then, theſe <hi>Divine Vouchſafements</hi> are not <hi>rapturous,</hi>
or <hi>ecſtatical:</hi> They are no <hi>ſudden</hi> flaſhes that are
gone in a moment, leaving the Soul in the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſorrow, and deſpair; but <hi>ſober laſting</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
that are the <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>reſults</hi> of vertue;
the <hi>rejoycings</hi> of a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. and
the <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of God to thoſe rare ſouls, who
have overcome the <hi>evils</hi> of their <hi>natures,</hi> and the
<hi>difficulties</hi> of the <hi>way,</hi> or are <hi>vigorouſly preſſing</hi> on
towards <hi>the mark,</hi> Phil. 3. 14. But for ſuch as
have only the <hi>forms</hi> of Godlineſs I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
while the <hi>evil inclinations</hi> and <hi>habits</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged,
(whatever they may pretend) all the
<hi>ſweets</hi> they <hi>talk</hi> of, are but the <hi>imagery</hi> of <hi>dreams,</hi> and
the <hi>pleaſant deluſions</hi> of their <hi>fancies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THus I have ſhewn how far the <hi>meer animal
Religion</hi> may go, in <hi>imperfect ſtriving:</hi> And
now I muſt expect to hear,</p>
                        <p>(1.) That this is very <hi>ſevere, uncomfortable</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
and if one that ſhall eventually be <hi>ſhut
out,</hi> may do <hi>all this,</hi> what ſhall become of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53432:35"/>
                           <hi>generality</hi> of <hi>Religious</hi> men that never do <hi>ſo much?</hi>
And if <hi>all this</hi> be <hi>ſhort,</hi> what will be available? who
then ſhall be ſaved?</p>
                        <p>To which I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That we are not to make
the <hi>meaſures</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> our ſelves;
but to take <hi>thoſe</hi> that Chriſt Jeſus hath <hi>made</hi> for
us: And he hath told us, That <hi>except our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
we ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
Mat. 5. 20. Now the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi>
did things in the way of <hi>Religion,</hi> that were equal
to all the particulars I have mentioned; yea they
went beyond many of our <hi>glorious</hi> Profeſſors,
who yet think themſelves in an <hi>high form</hi> of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
They <hi>believed</hi> their Religion <hi>firmly,</hi> and
<hi>Prayed frequently</hi> and <hi>ſervently,</hi> and <hi>Faſted ſeverely;</hi>
They were <hi>exact,</hi> and exceeding <hi>ſtrict</hi> in the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>
of their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and hated <hi>ſcandalous</hi> and
<hi>groſs</hi> ſins; and were very <hi>punctual</hi> in all the duties
of <hi>outward Worſhip;</hi> and in many things <hi>ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi>
and went beyond what was <hi>commanded:</hi> Such
<hi>zealous people</hi> were <hi>They;</hi> and They <hi>ſeparated</hi> from
the <hi>converſations</hi> and <hi>cuſtoms</hi> of <hi>other Jews,</hi> upon the
account of their ſuppoſed <hi>greater Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Theſe</hi> were <hi>heights</hi> to which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> arrived;
and a good Chriſtian muſt <hi>exceed</hi> all <hi>this:</hi> And he
that lives in a <hi>ſober courſe</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue;</hi> of <hi>ſelf
Government,</hi> and humble <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to God; of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53432:36"/>
to his <hi>Superiors,</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> to his <hi>Neighbours:</hi> He
doth <hi>really exceed</hi> it, and ſhall <hi>enter,</hi> when the other
ſhall be <hi>ſhut out.</hi> So that, when our Saviour ſaith,
that the <hi>Phariſaick</hi> Righteouſneſs muſt be <hi>exceeded,</hi>
the meaning is not, That a greater <hi>degree</hi> of every
thing the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, is <hi>neceſſary;</hi> but we muſt
do <hi>that</hi> which in the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of it is <hi>better,</hi>
and more acceptable to God, <hi>viz.</hi> That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they placed their Religion in <hi>ſtrict Faſtings,</hi> and
nice obſervations of <hi>Feſtivals;</hi> in <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>earneſt
Prayers,</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> to get <hi>Proſelytes;</hi> we ſhould
place <hi>ours,</hi> in <hi>ſincere ſubjection</hi> of our <hi>wills</hi> to the
<hi>will</hi> of God; in <hi>imitation</hi> of the life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
<hi>obedience</hi> of his Laws; in <hi>amending</hi> the faults of our
natures and lives: in <hi>ſubduing</hi> our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and
caſting out the <hi>habits</hi> of <hi>evil: Theſe</hi> are much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Religion of the <hi>Fanatick Phariſee;</hi> not
in <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>pomp;</hi> but in <hi>real</hi> worth, and <hi>divine
eſteem.</hi> So that, upon the whole, we have no
reaſon to be diſcouraged, becauſe They that do
<hi>ſo much</hi> are <hi>caſt out;</hi> ſince, though we find not
thoſe <hi>heats,</hi> and <hi>ſpecious</hi> things in our ſelves which
we obſerve in <hi>them,</hi> yet if we are more <hi>meek</hi> and
<hi>modeſt,</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> and <hi>charitable,</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and
<hi>juſt,</hi> our caſe is <hi>better;</hi> and we have the <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Godlineſs,</hi> when theirs is but the <hi>Form;</hi> And <hi>we,</hi>
whom They accounted <hi>Aliens</hi> and <hi>Enemies,</hi> ſhall
<hi>enter;</hi> while <hi>they,</hi> the preſumed <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi>

                        </p>

But (2.) I expect it ſhould be again objected
againſt this ſeverity of Diſcourſe, That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaith, <hi>Mat. 11. 20. That his yoke is eaſie, and
his burden is light:</hi> which place ſeems to croſs all
that hath been ſaid about the Difficulties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And 'tis true it hath ſuch an <hi>appearance,</hi>
but 'tis <hi>no more;</hi> For the words look as <hi>croſs</hi> to the
<hi>expreſſions</hi> of the ſame Divine Author, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>ſtraitneſs</hi> of the <hi>Gate,</hi> and <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Way,</hi> as to any thing I have delivered from thoſe
<hi>infallible ſayings.</hi> Therefore to remove the <hi>ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi>
of <hi>contrariety,</hi> which the <hi>objected Text</hi> ſeems to
have to thoſe <hi>others,</hi> and to my Diſcourſe, we may
obſerve,</p>
                        <p>That when our Saviour ſaith, that his <hi>yoke</hi> is

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which ſignifieth
<hi>very good, excellent, gracious;</hi> and the meaning I
ſuppoſe is, That his Precepts had a <hi>native beauty</hi>
and <hi>goodneſs</hi> in them; That they are <hi>congruous</hi> and
<hi>ſutable</hi> to our reaſonable Natures, and <hi>apt</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to make us <hi>happy;</hi> In which ſenſe, <hi>this</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
hath no <hi>antipathy</hi> to the <hi>Text,</hi> or to any

<hi>[My Burden is light]</hi> I think by this we are to
underſtand, That his <hi>Commands</hi> are not of that
<hi>burdenſome</hi> nature, that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Laws were: Thoſe were very cumberſome, and
had nothing in their nature to make them <hi>pleaſant</hi>
                           <pb n="64" facs="tcp:53432:37"/>
and <hi>agreeable;</hi> whereas his Religion had no <hi>expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
troubleſome</hi> Rites appendant to it; nor did it
require any thing but our obſervation of thoſe
<hi>Laws</hi> which eternal <hi>Reaſon</hi> obligeth us to, and
which of our ſelves we ſhould chooſe to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
were we freed from the <hi>intanglements</hi> of the

                        <p>ANd now I come to <hi>Apply</hi> what I have ſaid;
and the things I have to add will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under theſe two Generals (1.) <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi>
and (2.) plain <hi>Advice</hi> in order to practice.
I begin with the <hi>Inferences</hi> and <hi>Corollaries</hi> that ariſe
from the whole Diſcourſe. And,</p>
                        <p>(1.) We may collect, <hi>What is the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>

conſiſts in the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>prevalency</hi> of <hi>Theſe. This</hi>
is that the Scripture calls the <hi>Old man,</hi> Eph. 4. 22.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53432:37"/>
them; which if it keeps on, ends in <hi>Victory.</hi> And
this is call'd <hi>Converſion,</hi> Acts 3. 19. and <hi>Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
while 'tis in its firſt motions; And the <hi>Divine
Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 20. The <hi>Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 16. <hi>Light,</hi>
Epheſ. 5. 8. and <hi>Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. when 'tis

                        </p>
                        <p>For our fuller underſtanding this, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
That Grace is taken (1.) for <hi>Divine favour;</hi>
(2.) for <hi>Chriſtian Vertue.</hi> As it ſignifies <hi>Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
ſo it is uſed,</p>
                        <p>(1.) For thoſe <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>aids</hi> God affords us,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. and the <hi>influences</hi> of
<hi>his Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 9. In this ſenſe we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
from the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Baptiſm, viz.</hi>
We are intitled to <hi>divine helps,</hi> which is a kind of
<hi>regeneration;</hi> for we are born in a condition of
<hi>impotence,</hi> and <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and <hi>deſtitution</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual
aſſiſtances;</hi> This is the <hi>world</hi> of <hi>meer nature;</hi> But
then in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> we are brought into the <hi>world</hi>
of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> that is, are put under its <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
and are aſſured of its <hi>aids,</hi> and ſo are <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
born again;</hi> Not that this <hi>Regeneration</hi> alone
will <hi>ſave</hi> us, without our endeavours; it imports
only an <hi>external relation,</hi> and right to <hi>priviledges,</hi>
and by <hi>theſe</hi> we may be powerfully <hi>aſſiſted</hi> in our
<hi>ſtriving,</hi> if we uſe them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53432:38"/>
But then (2.) <hi>Grace,</hi> as it ſignifies <hi>divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
implies his <hi>ſpecial</hi> love and kindneſs, ſuch as
he vouchſafes to holy and vertuous men; ſo that
we may obſerve that there may be a <hi>diſtinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> A
ſtate of <hi>Grace</hi> in the former ſenſe, is a <hi>condition aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted</hi>
by the <hi>influences</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and all <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
perſons are in <hi>that.</hi> But if they <hi>uſe</hi> not thoſe
<hi>helps,</hi> they are not in Gods <hi>ſpecial</hi> favour; and ſo
not in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Salvation.</hi> But when thoſe <hi>aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi>
are duly imployed, and join'd with our <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
endeavour,</hi> then the perſon ſo uſing them, is in
a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> alſo; and in God's ſpecial love
and favour. Thus of the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi>
ſenſe, as taken for <hi>divine favour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2.) The word is alſo uſed for <hi>Chriſtian Vertue,</hi>
2 Pet. 3. 18. and <hi>Vertue</hi> is call'd <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe
'tis wrought in us by the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of Gods <hi>Spirit</hi>
and the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which are <hi>divine</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
and to be in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in <hi>this</hi> ſenſe,
is to be a <hi>virtuous</hi> man, which ſuppoſeth <hi>divine</hi> aids,
and intitles to <hi>divine love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe things I have taken an occaſion thus
briefly to ſtate; becauſe there is oft-times much
confuſion in means diſcourſes about <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
from which much trouble and many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
have ariſen. And by what I have ſaid
alſo in theſe brief hints, the doctrine of our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53432:38"/>
Church in the office of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
clearly, and will appear to be very <hi>ſound</hi> and
<hi>true,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>petty</hi> exceptions of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Diſſenters.</p>
                        <p>(II.) I may infer, <hi>That the great Deſign of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the Goſpel is to perfect humane nature.</hi> The
<hi>perfection</hi> of our <hi>natures,</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>ſubjection</hi>
and <hi>ſubordination</hi> of the <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>paſſions</hi> to the
<hi>Mind,</hi> as it is enlightned, and directed by the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Laws,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> This is the ſtate
of <hi>integrity,</hi> in which we were <hi>firſt</hi> made; and
we loſt it by the rebellion of our <hi>ſenſes</hi> and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
powers, which have uſurpt the <hi>government</hi>
of us ever ſince. Here is the <hi>imperfection</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>
of our <hi>natures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now Religion deſigns to <hi>remove</hi> and <hi>cure theſe;</hi>
and to reſtore us to our firſt, and happy ſtate. Its
buſineſs is not to reform our looks, and our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
or to model our actions, and geſtures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a devout appearance; not only to reſtrain the
practice of open prophaneneſs and villany; nor
to comfort us with the aſſurance of Gods loving
us we know not why: But to <hi>cure</hi> our <hi>ill natures,</hi>
to <hi>govern</hi> our <hi>paſſions,</hi> to <hi>moderate</hi> our <hi>deſires,</hi> to
throw out <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> and all <hi>uncharitable</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſals,
with the other <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſorts of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and thereby to make us <hi>like</hi> unto God, in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53432:39"/>
whom there is no ſhadow of <hi>ſin,</hi> or <hi>imperfection;</hi>
and ſo to render us fit objects of his <hi>delight,</hi> and
<hi>love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that whatever doth not tend to the making
us, ſome way or other <hi>really better: better</hi> in our
<hi>ſelves,</hi> and better in all <hi>Relations,</hi> as <hi>fathers,</hi> and
children, and <hi>husbands</hi> and <hi>wives,</hi> and <hi>ſubjects,</hi> and
<hi>governours,</hi> and <hi>neighbours</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> is not Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
It may be a <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> but 'tis nothing
to the <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> And where we ſee not <hi>this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
of Religion, let the profeſſor of it be never ſo
<hi>high</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> in his profeſſion, we may yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that either his <hi>Religion</hi> is not <hi>good,</hi> or that he
only <hi>pretends,</hi> and <hi>really</hi> hath it not.</p>
                        <p>This I take to be a conſideration of great
moment and great certainty, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion aims at the <hi>bettering</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi>
of our natures. For the things it commands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
either to <hi>worſhip</hi> or <hi>virtue.</hi> The inſtances of
<hi>external</hi> worſhip are <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>praiſe;</hi> both which
are high acts of <hi>gratitude</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> and they fit
us for divine bleſſings, and keep us under a <hi>ſenſe</hi>
of God, and prepare us for <hi>union</hi> with him, which
is the <hi>higheſt perfection</hi> of which the creature is
capable. Thus the <hi>outward</hi> acts of <hi>worſhip</hi> tend
to our happineſs; and the <hi>inward</hi> do infinitely the
<hi>ſame.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53432:39"/>
Theſe are, <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Fear. Faith</hi> in God
ſupports and relieves us in all afflictions, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
The <hi>love</hi> of him is a pleaſure and ſolace to us in
all loſſes and diſappointments, ſince he is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
moſt filling, and ſatisfying; and <hi>one</hi> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be loſt, except we wilfully thruſt him from
us. <hi>Fear</hi> of God hath no <hi>torment;</hi> 'Tis no <hi>ſlaviſh</hi>
dread of his <hi>greatneſs</hi> and Power; but a <hi>reverence</hi>
of his <hi>perfections,</hi> and a <hi>lothneſs</hi> to offend him;
and this <hi>diſpoſeth</hi> us alſo for the <hi>communications</hi> of
his grace, and love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 9. And this it doth
by <hi>congruity,</hi> and its <hi>own nature;</hi> which is to be
ſaid likewiſe of the others. So that they would
make thoſe <hi>happy</hi> that practiſe them, whether they
had been poſitively enjoyn'd, or not; And
though no <hi>expreſs</hi> rewards had been annext unto
them.</p>
                        <p>There are other two acts of worſhip which
Chriſtianity requires, which are <hi>inſtituted</hi> and <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and reſpect Chriſt our Lord; They are, the
<hi>Sacraments; Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> both
which are <hi>holy Rites</hi> of high ſignification; and <hi>ſeals</hi>
of an excellent <hi>Covenant</hi> between God and us, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
us of pardon of ſins, and all divine <hi>favours,</hi>
upon the conditions of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>repentance;</hi>
and more firmly obliging us to holy <hi>obedience,</hi> and
<hi>dependance;</hi> The only <hi>way</hi> in which we can be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
Whence we ſee briefly, that all the parts of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53432:40"/>
                           <hi>worſhip</hi> which Chriſtianity binds upon us, tend to
our <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>Felicity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And all the <hi>vertues</hi> that it commands do the
ſame; both thoſe that reſpect us in a perſonal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
and thoſe others that relate to us as <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
of <hi>Societies.</hi> Thus <hi>humility,</hi> recommended
<hi>Mat. 5. 3. Meekneſs</hi> bleſt, ver. 5. purity, ver. 8. are
vertues that accompliſh our <hi>particular</hi> perſons, and
make us <hi>happy</hi> in our ſelves. For of <hi>Pride cometh
Contention,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. And a great part of our
troubles ariſe from ſtomach and ſelf-will; which
humility cures. <hi>Meekneſs</hi> alſo takes away the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the numerous miſchiefs we run into
through the <hi>rage</hi> and diſorder of our paſſions;
and 'tis in it ſelf a <hi>great beauty</hi> and ornament,
ſince it ariſeth from the <hi>due order,</hi> and <hi>government</hi>
of our <hi>faculties. Purity</hi> which comprehends <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi>
of all ſorts, frees us from the tormenting
<hi>importunity</hi> of thoſe deſires that drag us out of our
ſelves, and expoſe us to ſin, and folly, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
and make us exceeding miſerable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
which it is a perfection that renders us <hi>like</hi>
unto God, and the bleſt <hi>Spirits</hi> of the higheſt rank.
And Chriſtian vertues do not only accompliſh,
and make us happy in our <hi>particular</hi> perſons, but
they do the ſame in our <hi>publique</hi> capacities; They
diſpoſe us to a <hi>quiet</hi> obedience to our <hi>governours</hi>
without <hi>murmuring,</hi> and complaining; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53432:40"/>
the publique <hi>peace</hi> is ſecured; and all good
things elſe in <hi>that.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there are <hi>other vertues</hi> that Chriſtianity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns,
which have a more direct tendency to the
happineſs of others, as <hi>Juſtice,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. <hi>Charity,</hi>
1 Cor. 13. <hi>Loyalty,</hi> Rom. 13. and <hi>all</hi> other <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
vertues may, I think, be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>theſe.</hi> Where there is no <hi>Juſtice,</hi> every man
preys upon another, and no mans property is
ſafe. Where <hi>Charity</hi> is wanting, Jealouſies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds,
envying, back-bitings, and cruelties abound,
which render the world deplorably unhappy.
Where there is not <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>conſcionable ſubmiſſion</hi>
to Governours, the <hi>publick</hi> is upon every occaſion
of commotion, involv'd in infinite miſeries, and
diſaſters. So that all the <hi>precepts</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi>
are in their own nature <hi>proper inſtruments</hi> to make
<hi>us happy;</hi> and they had been <hi>methods</hi> of <hi>Felicity</hi> to
be choſen by all reaſonable creatures, though they
had never been required by ſo great, and ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
an Authority.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things I have ſaid, becauſe I could not
chooſe but take this occaſion to recommend the
<hi>excellency,</hi> and <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of our Religion; And
I have done it but only in brief hints, becauſe it
ariſeth but upon a <hi>Corollary</hi> from my main ſubject,
and from <hi>this</hi> I infer further,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:53432:41"/>
(III.) <hi>That Chriſtianity is the height, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of morality.</hi> They both tend to the real better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and accompliſhment of humane nature:
But the <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>meaſures</hi> of <hi>moral Philoſophy</hi> were
weak and imperfect till <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came; <hi>He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi>
and <hi>enforced</hi> all thoſe <hi>precepts</hi> of vertue, that
were written upon our hearts; and <hi>cleared</hi> them
from many <hi>corruptions</hi> that were grown upon
them, through ignorance and vice, the <hi>gloſſes</hi> of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> conceits of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and he
inforced them anew by his <hi>Authority</hi> and the
knowledge he gave of <hi>divine aids,</hi> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>rewards,</hi> and <hi>puniſhments,</hi> than were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
before; yea he <hi>enlarged</hi> them in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
ſuch as, <hi>loving enemies</hi> and <hi>forgiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</hi>
Thus <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> taught morality, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>way of living like men;</hi> And the 5th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Matthew</hi> is an excellent <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>this</hi>
kind.</p>
                        <p>So that to diſparage <hi>morality,</hi> is to <hi>diſgrace Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi>
it ſelf; and to vilifie <hi>one</hi> of the ends of
Chriſts coming into the world. For all <hi>Religion</hi>
and all <hi>duties</hi> reſpect either <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>neighbour,</hi> or
<hi>our ſelves;</hi> and the duties that relate to theſe <hi>two
laſt,</hi> are acknowledg'd <hi>moral vertues.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
St. <hi>James</hi> counted <hi>theſe Moralities</hi> of <hi>viſiting</hi> the
<hi>Widow</hi> and <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> to be the <hi>pure Religion</hi> and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53432:41"/>
undefiled, Jam. 1. 17. and the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi>
intimates, that thoſe <hi>moral</hi> vertues of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and
<hi>mercy</hi> were ſome of the main things that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. Our Saviour ſaith that
the whole <hi>Law</hi> is ſumm'd up in <hi>theſe</hi> two, to <hi>love</hi>
God with <hi>all</hi> our ſouls, and our <hi>neighbour</hi> as our
<hi>ſelves,</hi> Matth. 22. 13. which latter contains the
duties of <hi>morality.</hi> And that which the <hi>grace</hi> of God
in the Goſpel <hi>teacheth,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> is, to
<hi>live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world,</hi>
Tit. 2. 11. There is no <hi>godlineſs</hi> without <hi>morality.</hi>
All the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> reckon'd up <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22.
are <hi>moral vertues.</hi> And when we are commanded
to <hi>grow in grace, 2 Pet. 3. 18. vertue</hi> is partly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
For one branch of what is call'd <hi>Grace</hi>
in us, is <hi>moral</hi> vertue, produced by <hi>divine</hi> aids,
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> principles, and incouragements; though
'tis true, the world is extended to thoſe duties that
relate immediately to God alſo.</p>
                        <p>By which we ſee how <hi>ignorantly,</hi> and <hi>dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
thoſe people talk, that diſparage <hi>morality</hi> as a
dull, lame thing of no account, or reckoning.
Upon this the <hi>Religion</hi> of the ſecond Table is by
too many neglected; and the whole <hi>myſtery</hi> of
the <hi>new Godlineſs</hi> is lay'd in <hi>frequent hearing,</hi> and
devout <hi>ſeraphick talk, luſcious fancies, new lights, incomes,
manifeſtations, in-dwellings, ſealings,</hi> and ſuch like.
Thus <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> and all kinds of <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi> have
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53432:42"/>
made their way by the diſparagement of <hi>morality,</hi>
and men have learnt to believe themſelves the <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
pretious</hi> people, while their <hi>hearts</hi> have been
full of <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>bitterneſs,</hi> and their hands of
<hi>violence,</hi> while they <hi>deſpiſed dominions,</hi> and <hi>ſpake evil
of dignities, rebell'd</hi> againſt the <hi>Government,</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>publique</hi> peace, and endeavoured to bring <hi>all</hi>
into <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>confuſions.</hi> 'Tis this diabolical
project of dividing <hi>morality</hi> from <hi>Religion</hi> that hath
given riſe and occaſion to all <hi>theſe villanies.</hi> And
while the Practiſers of ſuch things have aſſumed
the name of the <hi>only Godly, Godlineſs</hi> it ſelf hath
been brought into <hi>diſgrace</hi> by them; and <hi>Atheiſm</hi>
incouraged to ſhew it ſelf, in open <hi>defiance</hi> to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
Yea, through the <hi>indiſcretions,</hi> and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſs
of <hi>ſome preachers,</hi> the <hi>fantaſtry,</hi> and vain
babble of <hi>others,</hi> and the general <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the
people to <hi>admire</hi> what makes a great <hi>ſhew,</hi> and
pretends to more than ordinary <hi>ſpirituality;</hi> things
are, in many places, come to that paſs, that thoſe
who teach <hi>Chriſtian vertue</hi> and Religion, in <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> without ſenſeleſs <hi>phraſes,</hi> and
fantaſtick <hi>affectations,</hi> ſhall be reckon'd for <hi>dry mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,</hi>
and ſuch as underſtand nothing of the <hi>life,</hi>
and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> Yea, thoſe people have
been ſo long uſed to <hi>gibberiſh</hi> and <hi>canting,</hi> that they
cannot underſtand <hi>plain ſenſe;</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſuch a ſtranger to their <hi>ears,</hi> that when they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53432:42"/>
hear it ſpoken of in a Pulpit, they count the
<hi>preacher</hi> a broacher of <hi>new divinity;</hi> and one that
would teach the <hi>way to heaven</hi> by <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> And
he eſcapes well, if they do not ſay, That he is
an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> or that he would reconcile us to <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm,</hi>
and <hi>Heathen Worſhip.</hi> The danger and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of which <hi>ignorant</hi> humour, the <hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
is apparent in the whole ſcope of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and therefore I add no more concerning
it here; but proceed to another Inference,
which is,</p>
                        <p>(IV.) <hi>That Grace and the new nature, make their
way by degrees on the Soul;</hi> for the <hi>difficulties</hi> will

No man can become greatly <hi>evil or good,</hi> on a <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
The Path of the juſt ſhines more and more to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
day,</hi> Prov. 4. 18. We do not jump from <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
into <hi>full light.</hi> We are not fully ſanctified and
converted in an inſtant. The <hi>day</hi> begins in an

grain of Muſtard ſeed,</hi> Mat. 13. 31. It doth not <hi>ſtart</hi>
up preſently to the <hi>ſtature</hi> of a <hi>tree.</hi> The <hi>Divine</hi>

There are ſome <hi>ſeeds</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi>
that God hath ſown in our natures; <hi>theſe</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>convictions,</hi>
which proceed to <hi>purpoſes; theſe</hi> to <hi>reſolutions,</hi> and
thence we paſs to <hi>abſtinence</hi> from all <hi>groſs ſins,</hi> and
the <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>outward Duties;</hi> and ſo at laſt by
degrees, to <hi>vigorous attempts,</hi> for the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of
<hi>evil habits</hi> and <hi>inclinations.</hi> When <hi>Grace</hi> is arrived
to <hi>this</hi> eminent growth, 'tis very viſible, as the
Plant is when 'tis above the ground: But the
<hi>beginnings</hi> of <hi>Converſion</hi> are not ordinarily <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that to catechize men about the <hi>punctual
time,</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> of their <hi>Converſion,</hi> is an
<hi>idle</hi> device, and a great temptation to <hi>vanity</hi> and
<hi>lying.</hi> Who can tell the exact moment when the
<hi>night ends,</hi> and the dawn enters? 'Tis true indeed,
the <hi>paſſage</hi> from <hi>the exceſſes</hi> of Wickedneſs, which
begins in ſome extraordinary horrors and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
is ſometimes very notable; but 'tis not ſo
in <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>moſt.</hi> The time of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> converſion
was eminent, but that change was from <hi>great
contrarieties</hi> and <hi>miraculous,</hi> and therefore 'tis not to
be drawn into inſtance. Both the <hi>beginnings</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute</hi>
progreſſions of Grace, are uſually undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
We cannot ſee the <hi>Graſs</hi> juſt putting out of
the earth, or actually growing; but yet we find
that it doth both. And <hi>Grace</hi> is better known in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53432:43"/>
its <hi>fruits,</hi> than in its <hi>riſe.</hi> By their <hi>Fruits ye ſhall
know them,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Mat. 12. 33. and
the <hi>ſame</hi> way we may know our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>(V.) <hi>We ſee that there is an Animal, as well as a
Divine Religion:</hi> A Religion that is but the <hi>effect</hi>
and <hi>modification</hi> of <hi>complexion, natural fear</hi> and <hi>ſelf-love.</hi>
How far <hi>theſe</hi> will go, we have ſeen, and
how ſhort it will prove in the end. The not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>this</hi> hath been the ſad occaſion of deceiving
many. Some obſerving great <hi>heats</hi> of <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
in the <hi>modern Phariſees,</hi> take theſe to be the
<hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>good people;</hi> believing all the <hi>glorious</hi>
things which they aſſume to themſelves: When
<hi>others,</hi> that know them to be <hi>envious</hi> and <hi>malitious,
unjuſt</hi> and <hi>covetous, proud</hi> and <hi>ungovernable,</hi> and
cannot therefore look on them as ſuch <hi>choice holy</hi>
people, are apt to affirm all to be <hi>hypocriſie</hi> and
<hi>feigning.</hi> In which ſentences, <hi>both</hi> are miſtaken
for want of knowing that there is a <hi>meer Animal
Religion,</hi> that will produce very <hi>ſpecious</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
effects: So that though the <hi>Phariſee</hi> Prays ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently,
and Faſts ſeverely, and talks much
of the love of God, and delights greatly in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and pious Diſcourſe, and will ſuffer all
things for what he calls his Conſcience; yet he is
not to be concluded a Saint from <hi>hence,</hi> becauſe the
<hi>meer Animal</hi> Religion may put it ſelf forth in all <hi>theſe
expreſſions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53432:44"/>
And though <hi>this Profeſſor</hi> be a <hi>bad</hi> man, <hi>proud</hi>
and <hi>covetous, malicious</hi> and <hi>cenſorious, Sacrilegious</hi>
and <hi>Rebellious,</hi> yet we cannot thence be aſſured
that he is an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> in one ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch an
one as <hi>feigns all that he pretends:</hi> But we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he is really ſo affected with <hi>Hearing</hi> and
<hi>Praying,</hi> and devout <hi>Company,</hi> as he makes ſhew,
and yet for all <hi>this,</hi> not alter our opinion of his
being an <hi>evil man:</hi> ſince the <hi>Animal</hi> Religion
will go as far as the things in which he glories.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing whereby the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are drawn more eaſily into the ways of <hi>Sects</hi>
and <hi>Separations,</hi> than by the obſervation of the
<hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>factions: Theſe</hi> they
take to be <hi>Religion,</hi> and the great matters of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi>
and <hi>thoſe</hi> the <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>only godly</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And ſo firſt they conceive a great opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, and then follow them whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they lead. For the generality of men are
tempted into <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> not ſo much by
the <hi>arguments</hi> of <hi>diſſenters,</hi> as by the <hi>opinion</hi> of their
<hi>Godlineſs,</hi> which opinion is grounded upon things
which may ariſe from the <hi>meer Animal Religion,</hi>
and very commonly do ſo. This they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not, and by <hi>this ignorance</hi> are betrayed into
the ſnare of <hi>Separation,</hi> to the diſturbance of the
<hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and their <hi>own great hurt</hi> and
<hi>inconvenience.</hi> Whereas could they be made to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53432:44"/>
know and conſider, that <hi>complexion</hi> and <hi>natural</hi>
paſſions may bring forth <hi>all theſe fruits,</hi> they might
be ſecured by this means againſt the <hi>tempting</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture;
and learn, that <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability</hi>
and <hi>Charity, Juſtice,</hi> and a <hi>Peaceable, humble
temper,</hi> are better arguments of <hi>Saintſhip</hi> than all
<hi>theſe.</hi> Thus a great <hi>miſchief</hi> might be prevented;
and there is <hi>another</hi> that might be remedied by
the <hi>ſame</hi> Obſervation: The inconvenience is
this,</p>
                        <p>While the enemies of Factions object <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi>
to them, affirming that all they <hi>do</hi> and <hi>ſay,</hi> is
meer <hi>perſonating</hi> and <hi>pretence;</hi> they confirm and
ſettle thoſe people in their way; for many of
them <hi>know,</hi> that they are in <hi>earneſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that their oppoſers are miſtaken in their
judgements concerning them; by which they
are better eſtabliſht in their own good opinion,
and hardned againſt conviction; whereas, did they
conſider ſuch things as I have ſuggeſted, about the
<hi>Animal Religion,</hi> and grant to them that they may
be <hi>ſerious,</hi> believe themſelves infinitely, and feel
all thoſe Warmths which they pretend, and yet
be <hi>evil men,</hi> and far enough from being <hi>Godly;</hi>
Did they ſhew them, that all their <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and more and greater than <hi>theirs,</hi> may ariſe
from a principle that hath nothing <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi>
in it: They would thereby ſtrike them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53432:45"/>
in the <hi>right vein,</hi> and bring them down from the
high perch, whereon, by their <hi>falſe marks,</hi> they
had placed themſelves; and thereby diſabuſe
them, and prevent the abuſe of others.</p>
                        <p>(<hi>VI.</hi>) We ſee how we may know our ſtate, whether
it be that of Grace and Life; or the other ſad one of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy
and Death. <hi>The</hi> ſtate <hi>of</hi> Grace <hi>is a</hi> motion
towards the recovery of the Divine Image, and a victory
over our ſelves, and all corrupt inclinations and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>The ſtate of</hi> Unregeneracy <hi>and</hi> Death, <hi>is the</hi>
continuance under the power and prevalency of ſenſe, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and evil habits. <hi>Now when 'tis queſtion'd
by our ſelves in which of</hi> theſe <hi>ſtates we are; it
muſt be ſuppoſed that we are arrived at</hi> ſomething
<hi>of Religion: For the groſly wicked cannot but
know what their condition is. And the way I
would propoſe to thoſe others, who are yet</hi> uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>is this,</hi> viz. <hi>To take notice,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whether they really deſign, and make any progreſs in
Goodneſs. Every motion</hi> indeed cannot be <hi>felt</hi> or
<hi>perceived;</hi> but if we go on, though never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly,
time will ſhew that we are grown. If
we <hi>conſider</hi> what are our <hi>particular defects,</hi> and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
apply <hi>proper</hi> inſtruments to remove them:
if we find ſucceſs in thoſe indeavours, and that
we are <hi>better</hi> this year than we were the former;
That our <hi>Paſſions</hi> are <hi>better</hi> governed, and our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53432:45"/>
affections</hi> more <hi>reſtrained,</hi> and our <hi>evil habits</hi>
and <hi>inclinations leſs</hi> powerful with us, 'tis an <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
ſign,</hi> that we <hi>live</hi> and are in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi>
that we ſhall at laſt arrive <hi>to a perfect man in
Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 4. 13. and ſhall <hi>attain if we
faint not,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 1. Whereas on the other hand,
if we come to ſome <hi>hopeful</hi> pitch, and <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi>
there; if <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>temptation</hi> be as <hi>powerful</hi> with us
<hi>now,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> were a year ago, and our <hi>inclinations</hi>
and <hi>paſſions</hi> juſt at the ſame paſs; we are in a <hi>bad</hi>
ſtate, and <hi>dead.</hi> While the Plant <hi>grows,</hi> it <hi>lives,</hi>
and may become a <hi>great tree,</hi> though at preſent it
be but <hi>ſmall:</hi> whereas <hi>that</hi> whoſe ſtature is <hi>bigger,</hi>
and more <hi>promiſing,</hi> if it <hi>proceeds</hi> not, <hi>decays</hi> and
comes to nothing.</p>
                        <p>Though we are <hi>imperfect,</hi> if we are <hi>ſtriving</hi> and
going <hi>towards</hi> perfection; God overlooks our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
and <hi>pardons</hi> them for Chriſt's ſake. This
is our <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and an <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>true Faith.</hi> But if
on the other hand, we think our ſelves <hi>well,</hi> and
do not always attempt <hi>forwards,</hi> our <hi>state</hi> is <hi>bad,</hi>
and our <hi>ſins</hi> will be <hi>imputed:</hi> Be our pretences
what they will, our <hi>Faith</hi> is not <hi>ſincere,</hi> and will
not ſtead us.</p>
                        <p>When we get to a certain <hi>pitch</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and
make <hi>that</hi> our <hi>ſtate,</hi> 'tis an argument that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
was <hi>meerly Animal;</hi> and but a <hi>mode</hi> of <hi>complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſelf-love,</hi> and <hi>natural fear.</hi> When we overcome
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53432:46"/>
                           <hi>ſome</hi> ſins, and are willing to ſpare and cheriſh <hi>others,</hi>
'tis a ſign that we are not <hi>ſincere</hi> in our attempts
upon <hi>any,</hi> and that what we have done, was not
performed upon <hi>good</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> motives.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sincerity is diſcovered by growth,</hi> and this is the
ſureſt <hi>mark</hi> that I know of <hi>Tryal.</hi> So that we have
no reaſon to <hi>preſume,</hi> though, as we think, we
have gone a <hi>great way,</hi> if we <hi>go not on.</hi> Nor on
the other ſide, have we any to <hi>deſpair,</hi> though our
preſent <hi>attainments</hi> are but <hi>ſmall,</hi> if we are <hi>proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
The buds and tendereſt bloſſoms of Divine
<hi>Grace,</hi> are acceptable to God; when the <hi>faireſt
leaves</hi> of the <hi>meer Animal Religion</hi> are <hi>nothing</hi> in his
eſteem.</p>
                        <p>This is a great advantage we have from the
Goſpel, that <hi>imperfection</hi> will be accepted, where
there is <hi>ſincerity;</hi> whereas according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of exact and regorous Juſtice, no man
could be made happy in the high degree of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but <hi>he</hi> that was <hi>perfect,</hi> and whoſe <hi>victories</hi>
were abſolute.</p>
                        <p>(VII.) It may be collected from our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<hi>Wherein</hi> the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> conſiſts, viz.
<hi>In a progreſs towards perfection, and an intire victory
over all the evils of our Natures.</hi> The <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
are not only in the <hi>ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and
external actions of <hi>feigned</hi> Piety; But all the <hi>fine</hi>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53432:46"/>
things of the <hi>Animal</hi> Religion are of <hi>this kind;</hi> and
they are the <hi>worſt</hi> ſort: By the <hi>groſſer Forms</hi> men
hardly deceive <hi>others;</hi> by <hi>theſe</hi> they effectually <hi>gull
themſelves.</hi> So that many that vehemently <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Forms,</hi> are the greateſt <hi>Formaliſts. Forms</hi> of
Worſhip may well agree with the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi>
whenas <hi>zeal</hi> againſt <hi>Forms,</hi> may be a <hi>Form</hi>
it ſelf; whatever makes <hi>ſhew of Religion,</hi> and doth
not make us <hi>better,</hi> that's a <hi>Form,</hi> at leaſt to <hi>us.</hi>
There are <hi>Spiritual Forms,</hi> as well as thoſe of the
other ſort, and <hi>theſe</hi> are moſt <hi>deadly. Poyſon</hi> is
worſt in <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> He that ſpeaks his Prayers
<hi>ex tempore</hi> with <hi>vehemence</hi> and <hi>loudneſs,</hi> if he ſtrive
not againſt <hi>ill nature</hi> and <hi>ſelf-will,</hi> is as much a
<hi>Formaliſt,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> that tells his <hi>Prayers</hi> by his <hi>Beads,</hi>
and underſtands not one word he ſaith. And
thoſe that run away from <hi>Forms</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> meet
more dangerous <hi>ones</hi> in <hi>Barns</hi> and <hi>private corners.
Orthodox Opinions, devout Phraſes, ſet Looks, melting
Tones, affected Sighs,</hi> and <hi>vehement Raptures,</hi> are
often meer <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> that proceed from
the <hi>Animal</hi> Religion, which it ſelf is a <hi>Form</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
O that the obſervers of ſo many <hi>motes</hi> in
their Brethrens <hi>eyes,</hi> would learn to throw out the
<hi>Beams</hi> of their own!</p>
                        <p>The Form of Godlineſs that pretends it ſelf to
be <hi>no more,</hi> is not ſo <hi>hurtful:</hi> But the <hi>Forms,</hi> that
call themſelves the <hi>Power,</hi> are <hi>deadly.</hi> 'Tis the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53432:47"/>
                           <hi>Formality</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> of <hi>Separatiſts</hi> that keeps
on the <hi>Separation: They</hi> contend for <hi>fancies</hi> and <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi>
trifles; <hi>We</hi> for <hi>order</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> The
people are abuſed by <hi>names,</hi> and being frighted
by the <hi>ſhadows</hi> of <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Formality,</hi> they
run into the worſt <hi>Formality,</hi> and ſillieſt <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in the World. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven conſiſts
not in meats and drinks,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. neither in
<hi>Circumciſion,</hi> nor <hi>Uncircumciſion,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 19. not
in <hi>zeal for</hi> little things, nor in <hi>zeal againſt</hi> them;
both the one and the other are equally <hi>formal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>power</hi> of Religion lies in <hi>uſing</hi> Divine <hi>aids
heartily</hi> and <hi>conſtantly,</hi> in order to the overcoming
the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of our <hi>way.</hi> This <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is not
exerciſed ſo much in <hi>reforming others,</hi> as <hi>our ſelves:</hi>
The chief deſign is to govern <hi>within,</hi> and not to
make Laws for the <hi>World without us.</hi> This is that
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> that is from <hi>above,</hi> which is <hi>pure</hi> and
<hi>peaceable,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. It makes no <hi>noiſe</hi> and
bluſter abroad, but quietly minds its own buſineſs
at home.</p>
                        <p>So that certainly the <hi>beſt</hi> men have not always
had the greateſt <hi>fame</hi> for <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> as the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> have
very ſeldom been the moſt <hi>popular.</hi> They are
the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Animal Religion</hi> that make the <hi>big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
ſhew.</hi> The voice of true Religion is <hi>heard in
quiet,</hi> it ſounds not in the corners of the ſtreet.
The <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is ſeen in <hi>Juſtice, Meekneſs,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53432:47"/>
Humility,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> things that look not ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
as the <hi>Spiritual Forms.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus of the <hi>Inferences</hi> and <hi>Corollaries</hi> that
may be drawn from my Diſcourſe, which though
they cannot all be inferred from any of its minute
and ſeparated parts, yet they lie in the deſign and
contexture of the whole.</p>
                        <p>I Come now to the <hi>Advice</hi> for <hi>Practice.</hi> The
way of Happineſs is <hi>difficult,</hi> but the <hi>difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
may be overcome by <hi>ſtriving.</hi> A <hi>little</hi> will <hi>not

that <hi>diligently;</hi> with <hi>conſtant reſolution</hi> and <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?</hi>
                        </p>

in <hi>ſtriving,</hi> and to quicken us to it.</p>
                        <p>Let us then ariſe in the ſtrength of <hi>Faith,</hi> and
in the encouragement of <hi>thoſe aids,</hi> and attempt
with courage upon the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of our way.
Let us ingage our <hi>deepeſt Reſolutions,</hi> and moſt <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
endeavours.</hi> Here is no need to <hi>deliberate,</hi> the
things are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> the <hi>benefits unſpeakable,</hi> and the
<hi>event</hi> will be <hi>glorious.</hi> It is no Queſtion, I hope,
<hi>whether God, or the Creature is to be firſt choſen; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heaven or Hell be better?</hi> and therefore there
is no cauſe that we ſhould <hi>ſtay</hi> and <hi>conſider;</hi> we
cannot be <hi>raſh here,</hi> we cannot <hi>hurt</hi> our ſelves by
a too <hi>ſudden ingagement;</hi> we have delayed <hi>too long</hi>
already, and every <hi>moment</hi> we ſit ſtill, is <hi>one</hi> loſs
to our <hi>Duty,</hi> and our <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Let us reſolve
then, and <hi>begin</hi> with <hi>courage,</hi> and <hi>proceed</hi> with <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
'tis our <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi> for which we are to
ſtrive; and every thing is <hi>active</hi> for its End and
Perfection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:53432:48"/>
All <hi>Creatures</hi> are <hi>diligent</hi> in ſerving the Deſigns
of Providence; the <hi>Heavens</hi> are in reſtleſs <hi>motion,</hi>
and the <hi>Clouds</hi> are ſtill carrying about their <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Waters;</hi> the <hi>ſluggiſh Earth</hi> it ſelf is always put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth in variety of <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>Graſs,</hi> and
<hi>Flowers;</hi> the <hi>Rivers</hi> run towards the Sea, the <hi>Brooks</hi>
move towards <hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>Sea</hi> within it ſelf.
Thus all things even in <hi>inanimate</hi> Nature may
mind us of acting towards our end. And if we
look a little higher, the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Field, the
<hi>Fowls,</hi> and <hi>Cattel,</hi> and <hi>creeping</hi> things are diligent
in <hi>ſtriving</hi> after the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of their
Natures, and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends the Sluggard to thoſe
little <hi>Inſects,</hi> the <hi>Ant</hi> and <hi>Bee,</hi> to teach him acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and diligence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 6. And ſhall the
<hi>Beaſts</hi> act more <hi>reaſonably</hi> than the profeſſed Sons
of <hi>Reaſon?</hi> May it not ſhame <hi>us,</hi> that we need
<hi>Inſtruction</hi> from the Creatures that have no <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?</hi>
With what face can we carry our heads
ſo high, and look down with contempt upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Animals, when <hi>they</hi> live more <hi>wiſely</hi> and
more <hi>regularly</hi> than we?</p>
                        <p>The Sum is, <hi>All things</hi> are inceſſantly <hi>moving
towards an End;</hi> and Happineſs is <hi>ours,</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould ingage our moſt careful Thoughts,
and moſt active Endeavours.</p>
                        <p>We are ſollicitous and diligent about things of
infinitely <hi>leſs</hi> moment, and in effect of <hi>none,</hi> viz.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53432:49"/>
                           <hi>uncertain</hi> Riches, <hi>ſenſual</hi> Pleaſures, and <hi>worldly</hi>
Honours; though the way to <hi>theſe</hi> is ſufficiently
<hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>uneaſie,</hi> yet we are not <hi>diſcouraged;</hi>
we attempt all thoſe <hi>Difficulties</hi> with an <hi>obſtinate</hi>
Courage, though without promiſe of any <hi>equal</hi>
aſſiſtance, or aſſurance of ſucceſs. We are often
<hi>defeated</hi> in our purſuits, and yet we <hi>go on.</hi> We are
<hi>overmaſter'd</hi> by <hi>croſs</hi> events, and yet we <hi>try again.</hi>
We <hi>miſs</hi> our <hi>happineſs,</hi> when we have attain'd our
<hi>end,</hi> and yet we are as <hi>active</hi> in courting diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
another time; either we attain not
the <hi>things</hi> we ſeek, or find no <hi>true ſatisfaction</hi> in
<hi>them,</hi> or they <hi>die</hi> in our hands <hi>preſently,</hi> and yet
we <hi>ſtrive.</hi> And doth not this <hi>activity</hi> about <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
unſatisfying Trifles,</hi> ſhamefully reprove our
Negligence in reference to our <hi>great End, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>Perfection?</hi> In ſtriving for which we have
all the <hi>powers</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>aid</hi> us, and the <hi>Word</hi> of
God, and the <hi>Blood</hi> of his Son, and the <hi>experience</hi>
of all that ever try'd, to aſſure us that we ſhall
neither fail of the <hi>things</hi> we <hi>ſeek,</hi> nor of the
<hi>pleaſure</hi> that we <hi>expect</hi> from them. And why
then do we <hi>lazily</hi> ſit down, and with the Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
ſay, <hi>There is a Lion in the way,</hi> while we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
greater diſcouragements, when vain things
are to be ſought? The Merchant doth not give
off, becauſe there are Storms, and the numerous
Dangers of the Deep to be met with in his way
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53432:49"/>
to the <hi>Indies;</hi> nor the Souldier lay by his Arms,
becauſe of the hazards and toils of War. And
do we act <hi>courageouſly</hi> for <hi>petty purchaſes;</hi> and faint
and deſpond when we are to <hi>ſtrive</hi> for <hi>Crowns</hi> and
<hi>eternal Glories?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis true indeed our own <hi>natural</hi> ſtrength is
<hi>ſmall,</hi> in proportion to the <hi>Difficulties</hi> we are to
encounter; but the <hi>Grace of God is ſufficient for us,</hi>
2 Cor. 12. 9. and we may do all things through
Chriſt that ſtrengthens us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. Nature is
<hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> but we are not left in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>meer nature: For we are not under the Law
but under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. We are under the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi>
of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> which will remove the
<hi>mountains,</hi> and plain the way before us, if we take
care to engage thoſe aids by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
                        <p>For this we may be ſure of, that <hi>God will never
be wanting to us,</hi> if we are not <hi>ſo</hi> unto our <hi>ſelves.</hi>
So that the caſe as to our <hi>natural inability,</hi> and the
<hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſeems to be thus. A man
in a Boat is carried from the Harbour he deſigns,
by the violence of the Current; he is not able
only by plying the Oar, to overcome the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Tide; but a gentle Gale blows
with him, which will not of it ſelf carry him up
againſt the Torrent; <hi>Neither</hi> of them will do it
<hi>ſingle:</hi> But if he <hi>hoiſt</hi> the <hi>ſail,</hi> and uſe the Oar too,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53432:50"/>
this <hi>united</hi> force prevails; and he gets happily to
the Harbour. This methinks reſembles our
Condition; we are carried down the Torrent of
<hi>evil inclinations</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> our own <hi>unaided</hi>
powers are too <hi>little</hi> for that <hi>great</hi> force: but the
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is with us, It breaths upon us, and is
ready to aſſiſt, if we are <hi>ſo</hi> to uſe it, and by the
ſuperaddition and ingagement of thoſe bleſſed
Aids, there is no evil in our natures but may be
overcome. So that we have no reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
at the apprehenſion of our <hi>impotence, out
of weakneſs we ſhall be made ſtrong,</hi> Heb. 11. 24. If
we imploy our <hi>Talent,</hi> though it be but a very
<hi>ſmall</hi> one, we ſhall have more, Mat. 25. 29. And
if we <hi>accept</hi> of thoſe divine helps, and <hi>uſe</hi> them,
what was before, to meer <hi>natural</hi> conſideration,
<hi>uneaſie,</hi> will be pleaſant and ſweetly reliſhing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>One</hi> of the greateſt <hi>Difficulties</hi> in the way of
Religion, is to begin: the <hi>firſt</hi> ſteps are <hi>rougheſt</hi>
to thoſe feet that have been unaccuſtomed to it.
The helps and manifold incouragements we
ſhall meet with in the <hi>Progreſs,</hi> will render it
more <hi>agreeable</hi> and <hi>delightſome.</hi> Thoſe very <hi>toils</hi>
will be <hi>grateful;</hi> there is ſcarce any great <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
<hi>pleaſure,</hi> but where there is ſome <hi>Difficulty</hi> and
<hi>Pain.</hi> Even our <hi>Work</hi> it ſelf will be <hi>Wages.</hi> And
'tis not only the <hi>End</hi> of Wiſdom that is <hi>pleaſantneſs,</hi>
but the <hi>very way,</hi> Prov. 3. 17. So that though
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53432:50"/>
we are call'd upon to <hi>ſtrive,</hi> and to <hi>run,</hi> and to
<hi>fight,</hi> (which words import Labour) yet we are
not required to Quit our <hi>pleaſures,</hi> but to <hi>change</hi>
the <hi>objects</hi> of them; to leave the <hi>delights</hi> of <hi>Swine</hi>
for <hi>thoſe</hi> of <hi>Angels; ſenſual</hi> for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                        <p>Thus all things encourage, and invite us to
<hi>ſtrive;</hi> God calls upon us, and our own <hi>Intereſts</hi>
call; <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came to engage us to this Work,
and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> waits to aſſiſt it. If notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this, we <hi>ſit ſtill,</hi> our Negligence will
be <hi>inexcuſable</hi> and <hi>fatal:</hi> or if we <hi>ariſe</hi> and go a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
forward, and then lay us down to take our
<hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>reſt,</hi> our ſtate (in the judgement of one
that knew) will be worſe, more <hi>deſperate,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeleſs,</hi>
2 Pet. 2. 21.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> Conclude <hi>all then, in the words of the Bleſſed</hi>
Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Therefore my beloved Brethren,
be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work
of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your Labour is

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW <hi>many,</hi> and how <hi>great,</hi> have
been the Feuds, and ſtill are, of
this tottering, and broken Age,
there is no man here ſo happy as
to be ignorant: That ſuch Strifes
among Brethren are Unnatural,
and Diabolical; and that 'tis a lovely thing to
ſee Chriſtians live together in Charity, and Love;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53432:53"/>
there is no Chriſtian but will grant: but how
the fatal Evil is to be cur'd, and the lovely thing
is to be compaſt; here's the Knot, here's the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
To endeavour the reconciling Extreams
that are ſo divided, looks like a deſign to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
a friendſhip between the Winds and
Waves: 'Tis very <hi>ſtrange</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould
be ſo at odds, whoſe Religion is Peace, and
Love, and the reaſons of whoſe differences are
ſo ſmall, in proportion to the degree of their
Animoſities: Our <hi>GOD</hi> is One, and we have
the ſame common <hi>SAVIOUR;</hi> we profeſs one
<hi>GOSPEL,</hi> and believe the ſame <hi>Creeds;</hi> we
have the ſame <hi>SACRAMENTS,</hi> and the
ſame fundamental <hi>ORDINANCES:</hi> And
ſince we are agreed in <hi>Theſe,</hi> what is there left,
that is worth the <hi>heat</hi> of a <hi>Diſpute? what,</hi> that
can juſtifie a <hi>Diviſion?</hi> Certainly, it is not mens
Principles that keep them ſo at odds, there is
ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> in the matter; there is ſomething
wanting that would heal our Breaches, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
our Diviſions: Love would heal us, if we
would be healed.</p>
                        <p>Now in a general Combuſtion, 'tis every
Chriſtians Duty to bring what Water he can, to
throw upon the Flames; eſpecially it is the office
of the Miniſters of Peace, to endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it. 'Tis a plain ſubject; but ſuch are moſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53432:53"/>
neceſſary, and this is moſt ſeaſonable; ſeaſonable
at all times, but principally in theſe, wherein
'tis hard to diſcern by the practice of Chriſtians
that the Duty of Love hath any thing to do with
Chriſtianity: And yet this is a vital grace of our
Religion: 'Tis the Law and Goſpel in a word;
for Love is the fulfilling of the Law, and the
Goſpel is a Law of Love; And 'tis very ſtrange,
and very ſad, that an Age, which hath ſo much
of light and faith in the pretence, ſhould have ſo
little of Charity and love in the practice; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
ſince that light, which is from above, is
full of Benignity, and Goodneſs; and that Faith,
which is truly Divine, <hi>worketh by love.</hi> This is
that which our Apoſtle recommends in the words,
and I have choſen it for my preſent ſubject: In
Diſcourſing it, I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
                        <p>(1.) The <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the Duty, (2.) Its <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
(3.) The <hi>Excellency</hi> of it; and (4.) propoſe
ſome <hi>Means</hi> to aſſiſt us towards the attainment of
this Generous, and Catholick Spirit.</p>
                        <p>FOR the (1.) The <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the Duty;
the whole Scripture is ſo full, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
in enjoyning it, that methinks I might be
excuſed from a labour, that would ſeem ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
to one, that <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and not the
practice of thoſe that profeſs it: But becauſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53432:54"/>
the Chriſtianity of moſt Chriſtians is, (if I may
ſo ſpeak) quite another thing from the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
of <hi>CHRIST;</hi> it will be neceſſary to
mind them what <hi>HIS</hi> was, that they may
be perſwaded to conform <hi>theirs</hi> unto it: and
though mens underſtandings are convinced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
that Charity is their Duty; yet there is
but too much need to repreſent ſome of the vaſt
heap of injunctions that make it ſo, to incline
their Wills. I ſhall therefore briefly lay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a few of the chief inſtances of this kind;
that you may have the diſtincter ſenſe of the
reaſons of your Duty, and from them, the
moſt powerful motives to enforce it. In order
to this, let us conſider in ſhort, the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of
Chriſt, and the <hi>teachings</hi> of his Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>Our Saviour urgeth it as his <hi>New Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
John</hi> 13. 34. and inculcates it again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the obliging form of his <hi>Command, John</hi> 15.
12. He makes it a <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> note of his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
John</hi> 13. 35. and enjoyns them to <hi>love
their Enemies, Mat.</hi> 5. 24. He mentions it as the
great qualification of thoſe on his Right hand,
that ſhall be received into his Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. 34, 35. and the want of it, as the reaſon of
the dreadful Curſe pronounced upon thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ones on the Left, at the ſolemn Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>ver.</hi> 41, 42. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Love the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53432:54"/>
of the Law, Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10. and ſets it in
the firſt place among the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,
Gal.</hi> 5. 22. yea, reckons it five times over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other Names in the Catalogue, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe
of <hi>Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs,
Meekneſs, ver.</hi> 22, 23. He advanceth it above
all Gifts and Graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. above the <hi>Tongues</hi>
of Men and Angels, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and above <hi>Prophecie,</hi>
and <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Faith, ver.</hi> 2.
And the beloved Diſciple St. <hi>John,</hi> who lay in
the Boſom of his Dear Lord, and ſeems to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
moſt of his Spirit, is tranſported in the
commendation of this Grace. He tells us, that
<hi>God is love, 1 John</hi> 4. 7. and repeats it again, <hi>ver.</hi>
16. He makes it an Argument of our being <hi>born
of God,</hi> and <hi>Knowing Him, ver.</hi> 7. and the
want of this an evidence of not <hi>Knowing</hi> God,
<hi>ver.</hi> 8. He counts it the <hi>mark</hi> of Diſcipleſhip;
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d the contrary, a ſign of one that <hi>abideth in
Death, 1 John</hi> 3. 14. He calls him a <hi>Murtherer</hi>
that hates another, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and a <hi>Lyar,</hi> if he
pretends to Love God, and loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 20. In fine, he out-ſpeaks the
greateſt heights of Praiſe, when he ſaith <hi>God is
Love,</hi> and he that <hi>loveth dwelleth in God, and God
in him, 1 John</hi> 4. 16. I might repreſent further,
that we are commanded to <hi>Love without diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
Rom.</hi> 12. 9. to be <hi>kindly affectioned one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53432:55"/>
another, ver. 10. to put on the Breaſt-plate of
Faith, and Love, 1 Theſſ. 5. 8. to be pitiful, and
courteous, 1 Pet. 3. 8. to provoke one another to love,
and to good works, Heb. 10. 24. to ſerve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
Gal. 5. 13. <hi>to love as Brethren, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 8.
We are minded of Chriſt's <hi>New</hi> Commandment,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. and of the Meſſage which was
from the beginning, <hi>That we ſhould love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
ver. 11. and are urged by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods loving us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. Thus the
Apoſtles exhort, and teach: and they Pray, that
<hi>our Love may abound, Phil.</hi> 1. 9. and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 12.
and give ſolemn <hi>Thanks</hi> for it, when they have
found it, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                        <p>And now conſidering the <hi>expreſneſs</hi> of all theſe
places, I cannot ſee, but that any Duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
may be more eaſily evaded than <hi>this;</hi> and
thoſe who can fanſie themſelves Chriſtians, and
yet continue in the contrary Spirit, and Practice,
may conceit themſelves religious, though they live
in the conſtant commiſſion of the greateſt ſins.
And if <hi>ſuch</hi> can quiet their Conſciences, and ſhuffle
from all theſe plain Recommendations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions;
they have found a way to eſcape all
the Laws of God, and may, when they pleaſe,
become Chriſtians, without Chriſtianity: For
the evidence, I have ſuggeſted to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of this Duty, doth not conſiſt in half
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53432:55"/>
Sentences, and doubtful Phraſes, in fancied Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
and far-fetcht Interpretations; but in plain
Commands, and frequent Inculcations; in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Intreaties, and preſſing Importunities; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Advices, and paſſionate Commendations:
And thoſe whom all theſe will not move, are
Incapable of being perſwaded, againſt their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
or their intereſt, to any Duty of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that, though I ſee never ſo much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs
for an Opinion, or Heat for an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Circumſtance without the conſcience of
Chriſtian Love; I ſhall never call that forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for thoſe little things, Zeal, or Religion:
Yea, though thoſe warm men ſhould ſacrifice
their Lives to their beloved Trifles, I ſhould
not think them <hi>Martyrs;</hi> but fear rather, that
they went from one Fire to another, and a
Worſe. And in this I have the great Apoſtle to
warrant me, who ſaith: Though I give my
body to be burned, and have not Charity, it
profiteth me nothing, 1 Cor. 13. 3. Thus of the
<hi>Firſt</hi> Head, the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the duty.</p>
                        <p>I Come to the II. the <hi>Extent.</hi> Our Love ought,
(1.) To be extended to all Mankind.
The more general it is, the more Chriſtian,
and the more like unto the Love of God,
who cauſeth his <hi>Sun to ſhine, and his Rain to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53432:56"/>
fall upon the Good, and upon the Evil.</hi> And though
our Arms be very ſhort, and the ordinary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our kindneſs and good will, can reach
but to a very few, yet we may pray for all men,
and deſire the good of all the world; and in theſe
we may be charitable without bounds. But
theſe are not all. Love obligeth us to relieve
the Needy, and help the Diſtreſſed, to viſit the
Sick, and ſuccour the Fatherleſs and Widows, to
ſtrengthen the Weak, and to confirm the Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
and Doubting, to encourage the Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and to reprove the Faulty; and in ſhort,
to be ready in all the offices of Kindneſs, that
may promote the good of any man, <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or
<hi>Temporal,</hi> according to the utmoſt of our power,
and capacity. <hi>The good man is Merciful to his Beaſt,</hi>
and the Chriſtian ought to be Charitable to his
Brother, and his Neighbour; and every man is
our Brother, and every one that Needs us, is our
Neighbour: And ſo our <hi>Love</hi> ought to extend
to all men univerſally, without limitation;
though with this diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>(II.) That the more eſpecial Objects of our
Love ought to be thoſe that agree with us in a
common Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. that is, All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
as Chriſtians, and becauſe ſuch. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
makes our Brother a Member of the Church
Catholick, that gives him a title to our nearer
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53432:56"/>
affections, which ought to be as large as that.
Our Love muſt not be confin'd by names, and
petty agreements, and the intereſts of Parties,
to the corners of a Sect: but ought to reach as
far as Chriſtianity it ſelf, in the largeſt notion
of it. To love thoſe that are of our Way, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and Opinion, is not Charity, but Self-love;
'tis not for Chriſt's ſake, but our own.
To Love like Chriſtians, is to Love his Image
from whom we are ſo called, And that conſiſts
not in <hi>demure Looks</hi> and <hi>affected Phraſes,</hi> in <hi>melting
Tones</hi> and <hi>mimick Geſtures,</hi> in <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Vehemence,</hi> in
<hi>Rapture,</hi> and <hi>Ecſtaſie,</hi> in <hi>ſyſtems</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity</hi>
about Nothing: But in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Innocence,</hi> and <hi>Integrity;</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> to God,
and <hi>Charity</hi> to all the World; in a modeſt <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and humble <hi>Deportment;</hi> in a <hi>peaceable Spirit,</hi>
and <hi>readineſs</hi> to <hi>obey God,</hi> and <hi>Thoſe</hi> He hath
ſet over Us: Where-ever Theſe are, there is the
Image of our Lord, and There ought to be our
Love; though the perſons thus affected, are Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of many things, and err in many; though
they differ from us in ſome Opinions we count
Orthodox, and walk not in the particular ways
or Circumſtances which We eſteem Beſt. And
thus briefly of the <hi>Extent</hi> of the Duty, we ought
to Love <hi>ALL MEN,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>ALL</hi>
Chriſtians, I deſcend to the <hi>Third</hi> general, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="104" facs="tcp:53432:57"/>
(III.) The <hi>Excellency</hi> of Chriſtian Love,
which I repreſent in the following particulars.</p>
                        <p>(I.) IT is the Image of God; and of all
the graces renders us moſt like our Maker: For
<hi>God is love,</hi> and the <hi>Lover of men;</hi> and his <hi>tender
Mercies are over all his Works:</hi> And the moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
apprehenſion we can form of his Being, is,
to look on him as an <hi>Omnipotent, Omniſcient,
Immutable Goodneſs.</hi> And is it not a glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
that makes Men like the fountain of
all perfection? Our unhappy firſt Parents loſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,
by aſpiring to be like God in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
and if we endeavour to be like him in
Love, we ſhall be in the way of gaining a better
Paradiſe than they loſt.</p>
                        <p>(II.) <hi>LOVE</hi> is the Spirit of Angels, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Souls, and the beſt of Men. There is
nothing by which the Angelical nature is ſo
much diſtinguiſh'd from the Diabolical, as
Love, and Goodneſs; for the Devils have Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
and Immortal natures, and great degrees
of Power and Knowledge; and thoſe perhaps
not much inferiour to what is to be found in
ſome of the better Spirits: ſo that the great
difference is not in the exceſs of natural perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which the Angels of Light have above
thoſe of Darkneſs; but in this, that the former
abound in Love, Sweetneſs, and Benignity;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53432:57"/>
and the latter, in Malice, Cruelty, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
theſe are the very Image of Satan, and Spirit
of Hell. Whereas all the Celeſtial Inhabitants live
in the joyful exerciſe of uninterrupted Love and
endearments: Nor is that Love confined to
the bleſſed and glorified Company, but it ſheds
it ſelf abroad upon the nether world; and they
are <hi>Miniſtring Spirits for our good, Heb.</hi> 1. 14.
They ſo far Love us, that they can ſtoop from
Heaven to ſerve us. There is Joy there at the
Converſion of a Sinner; and no doubt there is
Love to converted Saints, and care and pity for
all the reſt of Men. For the ſpirits of the
juſt made perfect are freed from their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
humours, and pettiſh natures, their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
Zeal, and fondneſs of Opinions, which
ſtraitned their Affections while they were on
Earth: and now they are inlarged by the vaſt
improvements of their Knowledge, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of their Vertue; by a fuller ſenſe of
Divine Love, and of their Duty; by the genius
of their company, and the imployment of the
happy Place. So that in Heaven all are truly
<hi>Catholick</hi> in their Affections:</p>
                        <p>And the better any man is, the more he is ſo
upon Earth: The good man makes not himſelf
his center, nor are his thoughts wholly engroſt
about his own concernments; but he is careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53432:58"/>
ſolicitous for the general benefit, and never ſo
much pleaſed as when he is made an inſtrument of
Divine Goodneſs, to promote the intereſts of his
Chriſtian brethren. 'Twas an high ſtrain of
Love in <hi>Moſes,</hi> expreſt towards the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Iſraelites, when he was content to be <hi>blotted
out of Gods Book,</hi> rather than that their Sin ſhould
not be blotted out, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was no leſs Zealouſly affectionate towards the
Jews, when he ſaid, he could <hi>wiſh himſelf accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from Chriſt,</hi> viz. ſeparated from Chriſtian
communion as a moſt vile and abject perſon,
for their ſakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. Theſe were ſpirits
whom Religion and Divine Love had enlarged:
and the more any man advanceth in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the nearer he approacheth to this generous,
heroick temper.</p>
                        <p>(III.) <hi>LOVE</hi> is an eminent branch of the
Divine Life, and Nature. <hi>Love is of God,</hi> and
<hi>every one that Loveth, is born of God,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 7, 8. The Divine Nature in us,
is the Image of God Pourtray'd, and lively
drawn upon the regenerated Soul; and I noted
before, that Love is the vital Image of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
'tis His ſpirit infuſed into us, and growing
in us; and upon that account to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Gifts, and natural Perfections: as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
hath done it in the mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53432:58"/>
the common Gifts of the Spirit differ from this
ſpecial Grace, as the Painters Picture doth from
his Son: His Counterfeit may indeed, in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
appearance to the Eye, reſemble him
more than his Child; but yet it is but an empty
ſhadow, deſtitute, and incapable of his Life,
and Nature: So there are a ſort of Gifts, that
have a ſpiritual appearance, and may, to thoſe that
ſee things at diſtance, or have not their ſenſes
exerciſed, ſeem more like the divine nature,
than this modeſt vertue: But thoſe that come
near them, and are better able to diſcern, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that in themſelves they are without the
Divine Life, and Motion, and are meer Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Pictures. And here I dare ſay, that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
faculty to Preach Plauſibly, and Pray with
Fluency, and Eloquence; to Diſcourſe Devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and readily to Interpret Scripture, if it be not
joyned with a benign and charitable ſpirit, is no
participation of the God-like life and nature;
nor indeed any more Divine, than thoſe common
gifts, and natural parts, which thoſe that think
highly of themſelves upon theſe accounts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe.
For very Evil men have been eminent in
theſe accompliſhments, and Wicked Spirits are
without queſtion endowed with them; and they
are of themſelves arguments of nothing but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Imitation, a devotional Complexion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53432:59"/>
and warm Imagination: Whereas on the other
hand, Charity, and Chriſtian Love are good
Evidence of a Renewed ſtate, and nature. Our
Saviour made it a Character, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. and the
Apoſtle concludes from it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. By
<hi>this we know that we are paſſed from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we love the Brethren.</hi> And if this be a <hi>Mark,</hi>
and St. <hi>John</hi> be not miſtaken, I doubt that ſome
who are very <hi>gracious,</hi> by many Signs of their
own, will want one of Chriſts, to prove their
comfortable preſumption.</p>
                        <p>(IV.) <hi>LOVE</hi> is the bond and tye of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Communion; <hi>How can two walk together ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they are agreed?</hi> The Church is a Body conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of many Members, which unleſs they Unite,
and ſend their mutual ſupplies one to another,
the whole is diſtempered, and in the ready way
to Death and Diſſolution. Now Charity is that
vital Cement whereby they are United, and the
Soul by which the common body lives; that
whereby the League between the members is
preſerved, and health with it. When this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays,
ſad ſymptoms, and mortal evils follow.
We ſee in Nature, the great Fabrick of the World
is maintained by the mutual Friendſhip, and
conſpiracy of its parts; which ſhould they uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
fall out, and break the bond of Amity
that is between them; ſhould they act their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathies
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53432:59"/>
upon each other; yea, ſhould they
but ceaſe to ſerve one another for the general
good; the whole frame would be diſſolved, and
all things ſhuffled into their old Chaos, and Abyſs.
And the greateſt evils that have, or can happen
to the Church, have been the effects of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of Charity, and thoſe inteſtine Diviſions that
have grown up in it. From theſe ſhe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſuffered more, than from external perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions:
The flames within have conſumed her,
when thoſe from without, have only ſindg'd her
garments.</p>
                        <p>(V.) <hi>LOVE</hi> is the moſt Catholick grace,
and upon that account the moſt excellent; ſince
that which promotes the good of the whole, is
better than any private perfection: for which
reaſon, things in nature will quit their particular
intereſts, when the common good ſo requireth;
as heavy bodies will aſcend, and light bodies
deſcend, to prevent a chaſm, and breach in
Nature. Now of all the divine vertues, there
is none of ſo large an influence, as <hi>Love;</hi> 'tis a
grace deſigned for the good of the community,
as the principle of ſelf-Love is for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of particular beings. This ſtirs up our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for the good of others, and eſpecially
for the general good. The Church receives no
wound, but Love feels the ſmart of it; nor is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53432:60"/>
any member of it afflicted, but Love is grieved.
This is the very Spirit of our dear Lord, who
was touched with a <hi>feeling of our Infirmities.</hi> And
to theſe I add this laſt.</p>
                        <p>(VI.) <hi>LOVE</hi> commends Chriſtianity to thoſe
without, and cleanſeth the Profeſſion of it from
many Spots it hath contracted within. The genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of men are not able to judge of Religions
themſelves, but uſually reckon of them, as they do
of their Profeſſors. Whatever is excellent, or elſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
in a Votary of Religion, redounds to
the credit, or diſparagement, of the Religion
he hath adopted: So that, were the charity and
goodneſs of Chriſtianity tranſcribed into the lives
of Chriſtians, it would raviſh the eyes of all
Beholders, and out-ſhine all other Profeſſions.
Men would more eaſily be perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Religion to be from God, whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
they ſaw to be ſo God-like. Love and
goodneſs prevail where nothing elſe will; theſe
win and captivate the Soul; And ſuch conqueſts
are better, and more noble than either thoſe of
Arts, or Arms, which only bring the body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
'Tis but ſmall credit to any Religion to cut
its way by the Sword, or gain upon the world by
Power, or Policy; That which opens it ſelf a paſſage
by its native lovelineſs, and beauty, is the moſt
Illuſtrious, and makes the ſureſt, and moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53432:60"/>
Conqueſts. And were Chriſtendom but
Chriſtian in this regard, and the Profeſſors of the
true Religion, truly Religious, that is, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that charity, and goodneſs, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
enjoyns; our Religion would ſpread its
wings through the World, and all contrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
would lie in the duſt before it: Whereas
the Diviſions, and fatal feuds of Paganized, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
Chriſtendom, are now the great parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Wall
between Us, and the Heathen-World;
yea, they are more particularly the great ſcandal
of the Reformation, and make us the ſcorn of
Thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And O that They that ſpeak and pray much
againſt the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> would not prove inſtrumental
to uphold his Throne! We expect, and hope for
glorious times when the Man of Sin is faln; and
doubtleſs there ſhall be ſuch: But then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thoſe times conſiſts not in external rule,
or dominion of the Church, but in the Univerſal
Reſtauration of it to its primitive Simplicity, and
Purity: Then will the Church be Glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when all Chriſtians ſhall unite upon the
Foundation of an Holy Life, and the joynt Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the few, plain, Fundamentals of Faith:
When they ſhall make real Goodneſs the Object
of their affections towards each other; and all
Differences in Opinions and diſpenſable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53432:61"/>
the Objects of their mutual Forbearance:
When ſuch times as theſe ſhall come, then doth
the Reign of Chriſt begin: And this is the true,
and wiſh't <hi>Millennium.</hi> Now we cannot expect
thoſe glorious days which are to Commence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Fall of <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> till we ſee all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſincerely ſet upon Deſtroying what is <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi>
in themſelves. <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> will not be
overthrown by our declaiming againſt Him, and
ſpitting the fire of Rage at the Infallible Chair.
It will be to better purpoſe for us to examine
what of <hi>Anti-chriſtianiſm</hi> remains in our ſelves:
And while Rancour, and Bitterneſs, Rage, and
Animoſities upon the Account of Difference in
ſmaller Opinions are in our Borders, <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi>
hath a Throne among us; and there is nothing
could be ſo Effectual a Blow at the Root of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-chriſtianiſm,
as the exerciſe of Charity and
Catholick Goodneſs. And when we ſee theſe
take place, then may we Triumphantly ſing
forth, <hi>BABYLON IS FALN.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Come now <hi>Fourthly</hi> to the <hi>Means</hi> of attaining
this excellent and Catholick Temper; And
I propoſe them by way of <hi>DIRECTION,
CONSIDERATION,</hi> and <hi>CAUTION.</hi>
The <hi>DIRECTIONS</hi> are theſe:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:53432:61"/>
(I.) Acknowledge worth in any man. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is good is from God, and He is to be lov'd,
and owned in all things; as well in the Paint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Butter-flies wing, as in the glorious, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
luſtre of the Sun; as well in the compoſure
of the little Ant, as in the vaſt Bodies of the
Whale, or Elephant; In the leaſt Herb under
our feet, as well as in the Stupendous Fabrick of
the Heavens over us: And moral Perfections are
to be acknowledg'd, as well as theſe natural ones:
We are to love Vertue in an Heathen, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is Well, or Worthy in thoſe, whoſe Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are moſt diſtant from our own: And we muſt
take care that we make not our Reliſh, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Worth and Goodneſs: Say not this is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
becauſe 'tis agreeable to your particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates;
and that on the other hand is Vile, and Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
becauſe 'tis diſtaſtful to your Guſt and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:
There are various kinds, and degrees of
Excellency, which differently affect the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Tempers, and Conſtitutions; And, at the
beſt, we are Imperfectly good, and therefore
cannot be the Meaſure of it. Let us then be ſo
Ingenuous as to own the vertue and the goodneſs
that is in all parties, and Opinions, Let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
and love it: This will be a means to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
our Spirits, and to remove the Animoſities we
are apt to conceive againſt the Perſons of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53432:62"/>
and 'twill ingage them on the other hand,
to a greater kindneſs for us, and ſo Leſſen our
Diſtance, and Diſagreements.</p>
                        <p>There is a kind of Spirit among ſome, which
is ſo different from that Charity, which thinketh
no Evil, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. that it thinks nothing elſe
concerning thoſe of a differing Judgement, but
that their Vertues are dull Morality; and their
Piety, Hypocritical Pretenſions; or what-ever
Worſe Ill-will can Invent, and Rage can ſay:
They will not believe that to be a Jewel, which
they find among ſo much ſuppoſed Rubbiſh.
But let us take Care, that we deny not God the
Honour of his Gifts, and Graces; or proudly
fancy that he hath given us the Monopoly:
This is contrary to that Charity which is not <hi>puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
up, and doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly.</hi> Or, if
we could modeſtly ſuppoſe, that there is nothing
but Ignorance, and miſtake among all thoſe who
are not of our Opinion; yet however, their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
ought to be acknowledg'd: The Son of
God was to be Worſhipped, even when he lay
in the Stable; and the Ark to be owned, when
among the <hi>Philiſtins.</hi> ('Tis a ſign that we love
God for himſelf, if we Love him every where)
And indeed, that Worth is more to be admired
that grows up in an uncultivated Soyl, and
among the Weeds of Errour, and falſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53432:62"/>
To find a Roſe, or Tulip in a Garden, is a
common thing, and merits leſs of our regard;
but to meet with them in the High-way, or open
Fields, this ingageth our nearer Notice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
the Flowers to our more particular
Kindneſs: Thus Vertue, though in all men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
yet 'tis no more than is expected to be in
Perſons of Knowledge, and right Judgement;
But in the Ignorant, and Miſtaken, it thrives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Diſadvantages, and deſerves more to be Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd,
and Incourag'd. And now if 'twere poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to bring the divided World to theſe Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Acknowledgements, men would find their
Spirits compos'd, and their Animoſities qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
They would ſee they have Friends, even in
the Tents of their Enemies; and <hi>this,</hi> Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Own'd mutually, would be a very hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
way to endear and reconcile us.</p>
                        <p>(II.) <hi>Be much in the Contemplation of the Love of
God.</hi> He that knows how much God hath Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, hath a mighty Reaſon to Love his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
The Apoſtle urgeth the Argument, 1 <hi>John
4. 11. If God ſo Loved us, we ought alſo to Love one
another:</hi> and he that conſiders, cannot chooſe;
for he muſt needs find himſelf ſweetly Ingaged
to Love God, of whoſe Love he is ſenſible; and
he that loves Him, loves all things in him: For
all things are <hi>his,</hi> and he tenders every thing he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53432:63"/>
hath made. The Love of God doth not confine
us to his ſingle abſtracted Eſſence, but requires
our Kindneſs to all that bear his Image, yea and
produceth it. <hi>Seraphick</hi> Love will be <hi>Catholick;</hi>
It doth not burn like a Lamp in a Sepulchre, but
'tis like the Stars of Heaven, that impart them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to all things: And as the Planets, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Light from the Sun, do not ſuck it in,
and ingroſs it, but diſperſe, and ſhed it abroad
upon the moſt diſtant Bodies; in like manner, a
Chriſtian Soul that is warmed and lightned by
Divine Love doth not keep it within it ſelf, but
communicates its benign Influences to all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are within its reach. The Love of
God in its proper Nature is diffuſive, and very
oppoſite to Envy and Animoſity; It Diſpels the
Clouds, and Allays the Tempeſts that ariſe from
the Body, and its Appetites; and compoſeth the
Soul to the Sweeteſt, and moſt even Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
It Inlarges our Minds, and Softens
our Affections, and Calms our Paſſions, and
Smooths the Ruggedneſs of our Natures; It
deſtroys our Pride and Selfiſhneſs, and ſo ſtrikes
up the Roots of Enmity, and Diviſions; and thus
diſpoſeth us to the moſt Generous and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
Charity.</p>
                        <p>(III.) <hi>Make the great Deſign of Religion, yours;</hi>
and know, that the Intent of <hi>that,</hi> is, not to fill
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53432:63"/>
our heads with Notion, or to teach us Syſtems
of Opinion; to reſolve us a Body of Difficult
Points, or to Inable us to talk plauſibly for leſſer
Truths; But to furniſh our minds with incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Virtue and inſtances of Duty; to direct us
to govern our Paſſions, and ſubdue our appetites
and ſelf-wills, in order to the glory of God, the
good of Societies, and our own preſent and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Intereſts: And if Chriſtians would take this
to be their buſineſs, and conſcientiouſly apply
themſelves unto it; they would find work enough
in their own hearts to imploy them, and neither
have time, nor occaſion to pry into the Infirmities
of others, nor inclination to quarrel with them:
they would ſee how unwiſe it is to be ſeeking,
and making Enemies, when they have ſo many
within themſelves; and how dangerous, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to a needleſs, and unjuſt forein War, while
a deadly domeſtick Foe is ſtrengthned by it. And
methinks 'tis wonderful, and 'tis ſad, that we
ſhould be ſo mild and indulgent to the Enemies
that we are bound to engage againſt by our Duty
to God, and to our ſelves, by his Laws, and our own
Reaſons, by the precepts and examples of his
Son our Saviour, by his Sacraments, and by his
Blood, by all things in Religion, and all things
in Intereſt; and at the ſame time, be ſo eager
againſt thoſe, whom we ought to conſider as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53432:64"/>
Friends, upon the account of our relation to God,
and the tie of common nature, and the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Divine Commands, and the intereſts of
Societies, and the practice of the beſt times paſt,
and the hopes of a future happineſs.</p>
                        <p>This is lamentable in it ſelf, and yet the more
ſo, for being common: And it ſeems to me ſuch
a kind of madneſs, as if a man ſhould be picking
cauſleſs quarrels with his Neighbours about a chip
of Wood, or a broken Hedge, when a Fire in his
houſe is conſuming his Goods, and Children:
Such Frenzies, and much greater, are our mutual
enmities and oppoſitions, while we quietly ſit
down in our unmortified Affections. And we
ſhould know them to be ſo, did we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
our Danger, or our Duty, and ſeriouſly
mind either the one, or other: We ſhould find then
that a Chriſtian hath no ſuch enemies as the Fleſh,
the world, and the Devil; that theſe will require
all our care, and imploy all our ſtrength, and
diligence: and he that knows this, and conſiders,
and acts ſuitably, will find too much in himſelf
to cenſure, and oppoſe, and too little to admire
himſelf for above other men; He will ſee ſufficient
reaſon to incline him to pardon his erring bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and be the more eaſily induced to exerciſe
charity, which himſelf ſo many ways needs. The
laſt Direction is this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:53432:64"/>
(IV.) <hi>Study the moderate pacifick ways, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and run not in extremes:</hi> both Truth, and
Love are in the middle; Extremes are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
After all the ſwaggering, and confidence
of Diſputers, there will be uncertainty in leſſer
matters: and when we travel in uncertain Roads,
'tis ſafeſt to chooſe the Middle. In this, though
we ſhould miſs a leſſer truth, (which yet is not
very likely) we ſhall meet with Charity, and
our gain will be greater than our loſs. He
that is extreme in his Principles, muſt needs
be narrow in his Affections: whereas he that
ſtands on the middle path, may extend the
arms of his Charity to thoſe on both ſides: It
is indeed very natural to moſt, to run into
extremes: and when men are faln Out with
a Practice, or Opinion, they think they can
never remove to too great a diſtance from it;
being frighted by the ſteep before them, they run
ſo far back, till they fall into a precipice behind
them. <hi>Every Truth is near an Errour;</hi> for it lies
between two Falſhoods: and he that goes far
from One, is apt to ſlip into the other; and while
he flies from a Bear, a Lyon meets him. So that
the beſt way to avoid the Danger is to ſteer the
middle Courſe; in which we may be ſure there
is Charity and Peace, and, very probably, Truth
in their Company. Thus of my Directions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="120" facs="tcp:53432:65"/>
FOr <hi>CONSIDERATIONS,</hi> I'le propoſe
ſuch, as ſhew the <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and Diſagreements upon the account of
different Opinions; which will prove that our
Affections ought to meet, though our Judgements
cannot. My firſt is this,</p>
                        <p>(I.) <hi>Love is part of Religion; but Opinions for the
ſake of which we loſe Charity, are not ſo.</hi> The Firſt,
I have proved already: and for the other, we
may conſider, That Religion conſiſts not in
knowing many things, but in practiſing the few
plain things we know. <hi>THE NECESSARY
PRINCIPLES OF FAITH LYE IN A
LITTLE ROOM. This is Life Eternal to know
thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt
ſent;</hi> Saith he that beſt knew what was Eternal
Life, and what neceſſary unto it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. And
the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> draws up all into the ſame
<hi>two</hi> Principles. <hi>He that cometh unto God muſt know
that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſeek him; Heb.</hi> 11. 6. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>bleſſed</hi> upon the ſingle Profeſſion, that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>Chriſt, the Son of the Living God,</hi> Mat.
16. 16. and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was baptized upon the
<hi>ſame, Act.</hi> 8. 37. St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons <hi>theſe</hi> as the
<hi>only</hi> Neceſſaries to Salvation, <hi>Rom. 10. 9. If
thou confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53432:65"/>
in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou
ſhalt be ſave.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> to the ſame purpoſe,
<hi>Whoſever believes that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi>
This Faith indeed muſt ſuppoſe the general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of natural Religion, and produce the Real
Fruits of Righteouſneſs to make it effectual to
its end; and theſe ſuppoſed, the Apoſtles ſpeak
as if it contain'd all that is eſſentially neceſſary to
be believed, and known, in order to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Thus the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of belief are few,
and plain: For certainly the Divine Goodneſs
would not lay our Eternal Intereſts in Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and multitudes; things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and retained. <hi>The difficult work of Religion
is not in the Underſtanding, but in the Affections, and
Will.</hi> So that the Principles, in which Religion
conſiſts, are the clearly revealed Articles in which
we are agreed. For the others about which we
differ, and diſpute, though ſome of them may be
conſequences of thoſe, and good helps to the
practice of Religion, yet I ſhould be loth to
make them a neceſſary and eſſential part of it:
For he that ſaith they are, concludes all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a ſtate of Ruine and Damnation, who either
do not know, or are not able to receive them:
An uncharitableneſs, that is as bad as Hereſie, if
it be not one it ſelf. The ſum is, Religion lies
in few Principles, I mean as to the Eſſence of it;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53432:66"/>
and that principally conſiſts in Practice. So the
Prophet reckons, <hi>Mic. 6. 8. He hath ſhewed thee
O man what is good: and what doth the Lord require of
thee, but to do Juſtice, and love Mercy, and to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with thy God?</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> gives an Account
of Religion like it, <hi>Jam. 1. 17. True Religion,
and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to Viſit
the Widow, and Fatherleſs in their Afflictions, and to
keep himſelf unſpotted from the World.</hi> Religion is an
Holy Life, and Charity is a main branch of that;
But Opinions are no vital part, nor do they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to the ſubſtance of it. And ſhall we
loſe a Limb for an Excreſcence, or an Ornament;
An Eſſential of Religion for that which is but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and extrinſick; Charity, for an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
I think 'tis not reaſonable, and I hope you
think ſo likewiſe. But I offer to your Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</p>
                        <p>(II.) <hi>Charity is certainly our Duty, but many of
the Opinions, about which we fall out, are uncertainly
true;</hi> viz. as to us. The main, and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Points of Faith are indeed as firm as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
but the Opinions of men are as fluctuating as
the Waves of the Ocean. The Root, and body
of a Tree is faſt, and unſhaken; while the Leaves
are made the ſport of every Wind: And Colours
ſometimes vary with every poſition of the Object,
and the Eye, though the Light of the Sun be an
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53432:66"/>
uniform Splendour. The Foundation of God
ſtandeth ſure, but men often build upon it what
is very Tottering, and uncertain. The great
Truths of Religion are eaſily diſcernable, but
the ſmaller, and remoter ones require more ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and acuteneſs to deſcry them; and the beſt
ſight may be deceived about ſuch obſcure, and
diſtant Objects. And methinks 'tis very ſtrange,
that men ſhould be ſo exceſſively confident of the
Truth, and Certainty of their Opinions, ſince
they cannot but know the Weakneſs of Humane
underſtanding in general, and cannot but often
have found the Fallibility of their own. The
Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>we know but in part, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 9.
and makes Confidence an Argument of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. If any man think that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any thing, he knoweth nothing yet, as he
ought to know. And <hi>Solomon</hi> reckons it as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Folly; <hi>The Fool rageth, and is confident:</hi>
and there is nothing that diſcovers it more;</p>
                        <p>For let us conſider; The Scripture hath not
been ſo clear, and expreſs in defining leſſer Points;
and the words, in which they are thought to be
Lodged, are many times figurative, and obſcure,
and of various meaning, ſpoken only by the by,
or agreeably to forms of ſpeech, or cuſtoms, that
we do not know; or by way of condeſcenſion to
common Apprehenſion: And therefore we ſee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53432:67"/>
that Interpretations are infinite, and there is no
ſort of men leſs agreed, than Commentators:
All Opinions plead Scripture, and many pretend
to reaſon, and moſt to Antiquity. The Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the Prudent; Churches, and Councils;
Confeſſors, and Fathers; the former, and the
latter Ages; the Vertuous, and the Devout;
the Credulous, and the Inquiſitive, they have all
differ'd in the leſſer matters of Belief: And every
man differs from almoſt every other in ſome
thing, and every man differs often from himſelf
in many things: Age hath altered our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or we are children ſtill: Our Affections
change our Thoughts, and our Imaginations
ſhift the Scene: and what we call Reaſon is many
times but a chain of Phantaſms. And we are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by prejudices, and over-ruled by Authority,
and formed by Education; and ſuck in our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Careleſly, and by accident: We are deeply
ſetled, before we have examined; and when we
examine, 'tis but by halves; we ſee but few
things, and judge all things by thoſe we ſee:
We either ſeek not Truth at all, or are unable
to manage a due, and impartial ſearch; when
we ſtumble upon it, we do not know it; and
when 'tis in ſight we boggle, and are afraid, and
run away from it; or ſtand, to pelt it with dirt,
and vile Names: In the mean while, we catch
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53432:67"/>
at ſhadows, and grow fond of the Images of our
own Fanſies, and cry up theſe for Truth, and
Faith; and diſturb Societies, and the Peace of
mankind, to gain credit to our Dreams. Such a
thing is man, and ſuch reaſons have we to be
confident of our Opinions; and to hate thoſe that
are not of our Perſwaſion; and to forſake a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Duty for Doubtful Tenents. Theſe things,
well conſidered, might leſſen our fondneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Opinions, and promote our Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
each other; which will grow by the ſame
degrees, by which the other decreaſeth. And
that it may, I add this further to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(III.) <hi>Chriſtian Love is neceſſary, but Agreement
in Opinions is neither neceſſary, nor poſſible.</hi> 'Tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true indeed, that the <hi>WAY</hi> to <hi>HEAVEN</hi>
is but <hi>One,</hi> and to walk in that, is the one thing
neceſſary: but then that is not the particular
Path of this Sect, or another: but the way of
an Holy Life; which may be practiſed under ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different Forms of Apprehenſion, and Belief.
Though the way be not broad in reſpect of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
or ſenſual Indulgence; yet it hath a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in reſpect of Judgement, and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Opinion. The Paths may be many in this
Royal Road; and 'tis not abſolutely neceſſary,
that we ſhould meaſure Foot-ſteps, and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53432:68"/>
tread the ſame: He that goes in the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and neareſt, is in the beſt condition for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and Safety; but another that goes about,
or in the rugged and uneven Path, may come to
the ſame journeys end, though with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and danger: And I ſhall not deny to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him Pardon for the folly of his choice, leſt
poſſibly
I ſhould need it my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, we are commanded to hold the
Unity of the Spirit, and that is neceſſary: but
this is in the Eſſentials of Faith, and Life, in which
all good men are agreed, notwithſtanding that
their forward Zeal will not permit them to ſee
it: Unity in the leſſer things may be requiſite for
Peace, and the Intereſts of Societies; but 'tis not
abſolutely ſo, for the Salvation of mens Souls:
Yea different Apprehenſion about Opinions in
Religion might conſiſt well enough with Peace,
and publique ſafety likewiſe, could men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to be modeſt, to keep their Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to themſelves, or not to fanſie their Conceits
neceſſary for all the reſt of mankind; and ſo vex
their Neighbours, provoke their Rulers, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle
Government, for the Propagation of
them.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a frequent Wiſh with ſome, <hi>That all men
were once of one mind:</hi> but then it muſt be <hi>theirs,</hi>
no doubt; for they would not judge it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53432:68"/>
upon other terms: They may as well wiſh
that we were all of one Age, Complexion, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and Degree of Underſtanding: In theſe
we ſee Providence hath order'd a great diverſity,
and in this there is both Beauty and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
Perhaps variety of Opinions may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
into us for the ſame reaſons; and much of
the pleaſure of Converſation, and inquiry would
be loſt, if there were an univerſal Harmony in
our Conceptions: But however this is, 'tis enough,
that ſuch an agreement is not neceſſary; Yea, I
take the other Step, 'tis impoſſible,</p>
                        <p>Our Tempers, Capacities, Educations, Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's,
Converſes, Intereſts, and Accidents are
ſtrangely divers; and therefore our Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt needs be different. There is ſcarce any
exact likeneſs in Nature: and all the variety that
is, ariſeth from the various mixture of a few Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
How great a diverſity then muſt needs
proceed from the different Combination of ſo
many things as influence our Belief, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Since the World began to this day, men
have been of different Opinions; and, no doubt,
they will be ſo to the end of it: For circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
conſider'd, 'tis morally impoſſible it ſhould
be otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>Seeing then that Charity is neceſſary, and
agreement in Opinions is neither neceſſary, nor
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53432:69"/>
poſſible; we ought to comply with our main
Duty, notwithſtanding any leſſer difference. If
this were conſider'd, there might be ſome Hope
of reconciling; and Contenders would ſee, that
though they differ, yet they <hi>need</hi> not, they <hi>ought</hi>
not to divide; but Unity of Affection might be
preſerved amid diverſity of Opinions: For which
happy Chriſtian temper men would ſee more
reaſon, if they would Conſider,</p>
                        <p>(IV.) That <hi>Errours, of themſelves, are Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Underſtanding, and not Enormities of the
Will:</hi> For no man is willing to be deceived: So
that they ought not to be the Objects of our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
but our pity. We hate no man for being
Poor, or Blind, or Lame: and Errour is the
Poverty, and Blindneſs, and Lameneſs of the
mind. We all are Pilgrims in our Way to the
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above: If ſome will go in this
Path, ſome in the other, theſe in a Circuit, and
thoſe amongſt the Rocks; we may be ſure, 'tis
becauſe they know not the danger, and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
which they Chooſe: So that we may,
and we ought to perſwade them, all we can, not
to divert into thoſe Ways: But if they will, upon
the Suppoſition, and Belief of their being beſt;
we may lament their unhappy miſtake, but muſt
not beat them, or throw Stones at them for it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:53432:69"/>
Errour is founded in Ignorance; even that
groſs one of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> about the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is
imputed to their <hi>not knowing</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor the
<hi>power</hi> of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 29. and both Reaſon,
and Charity requires us to pity Ignorance, and to
pardon it. Our Saviour makes it the motive of
his Prayer for the forgiveneſs of the Jews that
Murdered him, <hi>Luke 23. 34. Father forgive them,
for they know not what they do.</hi> 'Tis very true, that
Errour many times is occaſioned by a corrupt
Bias in the Will, and Affections; But then if our
erring Brother be ſincere in other matters, we are
not to conclude that his Underſtanding is this
way corrupted; and we can ſcarce be certain of
it in any caſe: Or, if it be, (if he believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
he doth not know that his Intereſt or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are the things, which prevail with his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and ſo Ignorance is at the bottom ſtill:
For 'tis a Contradiction that any man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that, which he doth not think is true, though
he have never ſo much Appetite, or Intereſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him: And if theſe oblige a man to profeſs
againſt the Dictates of his mind, or to ſuſpend
the exerciſe of it, (as oftentimes they do) ſuch
men are to be reckon'd under the Character of
Vitious, and not barely erroneous; and ſo are
not to be counted among meer Diſſenters in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
concerning whom I am now diſcourſing.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53432:70"/>
And that you may not raſhly judge that your
Brother ſpeaks againſt his Conſcience, becauſe
he profeſſeth the belief of things that to us ſeem
very wild and abſurd, and ſo hate him as a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver,
and an Hypocrite; when heis but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently
miſtaken perſon; I add this other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(V.) <hi>That we ought to make allowance for Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Authority, and fair pretences;</hi> which have a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power, even over honeſt minds, and do often
unavoidably lead them into Errour. For let us
conſider, how eaſily we receive the firſt impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and how deeply they ſink into our ſouls:
Childhood refuſeth no folly, examines no abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
Education makes it any thing; The firſt is
entertained as beſt, and what-ever offers after, is
execrated and deſpiſed, if it be not like it. This
is the condition of all Man-kind in their tender
age, and the far greateſt part carry the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to their graves, that they ſucked in infancy;
And hence it comes about, that there is nothing
more impoſſible, or ridiculous, even in dreams,
and diſtracted imaginations, than the things
which have been entertain'd by great numbers of
men, as Sacred: There are no conceits in <hi>Bedlam</hi>
more wild and extravagant, than many about
Religion, which have been believ'd firmly, and
zealouſly promoted, and fiercely contended for,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53432:70"/>
even to Blood and Deſolation, by mighty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and whole Empires; by Princes and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
by Great men, and Learned; by Devout,
and Prudent, in long Succeſſions from Father to
Son, many Ages together. And all theſe follies
have been firſt impoſed by Education, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Authority, and Cuſtom; The power
of which is very great, and very few have ſtrength
enough in their Underſtandings to overcome it:
And in matters of Religion they are afraid to
uſe their Reaſons againſt thoſe <hi>Follies</hi> which are
taught to be Divine Dictates, above all humane
Intellect, and not to be tryed or examined by
it. Upon which accounts it hath been, that Man-kind
hath been more extravagantly mad in many
Tenents about Religion, than in any thing elſe
whatſoever: For in other things the uſe of Reaſon
is permitted, but in Religion it hath been almoſt
Univerſally denyed.</p>
                        <p>Thus then, the far greateſt part of men, are
ſlaves to the Principles in which they were bred;
and our conſtitution, infirmity, and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are ſuch, that very few can help it; and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the moſt is in a manner unavoidable, at
leaſt in the weaker ſort, and Herd of men: For
they have no doubts, about what they have been
always Taught; and have little or no capacity,
inclination, or opportunity, to Examine: So
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53432:71"/>
that 'tis morally impoſſible for them to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the prejudices they lie under; And
conſequently we ought not to judge them Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
becauſe they profeſs things incredible, and
ridiculous; or hate them for believing them,
when 'tis ſo difficult, and ſo almoſt impoſſible,
that they ſhould do otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>And yet we are further to conſider, how much
thoſe that differ from us, and err in the things in
which they differ, are to be allowed upon the
account of the Authority, and Example of many
learned, wiſe, pious, and devout Men that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct,
and incourage them in their way; and
deeply threaten any diverſion from it: This is a
mighty prejudice, when 'tis on the ſide of Errour,
and, no doubt, many honeſt minds are carried
away by it. We are naturally apt to follow others,
eſpecially thoſe that we eſteem; and 'tis reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do ſo in things, that we are not ſo well
able to judge of our ſelves; and modeſt to permit
our judgements to be inclin'd by the ſenſe of thoſe
that are wiſer, and better. So that He may be a
good man, and a lover of Truth, that yet is
much Miſtaken in his Opinion; which, in ſuch
a caſe as this, is his Unhappineſs, not his Fault.</p>
                        <p>And I may add the other thing mention'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> that we ought to allow our erring brother
for the fair, and ſpecious pretences which many
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53432:71"/>
errours plead for themſelves; as Antiquity, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Conſent of Churches, Reverend Names, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality,
Gods Glory, Goſpel-light, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and many other ſuch, which ſound well, and
ſway much with many very pious people who
are taken with the pretence, but are not able to
diſcern the fallacy; and ſo ſwallow the errour for
the ſake of thoſe fine Names, wherewith it is gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
In which caſe alſo, there is Infirmity, and
Misfortune, that require our Pity, and our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
but nothing that can juſtifie our Rage
or Hatred. Yea, why ſhould we not Love
him for the Zeal and Reſpect he hath to thoſe
good things, the ſhadows of which have deceived
him, rather than Hate him for his weakneſs in
Miſtaking? And for thoſe that are ſo Rigid to
the Infirmities of Miſtaken Judgements, I wiſh
they would Conſider,</p>
                        <p>(VI.) That <hi>in many things they may err them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi>
and therefore ſhall have need of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of others. There is none of us, I hope, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt,
as to ſay, or think, that he is miſtaken
in nothing: If any do, that perſon errs more,
than moſt of thoſe whoſe Errours he cenſures:
And if he acknowledgeth that he errs in ſome
things, though he knows not the particulars: he
is himſelf concerned in the plea for Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the erroneous. If we were infallible, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53432:72"/>
all our Opinions were Certainties, and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
we might then have more pretence for
our Stifneſs, and Severities; But to confeſs the
Infirmities of our own underſtandings, and to
give no candid allowances to other mens failings,
this is utterly inexcuſable, and contrary to our own
intereſts: For in this rigorous way, every man
condemns himſelf, and puts a weapon into every
other mans hand to deſtroy him. Let him that is
without Errour, throw the firſt Stone at the Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous;
but if he begins, that is obnoxious him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
what favour can he expect? The ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he hath to Aſſault thoſe before him, all the
reſt have to Pelt him: So that to hate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
our Brother for his ſuppoſed Errours, is,
beſides the other evil things, very unwiſe, and
unpolitick, and contrary to the principles of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Self-love. If this were well conſider'd,
Intereſt might perhaps effect that in ſome, which
ſenſe of Duty cannot.</p>
                        <p>Now in all this, I have no intention to make
Apologies for Errour, but to lay ſure grounds for
Univerſal Love; and what I have ſaid, is not for
the Intereſt of any particular Sect, but it is the
joynt concern of all parties in Religion; ſince
they all equally need each others Charity. If any
man be Angry, and think I would have him be
too kind to the Erroneous; he will, I hope, be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53432:72"/>
pacified, when he conſiders, that I alſo deſign to
make them kind to him; and the kindneſs I plead
for, reſpects mens Perſons, and Vertuous Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and my Charity is to the Infirmities of their
Underſtandings: but for the fondneſs, and bitter
Zeal; the pride, and narrowneſs; the malice,
ſcorn, and ſeparation, that uſeth to go with the
opinions of Sects; theſe I confeſs are very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and deteſtable; and 'tis very hard not to be
warmed to Indignation by them: Theſe are
Vices, and Immoralities; and a True Catholick,
that loves God, and his Neighbour heartily, may,
and ought, to manifeſt his reſentments againſt
them, in order to the diſcountenancing and curing
ſuch hateful and deadly evils. Thus of my <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Propoſe the <hi>CAUTIONS</hi> under the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heads;</p>
                        <p>(I.) <hi>Beware of inordinate Admiration, and Love
of any Sect:</hi> When we paſſionately Admire a
Party, we are apt to Deſpiſe them that differ from
it; and to confine the Church to thoſe of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way: Hence it is that fond Opinators inveſt
their beloved Congregation, with all the glorious
Priviledges, and Titles, making Angels of their
own men; whenas for others, they lookdown
upon them, as heretical, or carnal, as formal peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53432:73"/>
or meerly moral, who are ſtrangers to Gods
Grace, and Covenant, and ignorant of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Faith and Religion; and therefore they will
not defile themſelves with their Converſation,
nor come into their Aſſemblies. They look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reſt of Chriſtians with an eye of pride, and
ſcorn; and affectedly thank God that they are
not like theſe Publicans, theſe men of the world:
They hug themſelves in the dear opinion of their
own Light; and conclude all others to be in
Darkneſs. They heap up Teachers to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. and doat upon their own
Apoſtles; I am for <hi>Paul,</hi> or I am for <hi>Apollos,</hi> or
I am for <hi>Cephas:</hi> This is a <hi>pretious</hi> man, or that is
a <hi>Goſpel-Preacher;</hi> ſuch a one is very <hi>Powerful,</hi> and
ſuch a one is very <hi>Sweet,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual;</hi> and O
how Beautiful are the Feet of thoſe Meſſengers of
good tydings to them, while they aſſure them by
the Marks of their Sect, that they are Gods Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
and Choſen People!</p>
                        <p>Which Fondneſs were not ſo Miſchievous, if
at the ſame time all others were not counted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
and Caſt-aways; But this follows, and
many other fatal evils: endleſs Enmities are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
and Charity is deſtroyed, and the foundation
is laid for Cruelty, and Perſecution: and Gods
goodneſs, which is to his whole Church, is
wronged by being narrowed, and Chriſts Blood
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53432:73"/>
is undervalued, and the greateſt part of his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
is by theſe men given to the Devil, and
Chriſtianity is undermined, and the Peace of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is overthrown: All this we have ſadly ſeen;
and I have ſaid nothing here out of any Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
or Bitterneſs; nor have I any deſign to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any good man, or number of men Odious,
or Contemptible; but to repreſent the Vanity,
and the Miſchief of this fond ſpirit, of admiring
Parties; which hath been very fatal to Charity,
and to the whole body of Religion.</p>
                        <p>And we ſhall underſtand more of the evil of it,
if we conſider St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s deſcription of the Sectaries
of his time, who looked upon themſelves as the
only illuminated people, and deſpiſed all other
Chriſtians: Theſe the Apoſtle deſcribes (1.) by
the <hi>groundleſneſs,</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> of their conceits;
They were <hi>Dreamers, ver.</hi> 8. (2.) by their <hi>inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
againſt Government; They Deſpiſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and ſpake Evil of Dignities; in the ſame
Verſe: (3.) by their <hi>ignorant malice,</hi> ver. 10. They
ſpoke <hi>evil of things they knew not;</hi> (4.) by their <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi>
and <hi>Unmercifulneſs</hi> to their Brethren; They
have gone in the <hi>way of Cain;</hi> (5.) by their <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,</hi>
and Projecting againſt their Rulers, <hi>ver.</hi>
11. And periſhed in the <hi>gain ſaying of Core;</hi> (6.)
By the <hi>ſpeciouſneſs</hi> of their ſhews, and appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
They were <hi>Clouds,</hi> ver. 12. (7.) By their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53432:74"/>
                           <hi>emptineſs,</hi> and want of real vertue, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

(8.) By their <hi>unconſtancy,</hi> and <hi>unſetledneſs;</hi>
They were <hi>carried about of winds:</hi> (9.) By their

(10.) By their <hi>eminency,</hi> and <hi>pretended Light;</hi>
They were <hi>Stars:</hi> (11.) By the <hi>irregularity</hi> of

they were <hi>Wandring Stars:</hi> (12.) By their <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſs;</hi>
They were <hi>Murmurers, Complainers,</hi>
ver. 16. (13.) by their <hi>Stubbornneſs</hi> in the

they are called <hi>Mockers,</hi> ver. 18. (17.) By their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
ver. 19. <hi>Theſe be they who Separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi>
(18.) By their real <hi>Senſuality,</hi> and ſelf-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
under great Boaſts, and pretenſions to the
<hi>Spirit; ſenſual,</hi> having not the <hi>Spirit.</hi> This is
the Apoſtles deſcription of the firſt <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> the
<hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who admired themſelves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the Communion of other Chriſtians,
under pretence of greater Holineſs: And I could
wiſh they had had no Succeſſors among us; and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53432:74"/>
they will have the fewer, if we learn to avoid the
undue Admiration of any particular Sect.</p>
                        <p>My next Caution is,</p>
                        <p>(II.) <hi>That you avoid eager, and paſſionate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes;</hi>
in theſe, Charity is always loſt, and Truth
ſeldom, or never found: When the Paſſion is
raiſed, the Judgement is gone; and there is no
ſeeing to the bottom in diſturbed, and muddied
waters. 'Tis the calm, and quiet conſiderer that
finds Truth, while the hot, and confident diſputer
loſeth both himſelf, and it; when his paſſion is once
kindled, he cannot ſpeak any thing pertinently
himſelf, nor underſtand what is ſpoken to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
by another; and ſo can neither convince,
nor be convinced. If thou differ with thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then, do not ruffle with him in vehement
diſputes, but remember the <hi>Apologue:</hi> The Sun
and Wind contended for the Travellers Cloak;
the Wind bluſter'd about him, and endeavoured
to prevail by violence; but with this bad ſucceſs,
that the man held his Garment the faſter for it:
At length, the Sun ſhines forth with a calm and
inſinuating beam, which warmed him gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly,
and caus'd him at laſt to throw his Cloak
from him. If thou art deſirous to prevail with
thy friend to lay down his Opinion, aſſault him
not by the fierceneſs of diſputes; For ſuch attempts
will but raiſe his paſſion, and that will make him
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53432:75"/>
ſtick the cloſer to his Errour; but ſhine upon him
with a calm light, inſinuate thy better principle
by modeſt, and gentle ſuggeſtions. He that
hath wedded any falſhood, hath many preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
againſt the contrary Truth; and theſe are
not to be torn off all at once, but ſoftly, and by
degrees to be unwound: This is the likelieſt way
to prevail upon Diſſenters; or, if at any time it
fails of its ſucceſs, there is however no hurt
done: Charity and Peace are preſerved, which
are much better, than moſt Opinions, for which
we contend: Whereas by Diſputes men are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
provoked, and tempted to pour forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Idle, and many bitter words; the quiet and
temper of their minds is diſturbed, and likely the
Peace of others alſo: They are brought no whit
nearer each other, in their Judgements, but put
at a much greater diſtance, in their Affections:
Whereas by the other method of calm proceeding
all theſe evils are avoided.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, we are commanded to contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
for the faith that was once delivered to the
Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. But the Faith there meant, doth
not conſiſt in points of doubtful diſputation, but
in the Fundamental Article That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is the
Meſſias,</hi> joyn'd with a <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
and the perſons againſt whom thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Chriſtians were to contend, were <hi>Ungodly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53432:75"/>
Men</hi> that denied <hi>the only Lord God,</hi> and <hi>our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> ver. 5. For theſe Eſſential matters, we
may, and we ought to be earneſt; but Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about leſſer things, is called by the Apoſtle,
<hi>Perverſe-Diſputing,</hi> and reckoned as the effect of
pride, and ignorance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. And hence
I paſs to a Third Caution, which is this,</p>
                        <p>(III.) <hi>Beware of Zeal about Opinions;</hi> by which,
I mean all the Propoſitions of leſs certainty, or
conſequence: About theſe we may, no doubt,
be inquiſitive and thoughtful; and our ſearch
will be commendable, while we manage it with
modeſty, and caution, in order to the gaining
more Motives, and directions for a vertuous
Practice: But to be eager in them, and to diſturb
the peace of Societies for their ſakes; this is a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and dangerous exceſs, deſtructive to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Charity, and the publick weal, and order.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing hath done the world more
miſchief, than indiſcreet, unſeaſonable Zeal for
Truths, while men have not made a difference
between thoſe, that are neceſſary to be believed,
and known; and thoſe others, which may ſafely
be doubted, and denied: 'Tis a great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
miſtake to think, that we ought to publiſh,
and propagate all the Truth we know; For every
man thinks his own Opinions about Religion,
Gods Truth; and nature inclines men to deſire to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53432:76"/>
beget their own image upon other mens minds;
and if this be made a Duty too, every man will
be a Teacher of all the reſt; and no man will let
his brother be at quiet; This man is ready to burſt
till he hath given himſelf vent; and the other
is as impatient, till he hath contradicted what he
hath ſaid: Both are zealous to Proſelyte each
other, and neither can be contented with a ſingle
conqueſt, till the publick be diſturbed. Theſe
are ſome of the effects of opinionative zeal, and
we know it by a dear experience. Here is the
ſource of all Diviſions, and Sects. Gods Truth
is the pretence of every Party, and being enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themſelves, they all think they ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
all others; and theſe Lights meeting, and
being infinitely reflected, beget a flame between
them, in which all of them are ſcorched, and
Charity, and Peace are conſumed.</p>
                        <p>If therefore we are friends to Chriſtian Love,
let us avoid, and oppoſe this its moſt fatal enemy;
and conſider, That we need not be zealous for
more truth, than what God hath made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and ought not to be zealous for more, than
what Scripture and Reaſon have made certain;
That the Neceſſary, and certain things are very
few, and the remoter doctrines difficult, and
deep; That we may eaſily be deceived in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
points, where ſo much acuteneſs, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53432:76"/>
and care, and diligence is needful; That
the greateſt part imbrace Shadows, and their
Zeal is for folly, and falſhood: That our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
may be good men, though they underſtand
not many things that we know; or err in many
in which we judge aright; That the benefits of
an Opinion, if true, will not make amends for
the trouble, and diſturbance, that is made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it; and That Charity is more valuable than
Knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 1. 1 Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p>If we thus Conſider, we ſhall be contented
with the ſatisfactions of our own minds, and not
be Angry with others becauſe they will not take
us for their Guides; we ſhall exerciſe our Zeal
upon the neceſſary, certain things; and our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
about the reſt; we ſhall inform our brother
who needs, or deſires it; and let him alone when
it may do him, or others hurt to diſturb him;
we ſhall propoſe our Opinions ſeaſonably, and
modeſtly, and be willing that men ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, as they can; we ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
at any mans Miſtake, that doth not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to Vice, and when it doth, we ſhall prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and calmly endeavour to rectifie his thoughts;
we ſhall converſe indifferently with all Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without wrangling, and diſcord; and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
our Charity, and Good Will towards the Good
men of any ſort: Thus our Zeal will be rightly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53432:77"/>
tempered, and directed, and Charity promoted.
And yet further in order to it, I propoſe this laſt
Caution:</p>
                        <p>(IV.) <hi>Beware of cenſuring, and affixing odious
Names and conſequences upon the perſons or opinions of
Diſſenters.</hi> He that Cenſures another, in part
Hates him; and wants many degrees of that
Charity the Apoſtle commends, and deſcribes,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6, 7. which <hi>beareth all things, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
all things, believeth all things, endureth all things.</hi>
He that Rails at his Neighbour for his Opinion,
wants only power to Perſecute him for it: yea,
even this is a kind of Perſecution; for there is a
perſecution of the Tongue, as well as of the
Hand; and He that Injures his Brother in his
Name, is a Perſecutor, as well as the other, that
hurts him in his Body or Eſtate. Let us take heed
then, leſt we become guilty by faſtning names of
Reproach upon thoſe of different Judgement;
and impoſing the odious conſequences that we
our ſelves make, upon our Neighbour, as his
Opinion: Both theſe are very common, and the
Spight, and Injuſtice of them do exceedingly exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
our Spirits, and enflame our Diſagreements:
By this way, Truth is expoſed to contempt, and
ſcorn, as well as Falſhood; and there is none ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
but its Adverſaries have made it a deformed
Vizard, to bring it under the Hatred and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53432:77"/>
of the Ignorant; and that which hath an
Ugly Face, is more than half condemned among
the generality of men, who cannot diſtinguiſh the
true complexion, from the dirt that is thrown
upon it: This the Zealots of all Parties very well
underſtand, when they run down many things
by a Vile name which they cannot Confute by
Argument: 'Tis but raiſing the Cry of <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,
Socinianiſm, Popery, Pelagianiſm,</hi> and ſuch
like upon them; and all other Refutation is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous:
Theſe I mention not out of Favour, but
for Inſtance; and 'tis the like in many other caſes.</p>
                        <p>Thus apt are men to be frighted by Bugbear
Names, from Truth, and Charity: And this is
Superſtition in the true ſenſe, to be afraid of things
in which there is no hurt; and it is promoted by
the Uncharitable faſtning of our own conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon our brothers Opinion; This we think
follows, and then make no Scruple to ſay, 'tis his
Opinion; when he hates, and diſowns it, and
would quit his Tenent, if he thought any ſuch
thing were a conſequence from it: And thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
are our differences heightned, and rendred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
incurable.</p>
                        <p>If then we have any kindneſs for Charity and
Chriſtian Love, let us take care of ſuch diſ-ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
practices: A true Catholick ſhould not take any
Name to himſelf, but that of a Chriſtian; nor
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53432:78"/>
Reproach any other with any Style of Infamy.
He ſhould not, and cannot in Modeſty, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
charge his brother with any Opinion which
he will not own, though he never ſo clearly ſee
that it may be concluded, from what he believes
and teacheth. If men would learn to be thus
Fair, and Candid, to each other, our Differences
would be reduced to a narrower Circle; and there
might be ſome hopes that Peace and Love would
revive, and flouriſh in our Borders.</p>
                        <p>IF any now ſhould ask me, Whether this
Doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Love</hi> do not tend to <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Toleration?</hi> I ſhould anſwer, that thus far it
doth, <hi>viz.</hi> that all private perſons ſhould Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
each other, and bear with their brothers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;
That every man ſhould allow another
that Liberty, which he deſires himſelf, in things
wherein the Laws of God, and the Land, have
left him Free; and permit him his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
without Cenſure, or Diſpleaſure: Such a
Toleration, I think, Chriſtianity requires in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men;</p>
                        <p>But as to the <hi>Publick,</hi> I do by no means think
it Modeſt for Us to determine what the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould do: And in This caſe, 'tis as unfit
as in Any whatſoever; ſince this matter depends
upon the Conſideration of ſo many Things, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53432:78"/>
'tis very Difficult to ſtate the Bounds of Juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and Reſtraint: Leaving That therefore
to Their Prudence, whom Providence hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to determine in It; I ſhall only ſay, that ſo
much Toleration, as may conſiſt with the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of Religion, and Publick Safety, may be
Granted: But ſuch a Liberty as is prejudicial to
any of Theſe, ſhould not be expected: For Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and all other Conſiderations, oblige the
Government to provide for the Common Good.
And were the Duty of Catholick Charity duly
practiſed; and Private Chriſtians once perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to Tolerate one another; it might then be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for the Government to give a Larger publick
Toleration than poſſibly now is fit. In the mean
while, without troubling our ſelves with fanſies
about the Duty of our Governours, Let us mind
our Own; eſpecially this great one, of Charity
and Chriſtian Love: And if we mind this, and
practiſe ſutably, God will be Glorified, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
Advanced; the Church will be Edified, and
our Souls Comforted; Government will be Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
and the Peace of the world Promoted;
And the <hi>Peace of God which paſſeth all Underſtanding,</hi>

<hi>The King is the Figure of
God among Men.</hi> But beſides all this, there is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough in the nature of the thing to prove,
that <hi>Kings</hi> have their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> from
<hi>God,</hi> and are no <hi>Subſtitutes</hi> of the <hi>People:</hi> which I
thus inferr.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:53432:83"/>
                           <hi>God</hi> made the World, and conſequently the
World is <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> alone is the <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi>
it: But <hi>he</hi> being of ſuch immenſe perfections, that
our Frailty cannot bear his immediate converſes;
'tis neceſſary that <hi>he</hi> rule us by men like our ſelves,
and put the Sword into the hands of Creatures of
our own make. This he doth, and hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that they that <hi>Rule</hi> are <hi>Gods Subſtitutes,</hi> and
no <hi>Creatures</hi> of the <hi>People:</hi> For the People have no
power to <hi>Govern</hi> themſelves, and conſequently
cannot devolve any upon another.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole I conclude, that the ſame
Commands and Authority that oblige us to obey
<hi>God,</hi> bind us to revere thoſe that ſo ſignally wear
his <hi>Image:</hi> and he that diſobeys the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
the <hi>Soveraign. He that reſiſts, reſiſts the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> and <hi>who can lift up
himſelf againſt the Lords Anointed and be guiltleſs?</hi>
ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Saul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus I have diſpatched the <hi>firſt,</hi> viz. <hi>Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
affronts</hi> the <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with which Kings
are inveſted; as I think I have made evident from
<hi>teſtimony,</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing.</hi>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> RESISTANCE is <hi>oppoſite</hi> to the <hi>Spirit</hi>
of RELIGION: Religion is of a calm and <hi>paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi>
temper, like that of its <hi>Author,</hi> whoſe <hi>voice
was not heard in the ſtreet.</hi> It ſubdues our <hi>paſſions,</hi>
                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:53432:84"/>
and governs our <hi>appetites;</hi> it deſtroys our <hi>pride</hi> and
<hi>ſordid ſelfiſhneſs;</hi> it allays the <hi>tempeſts,</hi> and ſpeaks
down the <hi>ſtorms</hi> of our natures; it ſweetens our
<hi>Humours,</hi> and poliſheth the <hi>roughneſs</hi> of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:
it makes men <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>peaceable, meek</hi> and
<hi>compliant.</hi> This was the Spirit of the great <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar</hi>
of our Religion; this was the genius of his

                        <p>He commands the payment of all Duties to
<hi>Caeſar;</hi> He acknowledgeth <hi>Pilates Power</hi> to be from
<hi>above;</hi> He commands his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to pray for their
<hi>Perſecutors;</hi> He permits them to <hi>flie,</hi> not to <hi>oppoſe.</hi>
He rebukes <hi>Peters violence</hi> to the High Prieſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
and the <hi>revenge of the Diſciples,</hi> when they
called for <hi>Fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He paid <hi>Tribute,</hi> ſubmitted to the Laws of the

                        </p>
                        <p>This was his temper: and the Apoſtles who
lived among <hi>his enemies</hi> and <hi>theirs,</hi> and met with
ſeverity enough to have <hi>ſowred</hi> their <hi>Spirits,</hi> and
<hi>exaſperated</hi> their <hi>Pens</hi> to contrary reſolutions and
inſtructions; Yet as true Followers of their dear
Lord, they faithfully tranſmit to us what they had
learnt from him, <hi>viz. That we ſhould obey thoſe that
have the rule over us; ſubmit to every ordinance of man;
pray for Kings and all in authority; ſubmit to Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Powers, and to obey Magiſtrates.</hi>

And thoſe <hi>Noble Spirits</hi> of the firſt Ages after,
who began to be <hi>Martyrs</hi> as ſoon as to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi>
who lived in the <hi>Fire,</hi> and went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
wrapt in thoſe <hi>Flames</hi> that had leſs <hi>ardor</hi> than
their <hi>love: Theſe,</hi> I ſay, amidſt the greateſt and
fierceſt <hi>Fires</hi> that <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Barbariſm</hi> had kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,
paid the Tribute of a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to their <hi>Murderers,</hi> and made unforced
acknowledgements of the right they had to their
obedience. Nor do we ever read of any attempts
they made to free themſelves by <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> though
(as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith) they were in powerful num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
mingled in their <hi>Villages,</hi> and in their <hi>Cities;</hi>
yea, in their <hi>Caſtles,</hi> and in their <hi>Armies.</hi> Yea,
there is an illuſtrious inſtance of <hi>paſſive obedience</hi>
in the <hi>Thebaean Legion,</hi> whoſe tenth man being
executed for not offering Sacrifice to <hi>Idols,</hi> they
quietly ſubmitted to the cruelty. And a ſecond
<hi>Decimation</hi> being commanded by <hi>Maximiniam,</hi> the
Author of the <hi>firſt,</hi> one of their great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
(an excellent Chriſtian) perſwades them to
ſuffer it with the ſame patience: becauſe it was
not with their <hi>Swords</hi> they could make their way
to the Kingdom of Heaven, but by another kind
of <hi>Warfare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now if after all this, and infinitely more
that might be ſaid on this ſubject, for men to
pretend <hi>Religion,</hi> and plead <hi>Scripture</hi> for <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
                           <pb n="160" facs="tcp:53432:85"/>
is <hi>impudent</hi> and <hi>ſhameleſs,</hi> an affront to Religion,
and a <hi>Lie</hi> in the face of Conſcience. And thoſe
that cannot diſcern thoſe <hi>great lines</hi> of their <hi>Duty</hi>
which are ſet upon the High places, and ſhone
upon with a full beam, and yet can find <hi>ſin</hi> in
<hi>little harmleſs circumſtances,</hi> which nothing hath
forbidden, but the coyneſs and perverſeneſs of
their own fancies; are like him that could ſee
the <hi>Stars</hi> at noon, but could not ſee the <hi>Sun;</hi>
and could ſpy the <hi>ſhadows</hi> made by the <hi>Mountains</hi>
in the <hi>Moon,</hi> but could not diſcern the greater
<hi>ſpots</hi> upon its <hi>viſible ſurface.</hi> And for men to ſtrain
at the decency of an <hi>Habit,</hi> or the uſage of a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi>
when they can ſwallow <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi>
without chewing; is to be like him who
durſt not <hi>eat</hi> an <hi>Egg</hi> on <hi>Saturday,</hi> but made nothing
to <hi>kill</hi> a <hi>Man.</hi> Doubtleſs had the Scripture ſaid
by a thouſandth part ſo much for the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi>
of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as it hath for obedience to <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
had there been one plain word againſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
as there are many againſt <hi>Rebellion;</hi> that
would have been worn bare upon the tongue,
and the World would have rung with it.</p>
                        <p>But the Injunctions and Commands of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
are againſt our <hi>humours</hi> and <hi>opinions,</hi> againſt
the <hi>darlings</hi> of our <hi>fancies,</hi> and the <hi>intereſt</hi> of our
<hi>Party:</hi> and therefore here we muſt ſhuffle, and
evade, cogg, and interpret by <hi>Analogies</hi> of our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53432:85"/>
own making, by the <hi>Rules</hi> of our <hi>Sect,</hi> and the

and any thing that will <hi>colour</hi> Sin, and <hi>cozen</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that will turn Religion into the <hi>Current</hi>

of our <hi>humours,</hi> and our intereſts.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>divine Authority</hi> ſhall be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced,</hi>
and pleaded when they agree with mens
fancies, and ſend light or advantage to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites</hi>
of their <hi>affections:</hi> But when they <hi>croſs</hi> their
<hi>Models,</hi> oppoſe the <hi>people</hi> of their <hi>imaginations,</hi> and
call them to <hi>duties</hi> that are <hi>diſpleaſant;</hi> the <hi>caſe</hi> is
<hi>altered,</hi> the great <hi>motives</hi> of perſwaſion have loſt
their <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>influence,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with them.</p>
                        <p>Thus briefly of the two firſt Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
(1.) <hi>affronts the Authority of God,</hi> and (2.)
is <hi>oppoſite to the Spirit of Religion.</hi> From which I
come to the third, which makes <hi>reſiſtance</hi> both a
great <hi>ſin,</hi> and a great <hi>puniſhment, viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3.) It is <hi>ruinous</hi> to the INTEREST of SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETIES.
This I muſt more largely proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
becauſe it will lead us into the <hi>ſad</hi> occaſion
of our preſent meeting. <hi>Man</hi> is a Creature made
for <hi>Society;</hi> and what is againſt the <hi>intereſt</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,</hi>
is deſtructive to <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> And if
the greatneſs of a ſin, and a miſchief be to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53432:86"/>
by its reference to the <hi>Publick,</hi> for ought I
know, <hi>Rebellion</hi> will be the next <hi>ſin</hi> to that which
is <hi>unpardonable,</hi> in the degree of <hi>guilt,</hi> as well as it
is near it in the <hi>penalty</hi> threatned.</p>
                        <p>Now there are two great <hi>intereſts</hi> of <hi>Societies,
viz.</hi> GOVERNMENT and RELIGION,
to both which <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> is <hi>fatal</hi> both in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and practice of it.</p>
                        <p>To begin with <hi>Government</hi> in order.</p>
                        <p>(1.) <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> is <hi>deſtructive</hi> to <hi>Government:</hi>
For if <hi>Subjects</hi> may <hi>reſiſt</hi> the <hi>Powers</hi> over them, no
<hi>Government</hi> in the World can ſtand longer, than
till the next opportunity to overthrow it. Every
man will <hi>reſiſt what he doth not like,</hi> and endeavour
to pluck down what comports not with his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
Thus every <hi>fit</hi> of <hi>diſcontent</hi> will ſtir up the
various, and inconſtant People to ſeek an <hi>altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And there was never any <hi>Government</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
framed in the World, but in the menage,
and adminiſtration of it, many things would <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe.</hi>
Now the generality of men are led by
their <hi>preſent ſenſes;</hi> and if they feel themſelves
pained by any thing (though the Grief be but in
their <hi>Imagination</hi>) they are for <hi>preſent</hi> deliverance
from that Evil by <hi>any means;</hi> never conſidering
whether the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Cure</hi> draws not greater Evils
after it than the diſtemper: and ſo upon every <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content</hi>
the people are <hi>inflamed,</hi> and upon every <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53432:86"/>
rebel.</hi> And thus is a <hi>Kingdom</hi> laid open to
inevitable devaſtation and ruine: and by a <hi>dear</hi>
experience we have learnt, that 'tis better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any <hi>inconveniences</hi> in a <hi>ſetled</hi> Government, than
to endeavour <hi>violent alterations.</hi> When the Sword
is <hi>drawn,</hi> no man knows <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> it will be
<hi>ſheathed:</hi> When the <hi>Stone</hi> is out of a mans hand,
he cannot direct it as he pleaſeth. <hi>Men</hi> with
<hi>Swords</hi> by their <hi>ſides,</hi> will do what <hi>likes</hi> themſelves,
and not what is <hi>enjoyned</hi> by thoſe that imploy
them.</p>
                        <p>Or, could we ſuppoſe (what our own unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
experience hath confuted) that <hi>Armies</hi> would
be <hi>obedient;</hi> yet the <hi>Murders</hi> and <hi>Rapes,</hi> the <hi>Spoils</hi>
and <hi>devaſtations,</hi> which are the <hi>natural iſſues</hi> of a
<hi>Civil War,</hi> are worſe than any <hi>inconveniencies</hi> in any
<hi>Government</hi> poſſible: And though, as my Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi> notes, <hi>Foreign War</hi> is like the heat of <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi>
good and healthful for the Body; yet <hi>Civil</hi>
War is like the <hi>heat</hi> of a <hi>Fever,</hi> ruinous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, thoſe that <hi>reſiſt,</hi> either overcome the
<hi>ſupream</hi> Power, or are <hi>conquered</hi> by it. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
their <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in all likelihood conquer
them, as well as thoſe they ſerved them againſt:
and ſo from the <hi>juſt authority</hi> of their <hi>lawful Rulers,</hi>
they fall under the inſolence of their <hi>licentious
Vaſſals.</hi> Or ſuppoſe they get the <hi>Government</hi> to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53432:87"/>
themſelves, all the evils will follow, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
do upon <hi>Competitions</hi> and <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Claims,</hi>
which will breed <hi>everlaſting diſturbance,</hi> and <hi>eternal
fears.</hi> Such evils will follow if the <hi>reſiſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail:</hi>
and if they chance to be <hi>ſuppreſt</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
by the Powers they oppoſe, they can expect
nothing leſs than to be <hi>cruſht,</hi> and <hi>ruined.</hi> So that
thoſe that <hi>reſiſt,</hi> whether they <hi>conquer,</hi> or are <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi>
draw inevitable ruine upon themſelves,
and probably on the common Body. For <hi>Laws</hi>
and <hi>Government</hi> are the great <hi>Charter</hi> of our <hi>Lives</hi>
and <hi>Libenties,</hi> our <hi>Properties,</hi> and our <hi>All;</hi> and as
the Father, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>Murders,
rapes, violence,</hi> and all kind of miſchief invade
the World with Anarchy and Diſorder.</p>
                        <p>And how far all this hath been verified in
our Land: a little recollection will inform
us. For,</p>
                        <p>WHEN <hi>fair</hi> Weather and a <hi>warm</hi> Sun, the
<hi>indulgence</hi> of Heaven, and a long <hi>tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
had made us <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>frolick, rich and full,</hi> our
<hi>proſperity</hi> made us <hi>wanton,</hi> and our <hi>riches inſolent.</hi>
We began to <hi>murmur,</hi> we knew not <hi>why;</hi> and to
complain, becauſe we had <hi>nothing</hi> to <hi>complain of.</hi>
Diſcontents grew upon the ſtock of our ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the perverſeneſs of our humours; and
every little occaſion was Fuel to the Fire that was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53432:87"/>
kindling in the diſtempered Body. We began
to <hi>invade</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> with <hi>malicious whiſpers,</hi>
and <hi>private Preachments,</hi> with <hi>Libels</hi> and <hi>Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
with <hi>Inſolencies</hi> and <hi>Tumults:</hi> And when <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
had incouraged it ſelf by <hi>Noiſe</hi> and <hi>Numbers,</hi>
by <hi>Popular zeal</hi> and <hi>loud talk</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> it flew
into the higheſt <hi>irreverences</hi> towards the <hi>King,</hi>
and the moſt <hi>violent</hi> proceedings againſt his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
that the neareſt <hi>Trees</hi> being removed, they
might have a full <hi>ſtroke</hi> at the <hi>Cedar.</hi> Nor did things

                        <p>The <hi>Sparks</hi> grew into mighty <hi>Flames,</hi> and thoſe
<hi>Vapours</hi> into <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts:</hi> The <hi>whiſpers</hi>

The <hi>Cloud</hi> like an <hi>hand,</hi> became a <hi>Magazine</hi>

The <hi>Pulpit</hi> ſounded as much <hi>War</hi> as the <hi>Drum;</hi>

way to be <hi>unfortunate,</hi> and <hi>undone!</hi> Will the

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53432:89"/>
it ſelf for an <hi>argument</hi> to <hi>legitimate Rebellion!</hi> Shall

up their <hi>hands</hi> in an <hi>appeal</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and bring
them <hi>down</hi> to the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Juſt!</hi> Shall <hi>Villany</hi>
raiſe its head to the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and meet no <hi>Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts</hi>

upon him in <hi>ſtorms</hi> and <hi>flames!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> would complain on
this occaſion: But <hi>Providence</hi> is <hi>juſt,</hi> though we
are <hi>blind. Proſperous Villany</hi> crows and triumphs
for a moment, but is covered with <hi>ſhame,</hi> and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>darkneſs</hi> in the iſſue: The <hi>end</hi> of things will
diſentangle <hi>Providence,</hi> and rectifie all diſorders.
Then ſhall we ſee that <hi>afflicted Vertue</hi> ſhoots up
on the <hi>other ſide</hi> the <hi>Grave,</hi> and ſends its <hi>branches</hi>
into a <hi>flowring Paradiſe,</hi> where they ſhall be <hi>green</hi>
and <hi>verdant</hi> in an eternal <hi>Spring,</hi> while every <hi>Tree</hi>
that Vertue hath not <hi>planted</hi> ſhall be <hi>rooted</hi> up, and
<hi>wither</hi> in a moment.</p>
                        <p>This briefly I thought fit to ſuggeſt as an <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
for <hi>Providence;</hi> leſt the <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> and
<hi>misfortunes</hi> of the <hi>Juſt,</hi> in inſtances ſo <hi>great</hi> and ſo
<hi>near,</hi> might tempt any to think, that there is <hi>no
GOD that judgeth in the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="170" facs="tcp:53432:90"/>
And thus I am arrived at the <hi>firſt period</hi> of the
<hi>miſeries</hi> that we brought upon our ſelves by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,</hi>
which concludes in the <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>diſſolution</hi>
of <hi>Government,</hi> and this runs into all the miſchiefs
to which humane Nature is obnoxious. For <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
is the great <hi>intereſt</hi> of <hi>mankind;</hi> that
which bounds our <hi>paſſions,</hi> and ſecures our <hi>rights;</hi>
prevents <hi>confuſion,</hi> and that <hi>deluge of Debauches</hi> that
<hi>Anarchy</hi> lets in upon the World. And how far
we felt this alſo in the conſequent Calamities,
would be conſidered.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Nation</hi> then had loſt its <hi>Head,</hi> and its
<hi>Glory,</hi> 'twas turned with its <hi>Heels upwards,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by a <hi>Thing</hi> as <hi>infamous</hi> in its <hi>quality,</hi> as its
<hi>Name.</hi> The <hi>Dreggs</hi> of the <hi>Populace,</hi> the <hi>Creatures</hi>
of a <hi>Sectarian Army,</hi> the <hi>worſt</hi> part of a Body, that
was <hi>bad</hi> enough in its <hi>beſt;</hi> theſe were our <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
and our <hi>Patriots,</hi> the <hi>preſervers</hi> of our <hi>Peace,</hi>
and the <hi>Keepers</hi> of our <hi>Liberties:</hi> and keep them
they <hi>did,</hi> but not <hi>for</hi> us, but <hi>from</hi> us. And was
not this a <hi>Liberty</hi> worth the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and <hi>Treaſure</hi> that
was ſpent to purchaſe it?</p>
                        <p>O the <hi>bleſſed Reformation,</hi> that filled our <hi>Pulpits,</hi>
and <hi>emptied</hi> our <hi>Purſes;</hi> that <hi>quickned</hi> our <hi>endeavours,</hi>
and <hi>inſpired</hi> our <hi>zeal;</hi> and that was ſo <hi>glorious</hi> in
our <hi>mouths,</hi> and ſo <hi>pleaſant</hi> in our <hi>hopes!</hi> Were not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53432:90"/>
all <hi>miſcarriages</hi> of Government well <hi>mended,</hi> when
<hi>Government</hi> was thrown up by the <hi>roots?</hi> and was not
the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> well <hi>cured,</hi> when the <hi>Body</hi> was <hi>deſtroyed?</hi>
Were we not well freed from <hi>evil Counſellors,</hi> when
we made <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>worſt</hi> we had? And was not
<hi>Tyranny</hi> well <hi>extirpated,</hi> when we were under an
<hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Tyrants?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the <hi>glorious</hi> things are to <hi>come,</hi> and we muſt
be caſt into <hi>New Models:</hi> And when the <hi>Birds</hi> of
<hi>Prey</hi> have <hi>divided</hi> the <hi>Spoil,</hi> and ſatisfied the <hi>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi>
of their <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>ambition,</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> ſhall
be made <hi>happy</hi> with <hi>New-nothings,</hi> and <hi>golden Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi>
with <hi>Chimaera's</hi> of <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> and <hi>fine
names</hi> for <hi>Slavery.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Loyalty</hi> muſt
be ſcourged with the <hi>Scorpions</hi> that are <hi>due</hi> to <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:</hi>
And thoſe that feared the <hi>damnation</hi> of the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> ſhall be ſure to incur the <hi>damnation of the
Reformers;</hi> and they that would not hazard their
Souls, muſt <hi>compound</hi> for their Eſtates.</p>
                        <p>But when the JUNCTO had run to the
length of their <hi>Line;</hi> that is, as far as their
MASTER would permit them; when <hi>they</hi>
were as <hi>odious</hi> as they <hi>deſerved,</hi> and <hi>his deſigns</hi> as
<hi>ripe</hi> as he could <hi>wiſh;</hi> then up ſteps the ſingle
TYRANT, kicks <hi>them</hi> out of their <hi>Seats,</hi> and
<hi>BEELZEBUB</hi> diſpoſſeſſeth the LEGION.
He <hi>engroſſeth</hi> the <hi>prey</hi> to himſelf, and aſſumes the
<hi>ſole</hi> priviledge of compleating our miſeries. He
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53432:91"/>
made himſelf after the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
his <hi>Sword</hi> with the <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>Law:</hi> He ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
us with the <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> we <hi>deſerved;</hi> and made
us feel a difference between the <hi>ſilken Reins</hi> of a
<hi>lawful Authority,</hi> and the <hi>heavy yoke</hi> of an <hi>inſolent
Uſurpation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when <hi>Providence</hi> had freed us from this
<hi>Plague,</hi> and called him to <hi>account</hi> for his <hi>Villanies,</hi>
we fell back into our old <hi>diſorders;</hi> we <hi>reeled to</hi>
and <hi>fro,</hi> and ſtaggered like a <hi>Drunken man,</hi> and were
at our <hi>wits end.</hi> We knew not <hi>this</hi> week, who
would be our <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>next;</hi> nor did our <hi>Lords</hi>
themſelves know to day, by what <hi>Laws</hi> they
would Rule to <hi>morrow. Confuſion</hi> was in their
<hi>Councils,</hi> as well as <hi>Tyranny</hi> in their Actions; and
there was but <hi>one thing</hi> they ſeemed to be <hi>agreed</hi>
upon, which was to <hi>inſlave</hi> the <hi>Nation.</hi> And if
we would not believe that this was <hi>Liberty,</hi> we
muſt be <hi>knockt</hi> on the head with our <hi>chains;</hi> if the
<hi>Sheep</hi> would not take the <hi>Wolves</hi> for their <hi>Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
'twas fault enough, and good reaſon why
they ſhould be <hi>devoured.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And were not things come at length to a good
paſs, when men in <hi>Buff</hi> durſt proclaim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the only <hi>Legal Authority</hi> of the Nation?
when our Armed Maſters murdered men in the
Streets, and threatned the <hi>ancient Metropolis</hi> of the
Nation, with <hi>Gunpowder</hi> and <hi>Granadoes? Fire</hi> and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53432:91"/>
                           <hi>Sword</hi> muſt be our portion, if we would not be
in love with <hi>infamous Uſurpers;</hi> and a worſe <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot</hi>
than <hi>Faux</hi>'s was acting in the <hi>face</hi> of the
<hi>Sun:</hi> The <hi>ſtrength,</hi> the <hi>riches,</hi> the <hi>beauty,</hi> yea, the
almoſt <hi>All</hi> of the Nation was deſigned a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
to the <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> of our <hi>Oppreſſors;</hi> and
<hi>Plunder</hi> and <hi>Maſſacres</hi> were almoſt the <hi>leaſt evils</hi> we

                        </p>
                        <p>Thus were we <hi>toſt</hi> up and down from one <hi>wave</hi>
to another, and made the ſport of the <hi>proud</hi> and
<hi>inſulting billows,</hi> till Almighty Goodneſs ſetled us
again upon our <hi>old baſis,</hi> and by a <hi>Miracle</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
reſtored us our PRINCE and our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
which our ſins had deprived us of, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh</hi>
us upon the <hi>ſure Foundations</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>
and <hi>Peace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe are ſome <hi>ſprinklings</hi> of that <hi>deluge</hi> of <hi>Woe</hi>
that we brought upon our ſelves by <hi>reſiſtance,</hi>
which I have briefly deſcribed to this purpoſe, that
the remembrance of theſe miſeries may beget a
ſenſe of our <hi>ſins,</hi> and the truth of the <hi>particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>
I have been diſcourſing under this Head,
<hi>viz. That Reſiſtance is fatal to Government.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And though <hi>Government</hi> may be fixt again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its <hi>Foundations,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> turned into their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Channel,</hi> after the <hi>violence</hi> they have ſuffered;
yet they loſe much of their <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi>
by ſuch <hi>diſſettlements:</hi> And the People that have
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53432:92"/>
                           <hi>rebelled once,</hi> and <hi>ſucceſsfully,</hi> will be ready to do ſo
<hi>often.</hi> As <hi>water</hi> that hath been <hi>boyled,</hi> will boyl
again the ſooner.</p>
                        <p>And thus we ſee how ruinous <hi>reſiſtance</hi> is to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and how deſtructive to that <hi>firſt</hi> great
Intereſt of Societies, as it is alſo,</p>
                        <p>(2.) TO RELIGION, which is the other.
That <hi>Rebellion</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> we have ſeen; and conſequently, that
'tis <hi>deſtructive</hi> of its <hi>Being,</hi> will not need much
proof; ſince contraries deſtroy one another. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
lays the <hi>Reins</hi> on mens necks, and takes off
the <hi>reſtraints</hi> of their <hi>appetites;</hi> it opens the <hi>flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi>
of <hi>Impiety,</hi> and lets looſe the <hi>brats</hi> of <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Imagination:</hi> It deſtroys the <hi>reverence</hi> of all things
<hi>ſacred,</hi> and drives <hi>Vertue</hi> to Corners: It gathers
mens <hi>luſts</hi> into a <hi>common ſtorm,</hi> and fills all things
with <hi>Chaos</hi> and <hi>confuſion. Religion</hi> cannot be <hi>heard</hi>
in the <hi>noiſe</hi> of a <hi>battel,</hi> but is trampled under-foot
in the <hi>hurry</hi> and <hi>tumult. Faith</hi> and <hi>love, humility</hi> and
<hi>meekneſs, purity</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> are overcaſt and ſilenced
by <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Cruelty, pride</hi> and <hi>barbariſm, luſt</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi>
Thus <hi>Rebellion</hi> by breaking up the <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the <hi>Earth,</hi> lets in an <hi>Hell</hi> upon us, and brings
a kind of preſent <hi>damnation</hi> upon the World. And
that this is another fatal miſchief of <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> we
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53432:92"/>
have felt alſo by an <hi>experience</hi> that will keep it in
our memories. And what execution it hath done
upon <hi>Religion</hi> muſt be conſidered next.</p>
                        <p>But this is a <hi>tender thing,</hi> and I am willing to
keep my ſelf within bounds that are <hi>charitable,</hi>
and <hi>ſober;</hi> and therefore muſt <hi>premiſe</hi> to what I
have to ſay about it; that I charge not the whole
<hi>Body</hi> of the People of the late Times, with the
guilt of all the <hi>Follies</hi> and corruptions I deſcribe.
Nor do I <hi>believe,</hi> or <hi>ſay,</hi> that the whole <hi>Maſs</hi> of
their <hi>Religion</hi> was ſo <hi>monſtrouſly vitiated,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</hi>
I profeſs <hi>Univerſal Charity,</hi> and have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
more for the worſt of them, than they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
will own for any that are not of their own
<hi>party,</hi> or <hi>opinion.</hi> And therefore at preſent I ſhall
ſay no more, than what the ſober and intelligent
among themſelves will acknowledge to be juſtly
chargeable upon ſome or other of the <hi>Sects</hi> bred
by our <hi>late Diſorders;</hi> and this will be enough for
my purpoſe, which is only to prove by near and
<hi>deplorable inſtances,</hi> that <hi>reſiſtance</hi> brings <hi>miſchiefs</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Religion;</hi> and not to expoſe to <hi>hatred,</hi> or <hi>contempt</hi>
the perſons of any that are <hi>ſerious</hi> in the way of
their <hi>profeſſion,</hi> though I judge it never ſo <hi>obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and <hi>miſtaken:</hi> And having ſaid this out of a
<hi>tender charity,</hi> that none may be wronged by <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation,</hi>
nor any <hi>offended</hi> that are not <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
I come with freedom to deſcribe ſome of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53432:93"/>
                           <hi>injuries</hi> our <hi>unhappy reſiſtance</hi> hath done <hi>Religion,</hi> not
withſtanding that both <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Tongues</hi> ſo high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
pretended its defence.</p>
                        <p>And indeed men <hi>fought</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> till they had
<hi>deſtroyed</hi> it; and <hi>diſputed</hi> about it, till they had <hi>loſt</hi> it.
<hi>Midtiplicity</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> had quite confounded the
<hi>ſimplicity</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> and 'twas moſt peoples
buſineſs to <hi>chatter</hi> like <hi>Pyes,</hi> rather than to <hi>live</hi> like
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or like <hi>Men.</hi> If Religion had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by mens <hi>talk,</hi> and <hi>diſpute</hi> about it, thoſe
later days of the declining World had been its
beſt; and <hi>this</hi> in its <hi>growth</hi> and ways of higheſt <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,</hi>
when all things elſe were verging to
their <hi>Set,</hi> and <hi>Period.</hi> But alas, the Tongue was
the <hi>moſt,</hi> if not the <hi>only religious Member.</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Pretenders,</hi> like the <hi>Aegyptian Temples,</hi>
were <hi>fair without,</hi> but <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Serpents,</hi> and <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles
within.</hi> Or like the <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> they had
<hi>Wings</hi> to <hi>flye</hi> in the <hi>Clouds</hi> of <hi>Imagination,</hi> but no <hi>Feet</hi>
to walk on the <hi>Ground</hi> of a <hi>vertuous practice.</hi> Yea,
ſome had found the way to <hi>ſwim</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> in the
<hi>Current</hi> of their <hi>appetites,</hi> and to reconcile <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Rapine, Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> with the
<hi>glorious</hi> names of the <hi>Elect,</hi> the <hi>People of God,</hi> the
<hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>good Party: Religion</hi> with
<hi>Rebellion;</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi> with <hi>Saintſhip.</hi> Men had
<hi>learnt</hi> to be <hi>godly,</hi> without <hi>goodneſs;</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
without <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:53432:93"/>
They were <hi>lovers</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and yet <hi>haters</hi> of their
<hi>Brother: haters</hi> of <hi>open Prophaneneſs,</hi> but not of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
wickedneſs: Very <hi>godly,</hi> though <hi>cruel,</hi> and
<hi>unjuſt:</hi> True <hi>penitents,</hi> though they returned to
their ſins, as ſoon as they had <hi>complain'd,</hi> and <hi>wept:</hi>
Their <hi>hearts</hi> were <hi>good,</hi> though their <hi>actions</hi> were
<hi>diſhoneſt;</hi> and they had the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> in
them, though that <hi>root</hi> were a <hi>dry ſtump,</hi> and had
no <hi>branches:</hi> They were <hi>regenerated,</hi> but not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
converted,</hi> but not a <hi>jot</hi> the <hi>better: Devout
Worſhippers,</hi> but <hi>bad Neighbours: Lovers of God,</hi> but
<hi>no haters of Covetouſneſs:</hi> Had <hi>power</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but
<hi>none</hi> over <hi>themſelves:</hi> They were <hi>Gods Servants,</hi>
though they obeyed their <hi>appetites;</hi> and <hi>his children,</hi>
though no <hi>better</hi> than thoſe, that are of their <hi>Father</hi>
the <hi>Devil.</hi> Thus had men got the knack to be
<hi>religious</hi> without <hi>religion,</hi> and were in the way to
be <hi>ſaved,</hi> without <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe were groſs diſorders whereby Religion
was taken from its foundation of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Holy
living,</hi> and placed in <hi>emotions, raptures,</hi> and <hi>ſwelling
words</hi> of <hi>vanity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And when <hi>theſe</hi> had <hi>kindled</hi> the <hi>imagination,</hi> and

they <hi>dream'd</hi> of <hi>ſtrange ſights, voices,</hi> and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>diſcoveries,</hi> which were nothing but the <hi>unquiet
agitations</hi> of their own <hi>diſordered</hi> brains: <hi>Theſe</hi> alſo
were taken for <hi>divine Revelations,</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi>
of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, ſhewing it ſelf <hi>miraculouſly</hi> in
them.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, and in ſum; Every <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
unaccountable motion,</hi> was by ſome repreſented
as the work of that Spirit, to which they are moſt
oppoſite: Thus when <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>brisk ſanguine</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
a <hi>cheerful Scene,</hi> and filled the <hi>imagination</hi>
                           <pb n="179" facs="tcp:53432:94"/>
with <hi>pleaſant</hi> Dreams; <hi>theſe</hi> were <hi>divine</hi> Illapſes, the
Joys and Incomes of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> When <hi>heated
Melancholy</hi> had kindled the <hi>buſie</hi> and <hi>active phanſie,</hi>
the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> talks of <hi>Illuminations, New Lights,
Revelations,</hi> and many <hi>wonderful fine things,</hi> which
were aſcribed to the ſame <hi>Spirit:</hi> and when <hi>Phlegm</hi>
prevailed, and had quencht the <hi>phantaſtick Fire,</hi>
rendring the <hi>Mad man</hi> more <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>unactive;</hi> then
the <hi>Spirit</hi> was <hi>withdrawn,</hi> and the man under <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>deſertion:</hi> And when again <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
was <hi>boyled</hi> up into <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> againſt every
thing that was not of the <hi>Fanatique genius;</hi> this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
was preſumed to be an <hi>Holy Fervour</hi> kindled by
that <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe <hi>real Fruits</hi> are <hi>gentleneſs,</hi> and
<hi>love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now, after that which I have ſaid on this
occaſion, it may perhaps be neceſſary to add, that
I hope none here will be ſo <hi>uncharitable,</hi> or ſo <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi>
as to think that I go about to diſparage the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and its <hi>influence;</hi> which (as I ought)
I <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>reverence:</hi> and becauſe I do <hi>ſo,</hi> I think
it fit to repreſent, and ſhame the <hi>blaſphemous abuſes</hi>
of it, which would expoſe the moſt Divine things
to <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and make them <hi>ridiculous.</hi> And that the
Holy Spirit hath been thus <hi>traduced</hi> and injured,
and is ſtill by great numbers among us, 'twould
be ſhameful not to acknowledge: And I add, that
my <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> for the <hi>realities,</hi> make me
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53432:95"/>
thus juſtly <hi>ſharp</hi> againſt the <hi>Counterfeits.</hi> Nor do
I think that <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>phantaſtry</hi> is to be ſpared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they wear the <hi>ſtollen Livery</hi> of things <hi>venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and <hi>ſacred.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, to go on; ſuch a <hi>Religion</hi> had the
<hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>it</hi> bred among us: A <hi>Religion</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and begot by <hi>Pride,</hi> and
<hi>Self-Love,</hi> which gilded the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of it with
all the <hi>glorious names,</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi>
And when they had encircled their Heads with
their own phantaſtick rays, and ſwoln their <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi>
into a <hi>Tympany</hi> of <hi>ridiculous greatneſs,</hi> they
<hi>ſcornfully</hi> contemned all but their <hi>Darling</hi>-ſelves,
under the notion of the <hi>Formal,</hi> the <hi>Moral,</hi> and the
<hi>Wicked:</hi> and <hi>proudly</hi> pitied the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>carnal</hi> World,
that is, all that were not of <hi>their conceited</hi> pitch,
and elevation. And having thus <hi>dignified</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and <hi>debaſed</hi> others: they herded together,
drew the <hi>Church</hi> into their <hi>little Corners,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the <hi>communion</hi> of others, who had leſs
<hi>conceit,</hi> though more <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> They bid us <hi>ſtand
off,</hi> leſt we ſhould have polluted them by our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed</hi>
approaches; and having made us as the
<hi>Heathen</hi> and the <hi>Publican,</hi> they cried, <hi>Come out from
among them.</hi> The <hi>true Church, ſoundneſs</hi> of <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
purity</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and of <hi>Worſhip</hi> (if men
would believe them) was confined to their <hi>clans,</hi>
juſt as they wee to the Corners of <hi>Africa</hi> of old,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53432:95"/>
when their Friends the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were <hi>there.</hi> Thus
did the Votaries of each Sect ſwell in their <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
till ſome other ſort as well <hi>conceited</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
endeavoured to take their <hi>Plumes</hi> from
them, and to appropriate thoſe glorious <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
to their own party.</p>
                        <p>And this went for the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and the
<hi>ſpirituality</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> under pretence of which, all
<hi>reverence</hi> to things <hi>ſacred</hi> was <hi>deſtroyed.</hi> For when
this <hi>Spirit</hi> had got into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and ſet up the
Cry of the <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Spirituality</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
left <hi>canting</hi> on the Subject, till mens Tongues
and Minds were fired againſt every matter of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
and <hi>order,</hi> as <hi>formal,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian:</hi> And ſo
far had it prevailed, as to drive thoſe of <hi>warm</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and <hi>weak</hi> heads, from all <hi>external Reverence</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> things: And the well meaning
people being frighted with the <hi>terrible</hi> noiſe of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> (words they
had learnt to <hi>hate,</hi> though not to <hi>underſtand</hi>) bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
and flew off from every thing their <hi>furious</hi>
Guides had marked with theſe <hi>abhorred Characters,</hi>
though it were never ſo <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>becoming.</hi> And
thus a <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>ſlovenly</hi> Religion had made its way
into the World, and ſuch a <hi>ſordid</hi> careleſsneſs in
matters of <hi>divine</hi> Worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhould a Stranger
have come into the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> that were acted by
this Spirit, he would not have imagined what they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53432:96"/>
had been doing: and that they were about <hi>Holy
Offices,</hi> would perhaps have been one of the laſt
things in his Conjecture. Thus <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>ſawcy</hi> talk
had crept into mens Prayers, under pretence of
<hi>Holy Familiarity</hi> with <hi>God;</hi> nauſeous impertinent
Gibberiſh, under the notion of <hi>Praying</hi> by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
and all kind of <hi>irreverences</hi> in <hi>external</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
under the ſhelter of a pretended <hi>ſpiritual</hi>
Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>Men had <hi>ſubtilized</hi> Religion, till they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<hi>it,</hi> made it firſt <hi>inviſible,</hi> and then <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND now it being thus <hi>multiplied, corrupted,</hi>
and <hi>debaucht;</hi> being made the <hi>Game</hi> of the <hi>Tongue,</hi>
and the <hi>Frolick</hi> of <hi>Imagination; phantaſtick</hi> in its <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
ſordid</hi> in its <hi>practices; ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a vertuous life,</hi> and made to ſerve the <hi>ends</hi>
of <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Avarice;</hi> what was like to follow, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>nature</hi> and order of things, but <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi>
and <hi>contempt</hi> of all Religion? And when one
ſays, <hi>here's Religion,</hi> and another ſays, <hi>there's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
a third will ſcornfully ask, <hi>where's Religion,</hi>
and <hi>what's Religion?</hi> When the <hi>Heathen Deities</hi> were
ſo multiplied, that <hi>every</hi> thing was made a <hi>God;
Protagoras, Diagoras,</hi> and others, firſt began to <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi>
and next to <hi>affirm</hi> that there was NONE.
<hi>Religions</hi> have been multiplied in <hi>our days,</hi> as much
as <hi>Gods</hi> in <hi>theirs;</hi> and we have ſeen much of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53432:96"/>
ſame fatal event, and iſſue. <hi>They</hi> made their <hi>Gods
contemptible</hi> and <hi>vile,</hi> by deifying things that were
<hi>ſo,</hi> and we had no leſs detracted from the credit
of Religion, by bringing it down to things of the
loweſt and vileſt rank and nature: Our <hi>Idolized
Opinions</hi> were no better than their <hi>Garlick</hi> and <hi>Ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
The <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of the <hi>Mind, Phrenſie</hi> and <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm,</hi>
which our days have <hi>worſhipped,</hi> were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> which <hi>they adored:</hi> And
<hi>they</hi> never raiſed Altars to worſe <hi>Vices</hi> than RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELLION,
FRAUD, and VIOLENCE,
which our Age hath <hi>hallowed</hi> and made <hi>ſacred.</hi> So
that notwithſtanding all the <hi>glorious</hi> pretenſions
of thoſe Times, Religion was, among many, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off all its <hi>Foundations,</hi> and the World prepared
for <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> The <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> of <hi>one Age,</hi>
make way for <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in the <hi>next.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus alſo briefly of the Condition of our
RELIGION.</p>
                        <p>AND thus I have ſhewn how much RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SISTANCE
of the <hi>Authority</hi> that is over
us, is againſt our DUTY and our INTEREST.
The <hi>former</hi> God hath plainly told us; and the <hi>latter</hi>
we have ſadly <hi>felt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It remains that we humble our ſelves under the
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>publick guilt,</hi> as well as <hi>complain</hi> of the
<hi>conſequent miſeries.</hi> That we may not draw down
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53432:97"/>
                           <hi>new judgements,</hi> by repeating <hi>old provocations;</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our <hi>particular ſins</hi> to the <hi>common ſcore.</hi> And I
think we ſhall do well to conſider, what <hi>we,</hi> who
abhor <hi>Rebellion,</hi> have contributed to the fatal evils
that followed it. We can perhaps be well enough
content that the <hi>viſible actors</hi> of thoſe miſchiefs
ſhould be <hi>laſht,</hi> and <hi>expoſed;</hi> and it may be, are
well pleaſed and tickled with our reprehenſions in
which we think our ſelves not concerned. But if
we will be <hi>juſt,</hi> if we will have this <hi>Faſt</hi> to ſignifie,
we muſt turn our reproofs upon our ſelves alſo,
and with grief and ſhame acknowledge that our
ſins and Debauches, our contempt of <hi>God</hi> and
ſcorn of <hi>Religion,</hi> have helpt towards the plucking
down that ſad judgement upon the Nation, which
we lament this Day: And it muſt be confeſt, that
there were thoſe that fought <hi>againſt</hi> the KING,
who yet ſpent their <hi>blood</hi> in his <hi>ſervice:</hi> and many
by their <hi>vices,</hi> endeavoured to engage Heaven
againſt that <hi>Cauſe,</hi> which themſelves ſtrove in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, to leſs purpoſe, to promote. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought not to think, that this <hi>Faſt</hi> is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>inveigh</hi> againſt the <hi>faults</hi> of others, and to make
<hi>them</hi> and their <hi>actions odious;</hi> but to humble our
ſelves under the apprehenſion of our own, and to
teach us to ſhew our love to the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>readineſs</hi>
to <hi>obey</hi> him, by <hi>ſubjecting</hi> our ſelves firſt unto <hi>God,</hi>
whoſe <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> HE is. And we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53432:97"/>
that they that are not <hi>Loyal</hi> to the UNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAL
LORD of all the World, can ſcarce poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſo to their <hi>particular</hi> SOVEREIGN. And
'twill need a great deal of Charity to help us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that thoſe who make no ſcruple to <hi>blaſpheme</hi>
the <hi>Name</hi> of God, and to break the plaineſt, moſt
earneſt, and moſt expreſs of his <hi>Laws,</hi> will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by conſiderations of <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> from
<hi>rebelling</hi> againſt their <hi>King,</hi> or affronting His, when
there is any powerful intereſt to oblige them to it.
If therefore we would give any evidence of a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>humiliation</hi> at preſent, or any ſecurity of a future
<hi>loyalty,</hi> let us do ſo by confeſſing our particular ſins,
and forſaking them; and then there will be hope
that the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may oblige us quietly and
peaceably to ſubmit to his MINISTER; and in
doing ſo we ſhall be bleſt with his <hi>influence,</hi> and
deſerve his <hi>protection.</hi> And thus demeaning our
ſelves like <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and
<hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> He left
with his Diſciples will be with us here, and <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Peace</hi> will encircle our heads with <hi>rays</hi> of
glory in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Peace</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> which paſſeth all underſtanding, keep your
hearts and minds in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> To whom with
<hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be aſcribed
all Glory, Honour, and adoration henceforth and
for ever. <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53432:100"/>
ſhall not undertake to determine ought in this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory;
Be the matter how it will as to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>natural</hi>
world, we have cauſe to believe, that there are
<hi>degeneracies</hi> in the <hi>moral: This</hi> our Saviour ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in the Queſtion, <hi>Luke 18. 8. When the Son
of man cometh, ſhall he find faith on earth?</hi> Implying,
that in the <hi>laſt Times,</hi> there ſhall be remarkable
fallings from the Faith, and a general Reign of
unbelief; which cannot be without great defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in manners alſo. And St. <hi>Paul, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim.</hi> 3. 1.
tells us, That the <hi>laſt days</hi> ſhould be <hi>perillous,</hi> that
men ſhould be <hi>Lovers of their own ſelves, Covetous,
Boaſters, Proud, Blaſphemers;</hi> and our Apoſtle in
the Text,
<q>—Scoffers, walking after their own luſts.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now we are not to think, that the holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſuppos'd, that <hi>theſe</hi> evils were not in <hi>other</hi>
days, as well as in the <hi>laſt:</hi> No, the ſame cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Vices runs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through all Ages, which
more, or leſs, are infected with them: But the
meaning, I conceive, is, That in the <hi>latter,</hi> they
ſhould be more <hi>notorious,</hi> and more <hi>numerous,</hi>
acted in higher degrees of impudence, and with
more circumſtances of guilt. There is no doubt
but there were always <hi>ſcoffers;</hi> but never <hi>ſuch,</hi> nor
ſo <hi>many,</hi> as in the <hi>laſt</hi> days; (The <hi>laſt</hi> of the world
<hi>ſimply,</hi> and not only thoſe of the Jewiſh State)
<hi>ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts</hi>— viz. as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

the word <hi>Luſts,</hi> takes in all unruly deſires, and

                        <p>In treating of the words I ſhall ſhew,</p>
                        <p>1. What <hi>ſort</hi> of <hi>Scoffers</hi> we may ſuppoſe here
meant?</p>
                        <p>2. What is the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>malignity</hi> of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour?</p>
                        <p>3. What are the <hi>conſequences,</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of it?
And thence</p>

                        <p>FOr the <hi>Firſt, <hi>Who are the ſcoffers meant?</hi>
                           </hi> I take
direction in it, from the <hi>character</hi> annext,
<hi>Scoffers, walking after their own luſts.</hi> Now the
luſts of men would be boundleſs, and are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of any check, or ſtop: They hate all <hi>reſtraints</hi>
that are laid upon them; and the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints

we may ſuppoſe the <hi>ſcoffers</hi> in the Text, <hi>who walk
after their own luſts,</hi> to be ſcoffers at <hi>Religion,</hi> which
would hinder and diſturb them moſt in that
courſe. And that they were <hi>ſuch,</hi> appears from
the following verſe; in which they argue <hi>ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly,</hi>
againſt the Chriſtian belief, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Saying, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53432:101"/>
for ſince the Fathers fell a-ſleep, all things continue as they
were from the beginning</hi>—verſ. 4.</p>
                        <p>Now generally the <hi>leſs impudent</hi> ſort of ſinners
endeavour to <hi>reconcile</hi> Religion to their Luſts, by
walking in ſome of the <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>godlineſs;</hi> ſo did
the <hi>Phariſees</hi> among the Jews, and divers <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
among the ancient Chriſtians; and their
modern ſucceſſors do the ſame ſtill: But there
are an <hi>other ſort,</hi> who are more bold, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
they will not give themſelves the trouble
of <hi>reconciling</hi> Religion to their Luſts, but take the
ſhorter courſe of <hi>oppoſing</hi> it, in favour of them.
<hi>This</hi> ſome do by ingaging their parts, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
gravely, and ſeriouſly to <hi>reaſon</hi> it out of
the world; but theſe are the <hi>few: Reaſon</hi> is a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere</hi>
thing, and doth as little comport with mens
Luſts, as Religion: And the ſame Luſts that
make them willing to reaſon againſt Religion,
make them incapable of it: For <hi>debauchery</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as great an enemy to mens <hi>intellectuals,</hi> as to
their <hi>morals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore <hi>others,</hi> and the moſt, go an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
way, and fight againſt Religion by <hi>ſcoffing</hi>
and <hi>buffoonry:</hi> This is the game the Devil ſeems
to be playing in the preſent Age. He hath tryed
the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>rage</hi> of the <hi>mighty;</hi> and the <hi>wit,</hi> and
<hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>learned;</hi> but <hi>theſe</hi> have not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the deſtruction of Religion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53432:101"/>
                           <hi>now</hi> he is making an experiment by an <hi>other</hi>
ſort of enemies, and ſets the <hi>Apes,</hi> and <hi>Drollers</hi>
upon it. And certainly there was never any <hi>other</hi>
Age, in which ſacred and ſerious things have
been ſo rudely, and impudently aſſaulted by the
prophane abuſes of Jeſters, and Buffoons, who
have been the <hi>contempt</hi> of all <hi>wiſe</hi> Times, but are
the <hi>darlings,</hi> and <hi>wits</hi> of <hi>theſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>O the Invention! the rare invention of this
happy Age! How eaſie hath it made the way to
this glorious reputation? 'Tis but laughing grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at the <hi>Fopps;</hi> the <hi>grave,</hi> the <hi>learned,</hi> the <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>
Fopps; and a man cannot fail of being a
<hi>Wit,</hi> in ſpight of ignorance, and impertinence.
Away with the pedantry, and dull formalities of
former days! we are <hi>Wits</hi> upon terms more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
and more eaſie. Our Age hath more
<hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>flame:</hi> our <hi>converſation;</hi> yes! our <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
converſation hath <hi>refined</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> us; We
ſee the folly and ignorance of our fore-fathers;
and laugh at the Tales with which crafty Prieſts
abuſed their eaſineſs, and credulity. <hi>Spiritual
ſubſtance! Immortal ſouls! Authority of Scripture!</hi>
                           <hi>Fictions, Ideas, Phantomes, Iargon:</hi>
Here is <hi>demonſtration</hi> againſt the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Trade, and
<hi>ſpiritual</hi> men. The reſt of the work is for Songs
and Plays; for the wit and humour of agreeable
converſation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="194" facs="tcp:53432:102"/>
Thus far we are come, and the infection
ſpreads; ſo that there is ſcarce a little <hi>vain Thing</hi>
that hath a mind to be <hi>modiſh,</hi> but ſets up for a
derider of God, and of Religion; and makes a
ſcoff of the moſt ſerious thoughts, and profeſſion
of the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> men of all Ages. <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi>
are become words of ſport: and <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
Fairyes</hi> and <hi>Chimaera's:</hi> 'Tis <hi>Foppiſh</hi> to <hi>ſpeak</hi> of
<hi>Religion,</hi> but in <hi>Railery;</hi> or to mention ſuch a
thing as <hi>Scripture;</hi> except it be to <hi>burleſque</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride</hi>
it.</p>
                        <p>'Tis <hi>dreadful</hi> to conſider, and a man may
tremble to deſcribe this <hi>monſtrous</hi> humour of many
in our Age, which I believe hath out-done <hi>all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
in the heights of this <hi>amazing</hi> ſort of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſadly proves that in the <hi>laſt</hi> days ſhall
come <hi>Scoffers,</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> as have not been from
the beginning: For though former Ages, no
doubt, have had deriders of Religion, yet in <hi>thoſe</hi>
times they <hi>hid</hi> their heads, and did it covertly
behind the curtain; in their <hi>privacies,</hi> and among
their <hi>Confidents;</hi> But in <hi>theſe,</hi> they face the Sun,
and impudently vent their folly in all companies,
and places, as if it were a matter of renown and
glory, and they expected to be counted <hi>Hero</hi>'s
for it.</p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee what <hi>ſort</hi> of Scoffers they are that
are to <hi>come</hi> in the <hi>laſt days, impudent deriders of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
                           <pb n="195" facs="tcp:53432:102"/>
becauſe they are reſolved on <hi>walking after their
own Luſts.</hi> I come,</p>
                        <p>II. To ſhew the <hi>malignity,</hi> and <hi>aggravations</hi> of
this humour.</p>
                        <p>1. 'Tis an <hi>open defiance of God,</hi> and a <hi>direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of his Glory.</hi> His glory, namely the <hi>derivative,</hi>
conſiſts in thoſe praiſes, and acknowledgements
that are due to his perfections; and thoſe are paid
in the exerciſes of Religion; ſo that to buffoon
<hi>this,</hi> is to ſhoot the arrows of our ſcorn directly
at the Throne of God. Indeed <hi>all</hi> ſins are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of him, and of his Glory, but in <hi>moſt,</hi>
they are <hi>ſo</hi> in the <hi>conſequence</hi> of the <hi>ſin,</hi> not in the
<hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>ſinner:</hi> The Drunkard, the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor,
and the unclean perſon, deſign only their
<hi>own ſatisfactions,</hi> not any <hi>immediate</hi> affront to their
Maker: But the <hi>Scoffer</hi> with prodigious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
doth <hi>that.</hi> He derides the love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
fear and reverence of the moſt High; which
is a direct contempt of his perfections.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>ſcorn</hi> is one of the <hi>greateſt</hi> indignities;
eſpecially, it is <hi>ſore</hi> and <hi>provoking,</hi> when one is
contemn'd by his <hi>inferiours;</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> when they
are his <hi>dependants,</hi> that have their bread from his
Bounty? <hi>ſuch</hi> is the caſe <hi>here,</hi> in all poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of aggravation; vileſt <hi>worms</hi> and loweſt
<hi>duſt, ſcoff</hi> at the higheſt <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and fulleſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53432:103"/>
The <hi>univerſal King</hi> our Soveraign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom Angels <hi>bow,</hi> and Devils <hi>tremble,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
by the <hi>ſlaves</hi> of his Kingdom and Creation:
The general <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Benefactor</hi> flouted by thoſe
that have their Being, and all their comforts from
his goodneſs, and cannot <hi>live,</hi> or <hi>move,</hi> or <hi>breathe</hi>
without him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. Inſtead of loweſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
gratitude, and proſtrations, they lift
up their heads in proud ſcorn and defiance of
him; and as the Royal Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of them,
<hi>Pſal. 73. 18. They ſet their mouth againſt the
Heavens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>This is a ſin that is a ſtep beyond Atheiſm it ſelf.</hi>
'Tis greater impiety to ſay, God is a <hi>careleſs,</hi> or a
<hi>contemptible</hi> Being, than to ſay, <hi>He is not.</hi> As the
Moraliſt tells us, He would rather it ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
that there was <hi>no ſuch man</hi> as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> than
that it ſhould be believ'd that there <hi>was</hi> ſuch
a man, but that he was a <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>worthleſs</hi>
perſon.</p>
                        <p>Now to <hi>deride Religion</hi> while we allow there is
a God, is to ſay by immediate conſequence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he is a <hi>careleſs</hi> and <hi>idle Greatneſs</hi> that <hi>heeds</hi>
not his Creatures; and ſo <hi>worſhip</hi> is an <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence:</hi>
or that he is ſo <hi>bad,</hi> or ſo <hi>mean</hi> a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he <hi>deſerves</hi> not to be worſhipp'd,
that is, that we owe him no acknowledgement
of his Being, or his Bounty; and which is more,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53432:103"/>
that 'tis <hi>ridiculous</hi> to pay him any. To deny the
exiſtence of God is groſs and unreaſonable; but
to acknowledge <hi>that,</hi> and to ſcoff at the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of love and veneration of him, is <hi>down-right</hi>
madneſs. So that if the <hi>ſcoffer</hi> be <hi>not</hi> an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi>
he is the more <hi>inexcuſable</hi> in his ſcoffing; and if
poſſible, he is <hi>worſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The humour of deriding Religion is <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſneſs
in the ſoul: All ſin</hi> is <hi>deformity,</hi> but <hi>this</hi> is
<hi>Horrid.</hi> For a man to have his parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
miſplaced; His legs, ſuppoſe, on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
his eyes in his neck, and his arms growing
out of his belly, is <hi>frightful;</hi> but there's a <hi>miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>
in the <hi>ſoul</hi> that is <hi>more ugly.</hi> Man hath ſuch
powers given him as <hi>ſcorn</hi> and <hi>deriſion,</hi> and while
they are exerciſed againſt <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> there is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amiſs</hi> in them: But when they are <hi>miſplaced</hi>
upon <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> upon the greateſt and the
pureſt, upon the moſt viſible, and moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
acknowledg'd perfections; they are <hi>then</hi> an
<hi>exceſs</hi> of <hi>deformity</hi> in the ſoul, and ſuch ſcorners are
greater <hi>monſters</hi> than the <hi>man</hi> that hath <hi>horns</hi> and
<hi>hoofs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. It is a <hi>wickedneſs beyond the degeneracy of Devils.</hi>
We read that <hi>They fought</hi> againſt the Angels, the
Miniſters of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7. but <hi>never</hi> that
they <hi>derided</hi> them for their Miniſteries. They <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
Gods ends, and intereſts in the world, but we
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53432:104"/>
find them not <hi>ſcoffing</hi> at Him. No, they <hi>believe</hi>
and <hi>tremble,</hi> Jam. 2. 19. This <hi>Fear</hi> is not a <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
indeed, in thoſe Apoſtate ſpirits, and yet it
proceeds from a <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of divine
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>vengeance:</hi> But the impious Scoffers at
Religion have out-grown <hi>that,</hi> and are more bold
than all the Legions of darkneſs. They have ſo
little dread of the wrath of God, that by their
ſcoffs they endeavour to <hi>provoke,</hi> and as it were to
<hi>dare</hi> him to pour his diſpleaſure on them: As if
they had a mind to challenge the field with Him,
and to try the <hi>reality,</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> and
<hi>terrours.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus briefly of the <hi>malignity</hi> and <hi>aggravations</hi> of
the <hi>ſin of Scoffing at Religion:</hi> There will be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſaying more of it in the ſequel; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſcend now,</p>
                        <p>III. To an account of ſome <hi>Effects</hi> and
<hi>Conſequences</hi> of it; and ſhall confine my ſelf
here alſo within the bounds of that, which is
mention'd as the <hi>character</hi> of theſe Scoffers in the
Text—<hi>Walking after their own Luſts</hi>—We have
ſeen that mens <hi>luſts</hi> are the ground and occaſion
of their <hi>ſcoffing;</hi> and I add, that <hi>this</hi> again is a
cauſe of the <hi>greater heights,</hi> and boldneſs of their
<hi>Luſts;</hi> like Water and Ice they produce one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Mens luſts put them upon ſcoffing at that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53432:104"/>
which ſhould reſtrain them; and <hi>this,</hi> through
the judgement of God, and the nature of the thing,
brings them at laſt to walk after their luſts
in ſuch <hi>obſequiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>intireneſs,</hi> that they follow
them,</p>
                        <p>1. Without any check, or reſtraint upon their Luſts.</p>
                        <p>2. Without power to forſake, or diſobey them.</p>
                        <p>3. Without, or with very little, hope of remedy, or
deliverance from the dominion, and ſad conſequences of
them.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are all <hi>dreadful</hi> things, and <hi>ſuch</hi> as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
(if not moſtly) follow upon the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humour of <hi>ſcoffing</hi> at Relgion.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> The Scoffers walk after their
own luſts, (1.) Without <hi>reſtraint,</hi> or check
from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This <hi>ſtrives long</hi> with
ſinners; but it <hi>will not always ſtrive</hi> with them that
ſtrive <hi>againſt</hi> it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. When men move
with their Luſts, as thoſe that are <hi>joyn'd to them,</hi>
the holy Spirit will <hi>let them alone,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 17. And
<hi>this</hi> impiety, in the very nature of it, is of all ſins
moſt likely to provoke Him to a dereliction of
the ſinner: Since it is the greateſt, moſt direct,
and moſt intolerable affront of the moſt High;
and if any thing be a <hi>fighting againſt</hi> the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
a <hi>vexing,</hi> yea a <hi>blaſpheming</hi> of Him, <hi>This</hi> is.
Moreover, ſuch a ſinner becomes a ſubject <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi>
of His <hi>communications.</hi> Nothing that is <hi>ſacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>d</hi>
                           <pb n="200" facs="tcp:53432:105"/>
or <hi>ſerious</hi> makes any impreſſion upon ſuch <hi>whiffling</hi>
ſpirits; 'twere as good attempt writing on the
water, or painting with a Pencil on the air, as to
think of faſtening any <hi>ſober</hi> ſenſe upon the <hi>ſcoffer.</hi>
And when it is come to this, that the ſinner hath
made himſelf <hi>incapable</hi> of any benefit from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the Spirit, He withdraws his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from <hi>that</hi> miſerable perſon. He will not
plough upon a rock, nor ſow upon the ſands.
So that the man hath the advantage now of not
being diſturb'd in his purſuits by the grand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of his luſts; but is ſuffer'd to run upon the
wrath of God, and everlaſting torments without
controul from Him.</p>
                        <p>2. The <hi>ſcoffer</hi> gets this priviledge alſo, <hi>to walk
after his own Luſts, without check from his Conſcience.</hi>
This is an <hi>Inward Judge,</hi> that <hi>ſummons, cenſures,</hi> and
<hi>condemns;</hi> and while there is <hi>ſuch</hi> a Court, and
ſuch tranſactions in the ſinners breaſt, he cannot
walk after his luſts in quiet. But the <hi>ſcoffer</hi> takes
a courſe with Conſcience:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>He debauches</hi> it. And,</p>
                        <p>2. He makes it ſtupid.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> it may be conſider'd, That
when <hi>He enters</hi> upon the trade of deriding Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
he doth <hi>not believe</hi> it to be really ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
and ridiculous; only he follows a
faſhion, and thinks 'tis <hi>witty</hi> to Scoff at it: But
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53432:105"/>
in proceſs of time and practice, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
through the <hi>withcraft</hi> of this <hi>vice,</hi> and the
<hi>ſecret judgement</hi> of God, grows into the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and temper of the ſin; And he comes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly</hi>
at laſt, to believe <hi>that</hi> in <hi>earneſt,</hi> which he
entred on at firſt in <hi>jeſt:</hi> and ſo Satan and his
Luſts have decoy'd him into a down right, <hi>ſerious</hi>
Infidelity. If the <hi>horrid Articles</hi> of impiety and
unbelief had been offer'd him at the beginning,
in a way of <hi>ſerious argument,</hi> he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
them with ſome <hi>intellectual deteſtation</hi> and
<hi>abhorrence:</hi> But having a long time droll'd upon
Religion, and <hi>repreſented</hi> it <hi>as ridiculous;</hi> rather
than ſo much wit and ſport ſhould be loſt, he is
willing to believe it <hi>is ſo;</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>will</hi> quickly
draws <hi>ſuch an underſtanding</hi> to it. But eſpecially
the conſideration of <hi>full liberty</hi> in his <hi>Luſts,</hi> indears
and recommends the opinion to him; and the
intellect <hi>ſo prepar'd</hi> is quickly convinc'd, having
ſo great an intereſt to incline it; ſo that <hi>now the
fooliſh mind is darkened,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
made a <hi>party</hi> with the <hi>luſts.</hi> It is become
<hi>reprobate,</hi> Rom. 1. 28. and given up to <hi>ſtrong
deluſions,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 11. The Scoffer now <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves</hi>
his <hi>Jeſts</hi> as if they were arguments of <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
and <hi>pleads</hi> for his <hi>luſts,</hi> as if they were <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi>
And thus his Conſcience is debauch'd: Or,
if he <hi>have</hi> not proceeded ſo far as <hi>this,</hi> Yet,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:53432:106"/>
2. He <hi>ſtupifieth</hi> it at leaſt. There are two main
acts of Conſcience: to <hi>inform</hi> us <hi>what is our Duty;</hi>
and to <hi>judge how far we do it,</hi> or <hi>do it not.</hi> And <hi>this
ſort</hi> of wicked men deal <hi>ſo</hi> with Conſcience as to
<hi>ſtupifie both.</hi> For <hi>Duty,</hi> they think of <hi>none; who is
Lord over them!</hi> and for <hi>reflection</hi> on their actions,
they are ſtrangers to it. They follow on with
their eyes and thoughts upon their Luſts, but
never conſider whither the way leads. They
purſue ſenſe and appetite, but reflect and think
no more than Beaſts. <hi>Whither am I going?</hi> and
<hi>what have I done?</hi> are <hi>no queſtions</hi> with them. All
the ſoul and mind they have is employ'd in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
means to gratifie and pleaſe their Luſts; and
while <hi>thoſe</hi> are ſatisfied, the men are content and
quiet, be their actions what they will. They
feel no inward trouble, or diſturbance from the
<hi>greateſt villanies:</hi> They can blaſpheme the name
of God by horrid Oaths every moment; and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch</hi>
themſelves by <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> and vile <hi>ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
every day, without the leaſt remorſe or ſenſe
that any thing is a-miſs; yea, they make <hi>ſport</hi> of
their Sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 9. and <hi>glory in their ſhame,</hi>
Phil. 3. 19. They <hi>live undiſturbedly</hi> in a courſe of
helliſh wickedneſs, and <hi>die</hi> in the ſame, without
any thought or apprehenſion of <hi>Sin, Death,</hi> or
<hi>Judgement.</hi> They laugh and debauch themſelves
into a ſtate <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 19. and <hi>ſear
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53432:106"/>
their Conſciences as with an hot iron,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2.
They are <hi>twice dead, plucked up by the roots,</hi> Jude 12.
<hi>dead</hi> by <hi>nature</hi> to the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Life; and <hi>now</hi> by
theſe vile uſages, <hi>dead</hi> to the <hi>moral</hi> alſo. And
when they are come <hi>thus far,</hi> they are freed too,</p>
                        <p>3. From the <hi>Reſtraints of the Miniſters of Gods
Providence, the Holy Angels. They</hi> are Inſtruments
in the diſtribution of mercies and judgements,
by which God reſtrains ſinners from their Luſts;
<hi>Miniſtring ſpirits for our good,</hi> Heb. 1. 14. and are
perhaps concern'd about us in more things than
we imagine; throwing bars a-thwart the way
where danger or temptation lies; inwardly and
ſecretly exciting good thoughts and deſires, as
Satan doth evil ones, and defending us, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inſtances, from the power and ſubtilty of that
enemy: But the derider of Religion, who is
forſaken of God and Conſcience, is alſo left by
<hi>Theſe.</hi> And that there is <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>dereliction</hi> of <hi>incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
ſinners, we may ſee <hi>Jer. 51. 9. We would
have healed Babylon; but ſhe is not healed, forſake her,
and let her go.</hi> Spoken, as ſome of the learned
Ancients ſuppoſe, by the <hi>Preſidential</hi> Angels; like
the voice in the Temple, a little before the laſt
deſtruction of it, <hi>Let us go hence.</hi> Thus
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 9. the Septuagint reads—<hi>They that keep
my ſoul take counſel together, ſaying, God hath forſaken
him, let us perſecute and take him, for there is none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53432:107"/>
him.</hi> The <hi>good Spirits</hi> depart from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible
ſinner, and leave him to the <hi>evil ones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus of the <hi>firſt</hi> dreadful <hi>conſequence</hi> of <hi>Scoffing</hi>
at Religion; the <hi>Scoffers</hi> are given up to <hi>follow</hi>
their <hi>Luſts</hi> without <hi>reſtraint.</hi> Another is,</p>
                        <p>2. That <hi>they follow without power to leave or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
them.</hi> They follow as <hi>Vaſſals</hi> and <hi>Slaves;</hi>
yea they follow as a <hi>Beaſt</hi> that is led. Their
<hi>wills</hi> are but the <hi>motions</hi> of their <hi>Luſt;</hi> their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
but the impure <hi>Phantaſms</hi> and <hi>Imaginations</hi>
that are raiſed by their <hi>Luſts;</hi> and their <hi>affections,</hi>
but the various <hi>inclinations</hi> of their <hi>Luſts.</hi> So that
what ever may be ſaid of the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>leſs degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
men, <hi>theſe</hi> have <hi>none.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our <hi>power</hi> conſiſts in the aids of the Spirit of
God, in the informations, convictions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
of Conſcience, and in the offices of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
we receive from the Miniſtring Spirits:
When <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>gone,</hi> all our <hi>power</hi> is <hi>gone.</hi> So that
thoſe <hi>reprobate</hi> men are <hi>dead in ſin, Eph.</hi> 2. 1. and
<hi>Sold unto it,</hi> Rom. 7. 14. They are <hi>led into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
by the Law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 7. 23.</p>
                        <p>They are <hi>ſlaves,</hi> and <hi>ſlaves</hi> to the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,</hi>
and the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>ſlaves:</hi> even to him that <hi>is
held in the chains of darkneſs, to the judgement of the
great day.</hi> Being <hi>left</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Angels, the
<hi>evil</hi> ones take <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of them; on which account
they are truly <hi>Demoniacks,</hi> and thoſe of the worſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53432:107"/>
ſort: they are <hi>mov'd</hi> and <hi>acted</hi> by the Devil, as if
they had <hi>no other Soul.</hi> And ſo,</p>
                        <p>3. They <hi>follow their Luſts with none,</hi> or <hi>very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hope of Remedy.</hi> The condition of the Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
(of ſome of them at leaſt) is <hi>quite</hi> or <hi>very
near deſperate.</hi> This follows from what hath
been ſaid already; and we may conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</p>
                        <p>1. That there is a <hi>day of Grace;</hi> a <hi>time</hi> in which
there is ground for hope: when <hi>that</hi> is <hi>done, hope</hi>
is at an end. Now this day is the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi>
of <hi>repentance:</hi> When ever a ſinner repents
and turns, he ſhall be accepted and live: But
men may <hi>out-live,</hi> and <hi>ſin away</hi> the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
of <hi>repentance;</hi> And <hi>then</hi> their <hi>Sun</hi> is <hi>ſet,</hi> their
<hi>day</hi> is <hi>done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now Repentance begins in <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>ſin;</hi> but when a man is arriv'd at a ſtate <hi>paſt
feeling,</hi> he is <hi>incapable</hi> of <hi>that:</hi> the moſt powerful
word, moſt terrible judgements, and moſt allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
mercies have no effect on ſuch; the beſt
Phyſick in the world will not work on a dead
carkaſs; the loudeſt voice will not rouze a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Statue; nor the moſt ſoveraign Salve, cloſe
up a cut in the ſtump of a <hi>Tree.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſumm is, When one is <hi>paſt</hi> the <hi>inward ſenſe</hi>
of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>danger, Sin</hi> and <hi>Miſery,</hi> he is paſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
Grace,</hi> and <hi>Hope:</hi> And this very often
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53432:108"/>
is the condition of the <hi>Scoffer,</hi> who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
and jeſted away all <hi>feeling</hi> of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
                        <p>Yea (2.) there is great cauſe to think that he
commits the <hi>Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi>
(or a ſin that is very near it) For <hi>that</hi> conſiſts in
the <hi>Disbelief</hi> and <hi>contempt of the great and laſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that was given by the Spirit, to the truth of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:</hi>
And that I may not ſeem to ſpeak this
without ground, let us look into the place
where the firſt and fulleſt account of this ſin is.</p>
                        <p>We have it <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. Our Saviour had cur'd
one that was poſſeſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. The people mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd,
and were inclin'd to believe upon it,
<hi>ver.</hi> 23. But the Phariſees revil'd, ſaying, that
he <hi>caſt out Devils by Belzebub, ver.</hi> 24. Chriſt
ſhews the abſurdity and falſhood of their ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
arguing that then Satan would be <hi>divided
againſt himſelf,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom, ſo divided, could
not ſtand,</hi> ver. 25, 26.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And having reaſon'd againſt that malicious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Miracle, he infers from the</hi> contrary,
<hi>and</hi> true <hi>way of his performing it,</hi> ver. 28. If
I by the Spirit of God, caſt out Devils, then is the
Kingdom of God come unto you, <hi>viz. then I, that
have done this,</hi> am the Meſſias: <hi>And he concludes by
a ſerious application to them to ſhew the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of ſuch bold, and impious ſuggeſtions,</hi>
                           <pb n="207" facs="tcp:53432:108"/>
31. Wherefore I ſay unto you, All manner of ſin,
and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy
againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhall not be forgiven
unto men.</p>
                        <p>Where by <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> muſt
be underſtood, according to the context, <hi>That</hi>
of imputing the operation of the Spirit in Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to the <hi>Devil,</hi> which is <hi>therefore</hi> ſo <hi>hainous,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is an expreſſion of the greateſt <hi>contempt</hi>
of it, and a bar againſt the being perſwaded
by it.</p>
                        <p>Now to apply this; Though the Scoffer doth
not impute the <hi>Spirits Teſtimony</hi> in <hi>Miracles</hi> to the
<hi>Devil;</hi> yet that is not becauſe he hath a <hi>greater</hi>
eſteem of the operations of the Spirit; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath <hi>leſs</hi> belief of the exiſtence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
Yea, he will not allow ſo much as the
Phariſees did, <hi>That any ſuch things were done;</hi> but
ſuppoſeth all to have been <hi>Impoſtures</hi> and <hi>deluſions</hi>
in the <hi>Author,</hi> or <hi>cunningly deviſed Fables</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,</hi>
which is a <hi>contempt</hi> put upon the operations
of the Holy Spirit, <hi>equal to that</hi> of <hi>aſcribing them to
the Devil,</hi> and doth as <hi>effectually</hi> and <hi>incurably</hi> ſtrike
up the Grounds of Faith, as <hi>that.</hi> So that in <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
the ſin of the Scoffers is the <hi>ſame</hi> with that
deſcribed in the Text, though differing in <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance</hi>
and <hi>form.</hi> Yea, 'tis the <hi>ſin</hi> with <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi>
ſince they do not barely <hi>ſpeak againſt the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53432:109"/>
Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and his operations, but <hi>deride</hi>
them: an expreſſion of the greateſt <hi>contempt</hi>
poſſible.</p>
                        <p>And when men are come thus far, to deſpiſe
the great Teſtimony of the Spirit and ground of
Faith, after it hath been ſufficiently propounded
to them, and entertain'd by them, in favour of
their Luſts; we have cauſe to think their <hi>Infidelity</hi>
is <hi>incurable,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>unpardonable.</hi> For
ſo the Apoſtle hath declar'd plainly, <hi>Heb. 6. 4, 5,
6. For it is impoſſible for thoſe</hi> who were <hi>once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,</hi>
and <hi>have taſted of the heavenly Gift,</hi> and
were made <hi>partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> viz. in
Baptiſm, and <hi>have taſted the good Word of God,</hi> and
<hi>the powers of the World to come;</hi> (all which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of the viſibly owning Chriſtianity, and
partaking in the duties and priviledges of it) if <hi>they</hi>
ſhall <hi>fall away, to renew them again to repentance.</hi> And
they that are arriv'd at the impudent height of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding
all this,</hi> are <hi>faln away</hi> with a witneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I think, we may conclude ſafely from the
Doctrine of the Apoſtle, that they are <hi>incurable</hi>
and <hi>unpardonable;</hi> and from <hi>this,</hi> and the diſcourſe
before, that 'tis ſadly probable, they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This 'tis like may ſeem very <hi>ſevere</hi> Doctrine,
but I cannot help that: if it be <hi>true,</hi> I am not to
be blam'd for the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:53432:109"/>
                           <hi>And I'me ſure the Book of</hi> Homilies <hi>declares
more poſitively in the caſe, than I have done:
For ſpeaking in the</hi> Tenth Homily, <hi>of the</hi> Scorners
<hi>of</hi> Godlineſs <hi>and</hi> Religion, <hi>who are there deſcrib'd;
the Author ſaith of them,</hi> [I think I may without
danger of Gods judgement pronounce, that never any
yet were converted unto God by Repentance, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtill in their abominable wickedneſs, heaping up to
themſelves Damnation againſt the day of Gods inevitable
Judgement.]</p>
                        <p>I Come now, IV. to the APPLICATION;
which ſhall be (1.) <hi>Earneſtly</hi> to <hi>Dehort</hi> all
that have the leaſt ſenſe of vertue, or <hi>reaſon,</hi> from
<hi>Scoffing</hi> at Religion; or at men for making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of it. And then, (2.) I ſhall conclude
with ſome very brief <hi>Directions</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of
<hi>caution,</hi> to ſecure us from the danger of this
Sin.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the <hi>firſt,</hi> I conſider that the <hi>Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,</hi>
with whom I am further to treat, are of two
ſorts, 1. The <hi>deſperate;</hi> who have debauch'd
themſelves into <hi>down-right Infidelity:</hi> And 2. the
<hi>Faſhionable</hi> ones, (as I crave leave, for diſtinction,
to call them) who do not Scoff at Religion out of
<hi>enmity</hi> or <hi>malice,</hi> but out of <hi>modiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi>
and it may be, out of deſign to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Wits</hi> for ſo doing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="210" facs="tcp:53432:110"/>
I ſhall deal <hi>Firſt,</hi> with the <hi>former</hi> ſort; and in
treating with them, ſhall uſe <hi>none</hi> of the <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments</hi>
of <hi>Religion;</hi> but from <hi>plain unaſſiſted reaſon,</hi>
ſhall ſhew the extreme vanity and madneſs of
their practice: And I would entreat them to think
of the following things.</p>
                        <p>(2.) Be Religion <hi>True</hi> (as we know) or <hi>falſe</hi>
(as they vainly imagine) their Scoffing at it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<hi>abſurd.</hi> Every Faculty is to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to its <hi>proper</hi> object: to employ and of them
about <hi>others</hi> that <hi>belong</hi> not to them is <hi>fooliſh</hi> and
<hi>unnatural.</hi> Now God hath beſtowed upon us
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> and underſtanding to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>diſcourſe</hi>
about things that are <hi>ſerious;</hi> and the Faculty of
<hi>laughter</hi> and <hi>deriſion</hi> to be exerciſed upon things
that are vain: to employ the former, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<hi>gravely</hi> about <hi>ludicrous,</hi> trifling matters is
<hi>ridiculous:</hi> And 'tis equally <hi>abſurd</hi> to be <hi>ſportive</hi>
about affairs that are <hi>ſerious.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now;</hi> whether Religion be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> 'tis a
<hi>ſerious</hi> thing: If <hi>true,</hi> the greateſt Intereſts of <hi>this</hi>
world and <hi>another,</hi> are included and concerned
in it. Or if it be otherwiſe, it muſt yet be
granted, that it hath much <hi>agreeableneſs</hi> with the
<hi>Reaſons,</hi> and moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> Faculties of Mankind;
and our greateſt and moſt important concerns in
<hi>this</hi> Life, <hi>viz.</hi> the main affairs of the <hi>Government</hi>
of the World are bound up with it, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53432:110"/>
to it: So that whether <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> it is no
matter of <hi>ſport,</hi> but ſubject for our moſt <hi>ſerious</hi>
conſiderations and diſcourſes. And from this
laſt hint about Government, I mind the Scoffer,</p>
                        <p>2. That his practice tends to the <hi>diſſolution of
humane Society,</hi> and the turning of mankind into
the condition of <hi>wild nature:</hi> And if it ſhould
ſucceed, and prevail generally, upon any <hi>whole</hi>
people, it would make them more <hi>barbarous</hi> than
any Nation in the world ever yet was.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>be</hi> Religion <hi>what it will,</hi> Government hath
<hi>Strength, Security,</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> from it. Take
this off, and the fears of it, and no Laws can be
put in execution (and without this, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a meer name, and nothing) For there
can be no <hi>aſſurance</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> where
there is no <hi>reſtraint</hi> from <hi>Religion</hi> upon <hi>Lying,</hi> and
falſe witneſs: and ſuppoſe but <hi>this,</hi> that there is
<hi>no reckoning</hi> or <hi>account</hi> hereafter; every man may
ſay, and teſtifie, what is for the advantage of his
Luſts (for no <hi>humane</hi> Laws can reach him) and
<hi>then Laws</hi> will be <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> or <hi>hurtful;</hi> and all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
will quickly be at an end. For
though, as things are under the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Religion, there is much lying, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs,
and injuſtice in the world; yet let all
the Reſtraints of Conſcience and Religion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and things will be incomparably worſe:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53432:111"/>
No mans Life or property will be ſafe; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
would worry and prey upon one another,
and we ſhould ere long fall a-ſunder into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>diſſolution</hi> and <hi>wildneſs.</hi> So that the <hi>Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi>
at Religion are declared <hi>enemies</hi> of <hi>humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and ſtrive to turn us out into the ſtate of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi>
and <hi>Cannibals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The humour is exceedingly <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
'Tis <hi>ill manners</hi> to flout and deride what is
eſteemed by our <hi>Betters;</hi> eſpecially, if <hi>that eſteem</hi>
be in the higheſt degree of <hi>veneration.</hi> Now
Religion hath publick acknowledgements of
greateſt reſpects from all Ages, and all Nations;
from the Princes and the people; from the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Learned; from the beſt, and the
moſt; from the deepeſt Inquirers, and acuteſt
Diſcerners: So that to <hi>Scoff</hi> at Religion, as if it
were <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>contemptible,</hi> is rudely to <hi>affront</hi>
all <hi>theſe,</hi> and to publiſh them for a pack of fools
and madmen. 'Tis to make <hi>Fopps</hi> of all our <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,</hi>
and <hi>Idiots</hi> of the <hi>Founders</hi> of our <hi>Laws,</hi>
and <hi>Government.</hi> 'Tis to <hi>defie</hi> every man we meet
(except the Atheiſt and the Scoffer) and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
all mankind <hi>beſides,</hi> to be a ſet of <hi>ſimpletons</hi>
and <hi>ſuperſtitious Sneaks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let ſuch men quit all pretences to <hi>civility</hi> and
<hi>breeding,</hi> they are ruder than <hi>Toryes,</hi> and wild
<hi>Americans;</hi> and were they treated according to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53432:111"/>
their deſerts from mankind, they would meet
every where with Chains and Strappadoes.</p>
                        <p>4. To <hi>Scoff Religion,</hi> is <hi>ridiculouſly proud and
immodeſt:</hi> And the <hi>ſcorner ſuppoſeth,</hi> that he ſees
<hi>more</hi> with <hi>one twinkle</hi> of his eye, than the wiſeſt,
moſt learned, and moſt conſidering part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
have <hi>ſeen</hi> in all their moſt ſerious and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
obſervations.</p>
                        <p>Certainly if Religion <hi>be</hi> a <hi>deceit,</hi> it is not ſo
<hi>thin</hi> and <hi>tranſparent</hi> a one, as to be preſently look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through by every <hi>whiffler,</hi> and <hi>ſwilling Buffoon.</hi>
If <hi>it is</hi> an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> 'tis <hi>ſuch</hi> a one, as hath impos'd
upon the wiſdom of all Ages; upon all the old
World, and upon the greateſt part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
And be it what it will, it hath made it ſelf
very plauſible by the helps of reaſon, and Arts of
Learning; and it would be very <hi>Strange,</hi> if after
all, it ſhould be detected and made ſo naked by
every one that can laugh, and break a Jeſt.
It would be <hi>wonderful</hi> if the Myſtery hid from
Ages, the <hi>Grand cheat of Religion,</hi> ſhould at laſt
be found out by <hi>Raileurs,</hi> and <hi>Songſters:</hi> That
it ſhould ſo long have been conceal'd from
the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> in all their diſquiſitions and
reaſonings, and be reveal'd at laſt to <hi>Debauchees</hi>

Suppoſe the <hi>worſt;</hi> and let Religion be as <hi>falſe</hi>
and as <hi>ridiculous</hi> as can be imagin'd: the <hi>Scoffers</hi> that
deride it, are <hi>impudent</hi> to pretend that <hi>They</hi> have
found it out. <hi>They</hi> find the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>falſhood</hi> of
<hi>Religion!</hi> Let them find new Faſhions, or new
Oaths (things ſuitable to their genius and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities)
But for ſhame let not <hi>them</hi> talk of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
about Religion. Or if they muſt be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>here,</hi> let them firſt learn their <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> and
know <hi>what Religion is:</hi> And when they <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi>
what they Scoff at, let them <hi>Scoff on</hi> if
they can.</p>
                        <p>5. To <hi>deride Religion,</hi> is a <hi>dangerous and unſafe</hi>
practice. For the Scoffer is not <hi>ſure</hi> that he is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
than <hi>all mankind,</hi> that hath reverence for it.
He hath <hi>no demonſtration</hi> to prove Religion <hi>falſe</hi>
and <hi>ridiculous:</hi> Nor is he <hi>abſolutely certain,</hi> that
there is no <hi>Immortality</hi> or <hi>future judgement.</hi> So
that, <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> it ſhould prove <hi>true,</hi> at laſt, that
there will be a <hi>general day of account;</hi> and men
ſhall be <hi>ſummon'd</hi> by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>judg'd</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Goſpel, for a ſtate of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
or woe; what is the <hi>caſe</hi> of the <hi>Scoffer
then?</hi> yea what <hi>will it be</hi> at that day? will his
<hi>mirth hold</hi> when the <hi>Judge</hi> ſhall <hi>appear?</hi> or will his
<hi>Wit recreate</hi> and ſupport him when he ſhall be
call'd to the <hi>Bar?</hi> will he have any heart to
<hi>droll</hi> when the <hi>Sentence</hi> is <hi>paſt?</hi> or will he applaud
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53432:112"/>
himſelf in having made <hi>Hell</hi> his <hi>ſport,</hi> when he
<hi>feels</hi> it? will he ſhew himſelf <hi>good company</hi> among
the <hi>Devils</hi> and his Angels; or make paſtime of
<hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> amid the flames of <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſay, 'tis <hi>poſſible</hi> (at leaſt) that what we have
heard of a day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> and a <hi>future ſtate</hi> of
Heaven and Hell, Angels and Devils, may be
<hi>real;</hi> And if it <hi>be,</hi> the Scoffer is <hi>undone,</hi> to <hi>Eternity</hi>
undone. So that he is <hi>extreamly a fool,</hi> to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſo great a ſtake, as the life and happineſs of
his Soul for evermore, upon a <hi>confidence</hi> that <hi>may
deceive</hi> him; yea he doth it upon a preſumption
that hath not as much as any good probabilities
to incourage it. For if Religion be <hi>not certain,</hi>
yet <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>appearances</hi> lie <hi>that way;</hi> and no
wiſe man would hazard his ſoul againſt ſuch
<hi>ſhews</hi> of truth: eſpecially, when the <hi>gain</hi> for
which he runs the riſque, muſt needs be very <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi>
and the <hi>loſs</hi> will be <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>irreparable.</hi> If
Religion proves <hi>falſe,</hi> the Scoffer gains the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of a little merriment and ſport; and it
may be, of being taken for a <hi>Wit</hi> among his
companions; But if it be <hi>true,</hi> he loſeth the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
and <hi>enjoyment</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the eternal <hi>happineſs</hi>
and <hi>perfection</hi> of his ſoul, he falls under the <hi>venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
of the moſt <hi>High,</hi> and into the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Devils;</hi>
under the <hi>ſtings</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and into the <hi>pains</hi> of
<hi>Hell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="216" facs="tcp:53432:113"/>
Now what man in his wits, would run the
venture of ſuch <hi>fatal loſſes</hi> and miſeries, for ſuch
trivial <hi>Nothings</hi> of advantage? He were <hi>mad,</hi>
that would ſtake his <hi>Eſtate</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to get a <hi>pin</hi> or
a <hi>feather,</hi> in a caſe wherein he could have <hi>no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi>
and he were <hi>more ſo,</hi> that would do it,
when there was odds againſt him. If there were
ten thouſand <hi>probabilities</hi> on the part of <hi>Infidelity</hi>
(without <hi>certainty</hi>) no wiſe man would lay all his
Intereſts upon it, when no more could be got
by it, than the pleaſure of a little laughing: But
to <hi>do</hi> it when ſo many <hi>appearances</hi> (if they are
no more) lie on the <hi>other</hi> ſide, is <hi>Bedlam</hi>
madneſs.</p>
                        <p>I have thus repreſented to the <hi>deſperate Scoffer,</hi>
whoſe Luſts have made him <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> believe, that
<hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>contemptible;</hi> that the practice of Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
at it, (be it what it will) is very <hi>abſurd</hi> and
<hi>dangerous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there is yet <hi>another ſort</hi> of <hi>Scoffers</hi> to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, who are not yet come <hi>ſo far,</hi> as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Religion is a <hi>Fable,</hi> and yet <hi>Scoff</hi> at the
<hi>profeſſion</hi> of it out of <hi>modiſhneſs,</hi> and an humour
of <hi>imitation.</hi> They do <hi>not</hi> in their hearts <hi>deny</hi>
Religion, but yet they deride <hi>Thoſe</hi> that practiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to it; they are not content to laugh at the
<hi>fopperies,</hi> that many times call themſelves by that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53432:113"/>
ſacred name; but fleer alſo, and ſpend the <hi>ſilly
thing,</hi> they think to be <hi>Wit,</hi> upon thoſe actions
that are <hi>undoubtedly</hi> religious: <hi>Such</hi> never enter
into the conſideration of the matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall endeavour to awaken them (that
they may know what they do) by the things that
follow.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>They Scoff at the Religious for acting according
to Reaſon,</hi> that is, becauſe they are <hi>men</hi> and not
<hi>bruits:</hi> Becauſe they act like <hi>intelligent</hi> creatures,
and not like the <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Mule</hi> that <hi>have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
They deride them for paſſing <hi>right
judgements,</hi> and making a <hi>right choice:</hi> for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>God</hi> before the <hi>creature;</hi> the <hi>ſoul</hi> before the
<hi>body;</hi> and <hi>eternity</hi> before <hi>time:</hi> For <hi>chooſing light</hi>
before <hi>darkneſs; beauty</hi> before <hi>deformity;</hi> and <hi>life</hi>
and <hi>happineſs</hi> before the extreams of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</hi>
God hath given to all his creatures a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
to direct their actions; <hi>Reaſon</hi> to <hi>Men,</hi> and
<hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Appetite</hi> to <hi>Beaſts;</hi> ſo that to deride men
for governing themſelves by their <hi>reaſons,</hi> and
not by <hi>inferiour</hi> principles, is as abſurd, as if a man
ſhould laugh at the Ox for grazing freely in the
field, and not ſtanding ſtill to grow like a tree;
or at the bird, becauſe it flies in the air, and doth
not creep like the worm on the ground. He that
doth <hi>ſo,</hi> is an <hi>Ideot,</hi> and a <hi>Natural,</hi> and the Scoffer
acts at the <hi>ſame</hi> rate of <hi>folly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:53432:114"/>
2. He <hi>derides</hi> men for living by the moſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
rule of nature,</hi> viz. that of <hi>Self-love,</hi> and
<hi>ſelf-preſervation.</hi> He flouts them for ſeeking
<hi>health</hi> and <hi>happineſs, riches, honours,</hi> and <hi>pleaſures,</hi>
the <hi>trueſt</hi> and the <hi>beſt:</hi> For endeavouring to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>favour</hi> of God, the <hi>peace</hi> of Conſcience,
and <hi>ſecurity</hi> of future and eternal well being:
For ſtriving to avoid the <hi>ſnares</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> the
<hi>wrath</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> He laughs at
them, becauſe they will not thruſt their heads
into the Fire, and leap the precipice into the
gulph of woe: Becauſe they will not be their
<hi>own executioners,</hi> and beat out their own brains.</p>
                        <p>3. He <hi>Scoffs</hi> at the <hi>Religious, becauſe they act for
the great ends of their Being.</hi> God made all things
for an <hi>end,</hi> and man for a <hi>noble</hi> one, the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himſelf for ever: Now the exerciſes
of Religion are the <hi>way</hi> to this <hi>end;</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
men for <hi>this,</hi> is to laugh at them for acting,
and deſigning <hi>pertinently</hi> and <hi>nobly.</hi> The Scoffer
jeers the religious, becauſe he lives for greater
ends, than the Beaſts; and indeavours to be
<hi>happier</hi> than his <hi>horſes</hi> and his <hi>ſwine:</hi> Becauſe he will
not be content, only to eat and drink, and revel
and die.</p>
                        <p>4. The <hi>Scoffer laughs</hi> at the <hi>Religious for aiming
at the perfection of his nature.</hi> God made man <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
but we have <hi>corrupted our ſelves,</hi> Eccl. 7. 29.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53432:114"/>
and debaſed our noble beings: We have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
our Makers Image, and deform'd our
natures. Now the deſign of Religion is, to
repair our ruines, and to recover us to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
and perfection of our <hi>firſt</hi> ſelves; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
Light to the mind, and vertue to the will,
and order to the affections; to heal, cleanſe,
and beautifie the ſoul: So that to Scoff at men
for living by <hi>this,</hi> is as if one ſhould deride the
<hi>ſick</hi> for taking <hi>phyſick,</hi> and the <hi>blind</hi> for uſing a
<hi>guide.</hi> As if a man ſhould be ſcorn'd for <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
after he had faln into a <hi>mire;</hi> or for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>cure</hi> for a foul <hi>Leproſie</hi> that had over-ſpread
him.</p>
                        <p>5. The <hi>ſcoffer derides</hi> the <hi>Religious</hi> for <hi>acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own principles.</hi> He <hi>ſaith,</hi> there <hi>is a
God,</hi> and jeers thoſe that worſhip Him; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that God is infinitely amiable, wiſe, great,
and good; and yet laughs at men for loving his
beauty, and believing his wiſdom, and truſting
in his power and goodneſs. He ſaith, that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Saviour;</hi> and derides thoſe that are
willing to be ſaved by Him: that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
is the <hi>ſanctifier;</hi> and laughs at <hi>that holineſs,</hi> He
teacheth and produceth. He will tell you, he
believes there is an Heaven of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
and ſcorns thoſe that ſeek it: that
there is an Hell of endleſs woe and torment;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53432:115"/>
and makes ſport of all endeavours to avoid it.</p>
                        <p>6. He <hi>derides</hi> men, <hi>becauſe they are true to their
engagements and profeſſions.</hi> Becauſe, when they
have promiſed to <hi>forſake the Devil,</hi> and <hi>all his
works,</hi> they are not willing in practice to <hi>forſake
God,</hi> and all <hi>his:</hi> Becauſe, when they ſay, <hi>Thy
will be done,</hi> they don't reſolve to do all they can to
<hi>croſs</hi> it: Becauſe after they have pray'd an hundred
times, <hi>Incline our hearts to keep thy Laws,</hi> they do not
ſet themſelves every day to break them.</p>
                        <p>At ſuch <hi>extravagant</hi> rates as <hi>theſe,</hi> doth he act,
that retains the <hi>belief</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>ſcoffs</hi> at the
<hi>practice</hi> of it. And O that they were <hi>wiſe,</hi> and
would <hi>conſider this,</hi> who ſo far forget God,
and the <hi>Reaſonable</hi> natures he hath given them!</p>
                        <p>I ſhall now, II. conclude with ſome <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>caution</hi> for <hi>ſecurity</hi> againſt this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<hi>folly.</hi> And,</p>
                        <p>1. Let us be in <hi>earneſt</hi> in Religion; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to <hi>underſtand</hi> what we <hi>profeſs;</hi> to <hi>believe</hi>
what we <hi>underſtand,</hi> and to <hi>practiſe</hi> what we <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi>
And <hi>then,</hi> we ſhall <hi>feel</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
on our ſouls, as will beget the higheſt <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
to it, and effectually ſecure us from any <hi>ſuch</hi>
impiety. For 'tis <hi>ignorance, infidelity,</hi> and an <hi>evil
life,</hi> that are the great cauſes of mens contempt of
Religion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:53432:115"/>
2. Let us take care, that we place not <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in <hi>uncertain opinions,</hi> and <hi>vain trifles:</hi> Mens ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
fondneſs of <hi>ſuch,</hi> hath expos'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
to much ſcorn and deriſion; while its
enemies <hi>will not,</hi> or <hi>can not, diſtinguiſh</hi> between
Religion it ſelf, and thoſe fopperies that pretend
unto it. This hath been a main ground of
moſt of the contempt that is upon it at this day.
There is nothing in <hi>ſubſtantial, naked</hi> Religion,
that can afford the leaſt juſt occaſion for laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or malicious ſport, it being in it ſelf the
moſt <hi>reaſonable, venerable</hi> thing in the world.
Let us take care then that we mingle not any
thing that is <hi>ridiculous</hi> with it.</p>
                        <p>3. When we deride the <hi>vanities</hi> of <hi>errour</hi>
and <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> let us be cautious, leſt we
give incouragement, or ground, to others by
it, to Scoff at <hi>Religion it ſelf;</hi> and conſider,
that the Luſts of men are ready to catch at
any occaſion to abuſe and vilifie their eternal
enemy.</p>
                        <p>4. Let us beware of too much delight in the
humour of <hi>Drollery</hi> and <hi>Jeſting,</hi> expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph. 5. 4. This ſort of wit,</hi> in
moſt, is a dangerous and ungovernable Luſt,
and ſpares nothing ſacred or ſerious, when 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd;
it makes the Spirit vain and trifling;
and indiſpoſeth it for any weighty exerciſe either
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53432:116"/>
of Reaſon or Religion, and from the indiſpoſition
it produceth to ſuch imployments, 'tis an eaſie
ſtep to the <hi>contempt</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p>5. Let us not <hi>intimately</hi> and <hi>frequently</hi> converſe
with the people of <hi>this ſort.</hi> There is <hi>infection</hi> in
ſuch company, and a <hi>ſecret Witchcraft</hi> in this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that may work us inſenſibly to an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it.</p>
                        <p>And O that the <hi>Youth</hi> of the preſent Age, would
be perſwaded to put a mark upon thoſe men;
and to avoid their <hi>dangerous</hi> converſation! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they had better joyn themſelves to <hi>Poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and <hi>Cut-throats,</hi> than to have much to do with
thoſe <hi>Factors</hi> for <hi>Damnation;</hi> A Generation ſo vile,
that ſhould Satan ſend the moſt malignant ſpirits
of Hell <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>profeſſedly</hi> to trade for him,
<hi>They</hi> could not act with more direct, and declar'd
oppoſition to God and goodneſs, than theſe
wretched men do. So that one may juſtly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that they are not ſhun'd by all ſenſible men,
as <hi>deſolation,</hi> and the <hi>plague:</hi> and hooted into
their wits, or quite out of them, by an univerſal
contempt, and moſt deſerved ſcorn. I am ſure
it becomes all that are of a Gentile, Vertuous,
and ingenuous Education, to avoid giving them
any countenance or incouragement, by any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
of acquaintance; and 'tis a duty they
owe to God, their Nation, and their own preſent
and eternal intereſts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="223" facs="tcp:53432:116"/>
6. Take heed of <hi>ſpeaking lightly of any thing that
appertains to Religion. Sacred</hi> things are never to
be mention'd but with <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>reverence:</hi> If
we toy and play in our diſcourſes with them,
though without direct <hi>ſcorn</hi> or <hi>malice,</hi> this too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
uſe of Divine things, will at laſt bring us
to an habitual diſvalue of them, which in time
will grow into contempt.</p>
                        <p>If we direct our ſelves by ſuch <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>caution,</hi>
we may, by the Grace of God, eſcape the <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi>
infection that flies almoſt every where in our
days, from the <hi>Scoffers</hi> that walk <hi>after their own
Luſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have thus ſhewn the <hi>ſin, folly,</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of
<hi>ſcoffing</hi> at <hi>Religion,</hi> and given ſome <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>caution</hi>
againſt it. One would think there ſhould be no
need of ſuch a diſcourſe among a Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who have <hi>felt</hi> ſo many <hi>Judgements,</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi>
ſo many <hi>mercies,</hi> who have the Goſpel preach'd
to them with ſo much <hi>power</hi> and <hi>plainneſs,</hi> and
have made ſo long and ſo zealous a profeſſion of
it. But is there not a cauſe for all this? If there be
<hi>none,</hi> I crave pardon for my troubling you ſo
long to no purpoſe: but if there be, I pray God
that we may all lay it to heart, earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
him to awaken thoſe that are guilty of
this <hi>hainous impiety,</hi> to ſee their <hi>ſin,</hi> and their <hi>danger,</hi>
before it be too late; and to divert from them,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53432:117"/>
and others, the Judgements that ſuch bold heights
in wickedneſs do moſt juſtly deſerve. That he
would in mercy find a way to remove this <hi>vile
abomination</hi> and <hi>ſcandal</hi> from our Land; and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<hi>ſuch</hi> an aweful ſenſe of Religion through the
Nation, as may keep us under the power and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of it. That he would make us all <hi>tender</hi>
and <hi>zealous</hi> in the things that refer to his Glory,
and the Honour of his Religion; and aſſiſt us by
his Grace, in all holy endeavours to promote thoſe
intereſts: begging all in the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Mediation</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, to whom with the <hi>Father,</hi> and
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be all Honour and adoration hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
and for ever.</p>

is <hi>Militant,</hi> and <hi>uncertain;</hi> ſubject to
thoſe alterations, and viciſſitudes which
attend all things that are of a mutable
nature. One while, 'tis in a fair and flouriſhing
condition; <hi>orderly</hi> without, and <hi>united</hi> within:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53432:119"/>
beautiful in its external appearance, and more ſo
in its inward holineſs and peace: And <hi>then,</hi> its
Heaven is overcaſt, clouds and thick darkneſs reſt
upon it: It is overwhelm'd by troubles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders;
and rent aſunder by <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
ſo that the <hi>ways of Sion mourn,</hi> and her <hi>Gates
are deſolate.</hi> In the afflicted ſtate was the Church
at the penning of this <hi>Pſalm:</hi> whether its afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were from the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh
Captivity,</hi> or its <hi>own corruptions,</hi> I ſhall not
here diſpute. It may ſuffice for us to take notice,
that the Church was now in great <hi>diſtreſs;</hi> and
that it took the right way of <hi>remedy,</hi> by applying
it ſelf to God for relief:
<q>
                              <l>Have mercy upon us, O Lord! have mercy upon us—</l>
                              <l>In which words we have two parts.</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. <hi>A <hi>paſſionate Supplication:</hi>
                           </hi> Have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon us, O Lord! have mercy—</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>The <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>occaſion</hi> of it:</hi> for we
are exceedingly fill'd with contempt—</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This</hi> is <hi>laſt</hi> in order of words, but <hi>firſt</hi> in order
of nature; and therefore I ſhall begin <hi>here,</hi> and
conſider in it:</p>
                        <p>1. The <hi>matter</hi> of trouble and complaint: it
was <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>ſcorning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The <hi>degree</hi> of it: 'twas <hi>exceeding</hi> contempt;
and their ſouls were <hi>fill'd</hi> with it.</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>character</hi> of the <hi>perſons,</hi> by whom the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53432:119"/>
Church was ſo contemn'd: they were, 1. Thoſe
<hi>at eaſe.</hi> And 2. <hi>the Proud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. For the <hi>matter</hi> of complaint: 'Tis expreſt
to be <hi>Contempt,</hi> which conſiſts in a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>vile</hi>
opinion of the perſon contemn'd: and <hi>ſcorning,</hi>
which may be taken for the ſhewing of it, in
<hi>actual deriſion,</hi> and abuſe. Now <hi>contempt</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a <hi>mean</hi> and low condition, and <hi>hatred</hi> upon
it. For <hi>miſery</hi> moves <hi>pity,</hi> and not <hi>contempt,</hi> where
there is any thing of <hi>charity</hi> or <hi>kindneſs.</hi> So that at
this time the Church was <hi>low,</hi> and <hi>hated</hi> in its
lowneſs, both which together, make up the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of <hi>contempt,</hi> and the <hi>ſcorning</hi> that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
to it. This is one of the moſt <hi>grievous</hi> of
all evils, expreſt well by him that ſaid, <hi>Nihil in ſe
gravius habet paupertas, quàm quòd homines efficit ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos.
Want,</hi> we may think, <hi>is miſery enough;</hi>
but it is <hi>aggravated</hi> and heightned by the contempt
and ſcorn that uſually goes along with it: even
the vertues and the <hi>wiſdom of the poor are deſpiſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>We have the</hi> degree <hi>of</hi> contempt <hi>expreſt. They
were</hi> exceedingly contemn'd: <hi>and</hi> exceedingly fill'd <hi>with</hi>
contempt. <hi>And their</hi> ſouls <hi>were</hi> exceedingly fill'd with
ſcorning.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Exceedingly</hi> fill'd, <hi>glutted</hi> with it, 'tis a Metaphor
taken from an <hi>oppreſſive</hi> repletion of the ſtomach,
even to <hi>nauſeating</hi> and loathing. Their <hi>ſoul</hi> was
fill'd, the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>quickeſt</hi> ſenſe of evil was
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53432:120"/>
over-charg'd with <hi>this,</hi> very grievous one.</p>
                        <p>They are, we ſee, greatly mov'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
and ſeem to ſpeak, as if there were ſcarce
words enough to declare their trouble: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,
that the contempt upon them, was not
<hi>only</hi> from <hi>open</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> enemies; for from <hi>Them</hi>
it was to be expected, and from <hi>Them</hi> not ſo <hi>much</hi>
to be regarded. The complaint had been too
<hi>ſoft,</hi> and <hi>unſpirited,</hi> if there had been no more in
it. If an <hi>open enemy did them this diſhonour,</hi> they
might have <hi>born</hi> it, without ſo much expreſſion of
<hi>tender</hi> reſentment. <hi>'Tis likely</hi> therefore from the
<hi>greatneſs</hi> of their concern, that ſome of them (at
leaſt) were, or had been, pretended <hi>familiar friends,</hi>
which ſome time went <hi>up to the houſe of God</hi> with
them, and made profeſſion of the ſame <hi>General
Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſufferings of the Church and good men,
are not only from <hi>adverſaries,</hi> and thoſe without:
but very oft from <hi>weak, peeviſh,</hi> and <hi>miſtaken friends:</hi>
from thoſe that are <hi>righteous,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much:</hi>
from the <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> and ignorantly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
from thoſe that have more <hi>heat</hi> than <hi>light;</hi>
that mean well, but underſtand little. Such,
many times, are <hi>more</hi> troubleſome to the Church,
than <hi>declar'd</hi> oppoſers: and Satan uſeth <hi>them</hi> as
inſtruments of affliction, and diſturbance to the
wiſe; as well as the prophane and unbelieving
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53432:120"/>
enemy. This ſort we may well ſuppoſe to be
ſome of the <hi>proud</hi> mention'd in the Text: which
may be conſider'd further under the Third Head,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. <hi>The</hi> Perſons <hi>from whom the Church
ſuffer'd this contempt and ſcorning.</hi> 1. Thoſe <hi>that
were</hi> at eaſe. <hi>And 2. the</hi> Proud. Our ſoul
is exceedingly filled with the ſcorning of thoſe that are at
eaſe; and with the contempt of the Proud.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Thoſe</hi> that were <hi>at eaſe:</hi> the rich and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
in the world. Who were <hi>incloſed in their
own fat;</hi> who had their <hi>portion in this life;</hi> whoſe
<hi>bellies were fill'd with hid treaſure,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt
ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. Yea, they had <hi>more than heart
could wiſh,</hi> Pſal. 73. and were <hi>ſuch,</hi> as ſaid unto
their Souls, <hi>Soul take thy eaſe, thou haſt Goods laid
up for many years, eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> Luke
12. They were at <hi>reſt</hi> in their enjoyments, and
very loth to be <hi>diſturb'd</hi> by the thoughts of <hi>leaving</hi>
them; and <hi>more</hi> unwilling to conſider, that they
were to give an account of their Stewardſhip. So
that they muſt needs look with an <hi>evil</hi> eye upon
<hi>Religion,</hi> the diſturber of their quiet, and have a
great mind to ſay in their <hi>hearts, There is no God,</hi>
Pſal. 14. 1. and that Religion is but a <hi>cunningly
deviſed Fable,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. or, if they cannot bring
themſelves to believe <hi>that,</hi> they will be apt to
ſay, <hi>Tuſh God ſeeth not, he careth not:</hi> or, if He <hi>do,</hi>
                           <pb n="132" facs="tcp:53432:121"/>
they will <hi>not;</hi> they endeavour to be as <hi>careleſs</hi> and
as <hi>blind</hi> as they can, and to put him <hi>far from them,</hi>
for they <hi>like not to retain God in their knowledge,</hi>
Rom. 1. And being <hi>thus</hi> diſpoſed, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to <hi>quarrel</hi> Religion, to <hi>diſpute</hi> againſt it,
as far as their wit will give leave; and when that
fails, to <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>deride</hi> it. Theſe <hi>envy</hi> the
Church, while it enjoyes any thing of the world
with them, and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it, when they have robb'd
it.</p>
                        <p>2. The Contemners were the <hi>Proud; And with
the Contempt of the Proud. They</hi> are of two ſorts,
1. Such as are made <hi>ſo</hi> by their <hi>riches</hi> and worldly
proſperity. 2. Thoſe that are ſwell'd with
the <hi>conceit</hi> of their <hi>Knowledge, Spiritualities,</hi> and
<hi>Graces.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> It is an uſual effect of worldly
fulneſs. Riches make men <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>inſolent,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> And a <hi>greater</hi> than
he, having deſcribed the <hi>proſperity</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi>
adds, <hi>Therefore</hi> pride <hi>compaſſeth them about like a
chain,</hi> Pſal. 73. 6. They <hi>ſpeak loftily,</hi> verſe
8. and loftily <hi>indeed,</hi> for they <hi>ſet their mouth againſt
the heavens,</hi> ver. 9. They ſpeak with <hi>proud ſcorn</hi>
of Religion, and thoſe that are retainers to it.
<hi>Proud—deſpiſers of them that are good,</hi> 2
Tim. 3. 3.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the vanity of man, that he would fain have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53432:121"/>
others to think him <hi>happy:</hi> And were it not for the
conſiderations of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> world that it
diſcovers, the <hi>Rich</hi> would be, of all men, the moſt
<hi>bleſſed:</hi> But Religion denies <hi>this,</hi> and affronts the
vanity of the <hi>great.</hi> It acquaints us with <hi>nobler</hi> and
<hi>ſurer,</hi> with more <hi>ſatisfying</hi> and more <hi>laſting</hi> Riches.
It pronounceth the <hi>wicked Rich</hi> to be <hi>miſerable</hi> amid
their <hi>fulneſs;</hi> that they are ſet in <hi>ſlippery places;</hi>
that they are <hi>brought to deſolation as in a moment;</hi> that
they ſhall be <hi>conſum'd with terrours,</hi> and <hi>their image,</hi>
viz. the <hi>remembrance</hi> of them ſhall be <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> Pſal.
73. On the other ſide, it teacheth, that the
<hi>righteous</hi> is the <hi>truly rich</hi> and <hi>onely happy</hi> man; and that
the <hi>little</hi> he enjoyes, is <hi>better</hi> than <hi>great riches of the
ungodly,</hi> Pſal. 37. 16. That he is <hi>Heir</hi> to a mighty <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi>
an <hi>heavenly</hi> inheritance an <hi>everlaſting</hi> one: to
the inheritance of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to a Kingdom of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
a Kingdom among the <hi>bleſſed,</hi> whoſe crown
is <hi>unmixt</hi> and <hi>unfading.</hi> This outdoth all the <hi>ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
and <hi>magnificence,</hi> all the <hi>enjoyments, expectations,</hi>
and <hi>pretences</hi> of the <hi>Proud</hi> who are ſwell'd by
their <hi>earthly</hi> Riches; and their pride inclines them
to hate Religion for <hi>this</hi> cauſe; and <hi>thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi>
that <hi>miniſter</hi> in it. The wicked that are
<hi>great,</hi> take it in ſcorn, it ſhould be thought <hi>any
greatneſs</hi> excels <hi>theirs;</hi> and that there are <hi>riches</hi> ſo
much <hi>better</hi> than thoſe which make them the
<hi>adored</hi> and <hi>potent</hi> of the world. They cannot
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53432:122"/>
bear that the <hi>Servants</hi> of Religion, whom they
have deſpis'd for wanting Lands and Titles, <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
and <hi>painted</hi> Coats, ſhould <hi>think</hi> of ever being
<hi>more ſplendid</hi> and <hi>more happy</hi> than <hi>They:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are ready to ſcorn <hi>Rligion,</hi> as <hi>phantaſtick</hi>
deluſion; and to account the <hi>hopes</hi> of it, as the
<hi>imagery</hi> of <hi>dreams.</hi> They will talk as if <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and the happineſs of <hi>another</hi> world, were only
<hi>feign'd,</hi> to ſupport <hi>their</hi> ſpirits, that want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of <hi>this.</hi> And that the <hi>myſterie</hi> of <hi>living again,</hi>
was but the crafty contrivance of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians</hi>
to gain wealth, and keep mankind in awe
and obſervance by <hi>Romantick</hi> hopes, and <hi>cauſeleſs</hi>
fears. Or, if the Church and its immediate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
partake of the good things of <hi>this</hi> world,
they think it <hi>too much,</hi> for thoſe that <hi>expect</hi> ſo much
in <hi>another:</hi> They would have them live by <hi>Faith
purely;</hi> intirely on the <hi>next</hi> world, without enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing in <hi>this.</hi> So that by all wayes of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and oppreſſion they endeavour to deprive
them of their properties; and when they have
<hi>made</hi> them <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> they pour all manner
of <hi>contempt</hi> upon them. When the Church is
<hi>wholly Spiritual,</hi> that is, <hi>without</hi> all <hi>earthy</hi> comforts,
and enjoyments; when the Miniſters of it are
cloath'd in <hi>Sack-cloth,</hi> and brought to a <hi>morſel</hi> of
<hi>bread,</hi> and to an entire dependance upon what
they will let them have: Then they clap their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53432:122"/>
hands, and cry, <hi>Ha, ha! ſo would we have it;</hi> they
treat them with <hi>imperious Scorn,</hi> ſpeaking <hi>grievous
things proudly, and contemptuouſly againſt the Righteous,</hi>
Pſal. 31. 18. Thus of the <hi>firſt</hi> ſort of <hi>proud
Contemners</hi> of the Church. There is <hi>another,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p>2. The <hi>Spiritual proud,</hi> that are lifted up above
meaſure, in the thoughts of their <hi>priviledges</hi> and
<hi>attainments.</hi> Pride takes occaſion from all things:
and when it hath not <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>worldly honours</hi>
to raiſe it ſelf upon, it takes <hi>even Religion</hi> to ſerve
its vanity. It ſets men upon the <hi>pinnacle,</hi> yea
it carries them into the <hi>clouds</hi> of <hi>imagination:</hi>
and thence they <hi>Scornfully look down</hi> upon all that
are not of the ſame phanciful height. They
chooſe unto themſelves <hi>ſingular</hi> wayes, and <hi>heap</hi>
up to themſelves <hi>Teachers</hi> of their <hi>own;</hi> they put
on glorious ſhews of <hi>ſpirituality</hi> and <hi>ſtrictneſs;</hi>
and make a more <hi>refined form</hi> of Godlineſs: And
then they phancy, that they worſhip in a more
<hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> manner, that they have
<hi>more knowledge</hi> of Gods mind, and <hi>experience</hi> of
his wayes, than all others: And ſo, that they are
his <hi>ſpecial favourites,</hi> and more dear unto him
than all the reſt of mankind. That <hi>they
only</hi> have <hi>pure Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>pretious</hi> truths;
while the reſt of the Church are in <hi>darkneſs</hi> and
the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of death, cover'd with the night of
<hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superſtition:</hi> and were it not for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53432:123"/>
them, fire and brimſtone, deſtruction and utter
deſolation would ſeize on the reſt of men.</p>
                        <p>And being <hi>thus</hi> opinion'd of themſelves, they
will not mingle with the <hi>wicked,</hi> but gather into
their <hi>Select</hi> companies, and worſhip after their <hi>own</hi>
faſhion: They deſpiſe the publick orders of the
Church, and contemn thoſe that are not in the
<hi>mode</hi> of <hi>ſingularity</hi> and <hi>ſeparation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But <hi>eſpecially,</hi> they look on the Miniſters of the
Church with the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>bittereſt ſcorn:</hi> they
undervalue their abilities, and defame their
lives: they talk of them, as if there were
nothing but <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>debauchery</hi> among
them. As if a man were forſaken of God and all
goodneſs, aſſoon as the Church had taken him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her ſervice; and bereft of all underſtanding,
and all ſenſe of vertue and Godlineſs, aſſoon as
he undertook to <hi>Miniſter</hi> in the <hi>publique legal</hi> places
of worſhip. They greedily hunt after <hi>Stories,</hi> to
make them odious and contemptible; and catch
the vomit of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Drunkards</hi> to throw in
their faces: I mean, they <hi>publiſh,</hi> and <hi>authenticate</hi>
the ſlanderous lies that thoſe ſots make in their
<hi>more</hi> than beſtial debauches; what <hi>They</hi> intend
for <hi>ſport; theſe</hi> propagate in <hi>malice:</hi> they vent
the ſcandalous tales among their friends, for <hi>ſad
certainties;</hi> and confirm them with <hi>ſighs,</hi> and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<hi>nods</hi> (as the others did with <hi>Oaths</hi> and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53432:123"/>
                           <hi>Dammee</hi>'s) as if they were <hi>troubled</hi> at the evil they
report, when as indeed they are <hi>then</hi> moſt tickled
and pleaſed! <hi>'Tis marrow and fatneſs</hi> to them to
<hi>hear</hi> and <hi>tell ſtories</hi> of the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> no
one can oblige them more, than he that <hi>ſo</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
them: And when <hi>informations</hi> fail, they
have good <hi>inventions</hi> to ſupply that want; ſo that
no <hi>innocence</hi> can eſcape them: <hi>No vertue</hi> is protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt them. They'l interpret every <hi>harmleſs</hi>
action into a <hi>miſcarriage;</hi> and aggravate every the
<hi>ſmalleſt</hi> miſcarriage with all the moſt <hi>heinous</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of guilt and villany. Yea, where no
blot is to be found, none to be pretended; there
they <hi>vilifie</hi> the <hi>vertue</hi> of thoſe unblamable perſons,
as dull <hi>morality,</hi> and <hi>them</hi> as <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
and <hi>Myſterie</hi> of Religion.</p>
                        <p>But beſides <hi>theſe,</hi> there is another ſort of <hi>Proud,</hi>
that are occaſions of the Church's contempt:
men that would have themſelves thought to be
the <hi>only</hi> friends to it: That will not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with their brethrens <hi>ſubſcriptions</hi> and <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
for the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the
Church, except they will take <hi>Their Interpretations:</hi>
And unleſs you will be of <hi>their</hi> mind in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed
Doctrine; you muſt be publiſh'd enemies
to the Church, and ſuſpicions will be raiſed upon
you as <hi>ſecret adverſaries,</hi> and dangerous perſons
that <hi>undermine</hi> the <hi>foundations. Theſe</hi> would ſet the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53432:124"/>
Church upon an <hi>indiviſible</hi> point, and have it ſtand
like a ſteeple <hi>invers'd.</hi> They would ſhut out
thoſe that have ſerv'd the Church to as good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as any of themſelves; that <hi>can</hi> do it, and <hi>will</hi>
in ſpight of their <hi>peeviſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>conceited</hi> folly.
Such men as <hi>theſe</hi> act as if they thought the Church
had not enemies <hi>enough:</hi> they would make <hi>more</hi>
divide from it, if they <hi>could:</hi> and would have
<hi>themſelves</hi> accounted the <hi>only members</hi> and <hi>pillars</hi> of
it. Whether <hi>this</hi> be the way to aſſert its honour
and reputation; or to lay the ground for <hi>more
contempt;</hi> let indifferent men judge: and to their
thoughts I leave it.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the other <hi>General,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>The <hi>earneſt Supplication:</hi>
                           </hi>—Have
mercy upon us, O Lord!</p>
                        <p>This may be underſtood as a Petition both
for, 1. <hi>Pardon:</hi> And 2. <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Common contempt is a Judgement, of
which ſin is the ground and occaſion: and when
men complain of <hi>Judgements,</hi> they ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their <hi>offences:</hi> which if they do, with hearty
penitence, and due humiliation, they are then
prepar'd for pardon, and <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to apply
themſelves to God for it. This is the <hi>firſt</hi> thing
to be done in order to deliverance from <hi>any</hi> evil,
and particularly from <hi>this:</hi> 'Tis vain to ſeek for
the removal of the effect, while the cauſe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53432:124"/>
to continue. Allow'd ſin is contempt
thrown upon the Majeſty of God; and thoſe that
<hi>diſhonour Him, ſhall be lightly eſteem'd.</hi> He muſt
firſt be reſtored to <hi>his honour</hi> by our humbling our
ſelves, and renouncing our ſins: and then He
will be ready to deliver us in his time, from the
<hi>ſcorning</hi> of <hi>thoſe that are at eaſe,</hi> and <hi>the contempt of the
proud.</hi> For thoſe that <hi>honour him, he will honour,</hi>
1. Sam. 2. 3. And <hi>when a mans waies pleaſe the
Lord, his enemies ſhall be at peace with him,</hi> Prov.
16. 7.</p>
                        <p>This ſeems to be the <hi>firſt</hi> thing implied in the
Petition: <hi>Have mercy upon us, O Lord;</hi> in the <hi>pardon
of our ſins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is for <hi>deliverance</hi> from the <hi>contempt,</hi>
of which they complain: and ſo the Supplication
ſpeaks <hi>thus: Have mercy upon us, O Lord!</hi> and <hi>help
us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They do not trouble themſelves with <hi>Appeals</hi>
and <hi>Apologies</hi> unto men; no, 'tis a <hi>ſmall thing</hi> with
them to <hi>be judged of mans judgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 3.
but they make their application to Him that
<hi>judgeth righteouſly:</hi> if <hi>He</hi> approves, 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
who condemns; if <hi>He</hi> honour, let men vilifie
and contemn at their peril. The Church ſeeks <hi>His</hi>
favour and his help for deliverance: for <hi>vain is the
help of man.</hi> And it ſeems to be exceeding <hi>earneſt,</hi>
and ſolicitous to procure it; which is implied in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53432:125"/>
the <hi>reiteration</hi> of the requeſt, <hi>Have mercy upon us, O
Lord! have mercy. Which earneſtneſs</hi> we may not
ſuppoſe to proceed only from tenderneſs of their
own names and reputation, as if their being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
were ſo very grievous a thing to them:
No, there was more in it, the honour of God
was concern'd, and they were vilified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
becauſe of their Relation to Him: For <hi>his
ſake they ſuffer'd reproach,</hi> Pſal. 69. 7. and the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of them that reproached thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
<hi>ver. 9. are faln upon me.</hi> Thoſe that deſpiſe
the Church, and its Servants, firſt deſpiſed God,
and Religion: And 'tis the intereſt that his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hath in its contempt, that makes them in the
Text ſo ſenſible, and ſo earneſt. When men
hate and contemn their Prince, and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they will ſcarce dare to vent their ſpite <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi>
againſt <hi>him:</hi> but do it againſt his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and Favorites: in like manner, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous
enemies of God carry themſelves to
him and to his Meſſengers, and Servants: they
give <hi>him</hi> a little formality of complement and
reſpect; but pour all poſſible ſcorn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon <hi>them:</hi> But 'tis for <hi>his ſake they are thus
ſlain all the day long;</hi> and He knows where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and enmity begins; ſo that when we are
<hi>ſcorn'd</hi> on the account of Religion, we <hi>may</hi> reſent
it, and <hi>ought</hi> ſo far as to be earneſt with God for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53432:125"/>
deliverance, becauſe <hi>his</hi> honour is concern'd with
ours.</p>
                        <p>But this will be matter of particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Addreſs, and therefore I ſay no more of it
in this place; but deſcend to apply the diſcourſe
for our <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I <hi>Infer Firſt,</hi> That no Church upon Earth can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it ſelf from contempt. <hi>This</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> was
Gods own conſtitution; a Church of his framing,
not only in the <hi>eſſentials,</hi> but in the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of it:
A Church inlightned by Prophets, founded on
Miracles, and incouraged by the more than
ordinary preſence of God with them: and yet
even <hi>They</hi> were a <hi>reproach</hi> to <hi>their neighbours, a
ſcorn and deriſion to them that were round about them,</hi>
Pſal. 79. 4. <hi>Their</hi> ſouls <hi>were filled with the ſcorning
of thoſe that were at eaſe, and with the contempt of the
proud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church that ſucceeds into all
<hi>their</hi> priviledges, and hath the addition of <hi>more</hi>
and <hi>greater; That</hi> alſo hath undergone heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of contempt ever ſince it appear'd in the
world. The Author of it was the <hi>Son of God,
God bleſſed for ever; the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory,</hi>
and <hi>expreſs image of his perſon;</hi> and yet <hi>He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
and rejected of men,</hi> Iſa. 53. 3. they <hi>hid their faces
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53432:126"/>
from him, and eſteemed him not;</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyed,
and the event made good. <hi>He came unto
his own,</hi> and <hi>they received him not;</hi> yea, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
him with contempt: They <hi>reproach'd</hi> him
in his <hi>Life,</hi> as a <hi>Wine-bibber,</hi> a <hi>Glutton,</hi> a <hi>friend</hi> of
<hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>ſinners;</hi> In his <hi>Doctrines,</hi> as a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,</hi>
and <hi>Blaſphemer;</hi> In his <hi>Miracles,</hi> as a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer</hi>
and <hi>Magician,</hi> and one that <hi>caſt out Devils by
Belzebub;</hi> in his <hi>Declarations,</hi> and rightful claims,
as an ignominious <hi>Impoſtor:</hi> And at his <hi>Death,</hi>
they loaded him with all the <hi>marks</hi> of <hi>contempt</hi>
and reproach imaginable: <hi>Seiz'd</hi> him with
Swords and Staves, like a Murderer or a Thief;
<hi>condemn'd</hi> him by a publique cry, as one not fit
to live upon the earth, <hi>Away with him; Crucifie him,
crucifie him;</hi> Buffeted him, Spit upon him, hung
him up on an infamous tree, as a vile perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two notorious Malefactors. And if the
Maſter had ſuch uſage, what were the ſervants
to expect? If <hi>He</hi> be call'd <hi>Belzebub,</hi> what muſt
they look for? <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 25. They could expect
no other than <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>reproach,</hi> and they had it
in full meaſure.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Apoſtles, and immediate</hi> Meſſengers of the
holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were accounted as <hi>madmen, bablers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers</hi>
of the people; and <hi>ſetters forth</hi> of <hi>ſtrange Gods;</hi>
their way and Doctrines, <hi>fooliſhneſs, cunningly deviſed
fables, every where ſpoken againſt.</hi> Their <hi>perſons</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53432:126"/>
infamouſly with Whips, and publique ſcorns:
And the <hi>diſciples</hi> that were made by their Miniſtry
and endeavours, had trial of <hi>cruel mockings,</hi> and
<hi>ſcourgings, bonds</hi> and <hi>impriſonment;</hi> and were forced
to wander about in <hi>Sheep-kins</hi> and <hi>Goat-skins, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,
afflicted, tormented,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks to
the Hebrews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>They ſuffered reproach from the <hi>carnal proud,</hi>
their enemies without, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens:</hi> and
from the <hi>ſpiritual proud</hi> that pretended to be within,
the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> thoſe <hi>vile Fanaticks</hi> of the firſt times,
who boaſted that they were more knowing, and
more ſpiritual than all others; that they better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
yea, <hi>only</hi> underſtood the <hi>myſterie</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
they ſpoke <hi>ſwelling words of vanity,</hi> had
<hi>mens perſons in admiration, heap'd up teachers, crept into
houſes, led captive ſilly women, deſpiſed dominions, ſpoke
evil of dignities,</hi> cauſed <hi>diviſions, ſeparated themſelves,</hi>
as they are deſcribed by the Apoſtles: Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
the true Church, and all the ſober mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, as people of a <hi>low</hi> Form, and utterly
unacquainted with the <hi>heights</hi> and <hi>ſpiritualities</hi> of
the Goſpel; and therefore they ſcorn'd their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and communion, and <hi>went out from among
them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I need not further proſecute the relation of the
Churches uſage in thoſe old times: Theſe laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
lead my thoughts to our own; and perhaps
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53432:127"/>
there have been <hi>none</hi> from the beginning which
more ſadly prove, that <hi>no Church</hi> can be ſecure from
contempt, than <hi>theſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the bleſſing of God we enjoy a Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Apoſtolical</hi> in its <hi>Doctrine, Primitive</hi> in its <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
decent</hi> in its <hi>Ceremonies; grave</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> in its
<hi>Liturgy;</hi> We have the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Creeds,</hi> the
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>main</hi> Ordinances, and Duties of the
<hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>pureſt</hi> times; we are freed from <hi>Idolatries,
Superſtitions,</hi> and other corruptions of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> on this hand; and clear from the vanities,
and Enthuſiaſms that have overſpread <hi>ſome</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> on that; our Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the <hi>painted bravery</hi> of the one; and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt the ſordid ſlovenlineſs of the other.
Her cloathing is <hi>decent</hi> and not <hi>gaudy;</hi> Hath all
<hi>that</hi> which may aſſiſt <hi>reverence,</hi> without any thing
that can directly miniſter to vanity or ſuperſtition.</p>
                        <p>It is a Church reformed by grave <hi>Councils,</hi> and
not by popular <hi>Tumults;</hi> fram'd to <hi>primitive</hi> pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns,
and not to <hi>modern</hi> phancies; conducted by
Reverend Prelates, and not left to the pride and
ignorance of <hi>Novices,</hi> or factious multitudes. And
now, one would think, that <hi>ſuch</hi> a Church as <hi>this,</hi>
might eſcape the contempt of the <hi>Proud,</hi> and that
it would be rever'd (at leaſt) among the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of the <hi>ſame</hi> Faith and Religion. But alas!
how much otherwiſe is our caſe! we are <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53432:127"/>
contemn'd; our ſoul is exceedingly filled with the
ſcorning of thoſe that are at eaſe, and with the conptempt of
the proud.</hi> Never any Church had more juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to take up this ſad complaint of the Text than
<hi>this.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For, its <hi>Government,</hi> the moſt <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> and
moſt <hi>Catholick,</hi> is decryed by the <hi>ſpiritual proud,</hi> as
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical:</hi> Its <hi>worſhip,</hi> the <hi>pureſt</hi>
and moſt <hi>primitive,</hi> reproach'd as <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and
avoided by them as the Plague: Its <hi>Liturgy</hi> (the
<hi>beſt</hi> in the world) loaded with contempt, and
made a common Theme of deriſion: Its <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>
made <hi>void</hi> by every one that pleaſeth; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
by very <hi>few</hi> out of Conſcience, and by <hi>none</hi>
out of Fear: Its <hi>penalties</hi> the greateſt (its <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi>
that were ſo juſtly terrible heretofore)
<hi>ſlighted</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> as if they were but meer <hi>Buggs</hi>
and <hi>Scare-crows:</hi> Its <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> thoſe few <hi>comely
Rites</hi> it enjoyes, declam'd againſt with loud
outcries, as <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> and <hi>abominable;</hi> and its
<hi>publick</hi> places of <hi>worſhip</hi> (thoſe ſacred houſes of
God) deſerted, as if their walls were infected; and
exchang'd for <hi>private</hi> corners.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Such</hi> contempt is pour'd upon this excellent
Church, and all this reproach it ſuffers from the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
proud,</hi> who think themſelves <hi>wiſer than the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>
not becauſe they <hi>keep,</hi> but becauſe they <hi>break</hi> the
Laws, and phancy they are inlightned enough
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53432:128"/>
to be a <hi>Law unto themſelves,</hi> without needing
the Rules of other Governours, than thoſe of their
own Imaginations. In <hi>the laſt days ſhall come Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
walking after their own luſts,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 3. <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi>
as well <hi>Dehauch'd</hi> Scoffers, who walk after
their <hi>phantaſtical,</hi> as the others do after their <hi>carnal</hi>
luſts; and therefore deſpiſe and contemn all Laws
that ſhould bound and reſtrain them.</p>
                        <p>But the Church ſuffers contempt alſo from the
<hi>other</hi> ſort, the <hi>carnal proud</hi> have her <hi>exceedingly</hi> in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion,</hi>
and make <hi>mouths at her.</hi> And we are faln
into an Age, in which <hi>to be a Church,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
Religion, not <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> but <hi>any,</hi> is occaſion
enough, with ſome (and God knows not a few)
for contempt and ſcorning. The <hi>fool,</hi> in <hi>old</hi>
time, ſaid in his <hi>heart, There no God,</hi> Pſal. 14. 1.
but that folly hath put off its modeſty in <hi>ours:</hi>
and vile men now ſet more than their <hi>hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Heavens,</hi> Pſal. 73. 9. 'Tis <hi>wit</hi> to deride
Religion, and <hi>modiſh</hi> accompliſhment to make
merriment of things Sacred. As if we were paſt the
diſpenſation of <hi>diſputing</hi> againſt God; and were
ſo certain that he is not, or not to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
that there were no more to be done now, but
to laugh at the ſilly belief of his Exiſtence, and the
vain folly of adoring Him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To this height we are come, and by it have
out-done the impudence of all former times;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53432:128"/>
and what we are to expect if this bold impiety be
not ſtopt, is very</hi> ſad, <hi>but very</hi> eaſie <hi>to foreſee.
What are the effects of it at preſent, we know; and
the Church wofully feels in the extream contempt
and ſcorn that is upon it. And by reaſon of the</hi> one
<hi>ſort of proud contemners, and the other, it may
too juſtly complain in the words of the Jewiſh
Church in the</hi> Lamentations, I am a deriſion to all my
people; and their Song all the day; <hi>and in the language
of the Prophet,</hi> How do I ſit ſolitary, that was full
of people! my ways mourn becauſe few come to my ſolemn
Feaſts; my Gates are deſolate. My Prieſts ſigh, and
the precious Sons of Sion, comparable to fine Gold, are
eſteem'd as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of
the Potter. My adverſaries are the chief, my enemies
proſper; all my perſecutors overtake me between
the ſtraights. They hiſs, and gnaſh their teeth, and
ſay, We have ſwallowed her up: Certainly this is the
day we looked for, we have found, we have ſeen it.
<hi>This is our caſe, and</hi> O Lord, have mercy upon us:
have mercy upon us; <hi>for</hi> none other fighteth for us, but
only thou, O God.</p>
                        <p>II. SInce we cannot be <hi>ſecure</hi> from <hi>contempt,</hi>
let us endeavour not to <hi>deſerve</hi> it; nor give
occaſion to that hatred and ſcorn which is upon
the Church and its members. This I ſhall take
liberty to addreſs, (1.) To my Brethren of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53432:129"/>
                           <hi>Clergy;</hi> and (2.) To the <hi>people</hi> that are yet in
communion with us.</p>
                        <p>1. As for <hi>Vs,</hi> we are ſure to be the firſt,
and deepeſt ſharers of the contempt that is upon
the Church: And how it is with us at this day
by reaſon of it, is eaſie to ſee, but deplorable to
conſider. I deſire not to ſpeak fond, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaning
things, but this I think I may ſay with
juſtice, That no Church in the world enjoyes a
more truly learned, and ſober Clergy than this;
and with as much truth I may affirm, That no
Clergy upon earth undergoes ſo great a burden
of contempt. The <hi>Heathens</hi> of all times, and
places of the world have had reverence for their
Prieſts: the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> ſacred reſpect for
theirs; the people of the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches pay
great venerations to the meaneſt of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are very reſpectful to them.
Yea, even the ſeveral Claſſes of <hi>Sects</hi> among us,
reverence their Teachers: So that the dueneſs of
reſpect to the Miniſters of Religion, ſeems to be
the common acknowledgement of mankind;
grounded upon the Relation they have to God,
as his <hi>Embaſſadours,</hi> and <hi>Stewards</hi> of his <hi>Myſteries;</hi>
and the nobleneſs and importance of the buſineſs
they are employed in, the conducting the ſouls of
men to everlaſting happineſs.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>we,</hi> the Clergy of <hi>this</hi> Church, and only
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53432:129"/>
                           <hi>we,</hi> ſeem to be cut off from the common acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
rights of Prieſthood: as if there were an
exception againſt us in the general Rule, and <hi>all</hi>
the Miniſters of Religion were to be honour'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all caſes elſe, greatneſs of Relation, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of employment give title to reſpect: But in
this, where the Relation is to the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and the
buſineſs is about things moſt <hi>worthy,</hi> and moſt <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi>
the practice is quite otherwiſe: and we are
<hi>expoſed</hi> by our character and employment to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem
and neglect. 'Tis true, we are guilty of
many ſins and imperfections, that may occaſion
diſreſpect; but I hope, not in proportion to the
contempt that is upon us. In judging of all
<hi>others,</hi> men make abatements in conſideration
of the weakneſs of humane nature: But <hi>we</hi> are
<hi>under the Law</hi> (I mean as to mens cenſures) and
are judg'd by the <hi>ſtricteſt ſeverities:</hi> there is no <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation,</hi>
no <hi>pardon</hi> for us, and it will not be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that we are but <hi>duſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea every <hi>Mote</hi> in our eye, is made a beam,
every <hi>infirmity</hi> is blown up to an height of <hi>villany;</hi>
and every vice of which any perſon among
us is guilty, is reflected upon the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>So that were it not for the right we expect at
a juſter Bar, than that of mans judgement, we
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53432:130"/>
were of all men the moſt miſerable: for we are
treated here, as if we had no claim to the civility
and good nature of mankind, but were either <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
race</hi> of creatures, or <hi>out laws</hi> of <hi>this.</hi> The
Apoſtle ſuppos'd it reaſonable, we ſhould be
counted worthy of <hi>double honour;</hi> but the world
thinks <hi>ſingle</hi> reſpect too much for us, and <hi>treble</hi>
contempt ſcarce enough. We are gone over
as the ſtones in the ſtreet, by the <hi>carnal</hi> proud,
and reckon'd as the dirt of it by the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
Yea, there are ſcarce any whoſe condition
is ſo bad, or ſo low, but think themſelves good
enough, and great enough to deſpiſe <hi>us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We look not for the great honours and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world, and 'tis not fit we ſhould; but
yet, there is no man, that is not ſtupid, but would
be ſenſible of ſuch treatment, and I think we ought
to reſent it, ſince the ground of our reproach is
contempt upon <hi>Religion,</hi> if not upon the <hi>Author</hi> of
it. Abſtract us from our relation to <hi>that,</hi> and our
Order may without boaſting, pretend to as much
wiſdom, and knowledge, ingenuity and vertue,
as other men. Our <hi>Education</hi> is as handſome and
ingenuous, and I know not why the <hi>parts</hi> of the
Clergy ſhould not be equal to thoſe of other
ways of breeding: So that we might paſs well
enough in the world, and, for ought I know,
might meet tolerable reception in it, were it not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53432:130"/>
that God hath honour'd us with the dignity of
being his immediate Servants, and hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
us in the affairs of Souls. But for <hi>this,</hi> I
can ſee no cauſe, why we ſhould not be as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the qualities that procure reſpect, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that have a competent meaſure of it: And
therefore upon the whole matter, I muſt ſay, that
we are ſo far from having <hi>honour</hi> for our <hi>office</hi> and
our <hi>work</hi> ſake, that we are leſſened by them, and
if a Miniſter meet reſpective entertainment in the
world, the kindneſs is extorted by ſome <hi>perſonal</hi>
advantages he owns; and not given him for his
<hi>character</hi> and Function; no, he's taken down, and
is ſo much leſs, in conſideration of it. So that <hi>God</hi>
himſelf is affronted, and <hi>Religion</hi> vilified by the
exceſſive, unreaſonable contempt that is put
upon the diſpenſers of his Truths and Laws: And
'tis pity that our concernment in this matter will
not permit us without incurring more reproach,
roundly to reprove this indignity to our Lord and
theirs, who hath ſent us in the moſt important er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
to them. But alas, all we can do without
the loud imputation of <hi>Preaching up our ſelves,</hi> is to
bear our Reproach in ſilence, and to mourn in
ſecret, for that horrid <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and Scorn of all
Religion, or of the beſt, which is the occaſion
of it: and certainly where there is contempt of
the Prieſthood above board, there is diſvalue
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53432:131"/>
of Religion under it: diſreſpect to one doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and will ſoon produce irreverence to the
other.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, we ſee, how great reaſon we
have to be cautious, that we contribute not to
the contempt that is on <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>our ſelves,</hi>
and juſtifie this impious barbarous Age in it.
And there is no better advice can be given to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us from it, than that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 16. <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf,</hi> and <hi>to the
doctrine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It concerns us <hi>firſt,</hi> to <hi>take heed of our ſelves,</hi> to
our Lives and Converſations. We have many
obſervers whoſe malice makes them <hi>critical</hi> and
<hi>curious; They</hi> lay in wait for our haltings, and are
glad at heart, when they have caught an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to revile us; we are encompaſt on all hands
by thoſe envious pryers; by the <hi>debauch'd</hi> on the
one ſide, and the <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> on the other. The
roaring Lyon is before us, and the wily Serpent
in the next ambuſh; <hi>one</hi> would fain have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
from our miſcarriages to tear and violate
the honour of <hi>all</hi> Religion; and the <hi>other</hi> to ſpit
its venome againſt <hi>that</hi> which we profeſs. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
us therefore to beware, and to walk <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly,
not as fools but as wiſe, becauſe the daies are ſo
evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order hereunto I humbly recommend theſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53432:131"/>
                           <hi>Cautions</hi> in paticular, that we take care not to be
found guilty of, 1. <hi>Phariſaiſm. 2. Immorality,</hi> or,
3. <hi>Negligence</hi> in our calling.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Phariſaick</hi> righteouſneſs, and <hi>Phantaſtick</hi>
heights of zeal beget great reſpects and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
among the vulgar; but contempt among
thoſe of better-underſtanding; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whereby Religion hath been more expos'd
in the preſent Age, than this. <hi>Plain unaffected</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and ſincerity is accountable in all times,
and hath ſtill reputation among the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but the <hi>flanting ſhews</hi> of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
aſſoon as they are underſtood. Our <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
then muſt <hi>exceed his,</hi> not in pomp, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
but in reality and ſincere practice.
There is no one that underſtands the nature of
Religion, the conſtitution of our Church, and the
temper of the Age, but knows it to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
intereſt both of Church and Religion, that
<hi>Phariſaiſm,</hi> which is the general humour that runs
through all the <hi>Proud Sects,</hi> ſhould be diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd
and detected; and therefore we ſhould
take heed, that we do not encourage the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vanity, by any conformity unto it.</p>
                        <p>Indeed there is no other way leſenow, to make
us <hi>popular,</hi> and to Crown us with the applauſes of
the people: and thoſe who affect <hi>that ſort</hi> of glory
and reputation, are under great temptation to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53432:132"/>
ſquare their diſcourſe and lives according to
thoſe vain models: but <hi>thoſe</hi> Miniſters <hi>deſerve</hi> to
be deſpis'd that are poſſeſt by that low ſpirited
ambition: and do not prefer the pleaſing God,
and Conſcience, and the few wiſe men, before
the pacifying the humours, and receiving the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes
and applauſes of ignorant and giddy Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticks:
and there are no ſort of men worſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to this Church than theſe; who while they
pretend to be of it, promote this ſpirit and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that deſtroyes it.</p>
                        <p>2. We ought on <hi>this,</hi> as on all accounts elſe, to
ſhun all <hi>Immoralities</hi> of practice. <hi>Vice</hi> makes <hi>any
one</hi> contemptible among <hi>good</hi> men, and <hi>us</hi> deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
among <hi>all.</hi> The <hi>worſt</hi> have an abhorrence
of <hi>Debauchery,</hi> or any degree of Prophaneneſs in
the <hi>Clergy:</hi> The beſt things degenerated, are
worſt. 'Tis true, live we how we will, the
malicious world will find accuſations againſt us,
but we muſt take care we do not juſtifie their
reproaches. Though (as things are in the preſent
Age) we are diſabled from doing much to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi>
Religion by our <hi>Doctrine;</hi> yet we may <hi>diſſerve</hi>
it much by our <hi>lives.</hi> The <hi>beſt</hi> that we can <hi>ſay</hi>
doth but <hi>little good;</hi> but the leaſt <hi>evil</hi> that we <hi>do,</hi> is
cauſe of <hi>great hurt</hi> and miſchief. Men are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by it in their Contempt of Religion, and we
are made incapable of doing <hi>it,</hi> or <hi>them</hi> any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
ſervice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:53432:132"/>
Or if we do nothing that is <hi>morally</hi> evil, yet ſuch
is the world now, that advantage will be taken
of the leaſt <hi>appearance;</hi> every thing ſhall be urg'd
againſt us that the wit of malice can make cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal;
And therefore it exceedingly concerns us
to heed the Rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Avoid all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of evil,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 22. we ſhould take care
not to come within the ſhadow of it. We live
in an Age, in which 'tis not enough for a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to be <hi>innocent,</hi> there is much wiſdom and
prudence neceſſary to keep <hi>that</hi> from having a
ſtain upon it. And though we be as harmleſs
as Doves, yet we ſhall not be thought to be ſo,
except we are as wiſe as Serpents. Men were
never more <hi>careleſs</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> converſations, and
never more exact obſervers and cenſurers of ours;
ſo that nothing will <hi>ſecure</hi> us in this Age, from
the tongues ſet on fire of Hell: our only courſe
is to be as much as we can out of their way; And
as far as our profeſſion will give leave to draw
our ſelves up into <hi>privacy</hi> and <hi>retirement.</hi> For
the Sea is too rough for us to be abroad upon
it.</p>
                        <p>The ſumm is, 'Tis not poſſible for us to avoid
contempt, but we may avoid being acceſſary unto
it, if we take care that our Religion be not
<hi>Phariſaical,</hi> nor our practice <hi>immoral,</hi> in reality or
appearance. Not that it is ſufficient for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53432:133"/>
of the Goſpel to be thus <hi>negatively</hi> righteous;
no, beſides other conſiderations, we have a great
charge upon us, which will require a very <hi>active</hi>
piety; And therefore,</p>
                        <p>3. We muſt take heed alſo that we are not
<hi>negligent</hi> in the great buſineſs of our noble Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
That buſineſs is ſo worthy and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that it requires the chief of our thoughts,
the flower of our time, and the vigour of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
to beſtow leſs upon it is to neglect it:
and every neglect of <hi>that,</hi> deſerves a degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon our ſelves. <hi>Give thy ſelf wholly to theſe
things,</hi> was the inſtruction of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 15. and our <hi>whole</hi> is <hi>little</hi> enough: for <hi>who is
ſufficient for theſe things,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. and when
<hi>we have done all, we are unprofitable Servants,</hi> Luke
17. 10. 'Tis little we can do, God knows, to
make the world <hi>wiſer</hi> or <hi>better;</hi> it is too wiſe, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
to be taught; and too bad in practice, to be
amended by us. However we muſt labour, and ply
the Oar, though the tyde be never ſo ſtrong againſt
us. 'Tis part of the <hi>patience</hi> of the Goſpel, to work
even there, where our labour for the preſent, is in
vain. It will not be ſo always, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. no, it ſhall be
rewarded by plentiful Glory hereafter, though it
were not incouraged by any viſible ſucceſs here.
<hi>Thoſe rewards</hi> we publiſh and expect, and for us to
do the work of the Lord <hi>negligently,</hi> is to put a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53432:133"/>
ſlight upon them, and upon Religion, <hi>our ſelves,</hi>
and to invite contempt from <hi>others.</hi> And there
is none certainly that more juſtly deſerves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt
degrees of it, than he that loiters in the
Lords Vineyard, and is negligent in the Miniſtry
of Souls.</p>
                        <p>I have expreſt theſe <hi>cautions</hi> in a <hi>negative</hi> way,
but hope it will be underſtood, that the <hi>poſitive</hi>
duties are <hi>included.</hi> When I ſay, we are not to be
<hi>Phariſaical</hi> in our Religion; I intend alſo, that
we are to be very <hi>plain, ſober,</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> in it: When
I caution againſt <hi>immoral</hi> lives, I imply, that
ours ought to be very <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>religious:</hi> When
I give the rule againſt <hi>negligence,</hi> I have taken care
to be underſtood to mean likewiſe, that the
greateſt <hi>ſedulity</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> is our duty. To have
run out into full Comments upon <hi>theſe,</hi> would
have taken up more than my whole time. I
deſcend to the Second Head in the <hi>Apoſtle's Rule.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. We ought to take <hi>heed</hi> to our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> if we
would not deſerve contempt. We live in a
tickliſh Age for <hi>this</hi> alſo; an Age of <hi>itching</hi> ears,
and <hi>curious</hi> palats: men were never ſo <hi>eritical</hi>
upon their <hi>teaching,</hi> though 'tis likewiſe ſadly true
that they were never ſo little careful to practiſe
according to it.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>oppoſitions</hi> of opinions, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
humours, and capacities, an Angel from
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53432:134"/>
Heaven could not pleaſe all; and as things are,
thoſe that are not pleaſed with the Doctrine, will
contemn the Preacher. So that avoid contempt
<hi>we cannot;</hi> but we ſhall not deſerve it, if our
<hi>Doctrine</hi> be guided by our <hi>end;</hi> and that is the
<hi>Glory of God</hi> in the <hi>Salvation</hi> of thoſe that hear us.
The buſineſs of <hi>Preaching,</hi> is to inſtruct men in
what they are to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> in order to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, and being happy. <hi>This</hi> is the great <hi>Rule,</hi>
this the <hi>meaſure.</hi> And the Diſcourſes that are not
directed by it, may be witty Orations, and learned
entertainments, but they are not <hi>good Sermons.</hi> For
every thing is to be judg'd by its <hi>fitneſs</hi> for its
<hi>end.</hi> If our Doctrines, and publique inſtructions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
are ſquar'd by <hi>that,</hi> we ſhall approve our ſelves unto
God and Conſcience; though vain and phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
men deſpiſe us: and <hi>ſo</hi> we are to ſpeak <hi>not as
pleaſing men, but God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 4.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing by which ſome <hi>Preachers</hi> have
more expoſed Religion and themſelves, than by
propounding <hi>other</hi> ends, and ſuch <hi>mean</hi> ones as
the gaining the reputation of being <hi>Witty, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi>
or <hi>Learned:</hi> for when they miſs their aim
(as they do <hi>always</hi> with the <hi>wiſe</hi>) they fall under
extream contempt with them. The affectations
of words, and Metaphors, and Cadencies, and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as <hi>generally</hi> as they deſerve. They are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifh'd
from converſation, and are not endured in
<hi>common</hi> matters; for ſhame then let us not retain
them in our Pulpits, and defile <hi>ſacred</hi> Subjects
with them. Let us leave thoſe ſorts of <hi>fooling,</hi>
when none but the ignorant can be deceiv'd by
them into a good opinion of us; and by their
uſe we ſhall deceive our ſelves into the deriſion
and Contempt of all that have either wit or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and which is infinitely worſe, into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
and wrath of God.</p>
                        <p>1. Our buſineſs in Preaching is the greateſt and
moſt important, and therefore we ſhould be very
<hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſerious</hi> in it; to be <hi>ſlight, flaſhy,</hi> or <hi>affected</hi>
in ſo ſolemn an affair, is to ſhew our ſelves vain
and contemptible triflers.</p>
                        <p>2. We are to inſtruct all ſorts, the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
as well as the more knowing, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith and practice; and therefore ſhould
deſign and endeavour to be as <hi>plain</hi> as we can,
both in our Doctrines and Expreſſions, avoiding
<hi>hard words,</hi> and ſenſeleſs <hi>phraſes,</hi> and ſpeaking in
the <hi>proper, natural, eaſie</hi> way, which is moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for the ignorant, and moſt acceptable with
the wiſe.</p>
                        <p>3. And for the accommodation of the <hi>memories,</hi>
as well as the underſtandings of the generality of
hearers, our Diſcourſes ſhould be in clear, facile,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53432:135"/>
and diſtinct <hi>methods;</hi> not involv'd in <hi>confuſions,</hi>
nor ſpun out into nice <hi>diviſions,</hi> or <hi>numerous</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                        <p>4. And becauſe the main work is to perſwade,
and direct an holy life, our Sermons ſhould moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be <hi>practical,</hi> and <hi>affectionate:</hi> Not but that we
may labour to explain, eſtabliſh, and defend the
great <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and practice, eſpecially in
an Age in which ſuch <hi>Shipwrack</hi> is made of both:
but then we muſt take care that <hi>thoſe</hi> we teach
are <hi>ſuch</hi> indeed, and that we vent not <hi>ſpeculative</hi>
notions and opinions, as <hi>fundamentals</hi> of Religion.
We are not to be concern'd for any Doctrines
in our Pulpits, but for the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> As for our opinions, this
is not the place for them: For it is not our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to make people in all points, <hi>Orthodox</hi> and
<hi>Knowing;</hi> but to endeavour that they may be
<hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> which is <hi>wiſdom</hi> to <hi>ſalvation. Theſe</hi>
I take to be <hi>proper meaſures</hi> for <hi>Preaching,</hi> and if he
that directs himſelf by them, be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> for his
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> he will have this comfort, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
he ſuffers is none of his fault.</p>
                        <p>I have done with what I intended for my
Brethren of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> namely for the <hi>younger</hi>
ſort, for I preſume not to inſtruct the elder and
graver men.</p>

I Am (II.) to apply the advice of this general
<hi>Uſe,</hi> to the <hi>people,</hi> who yet profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of our Church. You ſee the contempt
that is upon it, and I beſeech you to conſider
whether its pretended friends have not been, and
are not ſtill, great occaſions of it. The greateſt part
of Chriſtians are incapable of judging concerning
the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>goodneſs</hi> of any Church or Conſtitution
of Religion: but are inclin'd in their opinion,
and affection by the general <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of
its profeſſors and adherents: Now 'tis an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
univerſal principle among men, that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
and the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God <hi>require</hi> the greateſt
<hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>zeal;</hi> where theſe are obſerv'd in
peoples carriage to their particular Church, the
moſt are uſually inclin'd to have reſpect for <hi>that:</hi>
on the other ſide, when the members of any
Church are cold and unconcern'd, or wanton and
irreverent in their Religion; <hi>ſuch</hi> a temper when
it comes to be <hi>general,</hi> draws popular contempt
upon that Church and way.</p>
                        <p>This at preſent is the ſad caſe of ours; and I
doubt it may be too truly ſaid, that there are no
retainers to any Church in the world, who are ſo
little concern'd for it, and the worſhip of God in
it, as the pretenders to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> If we
ſurvey our ſeveral Congregations, and conſider
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53432:136"/>
our people, we ſhall find but very few that carry
themſelves, as if they had any conſcientious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Religion they profeſs. If the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
be taken from thoſe that are <hi>conſtant</hi> or
<hi>frequent</hi> at the publick Prayers in <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> or
other Churches; certainly the number muſt be
acknowledg'd to be very <hi>ſmall;</hi> and if we reckon
only <hi>ſuch</hi> that carry but the appearance of <hi>ſerious</hi>
Devotion, it will be yet <hi>leſs:</hi> ſo that the Church
may almoſt be tempted to ſay with him, <hi>There is
not one godly man left, the righteous are miniſhed from
among the children of men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are indeed multitudes, who will tell us
they are of this Church, when they give us no
ground, but their <hi>bare word,</hi> to believe they are of
<hi>any:</hi> While they talk of <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>adhering</hi> to
the Church, they will not afford the ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of it as much as their <hi>bodily</hi> preſence, as long
as the Devil and their Luſts have employment for
them elſewhere: <hi>They</hi> carry themſelves to it, as
to a matter of the greateſt <hi>indifference;</hi> will go to
Church now and then, when time lies upon their
hands, and they are in the humour for it; and then
again never think of Religion, or Worſhip, till
another accident excites them. And when they
<hi>come</hi> to ſuch <hi>Sacred</hi> places as <hi>this,</hi> with what rude
<hi>boldneſs</hi> do they enter Gods houſe? and how
much careleſneſs and irreverence do they expreſs
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53432:136"/>
in their very looks and garb? Confident negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
ſeems at preſent to be a <hi>faſhion;</hi> and the
whole carriage after is ſutable to this ill begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
What <hi>toying, talking, gazing, laughing,</hi> and
other rude follies may we obſerve in the midſt of
the moſt ſolemn parts of worſhip? and how much
ſlightneſs and playſomneſs in ſpeaking of <hi>ſerving
God, being devout, ſaying prayers,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>ſerious</hi>
things after it?</p>
                        <p>Now when theſe carriages are obſerv'd (not
to mention <hi>worſe</hi>) in <hi>thoſe</hi> that ſay they are of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> how readily doth it diſpoſe
the generality of men, who judge by bare appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to think <hi>amiſs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> that is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus treated by its members; and to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi>
moſt others that profeſs it, to be of the <hi>ſame</hi> ſort,
or not very different; and ſo to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the Church,
and all that adhere unto it. This certainly is a
very great occaſion of her preſent contempt; and
if you would not be acceſſary to its increaſe and
growth (if it be capable of any more) beware
of this <hi>careleſneſs</hi> and <hi>irreverence</hi> to the Religion
you profeſs.</p>
                        <p>If Religion be a <hi>real</hi> thing, and not a meer
imagination (as nothing is more certain) it then
requires our greateſt <hi>zeal and venerations;</hi> and the
moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> exerciſe of our faculties, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
no proſtrations can be too low in the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53432:137"/>
of the God of Heaven; no ingagement of
ſoul too intenſe, in praying for his bleſſing, and
praiſing him for his bounty; no attention too
ſerious in hearing of His Word; no deportment
too awful in His eye, and ſpecial preſence. Let
us all conſider this, and demean our ſelves in our
worſhip, as thoſe that are in earneſt: Let the
light of our zeal and devotion <hi>ſo ſhine before men,
that they, ſeeing our works, may glorifie God,</hi> reverence
the Church, and vindicate it and us from the ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe that are at <hi>eaſe,</hi> and the <hi>contempt</hi> of the
<hi>proud.</hi> Let us endeavour <hi>ſo</hi> to worſhip, that the
fervour of our piety may equal the truth of
our profeſſion; and our actions in Religion,
may have ſome ſutableneſs to our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from it. And then though the <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>we</hi> are <hi>filled with contempt,</hi> yet we ſhall be clear
from any imputation of the guilt; and our <hi>ſouls</hi>
may be at <hi>eaſe,</hi> though we are ſcorn'd by the

to the matters of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and indiſpoſed to things
of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>inviſible</hi> nature. Yea, there was a

For the <hi>Sadducees ſay, there is no Reſurrection,

from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to the 28. which capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Query they intended for an Argument againſt
the Doctrine of another Life.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt anſwers directly to the objection, by
telling them their miſtake of the <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>condition</hi>
of that Life: ſince they <hi>neither marry, nor are given
in marriage,</hi> that have attain'd unto it, but are <hi>like
the Angels of God,</hi> ver. 30. and then, takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to prove the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> or <hi>Living again</hi> of
the dead, out of the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>only</hi>
Scripture the <hi>Sadducees</hi> allow'd, <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32.</p>

                           </gap>, the Reſurrection of
the dead undertaken to be ſhewn, was <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
of the <hi>body</hi> (though <hi>that</hi> be a great truth
alſo) ſince the argument doth not reach <hi>this;</hi> For
one who believes that the ſoul lives after death,
may ſay, That God is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi>

                           <pb n="269" facs="tcp:53432:139"/>
And therefore the Concluſion our Saviour went
about to prove was, that <hi>There is another Life,</hi> which
the <hi>Sadducees</hi> deny'd and endeavour'd by this
Queſtion, though very weakly, to overthrow.
And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſignifies <hi>ſtanding</hi> up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
Living again, <hi>ſimply,</hi> not the Reſurrection
of the Body; except where the Body is expreſt,
or the neceſſary ſenſe doth otherwiſe inforce it.
So that, though it be a truth that the <hi>body</hi> ſhall
<hi>riſe,</hi> and demonſtrable from many other places,
yet it is not meant here; but the thing intended
to be prov'd, is, <hi>a Life to come;</hi> without determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whether <hi>in</hi> our bodies or <hi>without</hi> them.</p>
                        <p>This was undertaken, and this was perform'd,
for the <hi>Sadducees</hi> were put to <hi>ſilence,</hi> ver. 34. That
they were convinc'd, we do not hear; Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from Faith or Reaſon prevail little againſt
corrupt intereſts, and affections. But yet 'tis
<hi>ſomething</hi> to ſtop the mouths of Gainſayers; for
others may be fortified in their Faith by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of the enemies of it.</p>
                        <p>Would to God we could ſay, There was no
need of endeavours of this ſort, in our days, and
that this ſubject were quite out of date. But alas!
we ſee <hi>Sadduciſm</hi> reviv'd, after <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi>
hath been <hi>brought to light through the Goſpel;</hi> and the
Holy Jeſus hath given <hi>ſenſible</hi> aſſurance of it by
his own Reſurrection from the dead. Yea, the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53432:140"/>
Hereſie is improv'd in our <hi>time</hi> to a great and
more dangerous height, and almoſt to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> it
ſelf. We are faln into an Age wherein, among
ſome, and thoſe not a few, 'tis a piece of <hi>Gallantry</hi>
to be an <hi>Infidel:</hi> and Heroically great to have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
the <hi>panick</hi> terrours of <hi>another</hi> world. We
have liv'd to ſee the Doctrine of <hi>Spirits,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly
and openly derided, and <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Living
again</hi> eſteem'd equally vain, and ridiculous. The
<hi>wantonneſs</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> hath <hi>diſputed</hi> all the Articles
of the Chriſtian Creed; and the <hi>luſts</hi> of <hi>others</hi>
have taken advantage thence boldly to <hi>deny</hi> them.</p>
                        <p>So that 'tis not unſeaſonable in ſuch a world as
<hi>this,</hi> to labour in the proof of a future Being.
For beſides thoſe that openly oppoſe this Principle
of our Faith; the vileneſs and debauchery of our
days are too ſad an argument that many others do
not believe it. Men could not be ſo <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,</hi>
did they believe themſelves <hi>immortal;</hi> nor
<hi>live</hi> ſo much like <hi>Beaſts,</hi> did they not think alſo
that they ſhould <hi>die</hi> as <hi>ſuch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as our Saviour, dealing with the <hi>Jewiſh
Sadducees,</hi> did not make uſe of the proofs that were
moſt obvious and direct, but of that which was
moſt <hi>ſutable;</hi> not of the plain and clear places
in the <hi>other</hi> Scriptures, of which the Sadducees
made no account; but of <hi>this</hi> from the Books of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe Authority they granted: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53432:140"/>
while we treat with the <hi>modern Sadducees,</hi> we
muſt not offer Arguments from the Teſtimony
of <hi>theſe</hi> or <hi>other Scriptures,</hi> which they value not;
but reckon with them from the principles of
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> which they cannot but acknowledge.
And the Arguments I ſhall now uſe, to prove a
<hi>Future Life,</hi> ſhall be of this latter ſort: and thoſe
not taken from <hi>Philoſophick</hi> heights, and remote
<hi>Speculations,</hi> but from <hi>moral</hi> Conſiderations, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
things obvious; and taking ground from
matters of common obſervation. And though
I hope there are none of thoſe Infidels in <hi>this</hi> place;
yet, I ſuppoſe, it may not be wholly unprofitable
to you to be minded of the <hi>reaſons</hi> of your <hi>Faith,</hi>
in days wherein ſo many make <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of
it.</p>
                        <p>This then I ſhall endeavour, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>

Article.</p>
                        <p>3. What this Infidelity <hi>infers</hi> in the juſt <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and conſequence of it.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I prove a <hi>Life to Come,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. From ſome OBSERVABLES in the great
world. And,</p>
                        <p>2. From the FRAME and CONSTITUTION of our

The <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or obſervables I argue from,
are (1.) The <hi>Miſeries</hi> of <hi>this</hi> ſtate. And 2. The
<hi>unequal diſtribution</hi> of good and evil <hi>here.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I begin with the <hi>Miſeries</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Life. In the
deſcription of which, I ſhall take liberty to enlarge
a little, that we may have ſuch a ſenſe of it, as may
diſpoſe us to feel the force of the Argument. Let
us conſider then, That</p>
                        <p>In whatever condition we look on this poor
thing we call <hi>man,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>miſery</hi>
before us: Proſperity is temptation to wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and exceſs: Adverſity to murmuring and
impatience: Riches are anxiety and care; and
poverty, a complicated miſery: Labour is pain, and
idleneſs as uneaſie as employment: Wiſdom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
cutting ſenſes of the evils we encounter;
and folly expoſeth us to the edge of croſs
events. <hi>He that increaſeth knowledge increaſeth trouble,</hi>
Eccl. 1. 18. and <hi>the ſoul without it is not good,</hi> Prov.
19. 2. Our enjoyments ſatiate, and weary us;
and diſappointments are ſmart afflictions; ſo
that we <hi>want</hi> both when we <hi>have,</hi> and when we
<hi>have not,</hi> and are miſerable both in ſucceſsful
iſſues, and in defeatures: we complain of our
misfortunes, and ſeek reſt and eaſe in the ſhifting
of our condition; but in a ſhort time we find
as many <hi>other</hi> evils as thoſe we ſhun'd; and are
convinc'd, that the change of our ſtate yields no
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53432:141"/>
happineſs, but a different kind of miſery. Like
men in a Fever, we toſs from ſide to ſide, and
find reſt no where but in the Grave. If we have
a pleaſant moment we pay ſeverely for it in the
next, and a ſhort happineſs is a torment. We
are devour'd by our eager appetites, and torn piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal
by the contrariety of deſires and inclinations:
We carry all the beaſts of prey within us; There's
a fire in our breaſts that conſumes us, and we
<hi>die</hi> by the ſame flame by which we <hi>live.</hi> Nor is
the condition of our <hi>bodies</hi> leſs ſad and tragical:
We are ſcorch'd by Fevers, melted in Catarrhs,
burn and freeze in Agues, are rack'd by Gouts,
maim'd by Gangrenes, and rent aſunder by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
pains within our bowels: At laſt we are
made the food of worms, except a Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deceive them, and ſend away our fleſh before
us. The <hi>beſt</hi> of our condition is, that we can
<hi>die,</hi> and mingle with <hi>inſenſible</hi> rottenneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
The Grave is the beſt bed we find till we
turn to aſhes; and the ſilent darkneſs of the houſe
of worms and bones, is better than the light of the
Sun, and comfort of the Elements.</p>
                        <p>Such is the condition of this <hi>mortal</hi> Life; This
is our <hi>portion,</hi> and <hi>our lot is this.</hi> And theſe miſeries
of the <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate afford us the comfort of the
Concluſion, That there is <hi>another:</hi> and that <hi>this</hi>
is not <hi>all</hi> the Life of man. For God hath <hi>made</hi>
                           <pb n="274" facs="tcp:53432:142"/>
us, and not <hi>we our ſelves;</hi> And he is infinitely good,
and infinitely powerful: Abſolutely perfect, and
perfection it ſelf, and of his fulneſs he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
to his creatures, and takes infinite pleaſure
in ſo doing. This our <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and the common
notions of mankind teach us concerning God:
And hence it follows, that he hath <hi>made nothing</hi> to
be <hi>miſerable;</hi> he hath no pleaſure in the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and deſtruction of the Living; but <hi>made all
things that they might enjoy their Being:</hi> There can
be no envy, imperfection, or ſhadow of evil,
or defect in the fountain of Benignity and fulneſs.
Now He that is ſo abſolutely <hi>perfect,</hi> and ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<hi>good,</hi> hath plac'd us under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of <hi>preſent</hi> infelicity; and therefore from
that goodneſs, and that perfection, we may argue,
that he hath made <hi>other</hi> proviſion for us; and
that there is a <hi>Life beſides</hi> this mortal miſerable
condition.</p>
                        <p>Otherwiſe, with how much reaſon might we
expoſtulate as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job 3. 20. Why was light
given unto man?</hi> why was the Sun ſuffer'd to ſee
a thing ſo miſerable? why did we not go from
the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> to <hi>that</hi> of the Grave;
and <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be, aſſoon as we had a Being? Is our
Maker pleas'd with our ſighs; or is there any
Muſick or ſweetneſs to Him in our groans and
tears? Every thing <hi>elſe</hi> that he hath made, is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53432:142"/>
perfect in its kind, and enjoyes an happineſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to its nature: And muſt ours be the ſingle
<hi>excepted</hi> caſe, and <hi>man</hi> be the <hi>only</hi> inſtance of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
and miſery?</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſuppoſitions are not conſiſtent with the
perfections of the Divine nature, and yet would
be ſad realities if <hi>this Life</hi> were <hi>all;</hi> and there were
nothing elſe to ſucceed it.</p>
                        <p>2. I prove there is <hi>another Life,</hi> from the <hi>unequal
diſtribution</hi> of good and evil in <hi>this.</hi> The paſſages
of the <hi>preſent</hi> world are a very <hi>Chaos;</hi> there muſt
be a world of light and order. All things here
<hi>come alike unto all,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 2. Yea, there is
very often a worſe event of things to the
righteous, than to the wicked. Treaſons and
Villanies are crown'd with ſucceſsful iſſues: Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
and Victories attend the Enſigns of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
and Uſurpers; the Juſt is made a prey to
the Sons of Violence; and perſecuted in his friends
and name, even beyond the Grave; while the
injurious are Courted by ſmiling ſucceſſes, and
born to the Stars by flatteries and applauſes. They
lay down their heads upon peaceful pillows, and
take farewell of the world in ſolemn and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
obſequies: When the perſecuted Vertue
ſwims in a Sea of blood to the Tomb, without
other ceremony, than the tears and groans of a
ruin'd Family: there is no anſwer <hi>here</hi> to the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53432:143"/>
cries of the Fatherleſs and the Widow; the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
go down complaining into darkneſs; and
providence ſeems as <hi>ſilent</hi> as the Grave. Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath Vertue's Livery and reward, and the
Patrimony of Innocence is beggery and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
Providence ſeems <hi>now</hi> by glorious ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
to countenance the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and the Tyrant
<hi>Ottoman</hi> ſpreads his victorious Arms, and is fleſh'd
in Triumphs. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the
battel to the ſtrong, nor bread to men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Eccl. 9. 11. But the things of Earth ſeem
to be diſtributed by a kind of blind <hi>Lottery,</hi> and
to juſtifie the concluſion of the Atheiſt, that the
<hi>moral</hi> world (as he ſuppoſeth of the <hi>natural</hi>)
is rul'd by a <hi>fortuitous</hi> range of undeſign'd events.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thus</hi> things are in the <hi>preſent</hi> world; and yet
Almighty Wiſdom and Juſtice governs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
over it. And thence we may conclude, that
all things ſhall <hi>at laſt</hi> be clear'd, and order'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rules of exacteſt Juſtice and
<hi>Decorum:</hi> And ſince it is not done in <hi>this</hi> life,
we with much reaſon expect and believe <hi>another.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We ſee all things in the world of <hi>Nature,</hi> are
carried on in a beautiful well diſpoſed order:
There is harmony and elegance in the motion
of the Sun and Stars; and inferiour creatures are
managed by apparent wiſdom and contrivance:
the Univerſe is a great beauty, made up of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53432:143"/>
variety; there is no monſtrouſneſs or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
diſharmony in nature.</p>
                        <p>Now can we think, that the divine wiſdom
would be ſo curious in ordering the world of
things below us; and give up his <hi>nobler</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
to eternal confuſions and diſorders?</p>
                        <p>No, certainly, He that gives the <hi>hungry</hi> Beaſts
their <hi>meat</hi> in <hi>due ſeaſon,</hi> and ſends his ſhowers at the
appointed time, to refreſh the dry and parched
ground; He that waters the Spring with his
ſeaſonable dews, and ripens the Fruit with his
benign beams; He that teacheth the Rivers
when they ſhall overflow; and hath made the
ſwelling Ocean know its bounds and limits: will
doubtleſs take care that Vertue ſhall <hi>at laſt</hi> be
happy; and that the wicked ſhall receive the due
reward of their impieties. The preſent diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are but <hi>preparations</hi> for that ſtate of order,
and like the rude daſhes and <hi>rudiments</hi> of a
<hi>Picture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus of the arguments I propos'd from the
<hi>Firſt General,</hi> the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or <hi>Obſervables</hi> of the
World.</p>
                        <p>I deſcend to the SECOND, the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of our <hi>own natures.</hi> And under this, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
our <hi>Reaſons, Paſſions, Appetites,</hi>
and <hi>Inſtincts:</hi> from each of which I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſomething for the proof of a future Being.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="278" facs="tcp:53432:144"/>
I begin I. with our Faculty of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> This is
a noble power, and exercis'd not only about the
matters of the body, but upon the <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt</hi>
objects; in a way that is <hi>rais'd,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi>
and ſhews a capacity of far <hi>greater</hi> heights and
improvements: Which exerciſes, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
prove, that it is deſign'd for more than this
poor mortal condition. For if this be <hi>all</hi> the Life
of man, his <hi>end</hi> and happineſs would then be only
to provide for the body, and the gratification of
its Senſes: And if we were made for <hi>no more</hi> than
<hi>this,</hi> our <hi>Reaſons</hi> are a ſuperfluous proviſion in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
For what need of the Notions of a <hi>God,
Univerſals,</hi> and <hi>Abſtracted</hi> Theories; in order to
the filling of our <hi>bellies,</hi> and the pleaſing of our
<hi>Senſes?</hi> What need of a power of drawing one
thing from another in a chain of long depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances;
if we had nothing to do but to eat, and
drink, and laugh, and die? The <hi>eye</hi> cannot be
entertain'd upon <hi>abſtracted</hi> notions; nor the <hi>palate</hi>
feaſted upon <hi>Geometrick</hi> ſubtilties; there is no
<hi>Muſick</hi> to the ear in any demonſtration of <hi>Euclid,</hi>
nor any recreation to the Senſes in ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations.</p>
                        <p>Yea <hi>high</hi> and <hi>intenſe</hi> exerciſe of our reaſons is
ſo far from being ſerviceable in ſuch <hi>low</hi> offices
and pleaſures, that 'tis prejudicial to them; for it
ſpends the Spirits, mortifies the body, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53432:144"/>
flats the pleaſure of the Senſes: So that if this
were our <hi>only</hi> ſtate, and the advantages of the body
our end and happineſs, our reaſons then are not
only <hi>needleſs</hi> but <hi>hurtful;</hi> eſpecially when they
are employ'd upon the higheſt and nobleſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, 'Tis not agreeing with the divine
<hi>wiſdom,</hi> as 'tis diſcover'd in the whole <hi>Analogy</hi> of
things, to make ſuch noble faculties for ſo low
and mean ſervices: All things have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the oeconomy of God, and are in
<hi>number, weight</hi> and <hi>meaſure:</hi> every thing is ſuited
to its deſign and end: And hence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that our Reaſons were intended for <hi>more</hi>
than the little buſineſs of this inferiour life, and
that there is <hi>another</hi> in which it ſhall be becoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employ'd, and gloriouſly improv'd.</p>
                        <p>II. Our <hi>Paſſions</hi> in the preſent temper of
them, afford us evidence of another Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
As to which, we may conſider them, (1) in
their <hi>natural diſorders;</hi> and (2.) in the <hi>regulation</hi> of
them by <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>vertue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Let us reflect a little upon their preſent <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</hi>
In our firſt and growing years we are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
led by <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>bodily</hi> affections: and
before <hi>Reaſon</hi> comes to any conſiderable degree
of exerciſe, our <hi>paſſions</hi> are commonly too ſtrong
to be govern'd by it. Yea, they maintain war
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53432:145"/>
againſt the Laws of the mind, and <hi>lead us into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to the Law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 7. They fight
againſt reaſon and one another, and make a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
troubled Sea within us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 20. ſo
that we are driven by them upon Rocks and
quickſands, and our peace and happineſs is made
a prey to the waves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 22. All the evils of
the world bear teſtimony to this Reign of paſſion:
and the Hiſtory of all ages is full of the ſad iſſues
of violent affections.</p>
                        <p>Which things do plainly prove, that <hi>this</hi> is not
the <hi>only,</hi> or the <hi>proper</hi> Life of man. For certainly
<hi>Reaſon</hi> was intended to be the <hi>ruling principle</hi> in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures, and this Reign of <hi>paſſion</hi> is an
<hi>uſurpation</hi> in our natures, that muſt not laſt <hi>always.</hi>
Paſſion is well defin'd by <hi>Zeno</hi> to be an <hi>unnatural,
over-boiling motion:</hi> and 'tis not credible, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
creatures ſhould during their <hi>whole</hi> being,
continue under <hi>violent</hi> hurries, and <hi>brutiſh</hi> force.
'Tis not to be ſuppos'd that our light ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be darkned in an Eclipſe, and muffled up
in clouds; the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> may <hi>rule</hi> the <hi>night,</hi>
but if there be a <hi>Sun</hi> there muſt be a <hi>day,</hi> in which
it ſhall govern. <hi>Reaſon</hi> will have <hi>its time</hi> of
Rule; as <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> have had <hi>theirs;</hi>
and that muſt be in <hi>another</hi> world, for there is
but <hi>little</hi> of it in <hi>this.</hi> I ſay <hi>little</hi> of it, but <hi>ſome</hi>
there is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is begun in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53432:145"/>
the <hi>vertuous.</hi> This is the other thing in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of our Paſſions to be conſider'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The <hi>Regulation</hi> of them by <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
This is the <hi>beginning</hi> of a <hi>new</hi> Life; a Life
proper for men; which in the beſt is weak and
defective <hi>here;</hi> and arrives not to any very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
height of perfection; hence alſo we
may conclude that there is <hi>another</hi> Life, in which
thoſe divine inchoations ſhall be compleated. For
as from the obſcure diſcoveries of Senſe, in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
in the Womb, we may argue there is another
ſtate, wherein the ſenſitive faculties that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to ſhew themſelves, ſhall act with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and perfection; In like manner thoſe
<hi>Eſſayes</hi> of the ſoul towards a better Life in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
is an Argument that indeed there <hi>is one;</hi> and
that this <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate is but the <hi>Womb</hi> of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the firſt draughts of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Image; and God will not ſuffer it to
die in imperfect rudiments. The bluſhes of the
morning are an earneſt of an enſuing day. The
<hi>Chaldee</hi> Oracles call <hi>theſe</hi> the <hi>Tokens</hi> and <hi>Symbols</hi>
that God hath inſerted in the Soul; they are
the <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> and no doubt the <hi>harveſt</hi> will follow.
The tendencies of <hi>lower</hi> nature do not uſe to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
in <hi>vain;</hi> much leſs ſhall the beginnings
of the <hi>divine</hi> Life, and the reſemblances of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53432:146"/>
immortal Deity. <hi>All life is immortal,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi>
and certainly the ſeed of this noble and ſpiritual
one ſhall not periſh. God will not leave his <hi>Image
in the grave,</hi> nor <hi>ſuffer</hi> this ſpark of him to <hi>ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſumm is, The <hi>Regulation</hi> and Government
of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> is a <hi>new</hi> Life begun; the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the
true, proper rational Life (as <hi>Plotinus</hi> calls it) but
in <hi>this</hi> world 'tis very <hi>incompleat</hi> and <hi>defective;</hi>
and therefore there is <hi>another,</hi> in which it ſhall
grow up to the fulneſs of its ſtature and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p>I come in order to argue the ſame, III. From
our <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>Appetites</hi> in two inſtances,
<hi>viz.</hi> (1.) Their <hi>diſſatisfactions</hi> with the things of the
<hi>preſent</hi> World; and (2) ſome <hi>Tendencies</hi> of them
towards <hi>another.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I begin with the <hi>unſatisfiedneſs</hi> of them. Our
deſires are too wide for our enjoyments; and
there is a thirſt in the ſoul that is unſatiable. When
we have one thing we <hi>want</hi> another, and our
appetites are always craving. There is not
<hi>bread</hi> for the <hi>hungry ſoul,</hi> nor any fitting entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on this ſide the Sun: We flatter our ſelves
with fancied ſatisfactions at diſtance, but when we
come near we find not the happineſs and content
we expected. And as Children think that at
ſuch a Hill they ſhould touch the Skies: ſo we
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53432:146"/>
phancy that in compaſſing ſuch, or ſuch deſigns
we ſhould be happy; but when that is done, we ſee
as much beyond us, and learn that in appetities
there is no Term or <hi>Horizon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now theſe diſſatisfactions with the things of
the preſent world (which are no <hi>ſullen</hi> or <hi>Cynick</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but the complaint of all mankind (afford
an Argument of much probability, that we were
not made for this ſtate <hi>only;</hi> nor <hi>chiefly</hi> for it.
For all Faculties are <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with the due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of their <hi>proper</hi> objects; and every thing
<hi>reſts</hi> in its own <hi>Element:</hi> And therefore the <hi>reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs</hi>
and <hi>inquietudes</hi> of men in the <hi>preſent</hi> Life are
an Argument that we are not yet where we ſhould
be, but that we were deſign'd to live again in
<hi>another:</hi> Which reaſon we may improve by
this further obſervation: namely, that the <hi>better</hi>
any man is, the <hi>leſs</hi> he is pleaſed with theſe periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enjoyments. The noiſe of Fame, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Senſe, and the pageantry of worldly
greatneſs, are to Him like the Rattles and Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſtones
of his Child-hood; He hath loſt his
taſte and reliſh of ſuch entertainments. And
now, if all the delights and comforts we are to
expect, were of <hi>this</hi> ſort, the <hi>beſt</hi> men are in the
<hi>worſt</hi> condition, in <hi>loſing</hi> all their ſhare of their
<hi>proper</hi> pleaſure and felicity; and living <hi>without taſte</hi>
among ſo many reliſhing enjoyments.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="284" facs="tcp:53432:147"/>
2. The <hi>Bent</hi> of the <hi>deſires</hi> of Good men <hi>towards
another world,</hi> is a probable inducement to believe,
<hi>There is another.</hi> Indeed the greateſt part of mankind
is ſo miſerably ſunk into earth and ſenſe, that
they feel no ſuch tendencies or propenſions, but
rather averſeneſs to all things that do not gratifie
the body, and ſerve its intereſts: But yet there
are thoſe who have ſtrong inclinations towards
another Life; and the <hi>more vertuous</hi> any man is,
the <hi>earneſter</hi> will his deſires be after the ſtate of
Immortality: which importunities and cravings
of their ſouls, give us ſome ground to think, that
there is another world, and objects in it ſuited to
their deſires: Otherwiſe thoſe appetites would be
in <hi>vain,</hi> and the <hi>beſt</hi> would be <hi>moſt miſerable,</hi> while
they quitted other ſatisfactions, and graſp'd after
air and deluſion,</p>
                        <p>I come now to the laſt head of proof.</p>
                        <p>IV. Our <hi>Inſtincts;</hi> or ſome <hi>natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
of univerſal mankind. The inſtances I ſhall
name are two, (1.) The <hi>general</hi> belief and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of another Life. (2.) The common <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>
of <hi>Memory</hi> after death.</p>
                        <p>1. For the firſt, the Doctrine of a <hi>Life to Come,</hi>
hath not been the opinion only of concern'd
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> or deſigning <hi>Politicians;</hi> of melancholy
<hi>Superſtitioniſts,</hi> or diſtracted <hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi> It hath
not been the conceit of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Age, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53432:147"/>
within the limits of <hi>one</hi> Country or Region,
but is as <hi>general</hi> as the Light, and ſpread as far as
the utmoſt bounds of the reaſonable nature. For
thoſe that are ſtrangers to one another Laws and
Cuſtoms, and as different in their natures as they
are diſtant in their Climes; yet all alike concur
in the expectation, and belief of a future Being.
The cold <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> and ſcorch'd <hi>Moor;</hi> the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>American,</hi> and ſpruce <hi>Graecian;</hi> the ſoft <hi>Chineſe,</hi>
and the rough <hi>Tartar,</hi> though vaſtly different in all
other things, yet they agree in <hi>this, That there is
another world,</hi> and that we are <hi>immortal.</hi> And 'tis
the obſervation of <hi>Pliny,</hi> that thoſe <hi>barbarous</hi>
people that have neither <hi>Cloathes</hi> to cover their
nakedneſs, nor <hi>Laws</hi> for a common ſecurity;
that live by the Rules of <hi>ferity</hi> and <hi>luſt,</hi> and <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
from the Beaſts, <hi>ſeemingly,</hi> in little elſe but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
ſhape; that have neither Towns nor Houſes,
and but <hi>juſt reaſon</hi> enough to provide for the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities</hi>
of nature; yet <hi>theſe</hi> live in expectation
and belief of a <hi>Life after this;</hi> And the latter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
of Navigation, and remote diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
confirm the ſame in the fartheſt darkeſt parts
of the habitable Earth.</p>
                        <p>Now this <hi>general effect</hi> muſt have ſome <hi>general
cauſe,</hi> which cannot be any general <hi>deception;</hi>
For it is not morally poſſible, that thoſe who are
at ſo vaſt a diſtance in place, and nature, and all
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53432:148"/>
other circumſtances, ſhould <hi>agree</hi> in a <hi>common</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and jump in the <hi>ſame</hi> impoſture. It muſt
ariſe then either from ſome univerſal <hi>explicite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
or an univerſal <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> or voice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
If the former be granted, 'tis full proof of
the aſſertion: or if that be not, 'tis the <hi>other,</hi>
which ſeems moſt <hi>probable,</hi> viz. that God hath <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted</hi>
it into our reaſonable <hi>natures;</hi> or by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath conveyed it into the minds of all
men, which is <hi>Tantamont</hi> unto it. And ſo we are
carried to this belief, as the <hi>Lamb</hi> is to the <hi>Dugg:</hi> or
other creatures to the food or work of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
natures.</p>
                        <p>On this account <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſets it down for a
Rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith the ſame,
<hi>Quod omnibus videtur, eſt.</hi> That which ſeems to all,
is. For what ever is ſo <hi>univerſal,</hi> is from <hi>God,</hi> who
cannot deceive, or be miſtaken.</p>
                        <p>2. The <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>Memory</hi> after death is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
in mankind: and whether the former be ſo
properly, or not, <hi>this</hi> is certainly <hi>ſuch:</hi> All way
have been taken to perpetuate mens Names and
Memories; <hi>Children</hi> and great <hi>Houſes,</hi> and noble
<hi>Deeds,</hi> and <hi>Books,</hi> and <hi>Monuments;</hi> yea, and as if
<hi>Earth</hi> wanted things ſufficiently <hi>laſting</hi> to ſatisfie
this appetite of <hi>Immortality;</hi> men have placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the regions of incorruption, and have <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
the Stars <hi>by their own names.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="287" facs="tcp:53432:148"/>
Now this univerſal <hi>thirſt</hi> after ſuch an <hi>imaginary
Immortality</hi> is an inducement to believe, there is a
<hi>real one:</hi> Since did we <hi>ceaſe</hi> to <hi>be,</hi> aſſoon as we die
and diſappear to this world, ſuch an appetite
would be unreaſonable and ridiculous: For why
ſhould we deſire a <hi>precarious</hi> being in a name and
memory, if our <hi>true ſelves</hi> were ſo ſhortly to be
nothing? Of what concernment is it to us to be
remembred, if in a few days all things ſhould be
forgotten for ever: and we were to go into an
eternal ſilence and oblivion? What would a
<hi>Stone</hi> be the better for being accounted one of the
Ancient <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Seth?</hi> or a piece of <hi>wood</hi> in
beeing eſteemed a Sacred Relique of the <hi>Croſs?</hi>
The ſumm is, Mankind hath an appetite of <hi>poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous
Memory,</hi> which would be <hi>ſenſeleſs,</hi> and to
<hi>no purpoſe</hi> if there be <hi>no Life</hi> but <hi>this:</hi> Now <hi>God
implants</hi> no <hi>Inſtincts</hi> in his creatures that are <hi>futilous</hi>
and <hi>in vain;</hi> and therefore <hi>hence</hi> alſo we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there <hi>is a Future Being.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have now done with the Arguments on which
I intended to inſiſt: After all, I cannot ſay that
<hi>each</hi> of them is an abſolute <hi>demonſtration;</hi> or that
the evidence of <hi>every one</hi> is ſuch as is impoſſible
to be avoided: there are few proofs of that nature:
But <hi>this</hi> I do, that all of them together will, I
think, make a cord hardly to be broken: And

                        <p>But yet the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> proofs are thoſe from the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Arguments</hi> that demonſtrate
the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> prove alſo the <hi>certainly</hi>
of a <hi>Life after this.</hi> For one of the great deſigns
of the <hi>Holy Jeſus,</hi> was to bring <hi>Immortality</hi> to <hi>light,</hi>
and (as I noted before) he gave <hi>viſible evidence</hi> of a
future <hi>exiſtence</hi> by his <hi>own Reſurrection.</hi> So that thoſe
that could not <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>diſpute,</hi> and ſee truth at

by a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> to the <hi>Senſe;</hi> and thoſe that
could not be fully aſſured by the <hi>reaſonings</hi> of
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> which many of them were very
<hi>deep,</hi> and many <hi>uncertain,</hi> and many <hi>unſound</hi> and
<hi>falſe,</hi> might yet be perſwaded by the <hi>miracles</hi> which
were wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
thoſe Doctrines, which they taught, of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
and <hi>puniſhments</hi> in <hi>another Life;</hi> And that

either <hi>ſuppoſeth</hi> or <hi>proves.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſe</hi> I ſay, are the <hi>cleareſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> evidence, but
they are ſuch as are <hi>obvious</hi> to every underſtanding,
and cannot receive more light than what they
have at firſt fight in themſelves: I therefore omit
<hi>that ſort</hi> of proof, as not <hi>needed</hi> by thoſe that <hi>embrace</hi>
the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and for <hi>others</hi> that believe it not, the

                           <hi>Reaſons</hi> taken <hi>thence</hi> will be of no force with ſuch
men.</p>
                        <p>I have alſo deſignedly omitted the Arguments
that ariſe from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Soul, Philoſophically</hi>
conſider'd, for the reaſon mention'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>nice;</hi> and
ſo not proper for ſuch diſcourſes as <hi>this;</hi> nor are
they uſually of much force upon the mind.</p>
                        <p>I Come II. to ſhew the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Occaſions</hi>
of mens not believing a future ſtate. The chief
are ſuch as <hi>theſe,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers:
the horrid ſins of their <hi>preſent</hi> lives
make them afraid of <hi>another.</hi> They are reſolv'd
on the courſe of vanity and folly while they
live, and would have <hi>all</hi> to <hi>end here.</hi> They will
<hi>crown</hi> themſelves with <hi>Roſebuds,</hi> and leave tokens
of their mirth in <hi>every place;</hi> they'l let no <hi>Flower</hi> of
the Spring paſs <hi>by them,</hi> nor loſe any <hi>part</hi> of <hi>volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs:</hi>
and this they would have to be their
<hi>whole portion,</hi> and their <hi>only lot</hi> to be <hi>this.</hi> Away
then ye melancholick dreams, and troubleſome
fancies of another world! ye are an <hi>offence</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and <hi>ſavour</hi> not the things that are of jollity
and good humour: ye damp our joyes, and put
bitterneſs into the ſweeteſt draught of pleaſure:
Therefore away to Cloyſters and Cells; and dwell
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53432:150"/>
there among the ſuperſtitious and the ignorant;
but leave <hi>us</hi> the liberty of our thoughts, and the
ſatisfaction of our enjoyments. This is the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,</hi>
if not the language of the <hi>Sadducee.</hi> He
is not <hi>willing</hi> that there <hi>ſhould</hi> be another Life, and
therefore perſwades himſelf that there <hi>is not any:</hi>
He would not meet himſelf again, nor have ſuch
a reſtraint upon his appetites, as the dread of an
<hi>after-reckoning. The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is
no God,</hi> Pſal. 14. 1. it follows, <hi>They are become
abominable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vice</hi> is at the <hi>root</hi> of Atheiſm and unbelief:
<hi>Senſuality</hi> drowns all the noble conceptions of the
Soul, and fills it with <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>beſtial</hi> imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It ties mens thoughts down to <hi>preſent</hi> and
<hi>ſenſible</hi> things, and hinders their proſpect into the
<hi>Regions</hi> of <hi>Immortality.</hi> It makes them <hi>like</hi> to the
objects of their pleaſures, and renders them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to reſent <hi>future</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſatisfactions; they
can form no <hi>Idea</hi> of any thing <hi>agreeable</hi> to them
in the other world: all things <hi>there</hi> are <hi>uneaſie</hi> and
<hi>unreliſhing</hi> at the <hi>beſt;</hi> and the <hi>worſt</hi> is not to be
endured. So that they bend their force to eraſe
all impreſſions of ſo <hi>ungrateful</hi> a Doctrine; in
which, at laſt, through the power of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and the co-operation of Satan, they effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
prevail; and caſt off all belief and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any future Being. Another cauſe of which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="291" facs="tcp:53432:150"/>
2. <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> and a proud affectation to be
ſomething <hi>extraordinary. Vain men would be Wits,</hi>
and ſoar <hi>above</hi> the height of other mortals: Their
Eagle-ſight is <hi>ſharp</hi> and piercing, and they eſpy
the deceits and impoſtures, that the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are too dull to deſcry! They <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the
<hi>common</hi> Doctrines, and proudly pity, or laugh at
the eaſineſs of others, who ſuffer themſelves to be
ſway'd by them; and by how much the more
<hi>ſacred</hi> the truths are which they reject, by ſo much
<hi>greater,</hi> they reckon, is the honour of their own
<hi>ſagacity,</hi> in <hi>finding out</hi> the deceit, by which ſo many
have been abus'd and miſled.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſe</hi> are <hi>Wits</hi> in an <hi>inſtant;</hi> at the <hi>top,</hi> before
they have taken the <hi>firſt</hi> ſtep; and <hi>perfect</hi> in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as <hi>ſoon,</hi> and <hi>ſome</hi> of them <hi>before</hi> they have <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</hi>
If their accompliſhments be meaſur'd by
their <hi>confidence</hi> and their <hi>ſcorn,</hi> they are the greateſt
Wits among men; but if by their <hi>judgement</hi> and
real <hi>knowledge, they</hi> (of any) have not the leaſt
pretence to that title. For though they may
gain the glory among their eaſie companions, by
oppoſing the great acknowledgements of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and particularly <hi>this;</hi> yet they will never by
ſuch <hi>ways</hi> obtain it from thoſe who are <hi>really that,</hi>
which they <hi>affect</hi> to be <hi>thought.</hi> It is the known
obſervation of one who held a high place among
the <hi>Wits</hi> of his Age, That a <hi>little Philoſophy</hi> and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53432:151"/>
knowledge inclines men to be <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi>
but the greater meaſures ſet the mind right in
Religion, and ſecure it from the danger of thoſe
impieties: So that who takes <hi>this</hi> way to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a <hi>Wit,</hi> makes himſelf a <hi>Fool</hi> to the <hi>wiſe;</hi>
without gaining the reputation of being <hi>wiſe</hi>
among other <hi>Fools</hi> beſides thoſe of his own ſort.
Or if he could attain the height of that ambition,
'twould prove a very <hi>dear</hi> credit, that is purchaſed
upon ſuch terms, as are the ruine of his ſoul, the
deſtruction of his beſt hopes, and the degrading of
his noble nature.</p>
                        <p>3. Another main occaſion of <hi>Infidelity</hi> in this
Article, is <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or the entertainment of
Principles of Faith upon the credit of phancies:
Dangerous is the caſe of Religion, when <hi>Reaſon</hi> is
thrown by, and deteſted; and the whole ſtreſs
laid upon <hi>warm imaginations. Theſe</hi> indeed will
hold up the mind for a while, in great confidence
of another world, and fill it with a thouſand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<hi>images</hi> and <hi>chimaera</hi>'s about it, which
will be all taken for <hi>clear light</hi> and <hi>ſolemn certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
while the wind ſits right: But then alas!
anon the ſcene alters, and a change in the habit
of the body diſpoſeth the man to <hi>other thoughts;</hi>
and ſo all is flung away as <hi>deluſion;</hi> and the <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt</hi>
is ſtrongly carried down by the over-bearing
of his <hi>melancholy,</hi> into the doleful conceit of his
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53432:151"/>
                           <hi>mortality,</hi> and the belief that he ſhall die like
the Beaſts <hi>that periſh.</hi> And that that humour
diſpoſeth men naturally to ſuch apprehenſions,
we may ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> who ſpake <hi>in the trouble of his
ſpirit,</hi> and in the <hi>bitterneſs of his mind,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>There
is hope of a Tree if it be cut down, that it will ſprout, and
the branches thereof will not ceaſe—But man is ſick,
and dieth, and man periſheth, and where is he?</hi> Job
14. He ſeems to ſpeak in <hi>this</hi> and other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
like an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> or a <hi>Sadducee:</hi> and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
looks comfortleſs and diſcouraging, <hi>ver.
14. If a man die, ſhall be live again?</hi> The good
man was under the diſorder of a great and juſt
ſadneſs, and that repreſented all things as dark
and diſmal to his wounded phancy, and ſeem'd
ſometimes to deprive him of the only remaining
comfort, the hope of a better condition in another
world. The ſame effects hath <hi>melancholy</hi> ſtill
upon many <hi>Euthuſiaſtick</hi> tempers, on ſome of
which it prevails ſo far, as to fix thoſe impreſſions
on their minds, which never are worn off. And
though <hi>Job</hi> recover'd quickly by the exerciſe of
his Faculties, and the reaſon that God had given
him, and expreſſeth his expectation of a <hi>Future
Life,</hi> immediately after the paſſage of greateſt
doubt (<hi>All the days of my appointed time will I wait
till my change come</hi>) Yet thoſe whoſe principles are
faſtned only by their <hi>phancies,</hi> and the <hi>impulſe</hi> of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53432:152"/>
preſent belief, are in great danger to be <hi>loſt</hi> in ſuch
temptations.</p>
                        <p>Thus are ſome men diſpoſed to Infidelity by
their own <hi>Enthuſiaſms,</hi> and the ſame too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give occaſion to others to laugh at the belief
of a future Being, by repreſenting that ſtate in
various ſhapes, and under very odd diſguiſes.</p>
                        <p>I Am next to ſhew,</p>
                        <p>III. What the denial of a future Life <hi>infers,</hi>
in the <hi>reaſoning</hi> and <hi>conſequence</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>1. It follows hence, that man is but a <hi>better
beaſt;</hi> and thoſe Wits ſpeak agreeably to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that (whether in <hi>earneſt</hi> or in <hi>jeſt) Satyrize</hi>
humane nature, and repreſent us only as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a more cunning Herd of Cattle. For if
<hi>this Life</hi> be <hi>all,</hi> we have the ſame <hi>end</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi>
with the <hi>bruits;</hi> and they are <hi>happier</hi> of the two,
in that they have leſſer cares, and fewer diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
than we. Our <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi>
upon which we ſo much value our ſelves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this doctrine, are but <hi>chains</hi> of <hi>imaginations;</hi>
and <hi>thoſe</hi> but <hi>refined</hi> ſenſe: and ſo the <hi>ſoul</hi> and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of action, is no other in <hi>us,</hi> than it is in <hi>them;</hi>
and we differ but little more than one ſort of
Beaſts doth from another; namely, than the more
<hi>ſtupid</hi> doth from thoſe that are more <hi>ſprightly</hi> and
<hi>ſagacious.</hi> And then farewell the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53432:152"/>
                           <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>humane nature.</hi> Man is but a <hi>Beaſt</hi> of
<hi>prey,</hi> and his uſe of and dominion over the other
creatures, is but a <hi>proud uſurpation</hi> over his <hi>equals.</hi>
So that this opinion degrades our natures, and
affronts the whole race of mankind together.
And,</p>
                        <p>2. In the direct tendency of it, it deſtroyes
humane Societies; For thoſe cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Laws; nor Laws without ſome conſcience
of good and evil, nor would this ſignifie to any
great purpoſe, without the belief of another
world. Take away this, and every thing will
be <hi>good</hi> that is <hi>profitable,</hi> and honeſt that condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to a mans deſigns. That would be <hi>mine</hi> that
I could get by <hi>force;</hi> and I had no <hi>right</hi> to any
thing longer than I had <hi>ſtrength</hi> to defend it: and
thus the world would be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of
<hi>war,</hi> and fall into endleſs confuſions and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
So that the whole Earth would quickly be
an <hi>Hell intolerable; every</hi> man would be a <hi>Devil</hi>
to <hi>another,</hi> yea and every man to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>3. It ſuppreſſeth mens private <hi>happineſs</hi> and
<hi>felicity;</hi> and even the <hi>Rioters</hi> of the world have
ſtings and torments from it. If a man live in
<hi>Senſuality</hi> and fulneſs of <hi>pleaſure,</hi> what a cutting
thought is it to conſider, that in a little time he
muſt bid adieu to <hi>this,</hi> and to <hi>all</hi> felicity for ever?
And if his life be in <hi>trouble</hi> and diſcomfort; how
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53432:153"/>
terrible is it to reflect, that he muſt go from being
<hi>miſerable</hi> to be <hi>nothing?</hi> How can thoſe think of
parting with their poſſeſſions and enjoyments,
that have <hi>nothing</hi> elſe to expect? or, how can
<hi>they</hi> bear up under the burdens and vexations of
<hi>this</hi> ſtate, that cannot relieve themſelves by the
hopes of a <hi>better?</hi> With what ſad pangs of ſorrow
ſhould we lay our Friends into the Grave; if we
had cauſe to be aſſured that they were <hi>loſt eternally?</hi>
and how could we reflect upon our own <hi>morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
if we were to look for no <hi>farther</hi> Being?
The pleaſures of the <hi>preſent</hi> Life are gone in a
moment, and leave nothing but dregs and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
behind them; and if there be no further
delights beſides theſe <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>fading</hi> ſatisfactions,
'tis not worth the while to live; but we had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to have been nothing for ever.</p>
                        <p>The ſumm is, The <hi>Sadducee</hi> vilifies Mankind,
deſtroyes the peace of Societies, and the happineſs
of every private perſon: and ſo profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the common enemy of <hi>men,</hi> and a <hi>Renegado</hi>
to humane nature.</p>
                        <p>IT will not be needful for me to ſay much in
<hi>Applying</hi> this Diſcourſe; Almoſt every Sermon
we hear, is an Application of it: for <hi>here</hi> is the
matter and ground of our hopes, and hence are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the great enforcements of our duty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="297" facs="tcp:53432:153"/>
I preſume there are few, or none, in this place,
but who are ready to profeſs their <hi>belief</hi> of a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Life,</hi> and (as I premiſed) I have not inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the proof, to perſwade <hi>You</hi> of this Article;
but to ſhew, that the confidence is groundleſs,
which affirms, <hi>There is no reaſon</hi> for the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of <hi>Religion;</hi> and to contribute ſomewhat
towards the ſettlement of the weak, againſt ſuch
temptations.</p>
                        <p>Now if we <hi>believe</hi> this great Truth, as we ſay;
Let us do it to purpoſe; and not content our
ſelves with a cold and cuſtomary aſſent, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to raiſe our Faith to ſuch an height, that
it may have an effectual influence upon our lives.
The general belief that education hath infuſed,
is but a <hi>dead image</hi> in the ſoul that produceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
Let us endeavour by fervent <hi>Prayer,</hi> and
frequent <hi>Meditation</hi> to invigorate and excite <hi>ours</hi> to
<hi>that degree;</hi> that it may be a <hi>living repreſentation</hi> of
eternal things; that our Faith may be the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
and <hi>preſence</hi> of the <hi>inviſible</hi> world. The
<hi>ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> the <hi>evidence of things</hi> not
ſeen, Heb. 11. That we may have ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of it, as if the proſpect were open,
and our eyes beheld it; that we may fix our
thoughts there, and fill up our ſouls with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of that world.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Such</hi> a Faith as <hi>this,</hi> ought to be our aim; and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53432:154"/>
if we did <hi>ſo</hi> believe the other world; what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
what heroical, what happy perſons ſhould
we be in this? Such a Faith would ſecure us from
the flatteries and temptations of this ſenſual life;
and excite us to more earneſt longings, and more
vigorous endeavours after the happineſs of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
It would inable us to deſpiſe this vain world in
compariſon; and to bear all the croſſes of it, with
magnanimity and ſteadineſs of mind: It would
quiet our ſolicitudes, and anſwer the objections
againſt providence, and the preſent unequal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution
of good and evil. It would make the
moſt difficult ſervices of Religion eaſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to us; and fill our lives with ſweet hope,
and delights infinitely more agreeable than the
moſt reliſhing ſenſual joys: It would afford us
ſatisfaction, amid our diſappointments; and reſt
amid our anxieties and cares: It would raiſe
our deſigns and thoughts to things generous and
noble, and make us live like the Inhabitants of an
Heavenly Countrey.</p>
                        <p>Such bleſſed effects as <hi>theſe</hi> follow <hi>this</hi> Faith
<hi>here;</hi> and unmeaſurably, unſpeakably <hi>greater</hi> in the
other world; the viſion of God, and full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of His love; the perfection of our natures, and
the compleatment of our happineſs; in the arms
of our Redeemer, and amidſt the triumphant Songs
of Angels and Saints; in the exerciſe of holy love,

admiration and praiſe: Things too great to be
expreſt, or to be imagin'd, <hi>For eye hath not ſeen, nor

what God hath reſerved for thoſe that love him:</hi>
To Him be all Glory, and humble Adoration

                        <p>ALthough it might be well expected that
the Laws of God ſhould abundantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
by vertue of His <hi>Authority,</hi> and their

<hi>ſtupidity</hi> and <hi>perverſeneſs</hi> of men, that <hi>theſe alone</hi> have
not (uſually) any conſiderable effect upon us:
And therefore God who earneſtly deſires our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,

<hi>rewards</hi> on the one hand, and moſt terrible <hi>Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>

took no notice of thoſe ſins (in compariſon)
He was not ſo much offended and diſpleaſed,
but conſider'd the general ignorance, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Saviour ſaid with reference to the Jews, <hi>Joh.
15. 22. If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they
had not had ſin;</hi> Their ſin had not been ſo great,

upon them with ſuch ſeverity of condemnation.
But <hi>now</hi> that the <hi>Light hath ſhined in darkneſs,</hi> the
<hi>true Light that enlightens every one that cometh into the
world; Now</hi> ſince the <hi>Son of God is made manifeſt,</hi>
to <hi>deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> and to turn men

<hi>Truth:</hi> The plea of ignorance will no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
or extenuate, but God commands all men

<q>—He hath appointed a day—</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In which words we have theſe things,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53432:157"/>
(1.) <hi>The Declaration of a future Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Becauſe he hath appointed a day, in which he will
judge—</p>
                        <p>(2.) The <hi>univerſality</hi> of the ſubject to be Judg'd,
<hi>the World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3.) The Perſon that is to be the judge;—
<hi>The man whom He hath ordained.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(4.) <hi>The rule and manner of Judgement,</hi>
He will Judge the World in Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>I Begin in order with the <hi>Decree</hi> of a future
Judgement. Of this the Heathens had ſome
obſcure notions, as appears among other things,
by the ſtories of their fam'd Judges, that were to
call men to account in the other world. But
theſe were but <hi>glimmering</hi> apprehenſions: 'Tis
the Goſpel hath brought to light the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of a coming Judgement, in the ſolemnity
and circumſtances of it.</p>
                        <p>This hath declared, That there is to be a
<hi>Judgement Day,</hi> Matth. 10. 15. Jude 6. That
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is to be the <hi>Judge of the quick and the dead,</hi>
Acts 10. 42. That he ſhall be <hi>revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.
8. That he ſhall come <hi>with ten thouſand of his Saints,</hi>
Jude 14. That he ſhall judge the <hi>ſecrets of men
according to the Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 2. 16. That the
<hi>Dead</hi> ſhall be all raiſed by a General ſummons,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53432:158"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. and all ſhall be judg'd <hi>according to
their works,</hi> Rev. 20. 13. The <hi>juſt</hi> to eternal <hi>life,</hi>
and the <hi>wicked</hi> to everlaſting <hi>puniſhment,</hi> Matth.
25. 46.</p>
                        <p>So that the belief of a Judgement Day, is no
<hi>panick fear</hi> or <hi>melancholy dream:</hi> 'Tis no <hi>trick</hi> of
<hi>Politicians,</hi> or <hi>Mormo</hi> of Prieſts to fright <hi>fools</hi> and
keep the world in <hi>awe,</hi> but a <hi>Truth</hi> as certain and
undoubted as the Oracles of <hi>Truth</hi> can make it:
'Tis plainly declar'd in the moſt infallible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
yea, 'tis engraven on the minds of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
mankind, who all expect a call to a future
Judgement.</p>
                        <p>There is therefore no need of further proof of
ſo clear and ſo acknowledg'd an Article; But
it may be worth our while to conſider what may
be the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this appointment of a Judgement
Day. And the ſame will ſerve as Arguments to
confirm and enforce our Faith in it.</p>
                        <p>(1.) Then, 'Tis reaſonable and fit there ſhould
be a General Judgement, that <hi>Religion may be vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
and cleared.</hi> The Goſpel was of old to the
Jews a <hi>ſtumbling-block,</hi> and to the <hi>Greeks, fooliſhneſs,</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 23. and we know, by ſad experience,
how in latter days, Religion is expos'd and
ſcorn'd. It is made ridiculous by ſome, and laugh'd
at by others; and which do it the greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
Thoſe that put it into contemptible cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53432:158"/>
or thoſe that pour direct contempt upon it,
is not our preſent buſineſs to conjecture. This
is certain, that there is nothing hath been pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſo many vile actions and deſigns; Nothing
in which mankind have been, in any compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſo out of their wits, as in what they have
abuſively call'd by this Sacred Name. Religion!
we have ſeen it <hi>dy'd</hi> with humane blood, and
ſwoln with ſpoil and rapine: written on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
of tyrannies and uſurpations, and pleaded as
the CAUSE, the CAUSE of proſperous Villanies.
Divided into Atoms of Sects, and diſputed into
Air of opinions: Entitled to all the vanities of
ſick imagination, and claim'd by all the follies of
zealous ignorance.</p>
                        <p>And is it not reaſonable there ſhould be a time,
wherein this over-caſt, this clouded light ſhould
brighten like the Sun at noon; and diſpel thoſe
ſpots and that ſcumm, which ſuperſtition, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and hypocriſie have faſtned upon its
glorious Face? Is it not fit that the Goſpel ſhould
at length appear to have been the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
and no <hi>creature</hi> of <hi>melancholy</hi> or <hi>deſign?</hi> Ought
it not to be at laſt confeſt and known, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was a great <hi>Reality,</hi> and no <hi>cunningly deviſed
Fable?</hi> No dream of imagination, or intereſt
of any luſt; but as ſimple as Innocence, and as
clear as the virgin light? And it will be ſo in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53432:159"/>
the coming day, when the light of the other
World hath ſhone in upon the darkneſs of
this.</p>
                        <p>In ſumm, 'Tis juſt to expect that Religion will
be gloriouſly celebrated and cleared, and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe it will be done by the ſolemnity of
a Judgement day.</p>
                        <p>(2.) A Future Judgement is ordain'd, That
<hi>Providence may be unridled and abſolv'd.</hi> The <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of God are a <hi>great Deep,</hi> Pſal. 36. 6. and
His <hi>ways paſt finding out,</hi> Rom. 11. 33. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Providence are full of Myſtery and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders,
as dark as the midnights of <hi>December,</hi>
and as crooked as the paths of the Deſart. All
the Lines of our ſpinning, all our obſervations
and reaſonings are too ſhort to lead us to and fro
the Labyrinth. The world is govern'd by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
methods that are beyond our moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
knowledge. How are we puzzl'd when
we undertake to gloſs on Providence, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to give the reaſons of its moſt ordinary
managements! The wicked lift up their
heads againſt Heaven and proſper; and the juſt
bow the knee; lifting up their hands unto it, and
are undone: Folly ſucceeds, and is applauded, and
Wiſdom is diſappointed and contemn'd; Clouds
and thick darkneſs encompaſs the devout, and a
warm Sun ſhines upon him that ſacrificeth not
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53432:159"/>
(<hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 15.) And when vice thrives, and
folly triumphs, Providence is pleaded to credit
ignorance and impiety, and the ſucceſs of the
actions vouches for the goodneſs of the Cauſe.
God is thought to have <hi>own'd</hi> what, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
reaſons, he hath <hi>permitted,</hi> and to have
<hi>acted that,</hi> which in judgement he hath <hi>ſuffer'd.</hi>
On the other hand, the beſt Deſigns are thought
<hi>wicked</hi> when they prove <hi>unproſperous,</hi> and the
<hi>whiteſt</hi> Innocence marked with <hi>black</hi> characters,
when the cloud is upon it. Thus <hi>Shimei</hi> accuſed
<hi>David</hi> for a man of blood, becauſe of the evils of
his Houſe, 2 Sam. 16. 7. And <hi>Job</hi> was concluded
as great an inſtance of ſin, as he was of miſery,
<hi>Job</hi> 4. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> inferr'd from the <hi>Viper,</hi>
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Murderer,</hi> Acts 28. 3, 4. And
the unbelieving world from the <hi>Croſs,</hi> that the <hi>Holy
Jeſus</hi> was a Malefactor.</p>
                        <p>Thus do men ſhoot one another out of this
crooked bow, and judge the goodneſs and badneſs
of things by <hi>ſucceſſes,</hi> not by <hi>Rules;</hi> and thereby
traduce and abuſe Providence by making it
ſpeak the language of their affections, and their
Intereſts, and ſerve the ends of malice, and Self-love.</p>
                        <p>Which things being ſo in the preſent world,
it is fit that, at laſt, <hi>Providence</hi> ſhould be diſintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
and abſolv'd, that all the world may ſee
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53432:160"/>
the <hi>living creatures</hi> in the <hi>Wheels,</hi> Ezek. 1. 20. and
the eye that is in the Scepter, as the <hi>Aegyptian Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks</hi>
repreſented Providence. That we may at
length underſtand, that its <hi>ways are equal,</hi> Ezek.
18. 25. and that all the ſeeming inequalities
prove the ſhortneſs of our Reaſonings, not the
unevenneſs of its managements; that its <hi>ſtrangeſt,</hi>
and leaſt accountable iſſues were the Reſults
of Counſel, and govern'd by an infinitely wiſe
mind that ſhoots it ſelf through all things. That
we may underſtand the difference between <hi>good</hi>
and <hi>proſperous;</hi> and the reaſon of the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs.</hi> Why the <hi>fire</hi> out of
the <hi>Bramble</hi> is permitted to <hi>devour the Cedar;</hi> and
the <hi>deſert</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> is ſo often the <hi>lot</hi> of the
<hi>juſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe expectations are reaſonable, and in a
manner neceſſary; that mankind may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the events below were not <hi>Lotteries,</hi> but
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> full of Providence; and that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
acted by an infinite Wiſdom, Juſtice, and
Goodneſs. That wickedneſs ſhall, at <hi>laſt,</hi> reap
the miſery it hath ſown, and dwell in the flames it
hath kindled: And afflicted Vertue lift up its head
to receive the Crown and the Glories that are the
rewards of its patience: and appear to have ſhot
it ſelf up in <hi>another</hi> world, when it was depreſt in
<hi>this.</hi> And ſo all ſhall <hi>know that there was a God that
judged in the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 58. 11.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="311" facs="tcp:53432:160"/>
And this is another reaſonable account of the
appointment of a Future Judgement.</p>
                        <p>(3.) We may ſuppoſe it to be ordain'd for
<hi>this</hi> alſo, <hi>That ſecret wickedneſs may be diſclos'd,
and ſhamed.</hi> The Heart of man is as <hi>deep waters,</hi>
hath a ſmooth ſurface, but is full of rocks and
quickſands at the bottom. The world is a
Theatre, and the greateſt part of men are but
Actors: For as <hi>They</hi> cloathe themſelves with Gold
and Purple, and put on great names, and are fine
things upon the Stage, when behind the Curtain
and in their retiremen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s, they are but common
men, and like their ordinary Spectators: Thus
we dreſs our ſelves for publique converſes, ſet
our looks, and gild our language, and put on
the Livery of Wiſdom and Saintſhip, and appear
what we would be <hi>thought,</hi> not what we <hi>are:</hi>
But in our privacies, and more familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations,
in the looſe and unconſtrain'd order
of our words, and our actions, we are quite
another thing; we are fooliſh and frivolous,
froward and impatient, ſordid and abſurd: And
in the ſecret Chambers of our ſouls we are
worſe. The faireſt face would affright us, if
the skin were taken off it, and ſhew us nothing
but ghaſtlineſs and deformity: And it would
amaze us to ſee the <hi>In ſides</hi> of thoſe, whoſe <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
appearance is fair and plauſible. We now
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53432:161"/>
ſeek coverings for our ſhame, and hide our follies
and imperfections under handſome names, devout
ſhews, and fair pretenſions; or excuſe them by
<hi>Neceſſity, Temptation,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>Providence.</hi> And
though we ſee much ſin and vileneſs aſſoon as we
open our eyes, and look out of doors: Yet
there is another and a worſe world of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſhut up from our ſight, and hid in its own
darkneſs; in cloſe deſigns and private actions;
in the corners of the heart, and receſſes of thoughts:
Theſe make up a dark Region cover'd with fear
and ſhame, and the ſhadows of death; open only
to Him to whom all things are ſo, and midnight
is as bright as noon, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 12.) And he
will provide that ſo it ſhall be to all the world; that
all ſin may be as odious, as it is ugly; and unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
impiety may not ſtill lie hid in the ſecrecie
and ſilence it hath ſought: But that its whiſpers
may be proclaim'd by a voice more loud than
Thunder; and its conceal'd deformities be brought
into the open day: That thoſe hidden iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which hitherto have eſcap'd, may be whipt
with the ſcorpions of guilt and ſhame; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
purity and patience may appear in their Glory
and proper luſtre.</p>
                        <p>And for this Reaſon alſo God hath appointed
a Day wherein He will <hi>Judge the ſecrets of men:</hi>
That ſin may not be the more ſecure, for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53432:161"/>
being cloſe; But that it may be feared and
ſhunn'd in Grots, as well as in moſt publique
places.</p>
                        <p>And I may add, That thoſe actions of vertue
that no eye ſees, but that which ſees all things, and
thoſe unknown tendencies and anhelations of
divine ſouls after the adorable object of their
Love, may be ſolemnly celebrated and rewarded.
Again,</p>
                        <p>(4.) Such a Day is fit and is appointed, <hi>that all
rights and claims may be determined.</hi> The great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
are, <hi>which,</hi> and <hi>where is the True Church
and Religion.</hi> And if we attend to the Zeal, and
the confidence, the loud talk, and bold claims of
each of the pretenders, All are in the truth, and
All miſtaken: Every Sect is in the right, if it
may be judg'd by the fondneſs of its own aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and every one is out, by the ſentence of
all the reſt: Here's Religion, ſayes one; Nay,
but it's here, ſayes the next; and a <hi>third</hi> gives the
Lie to them both; And then they ſcuffle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
till they have talk'd themſelves out of ſenſe,
out of charity, and out of breath: And when
they would ſay on, but know not what; when
their paſſions are rais'd, but their Reaſons loſt;
<hi>They</hi> fall to pelt each other with hard names;
<hi>They</hi> ſquabble, and ſtrive, and damn one another by
turns; <hi>They</hi> gather parties to help up the Cry,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53432:162"/>
and fill all places with the noiſe of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and triumph and crow after a conqueſt in
Imagination: And after all this buſtle, and all
this ado, <hi>They</hi> ſit down where they begun; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is gain'd on either ſide, but an addition of
malice and bitter zeal, more rancour, and
more damning ſentences, while they are, for the
moſt part, as far from <hi>Truth</hi> as from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>This is the ſtate of the contending world, nor
can we expect it ſhould be otherwiſe, while Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Malice, Intereſt and Paſſion inſpire
the quarrels. Or, if Controverſies ſhould be
ended, the Vote would, doubtleſs, be caſt on
the ſide of Folly and Falſhood, for their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are moſt numerous, and moſt loud; while
the friends of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are meek and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
thinly ſcatter'd among the Herd, and ſtill
liable to be over-born, and out-nois'd by the
Tumult.</p>
                        <p>But the coming Day will ſet all right, and
effectually reſolve <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>What is
Truth?</hi> And then no doubt, The meek and the
peaceable, the charitable and the juſt, who did
not diſpute, but live; who were not ſwoln with
rage and notions, but big of Charity, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
kindneſs for mankind: Then ſhall <hi>Theſe</hi>
be declar'd the rightful Heirs of the Kingdom,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53432:162"/>
when the preſumed Sons of it, who hugg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as the only favourites of Heaven, and
warm'd their hands by their own fantaſtick Fires,
who flew aloft on the wings of Imagination,
and proudly look'd down upon the modeſt and
humble Believer; who were full of myſterie
and rapture, ſcorn and talk, but void of juſtice,
modeſty and love: <hi>Theſe,</hi> we have reaſon to
think, ſhall then be caſt out, and receive their
portion with the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> to the ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
of their confidence, and their
hopes.</p>
                        <p>In this Day ſhall the Errours, and the follies
that were recommended to the deceiv'd embraces
of the Sons of men, by frauds, and Art, paint, and
meretricious bravery, be expos'd in their naked
Deformities to the ſight and contempt of all the
world: And that <hi>Truth,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Vertues</hi> that
were perſecuted into Corners, and cover'd
with duſt and ſhame; torn piece-meal by wrath
and ignorance, and ſcatter'd up and down in the
Tents of Errour, ſhall then be brought into the
Light, and cleanſed from all debaſing mixtures,
and repreſented in their native lovelineſs and
beauty, that they may receive the praiſes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of their ancient friends, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
Yea, and the acknowledgements of their
now bluſhing and confounded enemies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="316" facs="tcp:53432:163"/>
Upon the whole we ſee, That the Faith of a
Future Judgement is not miſbecoming the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Sons of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but is infinitely
agreeable to the faculties of men, and the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of things.</p>
                        <p>I Come now to the SECOND main thing in the
Text,</p>
                        <p>II. The <hi>Univerſality</hi> of the Subject to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the <hi>World,</hi> ſo it is here; And the Scripture
elſewhere expreſſeth it in very general terms:
The <hi>ſecrets of men,</hi> Rom. 2. 16. <hi>Every man,</hi> Rev.
20. 13. The <hi>Dead, ſmall</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> Rev. 20. 12.
<hi>The quick and the dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 5.</p>
                        <p>Now I ſhall conſider the <hi>Univerſality</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Judgement in two great ſolemnities of it:
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>General Summons,</hi> and the <hi>General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
that follows: both mentioned together,
1 Cor. 15. 52. <hi>The trumpet ſhall ſound, and the Dead
ſhall be raiſed</hi>—</p>
                        <p>1. The <hi>Trumpet;</hi> either ſome divine univerſal
<hi>vertue;</hi> or the voice of ſome mighty <hi>Angel,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Ariſe ye Dead,</hi> and <hi>come to Judgement.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I hear that voice; 'tis full of Majeſty and
terrour; 'tis more loud than Fame, and more
general than the Light of Heaven. 'Tis heard at
both the Poles; in the Earth, and Sea, and Air,
and all Deep places.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Attend, Attend,</hi> Ye Sons of <hi>Adam!</hi> Ye that are
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53432:163"/>
afar off, and ye that are near; Ye that begun
with the Infant World, and ye that liv'd in its lateſt
Periods; Ye that freeze under the uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
North, and ye that are hid under the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
South; Ye that dwell in the temperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions;
and ye that are ſcorch'd with the heats of the
Line; Ye that only cry'd, and ceas'd to breathe;
and ye that went ſlowly and late to the Grave;
Ye that are yet alive, and ye that have been Ages
under ground.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hearken, Hearken</hi> to the Proclamation of the
great <hi>King,</hi> the Prince of Glory, the Judge of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men: The <hi>Day,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> of vengeance
and recompence is come, the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Terrours</hi>
and of <hi>Triumphs.</hi> The night is paſt: Ariſe ye
dead, ceaſe ſleeping in the Grave; Put on our
bodies, gather up your ſcatter'd parts, ſummon
your thoughts together, and make up your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.
The Tribunal is ſet, the Judge is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
And ye living Inhabitants, lay by your
deſigns, let fall your Traffique; quit your
pleaſures and purſuits; the time for theſe is
done, <hi>for ever</hi> done; Eternity is in view; Trim
your Lamps, the Bridegroom is at the door.</p>
                        <p>2. And now the General <hi>Reſurrection</hi> follows.
Behold the cloſeſt Vaults throw away their cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and diſcloſe the proud Families that lay hid
in that ſtately darkneſs: See how the looſe Earth
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53432:164"/>
moves about the Cloyſters of the Dead, and the
Grave opens all its doors to enlarge its Priſoners:
And lo, a numerous people riſeth from under
ground to attend the great Aſſize of Angels and
men! They ariſe, but are not yet alive; Death
ſits upon their faces clad in dread and paleneſs.
They loſe that motion with aſtoniſhment which
they gained with their reſtored parts; and are
ready to be ſhaken into their former duſt, by
the fear that hath ſeized their unſettled joynts:
<hi>They</hi> wonder at the Light, and at themſelves;
and are ready to drop back into the Graves, from
which they juſt peep'd out.</p>
                        <p>See here the <hi>mighty</hi> ſits trembling by his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
unconcern'd at the vain Epithets it gave to
his flatter'd Memory; and the <hi>delicate</hi> ſighs with
his firſt breath, willing to return to darkneſs, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs,
and worms; rather than to the light that
will diſcover the guilt, and the follies of a Life of
vanity and ſin. The <hi>Hypocrite</hi> droops to conſider
that his painting and his ſhame are to be brought
out of the night and ſilence of the Grave, into a
naked, and open day; and the <hi>vitious dies again</hi>
to think, That he hath taken up his body from
one Death to carry it to another, and a worſe.
Thus the world of the <hi>wicked</hi> ſhall all appear,
and all be concern'd in the Judgement that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="319" facs="tcp:53432:164"/>
The <hi>Righteous</hi> ſhall riſe alſo, They awake with
vigour in their ſouls, and life in their eyes; with
gayety in their looks, and tranſports in all their
powers. Their new warm'd blood moves plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
in its ancient chanels; and the reſtored
ſpirits dance in the renewed veins. They are
glad to meet the old companion of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and their miſeries, rejoycing at its reſcue from
the infamous diſhonours of corruption, and that
'tis ready to paſs with them into the promiſed
and long expected Glories.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the <hi>Firſt-fruits,</hi> and the full <hi>Crop</hi> is
near, and their <hi>joy is beyond the joy of Harveſt;</hi> and
we muſt leave the degree to be <hi>imagin'd,</hi> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>expreſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus the univerſal World both of the <hi>wicked</hi>
and the <hi>righteous</hi> ſhall appear on the Solemn
Summons.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and
<hi>Hell</hi> ſhall give up their Dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13. And
ſo <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and all the Ancient
Sages, with their Sons, and Nephews to the lateſt
Poſterity, ſhall ſtand up together before the
Judgement Seat: for all are ſubjects of the ſame
general Empire, and all are accountable for their
Actions to the ſame Soveraign Judge: And
He is the <hi>Man whom God hath ordain'd to judge
the world in Righteouſneſs.</hi> And this is the next
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53432:165"/>
thing in the Text to be conſider'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>III. The perſon appointed, The <hi>Man whom he
hath ordain'd:</hi> And this is the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> even
the <hi>Man,</hi> who being <hi>in the form of God, thought it no
robberry to be equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2. 6. The ſame is
He who is ordain'd of God to be the <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>the
quick</hi> and <hi>the dead,</hi> Act. 10. 42.</p>
                        <p>And now under this Head I ſhall ſhew how <hi>fit</hi>
he is, as <hi>man,</hi> for this great and ſolemn office, in
theſe two particulars.</p>
                        <p>1. He is fit to be the General Judge, as Man,
becauſe he <hi>deſcended to the meanneſs of our condition.</hi>
'Tis but juſt that <hi>He,</hi> who laid by his ancient
Glory, and cloath'd himſelf in the Livery of
guilt and ſhame, ſhould re-aſſume that native
Majeſty and ſplendour in the face of univerſal
mankind: That <hi>He,</hi> who made an humble
ſtoop from the <hi>Throne</hi> to the <hi>Manger,</hi> from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>World,</hi> to the life of a mean ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
ſhould (at laſt) be illuſtriouſly advanc'd as
much <hi>above</hi> the heights of humane grandeurs, as
then he was <hi>below</hi> them.</p>
                        <p>'Tis fit that <hi>That Holy and Divine Perſon,</hi> who
was buffeted and affronted, condemned and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
by an abuſive and injurious world, ſhould
righteouſly judge his Judges. That <hi>Herod</hi> may
ſee that he perſecuted not the Infant King of a
little Province, but the Soveraign of Angels
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53432:165"/>
and men: And that <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi>
may be convinc'd that <hi>He</hi> whom they called
<hi>King in ſcorn,</hi> is <hi>really</hi> a <hi>greater</hi> Emperour than <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar:</hi>
And that <hi>thoſe</hi> who were <hi>ſcandal'd</hi> at the
<hi>Croſs,</hi> and a verſe to the belief of an <hi>humble</hi> Saviour,
may ſee the ſhame and confutation of their Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and their Folly; in the exaltation of the
<hi>Holy Jeſus</hi> above all the poſſibilities of worldly
glory. Upon this account 'tis reaſonable and
becoming that the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhould be the
<hi>Judge.</hi> And it is ſo upon another, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Becauſe <hi>He contracted an alliance with our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
and <hi>experimentally knows and felt the Infirmities of
our ſtate.</hi> If the Supream naked Deity ſhould judge
us <hi>immediately,</hi> we ſhould be confunded and aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
at the Mjaeſty of his preſence, &amp; his greatneſs
would make us afraid. For who can bear that <hi>daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling</hi>
Glory? who can ſtand before a Throne ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with incomprehenſible Light and Flame?
This Glory is therefore <hi>allay'd</hi> by the interpoſal of
humane nature; and this Light wears a veil upon
it to encourage our approaches. Yea, 'tis our <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and our <hi>Friend</hi> that <hi>loved</hi> us, and <hi>dyed</hi> for us, who
is the man ordain'd to be our Judge. He hath the
<hi>ſame compaſſion,</hi> as when he <hi>wept</hi> over an obſtinate
City, and the <hi>ſame love,</hi> as when he <hi>bled</hi> and <hi>dyed</hi> for
a rebellious World. He knows the ſtrength of our
temptations, and the weakneſs of our natures, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53432:166"/>
will make abatements for them. So that the faithful
may hearfully appear before his Throne, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their ſins, and relying upon his Love. He that
loved us, and was like us, is to take our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.
'Tis our <hi>Redeemer</hi> is to be our <hi>Judge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus may <hi>believing Penitents</hi> incourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before him, and hold up their heads in
that Day of terrours, as much reviv'd by the
apprehenſion of his humanity and meekneſs; as
the <hi>wicked</hi> will be dejected by the knowledge of
his greatneſs and power.</p>
                        <p>And for this cauſe alſo, 'tis congruous and fit
that the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhould be Judge, when
<hi>mankind</hi> is at the Bar.</p>
                        <p>I Come now to the IV. General to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
—<hi>He will judge the World in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>
—viz. (1.) By a <hi>Rule:</hi> Not by unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<hi>humour,</hi> or arbitrary <hi>Will;</hi> Not by hidden
<hi>Decrees,</hi> or ſecret ſcrowls of <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> But by
thoſe <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>open Records</hi> that are in our Houſes,
and our Hands; that are Preached in Publique
places, and declar'd in a language we underſtand.
<hi>The Books ſhall be opened,</hi> Rev. 20. 12. and the Books
the Rules of Righteouſneſs, are the <hi>Law</hi> and the
<hi>Goſpel.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> ſtrictly requires <hi>perfect</hi> obedience,
the <hi>other</hi> accepts of <hi>ſincere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now while our actions are tried by the <hi>Law,</hi> and
meaſured by <hi>its Righteouſneſs,</hi> our ſtraighteſt Lines
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53432:166"/>
are crooked and uneven, and our greateſt ſervices
are very ſcant and defective. The beſt are like
the duſt in the Ballance, and the reſt are lighter
than Vanity. For as Magnifying Glaſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
roughneſs, and a ragged ſurface in the beſt
poliſh'd Marble; So this Glaſs of the Law diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
wrinkles and deformity in the faireſt and
moſt even vertue. And while mens lives and
actions are compared with <hi>this Rule,</hi> all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is diſtreſt, and a cloud hangs upon the brow
of the moſt religious and moſt innocent. The
Law concludes all men under ſin, and ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wrath: So that by this all the world is caſt;
and were happineſs to be had upon no other
terms, <hi>ſtrait</hi> would be the <hi>Gate indeed,</hi> and <hi>ſo narrow</hi>
the way, that none would find it. And while
no other Book than this is opened, all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of men fall proſtrate before the <hi>Throne,</hi>
condemn'd by the Law, and by themſelves.
Nothing is to be heard but an univerſal groan, and
the ſuppliant cry of <hi>Mercy, Mercy</hi> Lord!</p>
                        <p>When loe! the <hi>other Book</hi> is opened, and
out of it is read <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and multiplyed
<hi>Pardons</hi> to all the followers of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> who
have believ'd in the Crucified <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and teſtified
that Faith by their Repentance, and ſincere
obedience: But <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and new
<hi>confuſions; Death, Horrour,</hi> and everlaſting <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>
                           <pb n="324" facs="tcp:53432:167"/>
from the preſence of God and of his
Chriſt, to all the ſtubborn rejecters of His Grace,
who would not have him to Rule over them,
nor accept of His offer'd Salvation. Theſe are
the Declarations of this Book, and <hi>theſe</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of <hi>that Righteouſneſs</hi> whereby we are to be
judg'd: As the Judge himſelf hath told us,
<hi>John 12. 48. The words</hi> that he <hi>ſpake, the ſame
ſhall Judge us in the laſt day.</hi> And God will judge
the <hi>ſecrets of men,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, according to my
Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 2. So that <hi>believing Penitents</hi> that
are <hi>not perfect</hi> according to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> may
plead their <hi>ſincerity,</hi> their <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and
<hi>new obedience,</hi> which is their <hi>perfection</hi> according
to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Pardon:</hi> And this will be accepted
by the Judge with a gracious Air, and the ſweet
reviving voice of, <hi>Well done ye good and faithful
Servants.</hi> He invites them to Him with the
voice of pity and endearment, and raviſheth their
ſouls with the pleaſant ſound of <hi>Come ye bleſſed of
my Father,</hi> Matth. 25. 34. O the <hi>Ecſtaſies</hi> that
are in <hi>that</hi> Sentence! O the <hi>killing harmony</hi> of <hi>that</hi>
voice! Can a <hi>Finite</hi> ſpirit bear <hi>ſuch exceſs?</hi> The
pleaſures of Eternity crouded into a moment:
Did unfaln Angels ever know <hi>ſuch another?</hi> or can
there be <hi>more</hi> tranſport in ten thouſand Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs?
Certainly, the boundleſs imagination it
ſelf cannot form an Idea of that rapture, nor the
Tongue of a Cherub expreſs it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="325" facs="tcp:53432:167"/>
The ſumm is, The World ſhall be judg'd
in <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> viz. according to a <hi>Rule,</hi> and not
by <hi>meer power</hi> and <hi>will: A Rule!</hi> not the <hi>ſtrict</hi> and
<hi>ſevere</hi> one of the <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi>
one of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> whoſe Righteouſneſs is
<hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>ſincere obedience,</hi> which in the Great
Day ſhall be accepted, and gloriouſly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>2. God will judge the World in <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi>
viz. with <hi>impartial equity.</hi> To evidence this,
let us conſider the Judge in the three great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of his WISDOM, JUSTICE, and
POWER.</p>
                        <p>1. He is <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and cannot be abuſed by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
nor miſtaken in Law; cannot be impoſed
on by falſe allegations, nor cozened by fair
pretenſions: He intimately underſtands the
<hi>Fact,</hi> and the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and cannot be deceived by
malice of enemies, nor ſubtilty of excuſes.</p>
                        <p>2. He is <hi>Juſt,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> A <hi>pure</hi> Mind,
without <hi>intereſt,</hi> or <hi>affection.</hi> He cannot be <hi>aw'd
by greatneſs,</hi> nor ſway'd by partiality, and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
All mankind are equally diſtant from
Him, and all ſtand upon a Level before Him.
He that beggs in Raggs, and weeps in the
Corners of the Streets, ſhall be heard aſſoon as
the proud Gallant that lives in Luxury, and Pomp.
He that tugg'd at the Oar, aſſoon as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53432:168"/>
of Legions: And the poor fellow that
follow'd the Plough, ſhall have as much right
done him, as the mighty that ſate upon the
<hi>Throne.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. He is <hi>powerful. All power is in his hands,
both in Heaven and on Earth,</hi> Mat. 28. 18. So that
he can execute his Sentence without reſiſtance
or poſſibility of reſcue. There is no getting out
of <hi>His</hi> reach, who holds the World in the <hi>hollow
of his Hand.</hi> There is no oppoſing of his power,
except we had an <hi>Arm like God, and could Thunder
like Him.</hi> There is no quitting His Dominions,
for his Rule, and His Preſence are univerſal.
The frozen North, and the fartheſt South; the
Deſart and the Ocean, are all within the bounds
of His Empire, and His Influence. Yea, could
we climb up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> that is <hi>His;</hi> deſcend
we to the <hi>Centre,</hi> He is <hi>there;</hi> or if even as far
as <hi>Hell,</hi> His power reacheth <hi>thither</hi> alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
139. 8.</p>
                        <p>In ſumm, The Judge cannot be <hi>deceiv'd, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi>
or <hi>over-powered,</hi> and therefore on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
likewiſe He will <hi>judge</hi> the World in <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HAving thus ſpoken to the main parts of the
Text, I deſcend to enforce all, by ſome
<hi>Practical improvement.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="327" facs="tcp:53432:168"/>
If then there be an <hi>appointed Day</hi> for ſo <hi>univerſal</hi>
and <hi>righteous</hi> a <hi>Judgement,</hi> by ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> a
<hi>Judge,</hi> Let us conſider,</p>
                        <p>(1.) How <hi>paſſionately,</hi> and <hi>differently</hi> mankind
will be concern'd at that time. Of this ſomething
hath been ſaid before, but I ſhall now diſcourſe
the matter a little further, and endeavour to
give you <hi>ſome</hi> deſcription of the <hi>Terrours</hi> of the
<hi>wicked,</hi> and the <hi>Raptures</hi> of the <hi>Juſt</hi> at that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity:
Though all that can be ſaid will be
very ſhort of the Paſſions of that Day.</p>
                        <p>And (1.) How will the <hi>careleſs</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi>
world be <hi>appall'd</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſh'd</hi> at that unlook'd
for Summons! How will the dark Gentiles,
that never heard of ſuch a Day; and the harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Infidels that heard, but did not believe; and
the diſſolute ſpirit that heard, and believ'd but
did not conſider, how will they tremble and
be confounded at the dread preparations of that
Day!</p>
                        <p>Methinks I ſee the <hi>pale looks,</hi> and the <hi>ſhivering mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
the <hi>gazing</hi> eye and <hi>liſtening</hi> ear, the <hi>diſtracted</hi> face
and <hi>trembling</hi> hand of the moſt proud and daring
ſinner. The <hi>Drunkard</hi> lets fall his Cup, and the buſie
<hi>worldling</hi> ſtands at gaze, the <hi>loud companions</hi> are huſh'd
into ſilence, and the <hi>merry Droll</hi> into a careful look.
The <hi>Atheiſt</hi> hides his head, and the <hi>ſleepy Sot ſtarts</hi> up
into anxious wonder.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="328" facs="tcp:53432:169"/>
And after this firſt amazement, See how the
trembling-multitude run diſtracted up and down,
Some into corners to cover, others into companies
to conſult: Every man asks his Neighbour, what
is to be done? and he again repeats the queſtion
to every one that is next unto him: The <hi>Son</hi>
runs to his amazed <hi>Father,</hi> who needs the advice his
dear child ſeeks; and the <hi>Wife</hi> claſps about her
aſtoniſh'd <hi>Husband,</hi> that is as helpleſs as his
frighted Conſort. The <hi>Publican</hi> beggs counſel
of the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and <hi>he,</hi> poor ſoul, is as much at a
loſs as the Reprobate.</p>
                        <p>They all Court the Mountains to cover them,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16. and ſhuffle into Caverns to hide
from the preſence of the Judge. But alas! they
quickly ſee the vanity of thoſe naked retreats, and
find themſelves as much expos'd in the cloſeſt
Vaults, as they would be in the body of the Sun.
Mountains are but Cobwebb coverings, and
Rocks and Earth but a Cypreſs veil. Hills,
Caves, and all are His, whom the frighted Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
would avoid, and <hi>will not, cannot</hi> conceal
His enemies from His eye, that ſtrikes through
the Earth as through a Globe of Cryſtal. What
ſhall they do then; whither ſhall they go? they
cannot <hi>bear</hi> His preſence, and they cannot <hi>avoid</hi>
it: the Light <hi>kills,</hi> and the darkneſs will not <hi>hide.</hi>
For the darkneſs is no darkneſs to this Judge;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53432:169"/>
                           <hi>The darkneſs and the day to Him are both alike,</hi> Pſal.
139. 12.</p>
                        <p>Thus will the wicked be confounded by the
coming of the great and terrible Day, and moſt
of all thoſe that liv'd under the plain and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
warnings of it. Had they never heard of
this ſolemn time, they would have been <hi>aſtoniſh'd</hi>
but not ſo much <hi>affrighted;</hi> It would have been
their <hi>wonder,</hi> but not <hi>ſo much</hi> their <hi>miſery.</hi> Had
they not been told of this great appearance, and
this Judge, they might have look'd on <hi>that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
without thoſe ſad degrees of dread, and ſuch
mortal ſhiverings, and hoped for great abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in conſideration of their fatal ignorance:
But alas, they were told of this Day <hi>earneſtly,</hi> and
<hi>often.</hi> The God of all the World, and this Judge of
all, acquainted them with this ſolemnity while
'twas future; And <hi>theſe</hi> Preachers that were moſt
infallible, and moſt urgent, preſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of
theſe things upon their Faith and affections with
all evidence and importunity, ſutableneſs of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
and accommodation to their Reaſon and
their Intereſt; with all the motives of hope and
fear, and all the alliciencies and incentives that
uſe to move reaſonable nature. They <hi>heard,</hi> but
did not <hi>heed,</hi> they <hi>heeded a little</hi> but <hi>forgot</hi> the next
moment; they <hi>aſſented,</hi> but <hi>ſlept,</hi> they were <hi>awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
but ſunk again into a <hi>careleſs ſlumber;</hi> they
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53432:170"/>
ſaid they <hi>believ'd,</hi> but were not <hi>concern'd; convinc'd
a little,</hi> but not <hi>perſwaded; Perſwaded,</hi> but not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd;
Reſolv'd,</hi> and preſently <hi>let out</hi> of mind what
they had concluded.</p>
                        <p>And now when the ſight of the Judgement
Day ſhall thorowly awaken them to conſider
thoſe invitations and warnings they had to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for it, what inward anguiſh will they feel at
the thoughts of their ſottiſhneſs and neglects?
And methinks I hear the ſinner thus inveighing
againſt himſelf:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Brutiſh Soul!</hi> Where was thy <hi>reaſon?</hi> where
was thy <hi>Self-love?</hi> where were thy <hi>reflections?</hi>
where was thy <hi>Providence?</hi> couldſt thou not look
beyond the grates of fleſh, or didſt thou <hi>ſee,</hi> and
wouldſt betray me into this danger and this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery?
wert thou diverted by <hi>greater</hi> matters? or hadſt
thou any thing of <hi>more neceſſity,</hi> or <hi>concernment</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
thy thoughts? was the ſordid fleſh a better
friend than <hi>that</hi> triumphant <hi>Jeſus?</hi> or the world an
enjoyment <hi>like</hi> thoſe rewards he will now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe?
were thy pleaſures comparable to the joyes
of the happy expectants of this <hi>Time?</hi> or thy little
policies of equal moment with the affairs of this
day? O how wild and abſurd are theſe queſtions
now! and why were they not alwayes ſuch in thy
eſteem? Yea, why didſt thou determine on the
<hi>unreaſonable</hi> ſide? what can the fondling fleſh,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53432:170"/>
and eht world do for thee? what reliſh now in
thoſe pleaſures that are gone out in ſtenchand
ſhame? What profit in thoſe deſigns whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are vaniſh'd with thy hopes? O how ſhall
I anſwer this Judge? what ſhall I ſay to the black
indictment that lies againſt me? why did I abuſe
his love, and reject his addreſſes? diſregard his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and ſlight his threatnings? throw off his
eaſie yoke, as an intolerable burthen, and chooſe
darkneſs, death and miſery before light, and life,
and glory? what can I ſay to my Judge? what to
my ſelf?</p>
                        <p>Cover me ſhame and bluſhing; yea let death hide
me, and everlaſting darkneſs caſt its covering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me; But death will not befriend one that hath
ſo ſad a reaſon to ſeek it; and darkneſs flies away
from <hi>yond</hi> glorious preſence. O the day that I
put <hi>far</hi> from me! and the danger that I would
not conſider! The <hi>wrath</hi> I have been <hi>treaſuring
up!</hi> and the evils that I fear'd, but would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to avoid! Theſe are come upon me;
Mercy is at an end; and pardon is no more; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
are in vain, and Prayers inſignificant; The
Judge is juſt and inexorable, not mov'd by fond
pity, nor weak affections; He will ſhew <hi>no more</hi>
favour to thoſe who ſo long have ſlighted it;
Nor will He have mercy upon them that would
have none upon themſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53432:171"/>
Such reflections of anguiſh and deſpair as <hi>theſe,</hi>
we may ſuppoſe the ſight of the Great Day will
occaſion in the wicked, and be the beginnings
to them of a ſad and intolerable Eternity.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, (2.) The <hi>Tranſports</hi> of the
<hi>faithful</hi> will be unſpeakable on that day; when
they ſhall exchange the doleful tone of <hi>How long!
how long, O Lord!</hi> for the pleaſant voice, <hi>He is come,
He is come.</hi> See now how the nimble ſpirits play
in the ſmiling eyes, that languiſh'd and droop'd
before; And all the lovers of the <hi>Holy Jeſus</hi> awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into chearfulneſs and vigour. Joy warms
the cold and liveleſs blood, and ſends it about
with a pleaſant thrill through all the channels
of its motion; and the enkindled ſpirit is ready
to melt the groſs maſs that detains it from the
adorable object of its love.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O my ſoul!</hi> ſaith the tranſported admirer, How
<hi>reaſonable</hi> was thy <hi>Faith;</hi> and how <hi>unjuſt</hi> were thy
<hi>Fears?</hi> How <hi>ſmall</hi> were the troubles of thy <hi>night,</hi>
to the pleaſures of <hi>this day?</hi> and how injurious
were thy <hi>complaints</hi> to ſo <hi>glorious</hi> an <hi>expectation?</hi> O

<hi>ſorrow</hi> that ends in <hi>rapture!</hi> Was it <hi>ſuch comfort</hi> that
our Lord promiſed to thoſe that <hi>mourn?</hi> was <hi>this</hi>
the <hi>time</hi> I did ſo <hi>coldly</hi> expect, and ſo <hi>indifferently</hi>
regard? Is <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi> I loved <hi>ſo little?</hi> and was
<hi>this that Lord</hi> I was ſo careleſs to obey? Is <hi>this He</hi>
                           <pb n="333" facs="tcp:53432:171"/>
whom the fleſh and world tempted me ſo often
to deny; and whoſe intereſt could do ſo little
with me? <hi>Stupid ſoul!</hi> How unworthy art thou of
this ſight of Glory? and how more unworthy of
the favour of this glorious and triumphant Jeſus?
O the grace that pardons ſuch great defects; and
thus rewards ſuch mean ſervices! O the pleaſure

tranſports of hope that is within the reach of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Such,</hi> and incomprehenſibly greater, will be
the Ecſtaſies of the faithful in the day when the
Judge ſhall appear.</p>
                        <p>Let us all then (II.) make it our main care and

here for another ſtate, and the <hi>Day</hi> of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the great <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Trial</hi> for it. As we are
found then, our condition will be for ever; And
according as our actions have been, the Sentence
will paſs, either to everlaſting Joyes, or endleſs
Woe: What remains then, but that we look on
this as our great and moſt neceſſary work; That
<hi>we have the future Judgement alwayes in our eye and
thoughts;</hi> That we <hi>ſtudy the Laws whereby we are to be
judged;</hi> That <hi>we frequently judge our ſelves before;</hi>
and that <hi>we ſquare our actions by the directions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

the moſt joyful one to <hi>us</hi> that we ever ſaw, and the

                           <q>So the people of Nineveh believed God,
and proclaimed a Faſt, and put on Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
from the greateſt of them even to
the leaſt of them.</q>
                        </epigraph>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ineveh,</hi> the ancient and famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> was founded by <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
the mighty Hunter, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
firſt Monarch of the Earth;
it had its name from <hi>Ninus,</hi> who
compleated it, and was the third of that Empire.
Where its particular place was, is not, at this
day, certainly known; but this is certain, it was
a great City, of three days journey, ſaith the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53432:174"/>
Sacred Hiſtory, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. And, as was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ſuch were the ſins of it; all great Cities
abound in vice, but (it ſeems) the wickedneſs of
this was notorious, it made a cry, and that cry
came up before God to call for deſerved venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on their heads! but he that <hi>is ſlow to wrath,
and doth not willingly afflict the children of men,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to warn before he ſtrikes, and therefore
ſends <hi>Jonah,</hi> a Prophet of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to foretel their
approaching Ruine; He (conſidering the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefulneſs
of the Meſſage, and doubting what
Entertainment he was like to have from a proud,
and (as he might think) an obdurate City)
diverts another way, and flees toward <hi>Tarſhiſh;</hi>
but the judgement of God overtook him, and
plunged him into the Deep, where a Fiſh prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſwallowed the Prophet, who having been
three days in that Belly of Hell was by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
diſcharg'd upon the Shoar: and then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Commiſſion being renewed, he was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to the Heavenly voice, but went to
<hi>Nineveh,</hi> cryed againſt it, and the Event was
beyond all expectation, and extremely contrary
to his own; for,</p>
                        <p>[The people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed
a Faſt, and put on Sack-cloth from the greateſt of them
to the leaſt of them.]</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="339" facs="tcp:53432:174"/>
Very different was this Succeſs from what
other Meſſengers of God, Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and holy men of ancient, and later times,
have had: <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and preached many years, while the Ark
was in preparing, but they were diſobedient in
the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and went on in their ſins, till
the Flood came, and ſwept away that world of
the ungodly. The Prophets were earneſt, and
importunate, they cryed aloud, ſpared not, and
God by them ſtretched out his hand all day long,
and yet they were a diſobedient and a gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people, and gave them reaſon to complain,
<hi>Who hath believed our report, or to whom hath the Arm
of the Lord been revealed?</hi> The Holy Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who was greater than <hi>Jonah,</hi> than any
of the Prophets, than all; the Brightneſs of his
Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who did, as never man did, ſpake, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man ſpake, even he <hi>came unto his own, and
they received him not!</hi> they many of them believed
not his words, nor would they abide his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
but gave him occaſion to lament their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with tears of compaſſion, when he drew
near the City, <hi>he beheld, and wept over it, ſaying,
If thou hadſt known, even thou in this thy day, the things
that belong to thy peace!</hi> and then grief and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
breaks off the ſentence, they would not
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53432:175"/>
know the things belonging to their peace, though
the Prince of Peace was the Preacher of them:
and therefore elſewhere he paſſionately expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with them upon the ſcore of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and ſtoneſt them that were ſent unto thee, how
often would I have gathered thee, as an Hen gathereth her
Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not?</hi> The Son
of God himſelf could not prevail upon a City,
to which he made his frequent and earneſt
addreſſes; all he could do by the Methods of his
Graces was to bewail their obſtinacy, reſolved
impenitency, and unbelief: But <hi>Jonah</hi> ſucceeds
on one, as wicked, and much greater, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
firſt attempt he makes on it, v. 4. <hi>And Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah
began to enter into the City a days journey, and he
cryed, and ſaid, yet forty days and Nineveh ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:</hi>
and the very next words are thoſe of my
Text,</p>
                        <p>[So the people of Nineveh believed God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

                        </p>
                        <p>As I go, ſhall humbly compare their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
with our own, and conſider what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are ſuggeſted to us by that compariſon. I
begin,</p>
                        <p>(1.) With their Sins; thoſe were great, and
the cry of them was loud, <hi>Their wickedneſs is come
up before me,</hi> Chap. 1. 2. What their ſins were
in particular we are not told, but from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and the ſeverity of the judgement
threatned, we may conclude they were very
grievous; St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, <hi>that at the times of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
God winked</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,] He over-lookt, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
he made abatements, and had reſpect to
their frailties; He conſiders our Frame, our Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and Temptations, and is not ſo ſevere in
judging, and puniſhing men under thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of diſadvantage: According to the ſame
Scheme of Speech, our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>If I had not
done the works that no man ever did, they had had no ſin:
(viz.</hi>) theirs had not been ſo great, not ſuch in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.
But now, notwithſtanding the allowances
the divine goodneſs makes for a ſtate of Ignorance,
and conſequent Infirmity, the ſins of theſe <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
were ſuch as called for the ſevereſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53432:176"/>
even deſolation [Deſtruction]—<hi>Nineveh
ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What this deſtruction was in particular, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fire from Heaven, ſuch as deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> or an Inundation of waters, ſuch
as had over-whelmed divers Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys;
whether an Earth-quake, ſuch as ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Corah</hi> and his company; a ſudden ſurprize
of Foreign Enemies, ſuch as that of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations among the <hi>Romans;</hi> or of the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
on the <hi>Americans;</hi> or elſe any unexpected
violent commotion among themſelves, by Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre,
or Rebellion; whether to be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and miraculous, or in a plain and viſible
courſe; which of theſe it was, whether any of
them in particular, we are not told, only deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is threatned: Things were come to a ſad
iſſue with them, their ſins were full, and ripe for
vengeance.</p>
                        <p>Let us now, in the Name and Fear of God,
humbly compare this with our own caſe.</p>
                        <p>Our ſins alſo are very great, great as theirs in
their Nature, and Quality, in their circumſtances
and aggravations much greater and more heinous:
Blaſphemy, Prophane Swearing, Perjury, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Uncleanneſs, Drunkenneſs, Diſobedience,
Murder, Treaſon, Violence, Oppreſſion, all the
deadly ſins, whatever is contrary to found Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53432:176"/>
and true Doctrine, Reign, Triumph,
brave the Sun, are faſhionable, almoſt credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!
Fear and Shame, all the Reſtraints are
gone; men make a mock of ſin, glory in it, are
aſhamed of nothing: But Virtue, Sobriety,
Religion; Religion, matter of the beſt, higheſt,
trueſt honour, deſpis'd, buffoon'd, expoſed as
ridiculous!</p>
                        <p>Atheiſm, the greater, the leſs, formerly hid
its head, <hi>the Fool</hi> of old <hi>ſaid</hi> only <hi>in his heart, there
is no God:</hi> but now it appears openly, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
claims the reputation of wit, the only wit,
and good ſenſe; men like not to retain God in
their knowledge, but diſpute his Being, Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
Providence, and you are beholding to
them, if they do not bluntly tell you, There is
no ſuch thing, or do not ſay (at leaſt) with
thoſe in the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Tuſh, God ſeeth not, he careth
not, is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> Such we are,
and thus do, after Miracles of Mercies, and of
Judgements; after mighty Calamities, and equal
Deliverances; frequent warnings, and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Calls to Repentance!</p>
                        <p>And now, we have not indeed any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
extraordinary Prophet, particularly ſent to
thunder againſt us, but we have the warning
of <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets, of Chriſt, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and Miniſters of all ſorts; beſides all which,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53432:177"/>
the Providence of God, and the Circumſtances
of our affairs, and all things about us call loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that we ſhould prepare our ſelves to meet the
Lord coming to reckon with us; but, alas!
how ſhall we do this? Strength is weakneſs, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is Folly, and Infatuation; when he is angry,
his power is not to be reſiſted. <hi>Haſt thou an Arm
like God, or canſt thou Thunder like him?</hi> Job. <hi>His
preſence is not to be avoided. Whither ſhall I flee from
thy Spirit?</hi> Pſ. What ſhall we do then? muſt
we ſit down in deſpondency, in deſpair of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
is there no Remedy, no way? Bleſſed be
God, there is one; the ſame that was taken by
the poor <hi>Ninevites,</hi> who did not ſummon their
armed Forces, nor put their wits upon the Rack
for Stratagem, and Counſel, for publick Safety,
(means that may be uſed, and ought, in their
place.) No, they lookt on the Evil threatned,
as from the Lord, with whom there was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
againſt whom there was no contriving,
and applyed themſelves to appeaſe the offended
Majeſty; and they took the right courſe to do it;
for <hi>[They Believed God,</hi> &amp;c.] This was,</p>
                        <p>(2.) Their Reformation; the ſecond thing I
was to ſpeak of: in which I conſider,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, their Faith, <hi>[They believed God,]</hi> his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Attributes, Providence, Love of Virtue,
Hatred of Vice; and that the way to appeaſe him
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53432:177"/>
when he was angry was by the uſe of Prayer,
Faſting, and turning from evil ways. Theſe
they underſtood without a Prophet, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before the preaching of <hi>Jonah.</hi> God hath
conveyed ſome main knowledge of himſelf to
all his world, and hath not any where left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
without a Witneſs, his Laws are written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hearts of men, and all of thoſe we call
moſt Heathen. <hi>Rom. 2. What is to be known of
God, is manifeſt.</hi> Chapter the firſt of the ſame
Epiſtle, <hi>all the World is his,</hi> the Souls of men eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſo, of his Family, his Off-ſpring (as it
were) Bone of his Bone, Fleſh of his Fleſh, and
he provides for his own, they are worſe than
Infidels that do not. He takes care for Oxen,
for Sparrows, for Lillies; much more then for
the Souls of his Reaſonable Creatures; <hi>the very
hairs of our Heads are numbred,</hi> certainly then the
Souls of men are every one conſidered, every
one, ſome way or other, provided for. The
Summ is, God hath diſperſed ſome Light, ſome
glimmerings (at leaſt) of Light and Truth among
univerſal Mankind; and theſe men of <hi>Nineveh</hi>
had their portion, and by that were prepared for
more; that alone was not ſufficient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God ſends them a Prophet, not an Angel
to deſtroy (like thoſe ſent to <hi>Sodom,</hi>) not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ordinary Meſſenger from among themſelves,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53432:178"/>
their caſe required more; but an extraordinary
perſon, one from far: when men are prepared
for Repentance, they ſhall have the proper
means, God will not be wanting to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
when the ordinary means will not do,
they ſhall have ſuch as are extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common;
when the Native Light, and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are not ſufficient, they ſhall have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Preacher, ſuch was <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Aethiopian</hi>
Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. And an Angel ſent to <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to direct him to an Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Thus was
<hi>Jonah</hi> ſent to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and doubtleſs many
other good Heathens were ſo aſſiſted. He went,
though after a Repulſe of the divine commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and they were more ready to hear, than he
to preach; in that they both believed the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
and the Terrible Meſſage that he brought.
We alas! believe what we like, what is grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and agreeable to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our Faith is much
in our affections; but they believe what was
dreadful, and amazing, the truth was moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to their corrupt Inclinations, and carnal
Intereſt, and this their Belief is interpreted as
faith in God. To believe his Meſſengers coming
in his name, and with his Truth, is Believing
him, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that receiveth you,
receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him
that ſent me:</hi> and again, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53432:178"/>
me; he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent
me.</hi> The <hi>Ninevites</hi> did not ſo by <hi>Jonah</hi> or his
Meſſage; conſciouſneſs of their own guilt, and
their Natural Apprehenſions of divine juſtice,
made them apt to receive Impreſſions of dread;
and doubtleſs they had ill Abodings in their
minds before, by which they were prepared
for ſuch a Meſſage, and a Prophet, one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from another Countrey to appear with
ſo much Reſolution, and to ſpeak with ſo
much Authority, and aſſurance, affected them
more than if they had been uſed to ſuch
preachers of Errours; nor are we to ſuppoſe,
that he only repeated to them theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
words, <hi>Yet forty days and Nineveh ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
No, theſe (more likely) were but the
Summ, the Text, the Burden of his Sermon,
which probably he amplified with all thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
that were apt to move, and awaken:
and poſſibly the Mariners that were with him in
the Ship, and threw him over-board, upon the
Lot; that ſaw the Fiſh ſwallow him, and the
Tempeſt quieted upon it, might have come into
<hi>Nineveh</hi> before him, diverted from their intended
voyage by the Storm, meeting him again, after
they had ſeen him plunged into the Ocean, might
certifie the people of the Miracle, and they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
aſſured, that he was an extraordinary perſon,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53432:179"/>
and was come to them in an Extraordinary, and
Divine Errand; but whether this were ſo, or
not, whether they credited the Prophet on theſe
Motives, or any other, is not certain; but this is,
<hi>They believed upon the preaching of Jonah.</hi> And
now,</p>
                        <p>As God daily preacheth unto us by his vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Meſſengers, ſo he doth by his Providence,
by which we are ſometimes brought into great
ſtraits, even to the Brink of Ruine; and when
it is thus with us, when we are in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
under preſent Evil, and Fears of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
let us not abuſe our ſelves with falſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
put far from us the evil day, and cry
Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace: let
us not impute our Troubles, and diſorders to
accident, and common cauſes; but conſider,
that the Hand of God is in them, who is then
about to reckon with us for our ſins, and a voice
ſounding from thence, Repent, Repent, for
your Iniquities will be your Ruine. Let us not
be deaf, and ſtupid, as the careleſs old world
were, till the Flood came, and ſwept them
away; or as thoſe Mockers, the Apoſtle ſpeaks
of, who ſcoffingly ſaid, <hi>where is the promiſe</hi> (to
them it was threatning) <hi>of his coming?</hi> when
he was at the door; but let us humbly be
affected, as theſe poor creatures were, who
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53432:179"/>
believed upon the preaching of <hi>Jonah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And what was this Belief of theirs? was it
cold, indifferent, unconcerned aſſent only? no,
it was a Faith, powerful and active, that wrought
a mighty change, and produced the bleſſed Fruits
of Repentance, and Reformation; their Faith
had been dead, and unſignifying, if it had not
wrought, and wrought this way; if they had
paſt a Complement on the Prophet, that they
believed him, and gone on in the ſame courſe
as before; if they had believed God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in their provocations of him, their Faith
had been an aggravation, and might juſtly have
heightned, and haſtened their ruine; it had then
been a great argument of their Impudence, and
Obduration: but theirs was not a Fanatical, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical
Faith, without works; but a Faith
Operative, and Fruitful, and the Effect of it was
Repentance; and the expreſſions of that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Faſting and Prayer, and turning from evil
ways.</p>
                        <p>1. Faſting. This is a Rite of Humiliation
and Repentance, in which we acknowledge our
unworthineſs, and our vileneſs, that we merit
not common mercies, but deſerve the greateſt
puniſhments; and this anciently, and in all
times was alſo expreſt by Sack-cloth, and vile
cloathing, whereby theſe <hi>Ninevites</hi> likewiſe ſet
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53432:180"/>
out their wretchedneſs, and ill deſervings. God
Almighty hath ſo made us, that we are apt, and
cannot help it, to repreſent our inward Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by outward Expreſſions: and here is the
ground in Nature, and in Reaſon of Sacrifices,
and all the Rites of External Worſhip, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of this, by which the men of <hi>Nineveh</hi>
declared their abaſement before God; and we
have need of ſome eminent ſignal way to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our ſelves before him, in acknowledgement
of our greater, and more aggravated crimes;
we have ſometimes publick Faſts, and days of
publick Humiliation; But are they ſuch as God
hath choſen? do we in them afflict our ſouls with
penitence, and Godly ſorrow? do we as much
as impoſe any penance upon our external per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?
alas! we generally do not ſo much as the
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> and Hypocritical <hi>Jews</hi> did, who hung
down their heads, covered them with Aſhes,
put on Sack-cloth, and ſad looks, and abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from all things that were grateful, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Body, but we will not give our
ſelves the trouble as much as to appear, or look
like it; our Faſts are not only not the thing, but
not the reſemblance, or meer name, in effect a
Mockery; other kind of Faſting and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is expected, and required from us; and the
greateſt, the deepeſt is not low enough, nor great
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53432:180"/>
enough to ſignifie the ſence, and ſorrow, that
is due to ſo much guilt! The <hi>Ninevites</hi> declared
theirs ſolemnly, The King deſcended from his
Throne, and put on Sack-cloth, ſate in aſhes,
and proclaimed general Abſtinence to Man, and
Beaſt; and we ſee, that the whole people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the penitent Example, and put on
Sack-cloth from the greateſt of them to the leaſt
of them: This was one expreſſion of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and it was accompanied with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which alſo was very proper, and ſignificant,
(<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>(2.) Prayer. Earneſt, affectionate Prayer,
expreſt by <hi>crying mightily unto God, v.</hi> 8. This
alſo is a Duty generally acknowledg'd through
the world, in all the ages, and places of it, part
of the Law written on the Heart, a Branch of
the Religion of Mankind: Theſe <hi>Heathens</hi> knew
the neceſſity, and virtue of it; we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think they learnt it from this Prophet,
whoſe Meſſage was deſtruction; and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
ſtory, we ſee, he thought of nothing
leſs; they knew, that their ſins were againſt
God, as all are; <hi>againſt thee, and thee only have I
ſinned.</hi> He was offended, and he threatned; he
was to be appeaſed, or they were undone; and
prayer is the way, that all the world is taught to
ſeek pardon, and favour by; this they took, <hi>they
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53432:181"/>
cryed unto God,</hi> not unto Saints and Angels, unto
God, One, the true God; That there is but one
ſupreme Deity hath ever been the Belief of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
even of the Heathen world; the various
gods, we read of, are but the divers repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the one all-perfect Being, or of his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Attributes, and Manifeſtations in the world;
or they are of lower ſignification, and mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels, or nobler Souls departed, in which
ſenſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>There are Gods many.</hi>
So that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> cannot this way juſtifie
themſelves from the Imputation of Idolatry, by
alledging, that they worſhip one, and the true
God, as the ultimate object of their Adorations;
for even the Heathens, The <hi>Ninevites</hi> believed
God, and they cryed mightily unto God: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Mariners in the Storm <hi>cryed every one to
his God, viz.</hi> his Tutelar Angel, and <hi>Genius,</hi>
ſuch many of the Heathens had; and (it ſeems)
theſe were Heathen Mariners: But theſe here
direct their Devotions to the one Supreme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;
ſo they were required, and ſo by the
conſequence, we find, they did; <hi>for God ſaw
their works,</hi> and this among the reſt: <hi>and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented
him of the Evil he had threatned,</hi> and ſent it
not: this was the bleſſed anſwer of their prayers!
And now,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="353" facs="tcp:53432:181"/>
If they, or any other people had ever Reaſon
to cry mightily unto God, we have; Let us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
do this, he is ready to beſtow pardon, and
deliverance, but he will be ſought unto. Let us
do it in Faith and fervour, we have great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
and Encouragement, which the <hi>Ninevites</hi> had
not; we are taught how to pray, and in whoſe
Name.</p>
                        <p>We have a Mediator at Gods right Hand, that
ever lives to make Interceſſion for us; we have
through him free admiſſion to the Throne of
Grace, with boldneſs, and many promiſes, that
we ſhall be heard, and receive the Bleſſing, if
we ask in Faith, and in the Sons Name: Let us
then pray fervently, humbly, and inceſſantly,
for our Prince, and Nation, for our ſelves, and
poſterity; that God would pity, and pardon, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
his Judgements, and deliver us from all our
Enemies, and all our Fears, Eſtabliſh our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Government, and all our Intereſts
in thoſe. And,</p>
                        <p>O thou that ſtilleſt the raging of the Sea, and the
Madneſs of the people, be merciful to us, do thou ſave
us, or we periſh; The Seas ſwell, and rage horribly,
and the Deep is ready to ſwallow us up quick, do thou,
O Lord, put forth thy Hand, and ſtay us, or we ſink,
and periſh in the great waters, we ſink into the depth
of the Abyſſe, and there is no help, Be thou our help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53432:182"/>
and deliverer, for vain is the help of Man!</p>
                        <p>Thus prayer, earneſt, affectionate prayer is
neceſſary; not that God can be moved thereby,
but thereby we are prepared for his Mercies, and
he is always ready to give, when we are fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
But</p>
                        <p>Beſides this, the men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> did ſomewhat
elſe, and it was that which made the reſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
                        <p>(3.) <hi>They turned from their evil ways.</hi> This
was the main thing, and without it, Faſting and
prayer had been to little purpoſe, yea they had
been Abominations as the Sacrifices, Oblations,
Faſts and Services of the <hi>Jews</hi> were, becauſe they
did not looſe the Bands of wickedneſs, or let the
oppreſſed go free; They did not <hi>do Juſtice,</hi> and
<hi>love Mercy,</hi> and <hi>walk humbly with</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> which
he principally required from them, but theſe <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites</hi>
did; <hi>They humbled themſelves, and turned from
their evil ways, and from the violence that was in their
hands.</hi> It ſeems, ſome of their principal ſins were
Cruelty and Injuſtice, and therefore their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is particularly noted: they knew where the
Root of the Diſtemper grew, which was the cauſe
of approaching Judgements, and therefore here
they apply the Remedy, in renouncing thoſe ſins
they were ſo notoriouſly guilty of.</p>
                        <p>The Light and Law of Nature told them,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53432:182"/>
how diſpleaſing ſin was to the Almighty, and
that there was no atonement, but by Repentance;
no Repentance, but in Turning, and they did
this: They thought it not enough to cry out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their ſins, <hi>to roar like Bears,</hi> and <hi>mourn like
Doves:</hi> as the Expreſſion is in the Prophet: This
('tis like) they did, but ſtopt not here, they went
on to what was more to purpoſe, <hi>They turned
from their evil ways.</hi> Repentance is turning, <hi>Turn
ye, turn ye, why will ye dye?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let this practice of theirs be a pattern to us,
let us ſeriouſly conſider the common crying Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
ſins, and how far we are guilty of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
and reſolve in the Strength of God
to ceaſe from them, to deſtroy them our ſelves,
and to endeavour every one in his place, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
them in others: thus far each man is his
Brothers keeper; and Charity, and the Common
Intereſt require this Endeavour from us, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
by advice, by the exerciſe of our power:
Let us conſider, what are our particular ſins, the
ſins of our Education, of our Complexion, of
our Condition, and apply the Grace of God,
and our chief warchfulneſs, and diligence againſt
them, that we may ſtrike at the root, and deſtroy
the ſtrong holds; let us do the work throughly,
and effectually.</p>
                        <p>This our preſent ſafety, ours, our Kings, our
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53432:183"/>
Government, our Religion, our poſterity require
from us; for if we continue to do wickedly, we
may expect to be deſtroyed, both <hi>we and our King.</hi>
This, all the conſiderations of the next ſtate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
loudly call for, all manner of Reaſons
from both the worlds urge and enforce this:
Let us not be ſtill ſtupid, and deaf to ſuch calls,
but hear, and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly.
Let us put a ſtop to the courſe of our ſins, and
then we may expect that a ſtop will be put to our
Troubles, and the Judgements threatned and
feared, will be turned from us.</p>
                        <p>The Summ of all is, to urge us to be as wiſe
in our Generation, as thoſe poor Heathens were
in theirs, who Believed, Faſted, Prayed, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and we may conſider further,</p>
                        <p>(3.) <hi>The Univerſality of theſe</hi> [From the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them, to the leaſt of them.]</p>
                        <p>They were all affected, they all did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and ſo much as was accepted. This is a
wonderful Inſtance of Converſion, ſomewhat
like it is that of St. <hi>Peters</hi> 3000 in one Sermon;
<hi>The King humbled himſelf, and the people Faſted, and
put on Sack-cloth.</hi> The Greateſt is not too great to
humble himſelf before the God of Heaven, nor
the leaſt too little to be conſider'd by him, all
Fleſh had corrupted it ſelf, all were become abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
in their doings, and therefore all were
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53432:183"/>
concern'd to be greatly affected, and deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
from the greateſt to the leaſt <hi>[From the
Greateſt.]</hi> There the Humiliation begun, The
King deſcended from his Throne, and put on
Sack-cloth, laid by his Majeſty, and Glory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed
himſelf in the duſt, and put on vile array,
ſignifications of Sorrow and Repentance; from
the great, 'tis like, their enormous ſins begun,
thence they had their examples, thence their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.
The great draw their Trains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, Natural Pride and Ambition, make
all deſirous to imitate them, their Example is
largely diffuſive and infectious, and makes ſins
faſhionable: their ſins quickly over-ſpread, and
debauch a Nation, and therefore, 'twas fit, that
Repentance ſhould begin here, where, probably,
many of their ſins did; that the great ſhould
cure by their good example thoſe they had hurt
by their bad, and theirs being againſt more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and more Expectation are the greateſt, and
moſt aggravating: and therefore there was Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and need, that they ſhould be moſt penitent,
and firſt ſo: and accordingly here it Commenc'd.</p>
                        <p>Reformation is like to be general and effectual,
when the Great begin it in themſelves: it doth
not ſtop there, but paſſeth through the middle
degrees, to the leaſt of men, the meaneſt, and
leaſt conſiderable, thoſe alſo add to the common
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53432:184"/>
heap of provocations, and thoſe have therefore
reaſon to be humbled alſo; and when Gods hand
is lifted up, and his Judgements are near, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and expects that all, and every one, from
him that ſits on the Throne, to him that grinds in
the Mill, ſhould repent, and turn to him; the
ſins of the meaneſt contribute to the publick
guilt, and their Repentance helps forward to
publick deliverance.</p>
                        <p>Let us duly conſider this circumſtance of the
Repentance of the men of <hi>Nineveh:</hi> and,</p>
                        <p>O that God in his Mercy to us and them would
open the eyes of the Great among us to ſee this
their duty, and the things that belong to their
Peace before they are hidden from their Eyes:
as their Guilt is often greateſt, ſo the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
Judgements (many times) fall heavieſt
upon them. Two late dreadful Judgements we
have been under, Fire and Peſtilence: Theſe fell
chiefly upon the middle and meaner ſort. The
Judgements we have now reaſon to fear threaten
all, but chiefly the Great.</p>
                        <p>In the Name of God let us all pray that a deep
Spirit of Humiliation may be upon them, that
they may reflect on the greateſt of their ſins in
their Nature, and the Miſchief they have done
by their Influence; that they may ſtrive to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the reſt in Repentance, and ſhew the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53432:184"/>
Inferiour ſouls the way to Safety and Happineſs;
that they may lay aſide all Vanity, Luxury, and
Intemperance, Rioting and Drunkenneſs, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
and Wantonneſs, the <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> the deareſt
ſins, thoſe of Pride and Pleaſure, the ſins by
which the Nation hath been made drunk, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
debauched and depraved, that they may
mourn for theſe great crying Iniquities, and in
the ſtrength of Divine grace reſolve to turn from
them: This would be the happieſt ſight that ever
<hi>England</hi> ſaw, and the moſt hopeful. Oh that our
eyes were bleſt with it. And</p>
                        <p>Let not us of the middle and inferiour ſort
content our ſelves to deſire their Reformation and
amendment, but reſolve alſo on our own: 'Tis
generally very grateful to us to hear the faults of
the Great ript up, of our Governours eſpecially:
It will concern us more to affect our hearts duly
with thoſe we are guilty of our ſelves. And in
this we the Miniſters of Religion, the Guides
of the people (at leaſt, who ought to be ſo)
ſhould lead the way; our unworthineſs alſo hath
been great, and our provocations have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
we have not returned unto the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Benefits, or made a right uſe of
his Mercies, we have not been ſo ſtrict in our
Lives, or ſo diligent in our great and moſt
weighty Imployment, ſo much concern'd for
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53432:185"/>
the good of the Church or Intereſts of mens Souls
as we ought to have been; many have been Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
ſome Rioters, ſcarce any have imploy'd
proportionable Zeal and circumſpect diligence:
Our faults are publiſhed and aggravated to the
height (I hope beyond it) by our Enemies of
all ſorts, and we may expect ſtill a greater load
of Criminations and Reproaches. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that this evil is from the Lord for our ſins:
He ſaid to the Lying Spirits <hi>Go;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
that he might have bid <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe him.
Let us look at his hand and humble our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and not ſpend our Breath in Invectives
againſt the Inſtruments of our Troubles and
Fears, but apply the proper Remedy to the Root
of our Diſtemper, which we know is to bring
forth Fruit meet for Repentance. And let not
the people ſpend their, all their Heat, and Zeal
againſt the ſins of their Governours and their
Miſdeeds; in theſe they are apt to exceed, and
run beyond bounds, and multiply their own ſins
in ſo doing: But let them lay their hands on
their hearts, and ſay, We have all ſinned and
done wickedly, we have been all as ſheep go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſtray, but we will return to the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
and Biſhop of our ſouls: Let them make
themſelves deeply ſenſible, not only of the groſs
carnal Evils, but of the Spiritual Iniquities, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53432:185"/>
bitter zeal, contempt of Rulers, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Schiſm, Separation, waywardneſs, and
the like; and not excuſe and extenuate their ſins;
charge others, and leſſen their own by Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
compariſons; but let all ſorts and degrees of
men charge themſelves with their own guilt, and
deeply abaſe themſelves before the Almighty in
the ſenſe of it; and when it is thus, when peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
acknowledgements and humiliations are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
then a people is prepared for the Mercy of
deliverance, and the evils threatned ſhall not
come. And</p>
                        <p>In order to this we ſhould not look and ſtay
till the reſt begin, but every one ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be the firſt; and if we do take this
courſe and proceed in it, whatever others do,
whatever they ſuffer, we ſhall be ſafe, if not for
this world, yet for the next certainly (which is
better) and probably for both. And</p>
                        <p>Now I ſhall endeavour to enforce this great,
this moſt ſeaſonable, this moſt neceſſary duty,
by ſeveral conſiderations taken from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the Repentance of the men of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. They were Heathens, ſuch as the Prophet
ſpeaks, had not the knowledge of Gods Law,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) in the fulneſs and expreſſneſs of it; and
yet they Repented. But we are Chriſtians,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53432:186"/>
whoſe are the Law and the Prophets, to whom
Chriſt is come, Eternal Life is made manifeſt,
and the Everlaſting Goſpel is revealed: And
ſhall we continue our Impenitency and Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
Are there Flowers in the Wilderneſs and
none in the Garden? Do the wild Beaſts of the
Foreſt hear his voice, and ſhall not the Sheep of
his own Fold obey him? This will be an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of our ſins, if we impenitently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in them; thoſe rude Heathens did not ſo.</p>
                        <p>2. They Repented upon Preaching: we do
not read of any fiery Tryals they had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of any dreadful Judgements that had been
upon them; we hear not of any prodigies in
the Heavens, or any portents in the Earth, Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Stars, or Fiery Swords, or Earth-quakes,
or dreadful Apparitions, or other terrible ſights
to predict their approaching Ruine; ſuch as have
been fore-runners of Deſtruction to many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
No, we hear only of preaching, <hi>Jonah</hi>
Preaches, and they Repent. But now God hath
pleaſed to vouchſafe unto us great plenty, as to
the Declarations of his word and will by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
'tis as common as Gold in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Time,
as the Stones in the ſtreet, and we trample on
it, and make it as vile. Preaching is cuſtomary,
grown a thing of Form, hath loſt its force upon
us, we believe not the Report of it, we refuſe
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53432:186"/>
to hear, or hear with carleſneſs and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with no deſign, or with a wrong one to
entertain our Curioſity, or to gratifie our Fancies
with the ſame Affection that they ſee and hear
Plays; otherwiſe generally we neither heed nor
mind what we hear: The moſt powerful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hath little or no Authority or Effect with us
or upon us. Beſides which,</p>
                        <p>We have been exerciſed with great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Judgements; when his word would not
prevail, God was pleaſed to take the Rod into his
hand, we were harraſs'd with Twenty years Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
war, that drew our Blood, and waſted our
ſtrength, and conſumed our Treaſure, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
us with horrour and deſolation, that brought
in Oppreſſion, Tyranny, and ſad Confuſions;
from the aforeſaid War was the overthrow of
the beſt of Governments, the Murder of the beſt
of Kings, Suppreſſion of Laws, and Deſtruction
of the beſt Patriot and Subjects, and an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Slavery, Miſery and Diſorder. And after
our deliverance from thoſe evils by a wheel of
Providence, we continuing ſtill in our ſins, and
growing the worſe for our mercies, he ſent a
raging Peſtilence among us; The deſtroying
Angel poured forth his Viols of wrath, and
poyſon'd the publick Air of our chief City, and
deſtroyed Thouſands and Ten Thouſands in
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53432:187"/>
our Streets, and ſuch a Mortal Contagion as had
not been in all the days of our Fore-fathers. And
that Judgement was followed on the heels by
another as dreadful, and by a devouring Fire we
were made as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and like unto <hi>Gomorrha:</hi>
The Strength, the Glory, the Beauty of our Land
laid in Aſhes, and made an heap of Stones. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
which and many other Providences,
Mercies and Judgements, we have ſinned yet
more and more, as if we dared the moſt High,
and reſolv'd to provoke him to deſtroy us ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</p>
                        <p>Thus we have done, and if this is the ground
of our preſent Troubles and Fears, and if we
perſiſt in our hardneſs, and do not at laſt return
by Repentance, What can we expect but the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
extremities of his vengeance? The poor
<hi>Ninevites</hi> repented upon preaching, and 'twill
be a mighty aggravation of our ſins if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
impenitent, not only under the moſt awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
Preachers, but the moſt dreadful Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>3. The people of <hi>Nineveh</hi> repented upon the
preaching of a ſingle Prophet, they had but one
<hi>Jonah,</hi> not ſo much Teſtimony as uſeth to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in common buſineſs, <hi>in the mouth or two or
three witneſſes ſhall every thing be confirmed;</hi> and yet
they did not call for more evidence: There was
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53432:187"/>
a <hi>Jonah</hi> within (their own Conſcience) that
preach't the ſame Doctrine for the main with the
other without, and they repented upon the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
external Preaching of a ſingle <hi>Jonah.</hi> But now
among us, great hath been the number of the
Preachers, Patriarchs and Prophets, the Son of
God himſelf, and a whole Army of Apoſtles,
Miniſters, Confeſſors, Martyrs in former, in
latter, in preſent times, a whole Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
with a Firmament thick of Stars and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Lights of all ſorts and ſizes. And now did
thoſe poor Heathens hear the voice of a little
Brook, and ſhall not we the noiſe of many Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
Were they enlightened by a ſingle Planet,
and we not ſo by numerous Conſtellations?
This alſo will be another and great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if we ſtill perſiſt and go on harden'd in our
ſins.</p>
                        <p>4. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> repented when they might
have doubted, who is this <hi>Jonah?</hi> he is a ſtranger to
our Countrey, to our Laws, to our Religion, and
ſhall he lead us? this <hi>Jonah</hi> is a ſinner, and God doth
not uſe to ſend his mind and meſſages by ſuch.
He ſaith he is a Prophet, but how ſhall we know
it, where are his Miracles? where are his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials
from Heaven to juſtifie our Belief of
him? Thus they might have queſtion'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed
the matter, but they took the better
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53432:188"/>
courſe, and repented on the Preaching of <hi>Jonah.</hi>
They knew that though <hi>Jonah</hi> was a ſtranger, yet
one that was not ſo, the Preacher within, taught
the ſame Doctrine, that they might expect Gods
Judgements on them for their ſins; that though
<hi>Jonah</hi> were a ſinner, yet they might learn their duty
from ſuch; that though he ſhould not be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
yet there needed no Prophecy or Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Meſſenger or Meſſage to make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Divine Juſtice, and their own Guilt: So
that inſtead of cavilling and diſputing, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
and turned from their evil ways. But
now God hath given us a ſure word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and mighty and undoubted Miracles have
confirm'd the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and the Goſpel is eſtabliſhed by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
that ever were, and we have higheſt Reaſon
to Believe for the works ſake, and the Divine
Teſtimony that was given to the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> and
Apoſtles, by the uncontroulable Miracles which
they wrought eſpecially: we are aſſur'd by that
greateſt, of our Saviours Reſurrection from the
Dead, by which he is declared the Son of God
with power, all his Doctrines and all his Actions,
and the whole Scope of his deſigns do infinitely
confirm it unto us: And yet we doubt and diſpute,
and cavil when we ſhould Repent. This alſo
greatly heightens our ſins, and will our condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53432:188"/>
if we do not ſeaſonably, ſpeedily take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
courſe.</p>
                        <p>5. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> repented upon the Preaching
of a Temporal Judgement, <hi>forty days and Nineveh
ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> It was the deſtruction of their
City, no expreſs mention of the Ruine of their
perſons and poſterities, much leſs of the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Souls; and yet upon this leſſer
Threatning they Repented. But now beſides
the many Temporal evils our ſins threaten us
with, we have denounc'd againſt us the loſs of
our Souls to eternal ages. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God,</hi> Pſ.
9. 17. And terrible is that Sentence paſs'd on
the impenitent, <hi>Mat. 25. 41. Depart from me ye
curſed into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and
his Angels:</hi> Every word ſpeaks terrour, depart
and <hi>Depart curſed into Fire, into everlaſting Fire,</hi> and
Fire <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> in their
company and under their condemnation and
Torment. Such threatnings one would think
ſhould effectually reſtrain men from their ſins,
and bring them to Repentance; and woe to us
if thoſe or Gods other Methods do not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it.</p>
                        <p>6. The people of <hi>Nineveh</hi> Repented upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of Succeſs; They were not ſure that
their Repentance would be accepted; yea they
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53432:189"/>
had great reaſon to fear it would not; for the
threatning in the Form ſeem'd to be abſolute.
But they knew that there was certain Ruine in
the way in which they were going, and ſome
probability, poſſibility at leaſt, that the Divine
goodneſs might interpoſe for them upon their
Repentance, and they acted wiſely, and took
the ſafer courſe, they Repented and Repented
upon the faint Encouragement of a <hi>peradventure,
who knows but the Lord may repent and turn,</hi> v. 9.
But now God hath pleaſed to give us the fulleſt,
the greateſt aſſurance of Pardon and Favour upon
Repentance: for this we have his repeated word
and his Oath, and the Blood of his Son and the
Teſtimony of his Spirit: This is the Covenant
he hath made with us, and his Son came into the
world to give us the aſſurance, and his Spirit
hath always confirmed it, that by theſe <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
things by which it is impoſſible for God to
lye,</hi> we might have ſtrong confidence that our
Repentance will be accepted and rewarded.
And 'twill be a very great Inſtance and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our hardneſs, if notwithſtanding we go
on impenitently in our accuſtomed ſins.</p>
                        <p>7. The men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> Repented, and they
did it ſpeedily, <hi>When the Prophet began to enter into
the City a days journey,</hi> it follows immediately, <hi>So
the people of Nineveh believed God:</hi> They did not
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53432:189"/>
ſtand to conſult and deliberate about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they did not ſay to <hi>Jonah</hi> as <hi>Foelix</hi> did
to St. <hi>Paul, We will hear thee ſome other time of this
matter;</hi> no, They heard and Repented preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But we are apt to procraſtinate and delay,
and put the work off from one day to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from youth to manhood, from thence to
old age; from the time of Health to Sickneſs,
from thence to a Death-bed, and ſtill cry to
morrow and hereafter. But if we think to
do it at all, let us take the next time, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
here are moſt dangerous, and the work will
ſtill grow the more difficult: We are call'd by
preſent Providences to inſtant Repentance, if
we delay yet longer it may be too late, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Reformation is expected and required
from us, or immediate Judgements are to befal
us. And</p>
                        <p>The ſame Encouragement have we for the
work of ſpeedy Repentance as theſe <hi>Ninevites</hi>
had; for this is moſt certain, that if we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of the Evil we have done, God will alſo
Repent of the Evil he hath ſaid. Both which
gracious Acts of Penance on our part, and
Pardon on Gods, that they may be done,
God of his infinite Mercy grant through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Mediation of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="370" facs="tcp:53432:190"/>
To whom with the Holy Ghoſt be aſcribed
by Angels and men, by all things in Heaven
and Earth, as is moſt due, all poſſible Praiſe and
Power, Might and Majeſty, Dominion and
Adoration to Eternal Ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

and what he cannot
compaſs by main ſtrength, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
by Stratagem, and by Artifice. In
which latter, he hath always been moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
ſucceſsful, prevailing more by Policies,
than by Power. <hi>Satan</hi> is moſt dangerous in
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53432:192"/>
the livery of Religion, and the appearing Angel
of light hath done more execution, than the
known Prince of Darkneſs.</p>
                        <p>Indeed in the early times of Chriſtianity, it's
enemy and ours thought to have over-born and
cruſht it by open ways of violence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vigorouſly aſſaulted this new and naked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
with all the force that Wit and Intereſt,
Power and Malice combined, could draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and with all that rage, that Helliſh zeal
could inſpire, flew upon the naked Infant, that
had no captivating arts to recommend, no viſible
aids to aſſiſt it: But Innocence was too powerful
for Arms, and Truth and Vertue for aſſault;
and the Deſigner perceiving that this perſecuted
Chriſtianity did but brighten and grow more
conſpicuous by the Flames he kindled againſt it:
That the injured Innocents prevail'd more on
the World by their Patience, than their enemies
did on them by their Cruelties: That this hated,
this maligned Religion ſtood like a Rock in the
Sea, while the ſpightful Waves and foaming
Billows did but daſh and break themſelves
againſt it. I ſay, perceiving how little ſucceſs he
had in his aſſaults, he betakes him to his arts and
his devices. He pretends to that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
againſt: and gets into Religion that he
might overthrow it: And this deſign he hath
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53432:192"/>
been ever ſince carrying on in the world, <hi>viz.</hi>
to deſtroy Religion by it ſelf. And if ever Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
be exploded, 'tis like to be by a Spirit
that highly pretends unto it: So that the roaring
of the Lyon is not ſo formidable as the wily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
of the Serpent: And the Deceiver in the
cloſe Phariſee is more dangerous than Satan in
the Publican and open Sinner.</p>
                        <p>Now the way to defeat frauds and wiles, is to
underſtand them, and the Deſigner is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
aſſoon as his practices are diſcovered;
we therefore owe this care to the intereſt of our
ſouls, to endeavour to be acquainted with the arts
of our enemy; and we ſhall be ſecure from the
danger of their influence, when <hi>We are not ignorant
of his Devices.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the chief Devices of the Grand Deſigner
are levell'd againſt the Glory of God, the Peace
of the Church, our Faith and a good life. All
which in ſome of their main branches, I ſhall
endeavour faithfully to diſcover; and though I
foreſee my diſcourſe will light on things which
are very ſacred with ſome who will be angry
with every one that is not fond of their darling
devices, yet I ſhall not keep the Devils Counſel,
becauſe I know they are not ſo much theirs, as his.
And the more men are taken with the pretence, in
the greater danger are they of the miſchief.</p>

                           <pb n="376" facs="tcp:53432:193"/>
To begin then with the firſt Head propoſed,
Satan deviſeth againſt the Glory of God, and that
in theſe inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt his Goodneſs,
his Grace, his Spirit, and his Worſhip.</p>
                        <p>(1.) Satan deſigns againſt the Glory of Gods
goodneſs. The goodneſs of God is his nature,
and the fountain of his actions, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
ſaith the Philoſopher, and <hi>God is love,</hi> ſaith the
Apoſtle. And the moſt ſuitable apprehenſion
we can form of God, is to look on him as an
Infinite, Eternal, and Almighty Love, as that
benign fountain that is continually overflowing,
and that glorious Sun that is always ſhedding
abroad its beams and brightneſs. Indeed the
dry eſſence of God we cannot know, 'tis hid
from our ſight, and our approaches in dazling
glory, and light inacceſſible: But his nature,
that is, the Principle of his actions, is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and his attributes are but the ſeveral modes
and variegations of Almighty Love, from which
they differ but as the colours of the Rain-bow do
from the light of the Sun. This then is the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt God-like Attribute, and the Divine
glory is moſt concern'd in the honour of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and againſt this Satan hath in theſe latter
days eſpecially been moſt ſubtilly and unhappily
deſigning.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="377" facs="tcp:53432:193"/>
For perceiving that the notion of a God was ſo
deeply preſt upon the Souls of men, that there
was no eraſing, no plucking it thence: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to corrupt and undermine what he
could not otherwiſe deſtroy. And if he cannot
obtain of the world to ſay with the Fool, <hi>There is
no God,</hi> he'l attempt to perſwade them to believe,
that God is like him, or themſelves, and ſo is
worſe than none: which he doth by inſtilling no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into the minds of men, vaſtly prejudicial
to the honour of his goodneſs, and repreſenting
him as cruel, mercileſs, and tyrannical, as one
that hath made Myriads of excellent creatures,
to make them miſerable for ever, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in triumphing over the wretched and
calamitous whom meer unaccountable Will
hath made ſo. As one that hath involv'd the
greateſt part of his beſt Creation in black and
diſmal fates, before they ſin'd or had a being,
that do what they can, will dragg them into
the Regions of endleſs woe and pain. Thus
repreſenting the God of Love, under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

Which ſowre and injurious apprehenſions of
God had never enter'd upon the minds of men,
by profeſt and open ways of oppoſing that
goodneſs which ſhines with ſo clear a beam into
our Souls, and is writ upon every leaf of the
ſacred volume, and external nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the cunning agent hath inſinuated them by
a Device; pretending himſelf a mighty Zelot
for the glory of God's abſolute will, power, and
prerogative over his Creatures, which he hath
ſtrain'd and forc'd beyond all the bounds of
Right, Juſt, and Good. And by ſuch repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
he knows he doth no real honour to
theſe Attributes, but reflects a certain diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the divine goodneſs. For a Will that
is arbitrary, and not govern'd by goodneſs and
wiſdome, is meer unaccountable humour and
womaniſh impotence, and not becoming him
who acts by the Council of his own will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Apoſtle; yea and the Heathen Poet,
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. And that power and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that is a perfection of the divine nature, is
always in conjunction with the milder and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
attributes, he <hi>cannot lye,</hi> he <hi>cannot deſtroy him,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle: He cannot act contrarily to
the rules of his infinitely perfect eſſence. And
indeed to act inconſiſtently with the eternal laws
of Right and Good, is not only cruelty and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53432:194"/>
but impotency, and weakneſs. So that
this mighty noiſe of the glory of Gods abſolute
power and prerogative, in contriving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
the ruine of his creatures, is no exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any perfection in God, but a ſad and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
execution upon his goodneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
upon Religion, the foundation of
which is laid in Love to God, which is fatally
overthrown by ſuch ſowre and ſurly notions of
him, as repreſent him as the hater of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<hi>And when ſuch apprehenſions</hi> (as one hath
well obſerv'd) <hi>meet with ſtout and reſolute tempers,
they do but canker them againſt ſuch a Being,</hi> ſo that
firſt they wiſh he were not, and then eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelves he is not. Or, if ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of God light on the more timorous and
paſſive ſpirits, they do but fright them into ſome
poor ſneaking, forc'd and feminine devotions,
which are devoid of all heart and life. And
thus the ſucceſs of the firſt device againſt the
glory of the divine goodneſs, is either Atheiſm,
or a Superſtition that is near it.</p>
                        <p>But (2.) Satan deviſeth againſt the glory of
God, by diſparaging his Grace; which he doth
by detracting from the fulneſs, under pretence
of exalting the freeneſs of it. The Enemy of
Mankind is envious at that Grace the Divine
goodneſs affords us, and denies him, and becauſe
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53432:195"/>
he cannot confine the bounty of Heaven, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the beams from deſcending from above, he'l
endeavour to raiſe clouds below that ſhall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them, and deprive us of their influence,
which he doth by ſuggeſting narrow and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
apprehenſions of the grace of God, and
repreſenting it as an arbitrary, contracted deſulto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, beſtowed only here and there by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſome
meaſures, and directed by no rule
but that of meer unaccountable will, by which
abuſive repreſentation, the glory of the divine
Grace, which conſiſts in its univerſal diffuſion,
is clouded and eclipſt, and the minds of men
hindred from apprehending what they enjoy,
and from enjoying what without ſuch an abuſe
they could not but apprehend.</p>
                        <p>This is the deſign and the miſchievous iſſue
which to cover and to propagate, the cunning
Machinator pretends the exaltation of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that grace which he deſigns to diſhonour
and defeat. He raiſeth a mighty cry of Free
Grace, and intitles the Libellings of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by the ſpecious name of <hi>Vindiciae gratiae.</hi>
He fills mens heads and mouths with Grace,
Grace: O the freeneſs of Gods grace! Nothing
will be admitted but what comes in the Livery of
grace; men are pleaſed with the very word,
and tickled with that dear and agreeable ſound:
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53432:195"/>
all diſcourſes are inſipid that are not full of free
grace; and he will not be allow'd to know any
thing of it, that is not rapt up into the ecſtaſie of
admiring it.</p>
                        <p>Who would think now that ſuch a Spirit as
this, that ſo highly pretends to exalt Grace,
ſhould really diſparage it, and undermine it?
Who would think that the enemy of Gods Grace,
blew in this humour upon the world, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this mighty zeal that ſeems ſo gloriouſly to
illuſtrate and recommend it? And yet we may
ſee reaſon to believe ſo, when we ſhall conſider
that this Free Grace, that is ſo magnificently
talkt of, is infinitely unworthy God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to his Glory, both in the notion of <hi>Free,</hi>
and in the notion of <hi>Grace.</hi> For a thus admired,
thus celebrated freeneſs, is but an humourſome
doating on a party, which ſelf-admirers are
pleas'd to call the <hi>Elect,</hi> that is, thoſe of their own
faſhion and likeneſs. They firſt fanſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the favourites and ſpecial darlings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
not from any reaſon they have to think ſo
from the goodneſs of their lives, but the ſtrength
of their imaginations, which furniſh them with
ſtrong and proud preſumptions; and then they
admire (and well they may) the freeneſs of that
grace which chooſeth them to be the darlings,
and peculiar people, with as little reaſon, as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53432:196"/>
they can conceit themſelves to be ſo. And thus
the freeneſs they commend in God, is that we
call childiſh and unreaſonable fondneſs in our
ſelves; which is infinitely unbecoming him,
who is <hi>a lover of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>no reſpecter of
perſons:</hi> who acts by the eternal Laws of Right
and Good, and not by the feminine meaſures of
impotent humour and indulgence, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of whoſe Grace conſiſts not in loving or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
us, without reaſon, but for reaſons
drawn from the benignity and perfection of
his own nature, which communicates without
external motive or conſtraint, without bounds
or poſſibility of impediment. And thus we ſee
how a corrupt and abuſive notion of the freedom
of Gods grace, hath been inſinuated by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the prejudice of his Glory. And as free
grace has been miſrepreſented in the notion of
<hi>Free,</hi> ſo alſo hath it been corruptly taught in the
notion of <hi>Grace,</hi> which ſome have repreſented
as a violence the divine power offers unto our
wills; at leaſt, ſuperinducing a foreign quality
upon us, to which we contribute nothing, which
makes us <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as the Heathen expreſſes it,
Good and happy by a certain fate. So that
good men are but a better ſort of Engines. By
which notion of grace God is ſuppoſed to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the laws himſelf hath eſtabliſht in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53432:196"/>
which have provided that every thing act
conſonantly to the rules of their own natures.
Beſides which, ſuch an irreſiſtible impulſe as this,
defeats the doctrine of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For who is rewarded for actions that
are prefectly anothers, or who is puniſh'd for
what he could not help? And if grace be ſuch a
force as makes men good irreſiſtibly, and this
Grace beſtow'd only on one here, and another
there, meerly as arbitrary Will ſhall diſpoſe it;
the greateſt part of men (for ought I ſee) will
have fair apology for their ſins, at leaſt for their
neglects, ſince they wanted that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to make them better, and God alone could
have given them.</p>

                        <p>was the Apology of the Heathen, and might be
all mens elſe upon this ſuppoſal. And to this
I add, that ſuch a notion of Gods grace, lays a
foundation for ſloth and remiſſion of all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
For whoever believes that the grace of God
where it comes is like a mighty current that bears
down all before it, irreſiſtibly forceth our wills
to a compliance, and makes ſuch ſudden and
miraculous changes upon our natures: I ſay
whoever believes this, and thinks alſo that this
grace is neceſſary to make him good and happy,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53432:197"/>
and that nothing he can do can obtain it, or
draw it near him; what can we expect, but that
ſuch a man ſhould neglect all care and diligence in
order to the making himſelf better, in expectation
of this neceſſary irreſiſtible Grace, without which
his endeavours are at the beſt impertinent? and
who is ſo ridiculous to digg for the wind to
fill his Sails, or to endeavour to ſet to Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it?</p>
                        <p>We ſee then how the fulneſs and glory of the
divine grace have been undermined by plauſible
and dangerous conceits that have crept into the
world under the notion of free grace, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to God, and injurious to the intereſt of
mens Souls. And this is the ſecond device I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to detect.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly then, another deſign Satan manageth
againſt Gods glory, is to diſparage and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
his Spirit, which he doth by aſcribing to
it the fooliſh, and ſometimes wicked impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the fond and extravagant conceits of the
ſons of imagination. For as of old when
he perceived he could not overcome the belief
and acknowledgement of a Deity: He multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gods, and Deified things of the meaneſt and
vileſt rank and nature; even ſtocks and ſtones,
vices and diſeaſes: in like manner perceiving
now that he cannot hinder the influence of the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53432:197"/>
Spirit of God from being acknowledg'd in the
world: He crys up every folly and hot imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for the work of the Spirit: He entitles it
to boyling paſſion, under the name of zeal, and
to the diſeaſes of mens fancies, melancholy, and
phrenſie under the name of the Spirits motions.
Thus when kindled melancholly hath inflamed
the imagination with hot and ſcalding conceits,
and the fired Fancy gets into the Revelations,
opens the Seals, pours out the Viols, and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically
interprets the Fates of Kingdoms; when
'tis mounted on the Wings of the Wind, flys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Clouds, and flutters there in Myſtical non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,
when it flows into the tongue in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
ramble, and abuſeth the name and word
of God, mingling it with canting, unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
babble; I ſay, when the diſeaſed and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
Fancy thus variouſly diſplays it ſelf, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
makes men believe they are acted by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and that thoſe wild agitations of ſick imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are divine motions.</p>
                        <p>And when this fire is deſcended from the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the affections, and theſe, being extreamly
moved by thoſe vain and proud conceits, cauſe
tremblings and foamings, convulſions and ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
in the body (all which are but natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
if not worſe, and juſt ſuch as were thoſe
odd ecſtatical motions of the Devils Prieſts, when
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53432:198"/>
they came foaming from his Altars.) Theſe I
ſay the ſame wicked Deſigner hath taught theſe
wild Phantaſticks blaſphemouſly to aſcribe to the
bleſſed, and adorable Spirit. And when, their
fancies being full of turgid notions and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in an ecſtaſie, they dream of ſtrange ſights,
voices, and wonderful diſcoveries, which are
nothing but the unquiet agitations of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
brains. Theſe alſo Satan perſwades
them to be divine Revelations, and effects of
the Spirit of God ſhewing it ſelf miraculouſly in
them.</p>
                        <p>Briefly then and in ſumm: Every humour
and Fantaſtick unaccountable motion hath by
this device been repreſented as the work of
that Spirit, to which they are moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.
Thus when warm and brisk Sanguine
preſents a chearful Scene, and fills the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with pleaſant dreams, theſe are taken
for divine illapſes, for the joys and incomes of
the Holy Ghoſt. When heated Melancholly
hath kindled the buſie and active fancy; the
Enthuſiaſt then talks of Illuminations, New
Lights, Revelations, and many wonderful fine
things, which are aſcribed to the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
But when Flegm predominates, and
quencheth the Fantaſtick Fire, rendering the
mad man more dull, lumpiſh and unactive;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53432:198"/>
then the Spirit is withdrawn, and the man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſpiritual darkneſs and deſertion. And
when again choler is boiled up into rage and
fury, againſt every thing that is not of the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick
cut and meaſure, this alſo is preſumed
to be an holy fervour kindled by that Spirit,
whoſe real fruits are Gentleneſs and Love.</p>
                        <p>Thus then doth the Devil deviſe to diſgrace the
Spirit of God and its influence, by thoſe numerous,
vile, and vain pretenſions, which he thinks a
likely means to extirpate the belief of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of the Spirit, and to render it ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                        <p>But again (4.) Satan deviſeth againſt Gods
own glory by deſigning againſt his worſhip.
Which he doth by endeavouring to deſtroy its
reverence under pretence of Spirituality. God
requires to be glorified in body, and in ſoul,
which are his, and Satan ſets the worſhip of
one againſt the other, that he may deſtroy both.
Thus when under the Law Religion required the
Pomp and Solemnity of external Rites and
Uſages, the ſubtle deſigner drives it on in that
method ſo far, that at laſt the Spirit of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was loſt in the ceremony, and the life and
ſubſtance in the circumſtance. But when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
came into the world to aboliſh that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
oeconomy in order to the eſtabliſhing a
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53432:199"/>
more ſpiritual frame of Worſhip, then doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
turn with the Tyde, and puts on the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of a Zealot for Spirituality, which he
proſecutes ſo far, till at laſt in the Gnoſticks and
other aiery Hereticks, he had run Religion out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
meer empty Fantaſtick Notionality. In like
manner where in theſe latter ages the world
hath been diſabuſed, and hath detected the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the formal outſide Religion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
There doth the deſigner fall in with the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
ſets up for a Reformer, and mightily
contends for the Spirituality of Worſhip. He
gets into the Pulpit, and there with hot and
ſweating zeal he crys up the purity, the purity
of Religion, and never leaves canting on the
ſubject till he hath fired mens tongues againſt
every matter of decency and order, as formal
and <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> And when he is ſhut out of
thoſe high places, he creeps into corners, and
inflames the Spirits of the zealous and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
againſt all harmleſs circumſtances of
Reverence and Decorum. And ſo far hath
he prevailed in this device, as to drive thoſe
of warm affections, and weak heads, from
all due external Reverence to God and things
Sacred. For theſe well-meaning people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frighted by the terrible noiſe of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Antichriſtianiſm, Superſtition, (things
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53432:199"/>
they have learnt to hate, but not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand)
boggle, and fly off from every thing
their furious Guides have marked with this
abhorred Character. And thus a rude and
ſlovenly kind of Religion hath made its way
into the world, and ſuch a ſordid carleſneſs
in matters of divine worſhip, that ſhould a
ſtranger come into the aſſemblies that are acted
by this Spirit. He could not by their carriage
imagine what they were a doing; and that
they were about holy Offices, would perhaps
be one of the laſt things he could conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
Thus bold and ſawcy talk hath crept
into mens prayers, under the pretence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
familiarity with God, nauſeous impertinent
bawling, under the cover of praying by the
Spirit, and all kind of irreverences in external
demeanour, under the ſhelter of a pretended
Spiritual worſhip.</p>
                        <p>And thus the deſign of Satan is ſucceſsfully
carried on in the world, which is, to ſubtilize
Religion till he hath deſtroyed it. To make
it inviſible that he may make it nothing.
And this is another way whereby be betrays
thoſe who are <hi>Ignorant of his Devices.</hi> And thus
I have diſpatcht the firſt General, <hi>viz.</hi> Satans
Devices againſt Gods glory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="390" facs="tcp:53432:200"/>
From which I deſcend to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi>
Satans devices againſt the Peace of the Church,
which, while it ſtands in its main and united
body, is like a mighty mountain unconcern'd in
the tumults in the air, while the bluſtering winds
and tempeſts aſſault, but cannot prejudice or
diſorder it. And therefore the Deſigner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to divide, what he cannot deal with
in its knit and combined ſtrength: He ſtrives
to crumble it into Sects and Atoms, that this
mountain may become an heap of Sands,
which he may blow up and down, and ſcatter
with his winds, and ſo at laſt become a plain
before him. For which Deſign he hath two
main inſtruments and Devices, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical
Pride under the cover of Religious
ſtrictneſs: And (2.) Intemperate Heat, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of Holy and Divine Zeal.
Theſe are the chief Engines for the dividing
purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>(1.) Then he hatches, and foſters a Spirit
of Pride and Sectarian Inſolence, (a ſure and
fatal Divider) under the ſpecious pretence of
Religious ſtrictneſs. For where he perceives
he cannot ſucceed in his deſigns of debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world, and propagating open prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Impiety: He ſhifts his ſhape, puts
on the cloathing of light, and wraps himſelf in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53432:200"/>
a Cloak ſpun of ſtrict and ſevere pretenſions;
and in this habit puts himſelf among the proud
and conceited Profeſſors. Theſe he and their
own vanity gild and adorn, with all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
names and priviledges of the Goſpel; and
when they have incircled their heads with their
own Fantaſtick Rays, and are ſwoln in their
imaginations, with a tympany of ridiculous
greatneſs: They then proudly contemn all, but
their darling ſelves, under the notion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
the moral, and the wicked; and ſcornfully
pity the poor and carnal world, that is, all that
are not arrived to their conceited pitch and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
and now having thus dignified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and debaſed others, they herd together,
draw the Church into their little corners, and
proudly withdraw from the Communion of
others, who have leſs conceit, though more
Chriſtianity. They bid us ſtand off, leſt we
pollute them with our unhallowed approaches,
and having made us as the Heathen and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
they cry, <hi>Come out from among them.</hi> The
true Church, Soundneſs of Judgement, Purity
of Doctrine, and of worſhip (if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them) is confined to their Gange; juſt as
it was to the corners of <hi>Africa</hi> of old, when their
friends the Gnoſticks were there. Thus they
ſwell and ſwagger in their fantaſtick imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53432:201"/>
till ſome other Sect as well conceited as
themſelves endeavour to take their Plumes from
them, and to appropriate theſe glorious Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
unto their own party; and then they buſtle
and contend, Here's the Church crys one, nay
but 'tis here crys another, till a third gives the
lye to them both, and then the ſcuffle grows
warm of Pride againſt Hypocriſie, and the ſelf-conceit
of one Sect againſt the Pride of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all againſt ſobriety and truth: and
thus is the Church divided, the intereſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
weakned, and the world prepared for Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</p>
                        <p>But (2.) Another inſtrument and Device,
Satan uſeth to imbroil the Church, is Fantaſtick
heat under the name and notion of divine zeal.
Fire is a ſubtile and powerful Divider, and no
fire like that which is ſuppoſed to come from
the Altar, though it be but a paſſionate flame
kindled in a fiery temper that is only tinctured
with Religion. For every thing that is hot and
vehement about Religious matters wears the
name and Livery of Zeal; and Zeal when 'tis
directed by good Principles, to the ends of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and vertue, is a noble and generous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
but when 'tis actuated by ignorance and
evil principles, and hurried on by blind impulſes,
to the ends of rage and animoſity, 'tis a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53432:201"/>
and killing evil. And like a fire-brand in
a Magazine of powder, which deſtroys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction, and blows up every thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
the fury of its motion. This then being
fair in its pretence, and miſchievous in its effects,
Satan uſeth in his deſigns of dividing. He kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
ſome little Religious warmths in eager and
violent Conſtitutions, and blows the Coals till
natural paſſion be concerned and fired: So that
at laſt what was at firſt only a ſpark of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becomes a mighty flame of Rage. Then
breaks he out upon the Church with this holy Fire,
deſtroys that Charity which is the bond of peace,
and fills all with ſmoak and vapour, darkneſs
and confuſion. He Chriſtens this <hi>Jehu</hi>-like fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a Zeal for God, and declaims againſt every
thing that is ſober and temperate, as luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and indifference. He gets into the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
(who have many grains of Rage for one of

the Communion of the Church, crept into
houſes, led captive ſilly men, and ſilly women;
privily brought in <hi>damnable Hereſies, even to the

from the faith to follow fables, dreams, and
ſenſleſs imaginations. Such there were then, and
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that there muſt be Hereſies,
1 Cor. 11. 19. The luſts and various corruptions
of men, in conjunction with the permiſſions of
God, make them unavoidable. Some of the
firſt we read of in the Chriſtian Church, were
the Judaizing Chriſtians, who taught the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of retaining the Moſaical law, the denyers
of the Reſurrection, and the vile Gnoſticks who
under pretence of more knowledge, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
priviledges, abuſed Chriſtian Liberty to all
licentiouſneſs, and vileneſs of living, making
ſhipwrack both of Faith and Conſcience. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

write in their Epiſtles, and this of our
Apoſtle St. <hi>Jude,</hi> is all directed againſt that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.
In oppoſition to which, writing of the
Common Salvation, he ſaith, it was needful to
write unto them (the true Catholicks) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort

                        </p>
                        <p>This was needful in his days, and 'tis certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as neceſſary in ours, in which all the old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
are revived, with the addition of new, on
which account the ſubject is too ſeaſonable, and
I choſe it at this time, as a Preface to the diſcourſes,
I intend on all the main Principles of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, as I have already treated, in order,
on all the Principal heads of the Natural,</p>
                        <p>In the words read, two main propoſitions are
implyed.</p>
                        <p>1. That there was a Faith anciently deliver'd
to the Saints.</p>
                        <p>2. That all Chriſtians are bound to contend,
and earneſtly, for that Faith which was deliver'd
to thoſe Saints.</p>
                        <p>I begin with the Firſt. There was a Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
to the Saints. Now aimidſt the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
and contrariety of opinions, that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
are in the Chriſtian Church, each entitling
it ſelf to the Faith that was originally deliver'd
to the Saints, it may ſeem a matter of difficulty
to determine which is the right, the true Faith:
which difficulty doth not ariſe ſo much from the
nature of the thing, as it doth from mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
intereſts and affections, diſputing about it.
And therefore abſtracting from theſe, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53432:205"/>
to ſet before you, the chief Characters
of the true Faith, by which you may judge what
that is, and where it is to be found.</p>
                        <p>And 1. The Faith we treat of, is an Ancient,
Primitive Faith. <hi>Quod verum id prius:</hi> Truth
was from the beginning. Divers of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
with which our Saviour hath enlightned
every one that cometh into the world, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his perſonal appearance in it. <hi>Before Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
was I am,</hi> ſaith <hi>He;</hi> and <hi>Abraham ſaw</hi> his <hi>day,</hi>
the diſcovery of his great truths and ways. He
was <hi>the Author and Finiſher of our Faith:</hi> In
him it begun; and it was conſummate in
his perſonal teaching and inſtructions of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Diſciples and Apoſtles, who by the
Spirit deliver'd to us what they had received
from him. Natural Truths are more and more
diſcover'd by time: For many go to and fro,
and Science ſhall be encreaſed. But thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
verities are moſt perfect in their fountain
and original. They contract impurities in
their ſtreams and remote derivations; and the
way to diſcover the corruptions is to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the old ways, and ſee how it was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                        <p>By this Character of the Faith; that of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church is condemn'd. For all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and uſages of that Church that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53432:205"/>
and oppoſed by ours, are in compariſon
Novelties and Innovations; and whatever Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
they pretend to, they were not primitive.
Their Image-Worſhip, Invocation of Saints,
Half-Communion, and Prayer in an unknown
tongue, are directly, palpably contrary to the
Holy Scriptures: Their pretended Infallibility,
and Univerſality, their Indulgences, Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Tranſubſtantiation, with divers others
of their Doctrines, and uſages are by plain
conſequence condemn'd by thoſe Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
which are the repoſitory of the ancient
Faith and Practice; and both the one and the
other were unknown to the firſt and pureſt times,
thoſe of the firſt three hundred, nay ſix hundred
years: which aſſertions, I have in this place
particularly and largely made good; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of our Learned Divines have in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
fully proved it: Nor is there any one
thing which we condemn in the <hi>Roman</hi> belief
or practice, but what hath aroſe by the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of times, long ſince the beginning; and
indeed in the the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is an
eternal fountain of Innovations, in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they aſſume, of declaring; that is in good
earneſt, in making new Articles of Faith. So
that their people can never know when they
have all; new things may ſtill be obtruded
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53432:206"/>
as neceſſary and eſſential, without end.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, the Character of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
condemns the Sects alſo. Among them
there are ſome old Hereſies received, but their
principles and practices, as oppoſite to thoſe of
our Church of <hi>England,</hi> were not in the firſt,
beſt times. <hi>Presbytery, Independency, Anabaptiſm,
Quakeriſm</hi> may have been here, and there of old in
the brains of ſome particular conceited men, but
never were in any general practice any where; the
eldeſt not two hundred years ago; and ſome have
aroſe in our own time. Their ways they pretend
to, be contain'd in the holy Scriptures; and if
ſo, we would preſently acknowledge them to
be Primitive: But they are in the Scriptures,
only as thoſe are interpreted by their private
Spirits; that is, not there, but in the fancies of
the Innovators; and theſe being their guide, in
interpreting, Lo! here alſo is a fountain of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
novellizing. And as long as the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of men can frame novelties, we ſhall
never be at the end of new Sects.</p>
                        <p>We have ſeen the riſe of ſome in our late
times of confuſions, and if ever we ſhould be ſo
unhappy as to ſee ſuch again (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid)
in all likelihood from the ſame Source;
other new, yet unheard of, Sects and Hereſies
would ariſe, to the further dividing of the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53432:206"/>
Chncurh, ad ſcandal of Religion. There is nothing
ſo pregnant with Novelties as imagination, and
the Sectarian private Spirit is no better nor worſe
than Fancy. I deny not, but theſe, all ſorts of them,
do retain ſome of the Primitive Doctrines, as
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church alſo doth; but their opinions
and ways that are oppoſite to the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
are not ſuch.</p>
                        <p>This our Church, without fondneſs or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening,
I may ſay, doth profeſs and teach the
Ancient, Apoſtolical, Primitive Chriſtianity,
and hath admitted no new things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it. It was reformed according to the
Scriptures; the Scriptures, as they are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by the firſt General Councils, and Fathers,
thoſe next the Apoſtles, who, we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
underſtood beſt what were their doctrines
and ways.</p>
                        <p>This Church in its conſtitutions is therefore
truly ancient, ſo in every main, every conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thing; and truly Proteſtant, proteſting
both againſt Roman and Sectarian Innovations.</p>
                        <p>2. Another Character of <hi>the Faith delivered
to the</hi> ancient <hi>Saints,</hi> is, that it was pure: 'Twas
delivered to the Saints, and it made them ſuch.
The wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure.
It teacheth and produceth Purity, Holineſs,
and real Goodneſs, in Heart and Life. The
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53432:207"/>
buſineſs of it is to conform us unto God, and
to make us like him: And the Lord our God
is holy.</p>
                        <p>And by this Character alſo is Popery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd.
For this teacheth ſome direct impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and immoralities, and by the conſequence
of ſome other of its Doctrines, the neceſſity of
Reformation of life, is quite taken away; the
Reins are laid on mens necks, and Gods Laws
are made void by their traditions.</p>
                        <p>Of the firſt ſort are their Idolatries, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints and Angels, which God both
in the Old Teſtament and the New, hath ſo
earneſtly declared againſt; as the higheſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to his Majeſty, and affront to his Glory;
and which he ſtigmatizeth as the greateſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities;
and frequently calls Fornication and
Whoredome; they are ſpiritually ſo: Likewiſe
their doctrines and practices of depoſing and
murdering of Princes, and abſolving the people
from their Allegiance, their diſpenſing with
Perjuries, Rebellions, and other ſorts of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
are higheſt immoralities, and moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian;
that is, moſt contrary to the Spirit,
Genius, and deſigns of the holy Jeſus, which
were to redeem unto himſelf <hi>a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of good works.</hi> Beſides which direct and
point blank oppoſitions, to the Chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53432:207"/>
and Rules, they ſtrike at the root and main
deſign of Chriſtianity, by thoſe their doctrines
that render repentance and change of life unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                        <p>For according to them, the favour of God
and eternal Salvation may be had upon eaſier
terms: Croſſings, Pilgrimages, <hi>Ave Maries,</hi>
Whippings, Faſtings, with Confeſſion and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
will do the buſineſs. There is no
need of cutting off right hands, of plucking out
of right eyes, and mortifying the body, in our
Saviours ſpiritual ſence; that is, of ſubduing
and reſcinding all inordinate appetites and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
(which are the great difficulties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
the bodily exerciſes will ſuffice; we may be
ſafe, and Sainted without obedience to thoſe
hard ſayings. Or, if the other things ſhould
be omitted, 'tis but going to Purgatory at laſt,
and if you have money to leave for Maſſes and
Dirge's, you are ſecure of being pray'd out
thence. So that here the greateſt deſign of the
Goſpel, which is real, inward holineſs, and
purity, is deſtroyed: And without holineſs 'tis
here made poſſible to ſee God. And this is the
worſt thing that any thing that pretends to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
can be guilty of.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand the Sects, whatever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and ſpirituality they pretend, do many,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53432:208"/>
moſt of them, teach doctrines, and walk in
ways that are contrary to the purity of heart and
life, that becomes a Chriſtian. The Gnoſticks, who
were ſome of the firſt Fanaticks in the Chriſtian
Church, pretended that they were the ſpiritual,
the pure people, and that all things to them
were pure, on which account they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to all Immorality and filthineſs: <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>having not the Spirit.</hi> They
denyed there was any moral good and evils in
the nature of things, and eſtimate of God. And
this Hereſie is received among ſome of our Sects,
God they think and ſay, ſees no ſin in them his
elect people. He loves not for the ſake of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and vertue, but freely, that is, for no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but meer unaccountable will; and if ſo,
'tis in vain to amend our lives, to live ſoberly,
righteouſly, and godly, in order to our acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance
with him: Though we are the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in all manner of evil converſation, we
may yet be his beloved, his choſen: This hath
the malignity of the worſt of Popery or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm.
And ſuch a Principle is among ſome
of the Sects: I accuſe not all others that do not
affirm ſo much as this, do in a manner make
good works unneceſſary: Faith, their airy Faith,
that preſcinds from moral goodneſs is all. All
is believing, receiving, truſting, relying; which
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53432:208"/>
are great duties, parts of Faith, but this, as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
implys more, <hi>viz.</hi> an entire obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Goſpel. Such a Faith as this is that
which St. <hi>James</hi> writes ſo earneſtly againſt, as
dead, and unſignifying (of it ſelf alone) to the
purpoſe of Juſtification, and acceptance with
God. Again the imputed Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt, is a great truth rightly underſtood, but
by divers Sectaries 'tis abuſed to this falſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all Righteouſneſs that Chriſt wrought,
is formally and properly ours, as if we had done
it: So that we may be holy and vertuous by
his holineſs, though we have none of our own,
contrary to that of St. <hi>John, Little Children, let no
man deceive you, he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous,
even as he is righteous. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 7. But theſe fancy they
are righteous, without doing Righteouſneſs: if
they can lay hold on Chriſt, roll upon him, (as
they phraſe it) and firmly believe that he is theirs,
they are then compleatly righteous, by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his, though they have none of their own:
which <hi>Solifidian, Antinomian</hi> Notions, that are
lately ſpread among the Sects, place Religion in
the fancy, as the Popiſh Doctrines do in ſome
external ſervices; and as effectually as theirs,
take away the neceſſity of real reformation,
and true goodneſs. I might add a great deal
more under this head, as their Doctrines of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53432:209"/>
by which they excuſe themſelves in
their Spiritual ſins, their decrying morality, as a
dull, low, graceleſs thing, the immoral pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Schiſm, Diſobedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they
indulge and defend themſelves in. Theſe are
impurities that are contrary <hi>to that Faith which was
once deliver'd to the Saints.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But now the Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth all
the duties we owe to God, our Neighbour, and
our ſelves, in the juſt latitude and extent of
them. It hath no ſhifts or evaſions of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Reformation. It allows no hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
but upon thoſe terms. It teacheth no pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
that is impious, or immoral, nor indulgeth
any; whoever is an evil man in this Church, knows
he is ſo, by his own Principles he is condemn'd; and
hath no hopes of Salvation, but what are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on effectual Repentance, and Reformation.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>The Faith deliver'd to the Saints</hi> is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Thoſe Saints were ſo; Sheep, Lambs,
Doves. Such was their Lord, <hi>the Prince of
Peace,</hi> and his Religion, the wiſdome from
above <hi>pure and peaceable.</hi> By this Character al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Popery is confuted, which tends to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
both of Eccleſiaſtical, and civil peace.
The former, the peace of the Church, they
pretend to have beſt provided for, by the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Infallibility they have erected in theirs.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53432:209"/>
And by theſe all Controverſies in Religion,
are (they tell us) quickly ended. But the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
on't is, that that which ſhould end the
Controverſies, is it ſelf, one, and the greateſt.
They have an effectual Engine for Union, but
they themſelves are not agreed where it is; and
they are incurably divided about this their ground
of uniting. For ſome place the Supremacy and
Infallibility in the Pope, ſome in the Council,
ſome in both; and this hath not been only the
oppoſition of petty Doctors and Diſputers, but
Church is againſt Church: The <hi>French</hi> and the
<hi>German</hi> for one; and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>Italian</hi>
for another: Yea Pope hath decreed againſt
Pope in this matter; and Pope and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council againſt Pope and General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Lo! here is the Catholick Union, the
certain and infallible way of ending Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
in Religion. A way they have, but
they cannot find it: Yea, they are together by
the ears about that Infallible way of ending all
ſtrife. And notwithſtanding this rare receipt
that is in their hands, the diſeaſe, the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and diſputes of their ſeveral diſorders,
remains ſtill uncured. And indeed that Church
hath laid a foundation for everlaſting differences
and diſagreements, by bringing numerary, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative,
and doubtful Tenents into their Creeds;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53432:210"/>
an Engine for endleſs diviſions. There is no
poſſible uniting, but upon the few, main, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Articles contain'd in the Primitive Creeds.
Additions to theſe are the chief grounds of the
Diviſions of Chriſtendome. So that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church provides not for Eccleſiaſtical Peace,
but deſtroys it by its diſputable Articles of
Faith; and further ſo, by its other intollerable
terms of Communion, the various Idolatries
and Superſtitions it impoſeth, by which they
drive the beſt and moſt intelligent Chriſtians
from them: And ſo are themſelves the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
They make the breaches in the Church
they complain of. And for civil peace, 'tis
clear in all Hiſtories, that the Popes, and their
Agents and Emiſſaries (eſpecially the Jeſuites)
have been the great embroylers and Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Chriſtendome: The combuſtions and
troubles of every nation in it, can ſadly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
this. The fore-mention'd Doctrines of
Depoſing Kings, and abſolving the people from
their Allegiance, are principles of everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
and diſturbance.</p>
                        <p>But let us look on the other ſide. How is it
with the Sects in reſpect of peaceableneſs? why,
they may ſay unto ſtrife, <hi>Thou art our Mother,</hi> and
to Feuds and Animoſities, <hi>you have brought us into
the world.</hi> Unpeaceableſs of principles, and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53432:210"/>
temper, breed and maintain them. They are
broken from the Church, and divided each from
other, and amongſt themſelves ſubdivided,
minc't almoſt into Atoms. There is nothing
but endleſs diviſions, animoſities, jarrings, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
among them: <hi>The ways of peace they have
not known,</hi> they will not know. They have
cauſleſly ſeparated from the Communion of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and for the ſame reaſons muſt
have left the Fellowſhip of the Saints menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in the Text, and of all the Chriſtians of
the Primitive times, to whom both in doctrine
and many practices, they are moſt unlike.</p>
                        <p>And upon the ſame principles, new Sects
grow out of them, that divided firſt, and more
evils ſpring from thoſe others from time to time,
to the worlds end. I deny not but that there
are diverſe miſled abuſed perſons of peaceable,
and quiet Spirits, drawn in among them, and we
are to pray, and to endeavour that ſuch may be
regain'd; and if the Government ſhould think
fit to abate ſome leſſer things in conſideration of
ſuch, to ſatisfie and recover them, it would be
charity and kindneſs, that I know not who would
diſlike. But thoſe that are of the right Sectarian
ſtamp and temper, will never reſt, or ſettle any
where, nor be ſatisfied with any conceſſion.
God Almighty may change their hearts and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53432:211"/>
minds by his power, but nothing leſs can; and
all that we can do is to pray to him for them:
Nothing leſs than their whole wills, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
ſubjection to their fancies, will content them:
and if thoſe were granted, we could not be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
they would pleaſe them long; nothing
uſeth to do ſo. <hi>They are Clouds carried about with
winds,</hi> Jude v. 12. Let the wind be where it
will to day, no one can ſay from what point it
will blow to morrow. They are acted by a
private Spirit that is as little certain: The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
it ſuggeſts are numerous, and all account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
divine and ſacred, (Gods truth, Goſpel
ways) they muſt not be parted with, or ſilenc't;
no, all Laws and Conſtitutions of Government
muſt be thwarted, overthrown rather: Love
and Peace and all muſt be ſacrificed to the Idols;
which being ſo, what quietneſs can there be
from hence? what peace or temper among ſuch
principles? Theſe perpetually annoy, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
the Church; and to know what they do
in the State, let us conſider <hi>Germany, Scotland,</hi>
and 'tis to be hoped (though we have frail me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
on this ſide) we ſhall not forget how
peaceable the Sectaries have been in <hi>England,</hi> or
not obſerve how quiet they are at this day. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I hope we ſhall for Caution; I urge no
other remembrance. I wiſh they themſelves
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53432:211"/>
did not remember them ſo well, as we find they
do by many of the ſame actions and diſcourſes:
That Kings hold from the people; are only
Truſtees for them, and may be reſiſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
when they fail in that truſt, are Politicks
that do not much tend to civil peace, and we
know whoſe Principles thoſe were; and we
have no great reaſon to think they have quitted
them. I can give but brief hints of things that
would afford matter enough to fill Volumes,
as both Popiſh and Sectarian diſloyalty, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
and diſturbances would do. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
theſe mens ſecrets let not our Souls come.</p>
                        <p>The Church that we (ſome of us at leaſt)
profeſs our ſelves to be members of, teacheth
no unpeaceable doctrines, is guilty of no ſuch
practices. It impoſeth no Articles on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
as neceſſary to our Salvation, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Creeds; no terms of Communion, but
ſuch reaſonable orders and decencies as are free
from all appearance of Idolatry and Superſtition,
or any thing elſe that is unlawful; as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to any rational man, that ſhall take the
pains to conſider, and will judge impartially: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is more burthenſome or grievous, than
the Rites and uſages of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church were; which aſſertions I have in this
place lately proved, and divers of our Divines
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53432:212"/>
in their books have fully done it, to the ſhame
of Fanatical Gainſayers. As to the concerns of
civil peace, our Church, with Chriſt and his
Apoſtles, teacheth active, chearful, conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
obedience to the King, and ſubordinate Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in all lawful things, and quiet ſubmiſſion
to the penalties of not obeying, when the things
required are unlawful, plainly, certainly ſo:
And that we are not in this, nor in any caſe to
reſiſt. Suitable to this have been the practices
of the people of this peaceable Church: Among
whom there hath not yet been found a Rebel.
We never heard of a Church of <hi>England</hi>-man in
the late wars againſt the King, nor of a Sectary
for him.</p>
                        <p>But 4. <hi>The Faith deliver'd to the Saints,</hi> was a
reaſonable Faith; <hi>the underſtanding of man is the
Candle of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 20. 27. The light of Reaſon
is his light; with this <hi>The true light</hi> hath <hi>enlightned
every one that cometh into the world, Joh.</hi> 1. 9. and one
light is not contrary to another, there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in degree, but no oppoſition of Nature.
Faith and Reaſon accord: Yea, Faith is an act
of Reaſon: 'tis the higheſt reaſon to believe in
God: and the belief of our reaſon, is an act of
Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith in the truth and goodneſs of
God, that would not give us faculties to delude
and deceive us, when we rightly exerciſe and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53432:212"/>
employ them. By Faith Reaſon is further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
and by the uſe of Reaſon Faith is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.
Religion and Reaſon ſweetly agree;
and nothing can be Religious that is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Religion is a reaſonable ſervice. And
by this Character Popery is diſproved alſo. For
that impoſeth on the practice and minds of men,
things that are extreamly unreaſonable and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
as Articles of Religion: Such are the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of inviſible beings, by Images of Wood or
Stone, and eſpecially the Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
which is full of Contradictions; as that
the ſame body can be in a thouſand places at once;
that at the ſame time it may be bigger, and leſs
than it ſelf; that it may move towards and from it
ſelf; That it may be divided not into parts, but
wholes: Theſe, and numerous other abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and contradictions, to the reaſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are contain'd in the ſenſleſs myſtery of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Tranſubſtantiation. To defend which, the
Doctors of that Church are put upon this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſhift of denying all reaſon in Religion,
even the greateſt and moſt fundamental Article
of it, <hi>That the ſame thing can be, and not be:</hi>
which ſome of them ſay is the only method to
confute Hereticks. And while Reaſon and our
Faculties are acknowledg'd, we cannot entertain
their non-ſence, nor be anſwer'd in our juſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53432:213"/>
of their groſs abſurdities.</p>
                        <p>On the other ſide, the Character of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Faith condemns the Sects, the greateſt part
of whoſe Divinity is made up of ſenſleſs, abſurd
notions, ſet forth in unintelligible Fantaſtical
Phraſes; and theſe they account the heights of
ſpirituality and myſtery, upon which they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
and boaſt themſelves, as the only knowing,
the only ſpiritual people. When there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in all their pretended heights and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualities,
but vain imagination and dreaming;
and in <hi>v.</hi> 8. of this Epiſtle they are deſcribed by
this Character, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Dreamers. And as
the light of Senſe and Reaſon diſpels the vain
Images of Dreams, ſo theſe admitted would cure
Fanatical impoſtures and deluſions. For which
cauſe there is nothing they ſo vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
againſt as Reaſon, under the notion of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and as an enemy to the Spirit, and the things
of it. There is indeed a carnal Reaſon, that is
enmity to truth and goodneſs; but that is not
the reaſon of our minds, but the reaſon
of our appetite, paſſion, and corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
which is not reaſon truly ſo called, no
more than an Ape is a man. But for want of
thus diſtinguiſhing the things that ſo differ, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts
rail violently againſt all Reaſon, as the
grand adverſary of the truths and myſteries of the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53432:213"/>
Goſpel. Their Tenents that ſhe calls ſo will not
bear that light.</p>
                        <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth no opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
no myſteries that need ſuch a deſperate
courſe to defend them. Its Articles of Faith are
all contain'd in the Ancient Chriſtian Creeds,
which are no way oppoſite to Reaſon in any
Article, yea, Reaſon either proves or defends
them all. So that we never give out at this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
but are ready to uſe it upon all occaſions
againſt Atheiſts and Infidels of all ſorts. The
Church of <hi>England</hi> owns no Religion but what is
reaſonable.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>The Faith deliver'd to the Saints</hi> was certain;
it was deliver'd to them by thoſe that had it
from the holy Spirit of God, in the way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
inſpiration. Thoſe holy men ſpake as
they were inſpired. And that they were really
ſo, was no fond imagination, or bold preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
but a truth aſſured by thoſe mighty mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
they were enabled to perform. Thoſe are
Gods Seal, and the grand confirmation of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from him: and to this proof of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
both Chriſt and his Apoſtles continually
appealed. Here is the firm reaſonable Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Chriſtian certainty: The truths we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
are confirmed by Miracles, than which
there can be no greater evidence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="418" facs="tcp:53432:214"/>
But now the <hi>Roman</hi> Church deſtroys this
ground of certainty by a multitude of lying
wonders, which they impudently obtrude upon
the belief of the people, for proof and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of their falſe and corrupt Religion;
the immediate conſequence of which is a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
thereby brought upon the true Miracles;
and here is way made for Scepticiſm and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in the greateſt, and moſt Sacred Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctrines. And beſides, the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> having introduced among theſe many
doubtful, uncertain, and many certainly falſe
opinions, and impoſed them upon the faith of
its votaries, under the ſame obligations as it
doth the moſt fundamental Articles; what can
be the conſequence, but that thoſe who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the errour, or uncertainty of ſome of thoſe
pretended propoſitions of Faith, ſhould doubt all
the reſt? And indeed ſince the main aſſurance
is placed in the Infallibility of that Church,
for which there is ſo no reaſon, and ſo much
plain evidence to the contrary: Since them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
cannot tell where that boaſted Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is, whether in Pope or Council, if we ſhould
allow them any ſuch, it follows that their Faith
is precarious, and hath no foundation at all.</p>
                        <p>In like manner the Sects among us reſolve all
their aſſurance either into a bare belief, or the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53432:214"/>
of a private Spirit; for their ground of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting
the Scriptures is but this Teſtimony; and
conſequently whatever they receive from hence
bottoms here. The Papiſts believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
on the Teſtimony of the Church, and
theſe believe them on the Teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is in earneſt, the ſuggeſtions and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of their own, <hi>viz.</hi> they believe becauſe
they will believe, and they find themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
unto it.</p>
                        <p>And upon the ſame reaſon, when the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and humour alters they may ceaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
or believe the contrary. And there is
not any thing in the world more various and
uncertain than the ſuggeſtions and impulſes of a
private Spirit. Beſides, the Sects alſo have vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
multiplied Articles of Faith, and made all
their private opinions ſacred, calling them Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
truths, precious truths, ſaving truths, and
the like; when they are but uncertainties at
the beſt, and uſually falſe, and ſenſleſs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
by which way alſo they expoſe the whole
body of Chriſtian Principles to ſuſpicion, and ſo
weaken the Faith of ſome, and deſtroy the Faith
of others.</p>
                        <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſecures the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Faith, by reſolving it into the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
the true ſeats of Infallibility, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:53432:215"/>
of that into the Teſtimony of the Spirit in
the true ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Teſtimony that God
gave by his Spirit to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in
thoſe miraculous works he enabled them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form:
They did not only bear witneſs of
themſelves, that, as our Saviour argues with the
<hi>Jews, Luk.</hi> 11. 48. would not have ſignified much:
The Father bore witneſs with them, <hi>John</hi> 15. 8.
and the works they performed by his power,
were the ſure teſtimony: <hi>Believe me for the
works ſake,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. Here is the ground
of certainty. And the Church of <hi>England</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
no Articles of Faith, but thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that have been ſo confirm'd, that is, none
but what are evidently contain'd in the Holy
Scriptures. Whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (to
mention no other) have made the abſurd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Tranſubſtantiation, ſacred, though it
is not only not contained in Scripture but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the reaſon, and even to the ſound
ſenſes of mankind. And if neither reaſon,
nor ſo much as our ſenſes, may be believ'd,
what aſſurance can we have of any thing?
A ground is here laid for everlaſting Scepticiſm
and uncertainty. And the Sects have laid the
ſame in their numerous, ſilly tenents, that are
contrary to ſome of the moſt fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reaſon. Nothing of which, can with
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53432:215"/>
any ſhew, be objected againſt this Church.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>The Faith delivered to the Saints,</hi> was Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
'Twas deliver'd to all the Saints, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by all: and was not only the opinion
and belief of a prevailing Faction, or of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men in Corners. The Commiſſion given
the Diſciples, was to go and teach all Nations,
and to preach the Goſpel to every creature, and
accordingly it was widely diffuſed, and all that
profeſt the name of Chriſt, were inſtructed in
his Faith and Religion; in all the articles and
duties of it, that were eſſential and neceſſary:
In theſe they joyn'd in holy love and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till Sects came among them, that introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
damnable Hereſies, contrary to the doctrine
they had received: Theſe divided from the
Unity of the pure Catholick Church, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
themſelves from it, gathering into ſelect
companies of their own, under pretence of more
Truth and Holineſs.</p>
                        <p>After this manner, the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
which had for ſome ages been eminent in the
Catholick Church, did at laſt corrupt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
divers unſound doctrines and uſages,
unknown to the Ancient Catholicks; and being
great and powerful, it aſſumed the name of the
Catholick Church to it ſelf, and condemn'd all
other Chriſtians as Hereticks, when it was it
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:53432:216"/>
ſelf but a grand Sect, againſt whoſe depraved
doctrines and ways, there was a Church in all
ages that did proteſt. For the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches,
which are of as large extent as theirs, never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to them; and divers other Chriſtians in
all times, bore Teſtimony againſt thoſe errours
and depravations. This Sect was large and
numerous indeed, but 'tis not the number, but
the principles, make the Catholick; Principles
conformable to thoſe that were deliver'd to the
Saints. From theſe they have departed. And
the leſſer Sects among us have done the ſame, by
the many vain additions that they have made to
the Faith, and their unjuſt Separation from that
Church, which retains the whole body of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Doctrines and main Practices; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the mixture of any thing Heretical or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
A Church that doth not damn all the
world beſides her own members, as the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, and divers of the Sects do, but extends
her Charity to all Chriſtians, though many of
them are under great miſtakes, and ſo is truly
Catholick both in her Principles and Affections,
I mean the Church of <hi>England</hi> as now eſtabliſhed
by Law, which God preſerve in its purity.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>THe more attentively we conſider the
Chriſtian Religion in any of its parts,
we find greater grounds for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
both of its Author and excellency; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
does it ſurpaſs all thoſe writings of that
nature, which the great Sages of the World,
have, with ſo much ſuperciliouſneſs on their
part, and admiration from their reſpective fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
I may add too (all things conſidered)
not without meriting due praiſe from us, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their Scholars.</p>
                  <p>And this will appear evident and undeniable
if we but parallel them in any of the chief heads;
for inſtance, in the <hi>principles</hi> upon which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
does proceed, the <hi>precepts</hi> it contains, and
the <hi>rewards</hi> it appoints; which diviſion will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the ſumm of what we profeſs: In all which
the great Maſters of Heathen wiſdom, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcover, either a great deal of Ignorance, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53432:218"/>
malice, in prevaricating that light they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
upon them from Jewiſh tradition, ſo that
it may be well doubted whether their Symbolick
Divinity were not deſign'd rather to concel their
own Ignorance in what they pretended to, than
to ſecure the rites and myſteries thereof from the
vulgar's profanation. For example:</p>
                  <p>1. Take firſt the <hi>Principles,</hi> thoſe truths that
are the Baſis and foundation of our Religion;
ſuch as are the Being and Nature of God, the
Creation of the World, the Fall of man, and
his Redemption by a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Immortality
of the Soul, and the Reſurrection; 'tis plain the
whole Philoſophick world had none, or but a
very imperfect knowledge of almoſt all of them;
However ſome, of their laviſh Charity, have
endeavour'd to ſqueeze as much from their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
Nay, that they were not without ſome
knowledge of our greateſt Myſteries, <hi>viz.</hi> of
a <hi>Meſſias</hi> under their <hi>Daimono-Latria,</hi> and even of
the Trinity in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Triad, and the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body, under the Indians <hi>Palin-geneſis:</hi>
But no body that has any veneration either for
the Scriptures, or but for Truth in general, but
muſt ſee and acknowledge that all this is but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
from them.</p>
                  <p>Nor may we deny this further, that whatever
Notions of this kind they had, were but traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53432:218"/>
in reſpect of their Origine, and conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in reference to their ambiguity and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
                  <p>2. The like is to be ſaid of their <hi>Rules</hi> and
<hi>Precepts</hi> of virtuous living. For we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
thus much from them, that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
many excellent Inſtitutes to their
Sects. You ſhall collect among them many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
admirable ſayings, ſuch as theſe;</p>
                  <p>To know our ſelves; to abſtain from vice; to bear
afflictions: to do juſtly, and ſpeak truly <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
do as we would be done by; <hi>and many more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed for that kind of Divinity which was
deducible from the Rules of common prudence
and obſervation, and depended not chiefly or
ſolely upon Divine Revelation, they have done
extraordinary well: And if they had not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
us with ſo many famous examples of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
too, it would not reflect ſo much upon the
Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, which in the ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of its precepts has as far exceeded all that
they have writ, as ſome of their Lives have moſt
of ours; though that be not to be imputed to our
Religion, unleſs it were juſtly chargeable upon
the vitioſity or defect of its Principles or Rules.</p>
                  <p>Thus miſerably however do we compenſate
the Divine culture; and as if Nature abhorring ſo
great a diſparity betwixt mankind, would thus bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53432:219"/>
the Heathen with the Chriſtian World; by
oppoſing their Imperfect Knowledge, but ſeverer
Vertue, to our diviner Laws, but greater licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Practice: Many of them having, by as great
proportions exceeded us in their endeavours after

other means of it.</p>
                  <p>3. Laſt of all (which brings it to our preſent
ſubject) Chriſtianity propounds nothing but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the faireſt and ſureſt <hi>encouragement</hi> imaginable.
For the happineſs of our Religion is both tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently
ſuperiour to their diſcoveries and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
of it; and then alſo we are ſufficiently
and unqueſtionably aſſur'd hereof, <hi>i.e.</hi> 'tis not
recommended to us upon plauſible perſwaſions
and inconcluſive arguments, but in the genuine
ſence of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expreſſions, 1 Corinth. 2. 4.
<hi>in demonſtration of the Spirit and Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that we ſee there is a kind of peculiar excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in the Holy Scriptures, above all the Syſtems
of the greateſt Moraliſts; the foundation of our
Obedience being laid upon clearer and better
principles, the practice of our obedience being
carried higher by the ſpirituality of its commands,
and the rewards of our obedience being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
greater, than what we can conceive,
much leſs could they promiſe or beſtow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53432:219"/>
'Tis the laſt of theſe that is contain'd in the
Text, and for which I am to be further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
to ye in the proſecution of the
words I have read. <hi>And I heard a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſaying unto me, Write, Bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have theſe following particulars principally
to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>1. The happineſs of good men deſcrib'd by
its <hi>general nature,</hi> they are <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and by its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral
parts, they <hi>reſt from their labours, and their works
do follow them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> upon which this
happineſs is promis'd and aſſerted, <hi>yea ſaith the
Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>time</hi> of its <hi>perfection</hi> and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
partly in this life, but not fully nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
till death, <hi>ſaying Bleſſed are the dead that

                  </p>
                  <p>4. And laſtly, the <hi>Influence</hi> which the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of theſe premiſſes ought to have upon us,
both in Life and Death, in reference to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Patience. And</p>
                  <p>I. To begin with the <hi>deſcription</hi> of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
thoſe rewards, which are propounded to us
for the encouragement of our Obedience and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
Which are ſo great, that I am utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

The nature of that Celeſtial bliſs as far tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all our preſent felicities, by which we ſhould
judge of it; as it does the very capacity of our
meriting it.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> has obſerv'd, We can have
but a very imperfect accompt of thoſe things,
which receed any whit near thoſe extreams of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
and <hi>Infinity:</hi> becauſe either by their parvity
or immenſity, they elude or confound our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>And eſpecially the latter, which choak the
underſtanding; and is like the beholding of the
Sun, whoſe light and luſtre, by which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
other objects, marrs, and dimms our
ſight.</p>
                  <p>Such is the tranſcendent excellency of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bliſs, at once the delight and amazement of
our Intellectuals.</p>
                  <p>In the deſcription whereof our higheſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are ſo far from being hyperbolical, that
they amount but to a <hi>Litotes;</hi> ſo that after our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

So inevitably ſhould we diminiſh the Glory
of Heaven, by any expreſſion, illuſtration, or

                  <p>Which happineſs of ours conſiſts of, and is

                  <p>The total privation of all evil.</p>
                  <p>And the aggregate enjoyment of all good.</p>
                  <p>Both which as they are neceſſarily requiſite to
the nature of the things, ſo are they contain'd in
the very notion of the word.</p>
                  <p>For as the plurality of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> extremity of joy;
and accordingly 'tis deſcrib'd in my Text, firſt
Privatively, and then Poſitively.</p>
                  <p>1. For the <hi>privative</hi> part, <hi>Reſt from their labours,</hi> or
which is all one, Immunity from Evil, by which
this happineſs is oft-times deſcrib'd: for though
the privation hereof ſimply and abſolutely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
no part hereof, the abſence eſpecially; for by
that reaſon you might call a ſtock or ſtone or any
other inſenſible creature happy, as by the other
a Horſe or Dog might be ſaid to be ſo when dead:
yet inaſmuch as it is more than a negation,
namely the being deliver'd from a world of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
wherewith we are now infeſted, and more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53432:221"/>
which we had deſerved, and were once obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to, which we alſo then behold in others of
the ſame make and nature with us; the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
hereof, by which it ſo widely differs from
both the Inſtances, muſt needs fill our mind with
an ineffable delight and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Or at leaſt if this indolency be no part of our
happineſs, yet is it ſo abſolutely needful to it,
that we cannot tell well how to conceive of it
without this; and much leſs can ſuch a thing be
as perfect happineſs and degrees of miſery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
together.</p>
                  <p>Nor did ever any Sect of Philoſophers think
otherwiſe, but thoſe ſullen and ſelf will'd Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks.
That ever any body ſhould be ſo mad to
cry out in the extremity of pain and miſery,
<hi>Quàm ſuave, quàm dulce hoc eſt, quàm hoc non curo!</hi>
And I cannot but laugh at <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> his Rant,
<hi>Nil agis, O Dolor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There are divers inſtances of ſuch who have
born moſt exquiſite miſeries even to admiration,
as well out of a kind of hardineſs of nature, as
greatneſs of mind; and in that they were leſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
than the delicate and impatient: but
whence was it? either from neceſſity, or hope, or
both; this is Chriſtian-like, but that is bruitiſh, if
it were ſufficient without t'other, but 'tis not, for
perpetuity would certainly render any evil intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53432:221"/>
So that we are ſo far from being completely
happy as long as any diſeaſe or inquietude of
mind or body does attend us; that the hope of
being delivered is the only argument that can
afford us any ſolid and rational comfort in our
afflictions: For as to fatality, <hi>hoc ipſum eſt,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> when one urg'd it; and for the diſeaſe of
Impatiency, 'tis (as one has excellently obſerv'd)
no proper conſideration of comfort, but only an
art of managing our trouble; ſo as not to make
it greater than really it is.</p>
                  <p>2. The other part of our happineſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the main, we call <hi>poſitive,</hi> and conſiſts in
the enjoyment of all good; and is what St. <hi>John</hi>
intends by <hi>their works following them;</hi> i. e. they
ſhall then receive all thoſe glorious rewards that
God has promis'd to good and righteous men for
all their ſervice and obedience. We ſhould in
vain go about to recount them, they are ſo many
and ſo great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In two things the Scriptures chiefly place it;
in the</hi> viſion, <hi>and in the</hi> fruition <hi>of God.</hi> This
is life Eternal,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>ſaith this very St.</hi> John <hi>in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi>
to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt;
<hi>and again in his 1 Ep. Ch. 3. v.</hi> 2. It doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what we ſhall be; but we know that when he doth
appear we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.
<hi>The other is call'd</hi> the being with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53432:222"/>
united <hi>to him. St.</hi> John 17. 21. That they all
may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that
they alſo may be one in us. <hi>But this is not to exclude
the other inſtances of our happineſs, indeed it
comprehends all the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For what are all the pleaſures and contentments
of the World, but as ſo many rays of that Sun
and emanations of that fountain?</p>
                  <p>They are all contain'd with much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in God, than they were created in their
own natures: Whereupon it follows that they
which are admitted into his preſence, have all
the goodneſs and perfections of all the creatures
in the world united in God.</p>
                  <p>So that whatever can delight either body or
mind, there it is; nor will there be any room to
wiſh for or imagine more than what we have;
there being in him (as an ingenious man expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it) ſuch a various Identity, that the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him at once ſatisfies and creates deſires,
that without ſatiety, this without diſquiet.</p>
                  <p>3. To which if we add the <hi>eternal duration</hi> of
this ſtate, we attribute unto it a kind of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Infinities, a potential Infinity in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
actual in the object, and eternal in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of it:</p>
                  <p>Which ſingle conſideration is ſufficient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it to an infinite preference above all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53432:222"/>
things imaginable; becauſe theſe things being
founded in matter, and that being in continual
flux and motion, here can be nothing perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and laſting. Nor indeed would that be any
addition to our preſent felicity. 'Tis variety
that makes theſe things appear excellent; their
mutability, is both the life and death of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
delights.</p>
                  <p>A few repetitions make us abhor our food;
in leſs than a night and a day we grow weary of
our Beds; and 'tis ſo in all the other inſtances of
our Nature, and 'tis more ſo in thoſe of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis otherwiſe in the attainment of the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
end, where all our appetites are arreſted and
detain'd.</p>
                  <p>Indeed we no ſooner experience theſe things in
the fruition, but we ſtraightway nauſeate them;
finding them ſo pitifully allay'd with mixtures
of evil, and prove ſo miſerably ſhort of what we
deſire and expect from them. But 'tis otherwiſe
there, the excellency of thoſe Celeſtial Objects
will diſappoint our expectation by their tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
as much as in all other fruitions their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs
is wont to do.</p>
                  <p>So that Eternity, though but a circumſtance
which does only ſuperinduce a kind of extremity
or perfection to what it is conjoyn'd with; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53432:223"/>
may as well be drawn in to enhanſe our miſery,
(for what more than this makes the condition of
the damn'd ſo horribly dreadful, whereby they
are excluded from all hope, the very ſeed and
loweſt degree of felicity?) Yet is it ſo neceſſary
to what we are ſpeaking of, as that without it
thoſe joys of Heaven, though otherwiſe abſolute
and infinite, would ſuffer a contradiction, and
become imperfect: And that not only for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but the preſent, by introducing ſuch paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as muſt needs debaſe and allay the higheſt
delights.</p>
                  <p>So that by being thus ſecur'd in the poſſeſſion
of our happineſs, we receive thereby an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
addition to it.</p>
                  <p>II. Proceed we next to ſhew you the <hi>Security</hi>
and <hi>Evidence,</hi> upon which this happineſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
and aſſerted, and whether it bear any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to our duty and the <hi>Rewards</hi> of it, for ſo
we are allow'd to call them; though not upon
the account of merit, yet by reaſon of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
connexion with, dependance upon, and
that kind (ſuch a one as 'tis) of proportion they
bear to each other.</p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold evidence God Almighty
has given us, for the ſtrengthning of our hope,
and confirming of our faith, in the belief and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53432:223"/>
expectation of the other World. The firſt <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
grounded upon the teſtimony of the Spirit;
the other I call <hi>natural,</hi> and is grounded in the
things themſelves.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt evidence of our future bliſs, is the
teſtimony of the Spirit, expreſs in the Text, <hi>Yea,
ſaith the Spirit.</hi> But then we muſt have a care of what
kind of Teſtimony of the Spirit we underſtand it:
for, underſtand it as 'tis vulgarly taken, for ſome
act or operation wrought in and upon us, beſides
the Enthuſiaſm of it, fain would I be ſatisfy'd,
what validity can there be in ſuch a teſtimony, as it
ſelf needs ſomething elſe to confirm it? for ſo this
teſtimony of the Spirit is to be tryed by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance
and agreement to the word of God:
nor do I know any other way to diſtinguiſh it
from a motion or ſuggeſtion of the Devil's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
And though to err thus in this ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
may not be very pernicious, for I am not
mighty ſolicitous, how it was wrought, ſo there
be a firm perſwaſion in us of this truth; yet in
other caſes I know how dangerous it is, nor is it
ſafe in this, for it leaves a paſſage open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
to down-right Atheiſm.</p>
                  <p>By the teſtimony of the Spirit therefore I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the word of God, or the Scriptures as
made known and prov'd to us to be deriv'd from
this Divine Spirit, which we may call the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53432:224"/>
teſtimony thereof: for though St. <hi>John</hi> knew
this by the other way, as moſt certainly all others
did who received any Revelation; yet never
was any other than the perſon himſelf aſſur'd that
way.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I make degrees of more or leſs certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the way or manner of the Spirit's revealing a
thing; for the Apoſtles were as well aſſur'd of the
infallibility of their doctrine before they wrought
any miracles, as we are by them: but we were
not nor could be ſo.</p>
                  <p>But this notwithſtanding, in reſpect of us we
muſt admit of ſuch degrees; for no body I hope
will be ſo blaſphemous to equal ſuch private
dictates they have in their own breaſt to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
authority of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>So then I make this to be the <hi>moral</hi> evidence of
future happineſs: God hath ſaid it in his word.
And this I call a <hi>moral</hi> certainty, not in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to divine and infallible; as they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
contradiſtinguiſh'd; but only to natural:
for we can deſire no greater evidence, we cannot
have a higher confirmation of any truth, than the
veracity of Heaven to atteſt it.</p>
                  <p>I do not know any propoſition that carries
greater ſelf-evidence than this, That God ought
to be believ'd in what he ſays; and therefore
though we may queſtion the truth of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53432:224"/>
'tis impoſſible to do ſo of any thing we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be ſo revealed.</p>
                  <p>So that the ſtreſs of this point lyes upon that
great and neceſſary <hi>praecognition</hi> in our Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
namely, the Divine authority of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
Upon which poſtulate if we proceed,
there is as great certainty of the truth of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
That good men ſhall enjoy eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
after this life; as if we ſhould again hear that
Daughter of voice, and God himſelf ſhould ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
atteſt it.</p>
                  <p>2. But there is another ground or evidence of
our future happineſs which I call <hi>natural,</hi> becauſe
it depends upon that Intrinſick Relation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
there is between goodneſs and it; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them being only in degree, like
the dawning of the Morning to the luſtre of the
Noon. For what is it to be happy but to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God? and what does unite us to God but
Love? and what is the love of God but Religion?
And if you remove but all inward imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all outward impediments, there remains
no difference at all. So that Virtue and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do not only diſpoſe and prepare us for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Salvation, but we thereby receive and
experience the very beginnings and anticipations
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53432:225"/>
And though in reſpect of the mutability of our
will and affections toward God and goodneſs in
this world, we cannot be infallibly aſſur'd of it
as to our own particulars; becauſe every alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the one produceth a like anſwerable effect
as to the other: Yet in the general we may, even
from hence, be very well aſſur'd hereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is nothing more requir'd to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of our eſſential happineſs, than an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and progreſſion in the ſame vertuous
tract.</p>
                  <p>And however it looks in a Divine, if we will
ſpeak rationally to the thing, we muſt allow the
love and hatred of God to be the true natural
cauſes of our ſalvation and damnation, even
of their very eternity; it being naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be other than happy while we love
God, and contrariwiſe if we hate him; and this is
the only inſtant cauſe of its continuation through
all the durations of Eternity. And to remove
your aſtoniſhment, ſee, how in this lower
world, many ſtupendous and admirable works
are daily produc'd which were mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
while they lay hid and contain'd in the
ſeminal beginnings; after the ſame wonderful
manner by divers minute gradations does this
divine Creature grow up from its firſt formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our trembling and unſtable deſires, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53432:225"/>
the ſtature and perfection of Everlaſting Glory.</p>
                  <p>And yet there remains leſs doubt if we
take in the Conſideration of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
How elſe will you vindicate the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God in all the odd and confuſed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of this World? Where's your infinite
goodneſs and bounty, that ſuffers its ſervants
always to be neglected? what will become of
an almighty and omniſcient Juſtice if ſinners are
never call'd to an accompt? Or one, or t'other
cannot be.</p>
                  <p>III. 'Tis true indeed the compleating of this
bliſs (which brings us to our next head) is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
promis'd, nor to be had in this life. 'Tis
at <hi>Death</hi> theſe rewards become due and payable.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Dicique beatus</l>
                     <l>Ante obitum nemo, ſupremáque funera poſſit.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>It has been the conſtant method of Divine
providence, to cauſe the moſt excellent things to
follow and ariſe from the moſt uncouth and
unlikely. Thus in the Creation order ſprings
from confuſion, and the Light is made to attend
the darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to the methods obſerv'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where the cauſes are ever more worthy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53432:226"/>
than their effects from their firſt beginning down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Now as he is pleas'd to tranſcend and deviate
from the tracts and capacities of natural Agents,
thereby to aſſert his Prerogative, and render his
omnipotency more conſpicuous to the world:
So is he no leſs delighted to uſe the ſame receſſes
in diſplaying his Grace; evermore uſhering in
his mercies with the Black Rod, thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanſing
and endearing our ſubſequent refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>And though the goodneſs of thoſe celeſtial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
and the happineſs of their condition,
need neither foyl nor artifice to render that or
their acknowledgements of the Divine favour
greater: Yet however if we conſider theſe things
as a reward and incouragement of our obedience,
the proceeding thus is but regular and neceſſary;
that we ſhould do our work before we receive our
wages, and finiſh our undertaking, before we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Earneſt and Security Heaven has vouchſaf'd
us, but to depoſite the whole in hand, this
were, not to encourage but bribe our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
This were to deſtroy Morality, and turn
Vertue into Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53432:226"/>
Nor yet is the Divine goodneſs leſs communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
in this life, but we are not ſo capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it.</p>
                  <p>For look as in Nature neither the ſingle excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Object or the Agent alone is ſufficient
to produce any notable effect, but both are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd:
So likewiſe in Religion, all the effects
of the divine grace and bounty (though that be
free and infinite) are limited and determin'd by
our capacities and reception.</p>
                  <p>So that while our Appetites, thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
as they are call'd in Scripture, that are to be the
receptacles of all this Glory, are, either reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with the vain and ſinful objects of this
Life, or, are ſtraitned and contracted by the
weakneſs and imperfection of this dull and lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
matter, they muſt be rid of the one and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
of the other, and then, we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
happy.</p>
                  <p>You have ſeen the happineſs of the Chriſtian
man; there are indeed encouragements of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature, namely, earthly bleſſings and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
rewards, our whole preſent intereſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it happen to interfere at any time with the
other. Religion has deſcended to the ſecuring
of theſe too, and that not only by moral deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by a proper and natural efficiency; ſo
that we cannot better proſecute our preſent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53432:227"/>
than by the methods of Religion. And by
this gracious and happy complication of the
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> together, they are made to
become helpful and aſſiſting to each other, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reciprocally as a means or motive either to
other.</p>
                  <p>But this encouragement is neither proper nor
adequate to Chriſtianity; ſince it may be as well
purſu'd by natural, as by divine rules, better
perhaps by diabolical arts than either, nothing
experimentally ſo inriching men, as ſordidneſs,
oppreſſion, and other violences and frauds.
The Devil in all likelihood, giving the faireſt
proſpect, and moſt likely poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and glory of this world.</p>
                  <p>But they are things, I have ſhewn you, of a
nature infinitely more ſublime, that Chriſtianity
propounds to its obſervers; The rewards of
our Religion; exceeding as well the capacities
of our Nature, as all thoſe other things. To
the attainment whereof, as all vicious practices
are extremely contrary; ſo have all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Philoſophick tranſactions been miſerably
vain.</p>
                  <p>Some weak and glimmering light the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
had of theſe things; which it is not certain
whether they collected from ſome fragments of
tradition, or extracted from the principles of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53432:227"/>
natural reaſon; but which way ever it came, it
was ſo weak and imperfect, as ſerv'd to ſhadow,
not help to diſcover, but eclipſe the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
excellency of that State; till, as the Great
Apoſtle of the Gentiles ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
were brought to light by the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed without this all other propoſals
were unſuitable to its profeſſors, and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to the difficulty and ſeverities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"None ought to be deem'd
a vertuous or a juſt man, that will be allur'd
or affrighted from his duty, by any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
or diſadvantage whatever:"</q> But who,
trow ye, would abide both theſe, upon no
other conſideration, than barely to have acted
according to the ſentiments of right Reaſon, or
in hope to acquire an inſignificant fame of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
of which they could have no knowledge or
remembrance after death?</p>
                  <p>And for this cauſe I judge the Stoicks more
abſurd in their morals, than the Epicureans,
conſidering the principles that is upon which
they built. For 'tis the premiſe and not the
inference of theirs, that's ſo urg'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Let us eat and drink,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 32. But
now the Chriſtian Religion propounds ſuch
overtures to our Obedience and Patience,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53432:228"/>
as may juſtly and reaſonably encourage us
thereunto.</p>
                  <p>IV. For a Concluſion, let us take in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of that Phraſe of <hi>[dying in the Lord]</hi>
which relates primarily to Martyrdome; but
muſt alſo be extended to as many as live and dye
in the faith of the Holy Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all is this: That we would ſo
conſider this happineſs, as every of our great
intereſt, that we forfeit not our propriety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by a vicious and ſinful life. There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe can render it hazardous or doubtful,
but that, which indeed in the very nature of
the thing renders it impoſſible. Let us not
repeat <hi>Eſau</hi>'s folly, ſell our birth-right for a trifle;
and for the ſake of ſome pitiful luſt proſcribe our
ſelves out of our celeſtial inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Neither let us contemn our happineſs for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feaſible. Were wilful poverty and certain
Martyrdome, part of our duty, and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
appendages of our Religion, there is tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enough in the propoſals, to make us conflict
with the greateſt difficulties, and overcome them.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſtianity was thus attended, and
had nothing elſe to recommend it ſelf to the
world, beſides the reaſonableneſs of its injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53432:228"/>
with what holy violence did thoſe bleſſed
Saints ſtorm Heaven, and with a ſtrange eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
purſue Martyrdome! But now as if the
fervour of our Devotion were only kindled and
maintain'd by <hi>Antiperiſtaſis:</hi> Now I ſay the
Impediments are remov'd, and Religion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a part of our Civil obedience, and made
neceſſary to our ſecular intereſts, and guarded
with a great many other temporal Phylacteries,
men are yet more hardly wrought upon to be
Religious, the conſideration of a ſingle luſt ſhall
be able to weigh down all.</p>
                  <p>And if any would ſeem to have a greater
zeal for it than ordinary, as if they were in love
with the troubles of Religion, and not the thing;
they ſuffer their heat to ſpend it ſelf in little
piques and contentions, and about things of
none or ill moment, in maintaining of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and oppoſing their Superiours, and not in
Devotion, Obedience, Charity, Humility, and
the like, as they ought.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, Chriſtians, let the thoughts of this
bleſſedneſs, excite our affections Heaven-ward,
and quicken our endeavours: Let it animate
us againſt all difficulties, and buoy us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all adverſities; Let it cheer us in our
duty, quiet us in affliction, and comfort us in
death. That ſo living unto Chriſt, we may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53432:229"/>
at laſt dye in him, and in the end be for ever
bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>And now to accommodate all to our preſent
caſe. It has pleas'd God to take away this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
man, for ſuch, conſidering all things,
we muſt needs allow him; and becauſe 'twas
ſome we what early, I think of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s
notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Text, the ſooner the better,
the better for him, no doubt.</p>
                  <p>I had once thought to have given you his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
but I am not aſham'd to tell you, I found
me not able to do it worthy of him. And cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to mind a ſaying of one of the Roman Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,
I ſoon deſiſted from any further attempt
of it; who when he was reckoning up ſome of
the great men of that age, <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid, Livie</hi>
and <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and going to commend them, ſtops,
and concludes thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"But of men of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as their admiration is great, ſo is their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
full of difficulty."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to thoſe Relations that are more nearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
in this ſolemnity; I would beſeech them
to remember, that all Indecency and exceſs of
Grief, for our deceaſed friends, muſt needs reflect
upon the memory of the dead, or the diſcretion of
the ſurvivers. God enable them to bear it: And
ſupply this loſs to them by his Grace and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
Let me ſay, and to the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53432:229"/>
by increaſing the number of ſuch men, of
no worſe Learning, Integrity, and Courage;
that are able, and dare defend her againſt
the encroachments of Popery and Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme.</p>
                  <closer>Now to God only wiſe be Glory through Jeſus Chriſt
