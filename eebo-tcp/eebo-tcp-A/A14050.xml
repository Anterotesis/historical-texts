         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

writeth thus / knowe you that in the last dayes shall

               <p>Christ saith / in the vii. of Matthew / 
keepe your selues from false prophets which come
vnto you in sheepes clothing / but within are raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wolues: where by we maye learne / that all false
prophets are priuy and inward wolues. But the
Pope and his Sonne Stephen Gardiner with all
the order of priests aboue named / are false prophets / 
wherfore they are all wolues. He is a false prophet
which occupyeth the roume of a true prophet / and
eyther is not sent, or els yf he be sent / doth not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his office as God hath commaunded him but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
And as there are many kindes of false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
so are there many propertyes / wherby they
may be knowne: The first propertye of a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
is / to thrust himselfe into the office of a prophet / 
or to take the office in hand before he be sent. The
second is / to preach lyes, and other doctrine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God
hath commaunded. The third property is to preach
earnestly his owne doctrine / and to threaten greate
punishment to the breakers therof / and to preache
<pb facs="tcp:1406:16"/>
very slackly, it that God earnestly / and expressedlye
hath commaunded / and to discharge men from the
punishments which God threateneth to the trauns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours
and breakers of them. These are also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of a false prophet to scatter / and to kill gods
people / and to be couetous of golde and siluer / and of
promocion / and to serue the belly / That he is a false
prophet / that thrusteth himselfe into the office of a
prophet / or taketh the office in hande / before hee be
sent of God / the prophet Ieremy witnesseth the 14.
chapter: These prophets prophecy a lye in my name.
I sent them not. I gaue them no commaundement / 
neyther haue I spoken vnto them / and yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
a lying vision / and a gessing prophesie / &amp; the
deceit of their owne heart. Wherefore saith the Lord / 
the prophets which prophecye in my name when I
sent them not / shal perishe with hunger and sword.
Ieremy xxix. Let not your prophets and sothsayers
beguile you / neyther take yee anye heede to your
dreames which you dream / for they prophecye vnto
you lying in my name / &amp; yet I sent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not: the same
sentence is conteined Deutero .xviij. in these words:
A prophet which presumeth to speake a word in my
name / which I commaunded him not to speake / or
he that speaketh in the name of strange Gods / suche
a prophet shall dye. I find the same meaning in the
xxiij. of Ieremy / in these words: I haue not sente
these prophets / and yet haue runne: I spake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vnto them / and yet haue they prophecyed. And
in the xxvii. They prophecy you a lye / for I sente
them not / notwithstanding that they prophesy fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in my name. Ezechiell in the xiii. chapter speaketh
the same sentence: they haue seene vanity / and a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prophecy / saying / the Lord hath sayd it / when as
the Lord hath not sent them. Christ also in the newe
Testament describeth a false prophet after the same
manner saying. He that entereth not into the shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
by the dore / but climeth in another waye / he is
<pb facs="tcp:1406:17"/>
a theef and a murderer. I am the dore of the sheepe
all they that haue comme before mee are theeues &amp;
murtherers. If that he bee a false prophet which
taketh the office of a prophet or a shepeheard / and is
not sent of God: Yf he be a theefe and a murtherer / 
that entereth into the sheepefolde / otherwise then by
Christ / (as the holy ghost sayth he is) then all the
vnlearned Byshoppes / Deanes / Prouostes / 
Cannons / Parsons and S24357.tech.take2.sgmicars which can not
preach and teach Gods worde / are false prophetes / 
Wolues / Theeues and Murderers. For God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
sent them / and so came they not into their offices
thorowe Christe / but haue climed in an nother way.
That God neuer sente the vnlearned / I proue it
thus: He that would haue his worde preached vnto
his slocke / and would that the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

man / to be the shepehearde vnto it. But God
would haue his worde preached / and his flocke sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and kept with the same word / and this is hys
commaundement / crye and cease not: and shew my
people their fautes / go and preache the gospell to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
creature / go and teach all nations / feede my
Lambes / feede my sheepe. Then ye see that it is the
commaundement of God / that his flocke should bee
fedde with preaching and teaching, wherby we may
easelye knowe that he sendeth no du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me dogs / and
vnlearned Asses to be Byshoppes / Parso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

S24357.tech.take2.sgmicars ouer his flocke / that can not preache and
teach the worde of lyfe whereby his flocke shoulde
be fedde and saued from the Wolues. Therefore
God neuer sent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / neyther came they in by Christ.
Wherevpon it followeth / that all the vnpreaching
Prelates in England / are false prophets &amp; wolues
because God neuer sent them / nor called them to be
<pb facs="tcp:1406:17"/>
prophets / and because he knewe them vnmeete for that
office. Now I pray you haue ye seene no Wolues in
England / is it a straunge sighte to see in Englande
dumme Embassadors / and vnlettered legates that

               <p>The Lorde
God saith in the xxxiij. of Ezechi. If I bring the
sworde vpon the earth / and the people of the earth / 
take a man of their countrey / and make him theyr
watchman / and if he see the sworde comming vppon
the earth / and then blowe with his tromphet / and
warne the people plainly / and they heare the voyce
of the tromphet / and wil not be warned / if the sword
come and take them away / their owne bloude be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
their owne heades. But if the watchman see the
sword comming / and blowe not his horne / and the
people be not plainly warned / if the sword come / and
they be killed / the people are killed for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse / 
yet will I require the bloud of my people of
that watchmans hand Thus farre hath God spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
You may see that my parable and this doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
togither. The Lorde in the same chapter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his parable thus. O thou sonne of man / I haue
made thee a watchman to the house of Israel / that
thou may heare the word out of my mouth / and that
I may warne them playnly in my name. If I say
vnto the wicked / thou wicked / surely thou shalt die / 
and thou wilt not speake vnto him / that he leaue
his wicked waye / he shall dye in his wickednes / but
his bloud will I require at thy hand. Now syr haue
ye hearde it plainlye spoken without any parable / by
Gods owne mouth: that the watchman which wyll
not giue warning vnto his flocke / is guilty of bloud.
But none are guilty of bloude but murderers / but
dumme pastors are guilty of bloud / therfore they are
<pb facs="tcp:1406:19"/>
murderers and so spirituall wolues. If these places
be not thought sufficient to proue that vnpreaching
prelates / are false prophets and so Wolues and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers / 
I wil alledge mo places to satisfie them that
aer not yet satisfied. Almighty God sayth / Ezechiel
the xxiiij: Sonne of Man prophecye thou againste
the pastors / or sheepeheardes of Israell / and thou
shalt say vnto them: Woe be vnto the sheepeheards
of Israel / which haue fedde them selues / ought not

ye are clothed with the woole / ye kill it that is fatte /

the word of the Lord. As truely as I liue / I wyll

there was no sheepeheard, and because my sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes

               <p>There are
many kindes of false prophets, and who so euer hath
any one of the properties of any of those kindes is a
false prophet. Christe taketh him for a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
in the tenth of Iohn / that is vnsent / and entreth
into the office of a prophet or sheepehearde not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
Christ / but climeth in an nother waye / hys
words in latine are these: <hi>Qui non intrat per hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,

climeth in an other way, he is at hefe &amp; a murderer.
Almighty god in the xj. of Zachari / painting &amp; discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
another kind of false prophets / saith after the old
translatino: <hi>O pastor &amp; idolum derelenquens gre
gem.</hi> O sheepeheard and idole which leaueth or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh
his flocke. In the Surik translation <hi>Vae pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori
idolo qui gregem deserit</hi> Wo be vnto the idole
shepeherd that leueth his flock. The Lord in the 34.
of Ezechiel, describing false prophets / sheweth none
other token of a false prophet, or of an euil shepeheard
or of a Wolfe / but that he feedeth not his flocke. So
that he is both a false prophet / that commeth into the
church otherwyse then by Christ / and he also that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
rightly into the sheepefold and yet leaueth his
flocke / or tariyng with his flocke feedeth it not.</p>
               <p>Now haue I proued / that he that hath any of these
properties of a false prophet / is a false prophet. I
may therefore call all the vnpreaching prelates false
prophets, because they either haue two properties of

for Christ sayth to the pastors or shepeheards / go and
teach all nations / and Baptise them / in the name of
the Father / and of the Sonne and of the holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
teaching them to kepe all thinges / whiche I haue
commaunded you. And in the xvj. of Marke he saith
goe into all the world / and preach the gospel to euery
creature / then is preaching a worke necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
of all pastors and byshops. Wherefore if they doe
not this moste exellent worke that belongeth vnto a
sheepeheard / they are guilty / and are breakers of all
the other workes that belong vnto a byshoppe / or a
sheepeheard. Ezechiel / (as I alledged him before)
maketh all pastors that preach not the amendment of
life vnto the people / and giue not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expressed war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to amend their liues: to be murderers. If he
doe so / so may I doe the like. Then may I call
them well ynough murderers and therefore false por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets
<pb facs="tcp:1406:21"/>
and wolues. Well then when as no man can
denye / but that preaching is the principal office that
belongeth vnto a Byshoppe or shepehearde though
all your lately named deedes were offices belonging
vnto their vocation: yet for all that / the doing of all
them / should not discharge them from the wrathe of
God for committing of murder / if he murdereth, that
seedeth not. Which thing I shall declare vnto you, by
these two similitudes or likenesses: If a nurse prayed
euery day three houres for the child which shee hath
taken in hand to feede / and sange other three houres / 
and washed the child as cleane as it were possible for
a woman to doe / and yet gaue the child no milke / nor
fedde it, but suffred it to dye for hunger / I thinke for
all her praying and saying, singing and washing / 
shee were a murderesse. It that a watchman were
hyred of all the citizens of a citye to watch the citye / 
and this watchman went out of his watching place
and went into the citye &amp; helped the masons to biuld
the wales, or did any such like thing, whereof he had
no charge, or commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and the enemies came
into the citye / and killed all the citizens / or but ten of
them, for lacke of the warning of the watch man: this
watch man should be guilty of all their deathes that
were killed / as almighty God saith in Ezechiel. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so al your vnpreaching parsons / though they doe
diuers other things / eyther not belonging vnto their
office or belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to their office or cali<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; leue vndon
the most prinpal part of al other, that is preaching of
Gods word, and suffer the flocke to perish for lacke of
preaching / are gilty of the bloud of al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that perish / 
for lacke of preaching of Gods word vnto them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
when as God hath ordeined bishops to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ouer their flockes / if they leaue their office vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don / 
and go away from their flocke / and playe the
Counselours / Amners / and Chauncelours / if anye
of their flocke perish for lacke of keeping / they are
soule murderers / and therefore Wolues and worse
<pb facs="tcp:1406:21"/>
then dogges. Where as yee say that the parsons feede
Christes flocke sufficientlye / because they reade the
word of God / whiche is sufficient fode for all theyr
flocks: I say that it is true that the word of GOD
is sufficient foode for all their parishioners / if that it
were ministred and serued out vnto the people / as it
should be. But the reading of it in a strange tongue / 
feedeth not Christes flocke / and the word of God
spoken and read in a strange tongue / and not expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / 
saueth not the flocke from the Wolues / neither
doth the onely reading of gods worde / discharge the

the congregation / (although he that will praye se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatlye

shall I proue you by the same chapter of which you
aleged your auctority. Saint Paule saith: he that
prophecieth / that is / (hee that expoundeth the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
speaketh buylding or edification vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple / 
exhorting and comforting / he that speaketh in a

Latine worthy to haue suche great liuinges as they
haue? I gather also that expounding of the scripture / 
or preaching of gods worde, is the more excellent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and worke in Christes Church then reading is / 
then how shall a prieste bee excused from doing the
greater by doing fo the lesse? and yet the lesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

also, I will that yee all speake with tongues but yet
more that you should prophecy or declare the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture / 
for he is greater that prophecieth / then hee that

Let all thinges be done to the profite of

it nowe like that god wyll alowe Latin reading of
vnlearned priests without any expounding of it that
is read in an Englishe church / for his seruice / &amp; a

And whereas ye say / that though the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

it wel ynough / meaning thereby / that it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that the people should vnderstant it that is read
in the church / so that god vnderstand it: I aske you
whether all that the prieste readeth in the Churche
is sayd vnto god alone / or to the people alone. Yf at
be said to the people alone then is all the laboure loste
that is bestowed in speaking of Latine vnto them
that vnderstand none. Or if parte be spoken vnto the
vnlearned people / that part is also loste. If that all
that is read in the church be sayde vnto God (as yee
seme to mean, wher as ye say that god vnderstandeth
latin wel ynough / though the people vnderstande it
not) then say the priests vnto god all these sayinges.

of god, as no Massemonger is able to proue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Wherefore I maruel that ye dishonest them
with such a terme / when as ye can not proue that ye
lay vnto their charges. As for your Amners it is
playn that they occupy but the office of a Deacon / 
which is not to be compared to the office of an Elder

commaunded any bishop to be occupyed withall.</p>
               <p>Thinke you that vpon the day of iudgement, when

I was an Amner, or the Kings chaplain / and

false prophets, for all my argumentes and places of
the scripture alledged / I will alledge another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
or two of a false prophet which they geue / and
they ar these. To be earnest in setting out of theyr one
doctrin / and to be cold in setting forth of gods expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
commaudement / and to breake Goddes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement / 
that theire tradition or ordinaunce
might be aduaunced or set vp / to threaten great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment / 
where as god threateneth none, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corage
men from it / that god hath earnestly comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / 
and to flatter great men / and to suffer them to do
what they list / and so to maintaine them in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse / 
are the properties of a false prophet. And
that these are the properties of a false prophet / I wil
proue it by diuers open places of the scripture. Christ
in the xv. of Matth / layeth vnto the pharises charge
which were false prophets / that they were so earnest
in setting forth / and in keeping of their owne traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ordinaunces, that they not onely not cared
for the commaundement of God, but also brake the
commaundement of God / that their traditions migh
be set forth and kept of all men. The wordes of
Christ are these: wherefore breake ye the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God / for your tradition / they worshippe
me in vaine / that teach lerninges which are the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundements
of men. Marke in the vij. Chapter.
rehearseth Christes sayinges thus: ye leaue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of God, and keepe the ordinaunce of
men / as washing of cuppes and pottes / and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges do yee / like vnto these. Ye cast wel away
the commaundements of God / that ye may sette vp
your tradition. The byshoppes of Englande / and
the preachers there nowe / specially they that are in
auctority / commaunde the people to creepe vnto the
Crosse / to take holy water and holy bread / to weare
beades / and to go in procession / to heare masse, to here
mattins and euensong in a tongue that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not, to set vp candels, to lift vp their handes to
bread and wine, to praye to Saints / to praye for the
<pb facs="tcp:1406:26"/>
dead / to heare the piping of the orgaines, and preache
not the worde of God / neyther exhorte the people to
worship God inspirit and truth / in commanding and
preaching of these / they are very earnest / but slowe in
setting forth the will and expressed commaundement
of God. They repuire these so earnestly of the people,
and punish them so sore that breake these / that they
compell them to breake the open commandements of
God / that these may be kept. Euery holy day when
as the word of god should be preached / and the right
Supper of the Lord should be receiued, when the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gregation
should pray togither in a common tongue / 
these can not bee exercised for the infinite number of
popish toyes / and trifles which Gardiner / with his
 garison, haue of late by open tirany against the kings
law and gods word violently thrust vnto the church
before the Kings law was abrogated. Ezechiell also
in the xiij. chapter writteth thus of false prophetes / 
which flatter the people and tell them not of theire
faultes. Because ye haue spoken vanitye / and haue
seene a lye / therfore beholde / I the Lorde God am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you / &amp; my hand shall be against the prophetes
which see vaine thinges / and prophecye lyes. They
shall not be in the secreate of my people / and they shal
not be written in the number of the house of Israel,
neyther shall they come into the land of Israel / and
yee shall know that I am the Lord God. Nowe for
as much as they haue begiled my people, saying peace
when as there is no peace / and when as the people
bildeth the wale / &amp; they with their daubing couer it
with a naughty crust / tel them that couer it with an
vnprofitable crust / that it shal fal. I will ouerthrow
the walle which ye haue pargetted and couered with
a naughty crust / and I will dash it to the ground.</p>
               <p>And thou sone of man set thy face against the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of they people (loe there were then as well shee
wolues as hee) which prophecye out of their owne

<pb facs="tcp:1406:26"/>
sayth the Lorde God. Woe be vnto them that sewe
Cusshons vnder all elbowes of handes, and make

                  </gap> my people / that ye may catch them / and
shall ye quicken the soules of the people that come vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
you? Ye haue dishonoured me before my people for
a handful of barley / and lomps of bread / to kil soules
which ye oughte not to kill / and to quicken soules to
whom ye ought not to promise life / ye haue made sad
and sorowfull the hearte of the righteous with a lye / 
when as I made him not sory / and haue strengtthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the hands of the wicked that he might not return
from his euil way / that he mighte be saued aliue.</p>
               <p>These are the words of God in Ezechiel wherby he
describeth one kind of false prophets / and these words
doe agree with the maners of the byshops of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land / 
therefore they are false prophets. The byshops
and massaying priests of England deceuie the people
by saying that there is peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when as there is none / 
when as they say that god is not angry with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple / 
that neyther heareth the word of God / neither
prayeth with the heart in the common place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for prayer, and saith it is sufficient if they heare
masse and mattins / though the two other thinges bee
not done Almighty God requireth that ther shoulde
be no beggers amongst his people / he requireth that
no man shall put away his wife, except it be for forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
/ that no man shal take the name of god in vain
that rulers shall not polle and pill their subiects / that
no man shall banket excessiuely / and be dronken / that
no man shall doe it that is the cause and grounde
of euell / as are Dicing and Carding for money
and suche Daunsing as is occupyed in greate mens
houses and other places also / where vpon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Letanies, reading without any profit / creping

When as the collection and gathering was of
late for the pouerty / the papists thorow out al Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
could not be brought to giue the fourth part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the poore, that the gospellers gaue, belike because
they thought that they were discharged from giuing
of almes / if they kepte some money behinde for the

were so pergetted with popestrie / and with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

no more bound to giue any sufficient almes according
vnto the Scriptrue. But what maruell is it if the

papist in an open sermon, began earnestly to speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the almes house / which was builded and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the liberality of the citezins of the noble city of
London. When as Tunstal / Gardiner / Stokslay /

Henry the eyght, they suffered the King and diuers
Lords of the realme to put away and take as manye

If that they had don their duety / the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

broken lose (euen as great Masties do more harme
that are commonly tyed / when as they breake lose / 
then other do that commonly run abroad at liberty)
haue killed a grert sort in their mindes and desires / &amp;
haue casten them into prison / that they may kill them
in deede, as they haue killed them in thoughte / for if
the casting of them into prison alone might haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them / there had none of them all bene aliue at this

to vnderstand / when as the newe Testament decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the olde / and speaketh all things without figurs
wherefore if you will proue any thing substantially / 
ye must proue it by the newe Testament and not by
the olde. Also the Byshoppes haue not killed them

               <p>If that the alledging of the newe
Testament / will bring you to the light of the truth I
will alledge it more largely / not withstanding, that
I alledged no trope nor figures / out of the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
but morall lawes which shall endure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
Also I haue alledged diuers places out of the
new Testament, wherof euen but one alone / had ben
sufficient ynough to haue gotten credence / for that
thing that I desired to be beleeued in. But to proue
it fully that I haue taken in hand to proue: I shall
proue that Gardiner the bishop of winchester, and al
his fellowes of that order that he is of / haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the false prophets that are spoken of in the
newetestament. Christ in the 7. of Matth. saith that
false prophets go in Lambes clothing / and inwarde
are rauening Wolues. The massemongers of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
/ go in sheepes clothing / that is, they shew great
holines in their outwart apparel, they haue four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered
cappes, to sinnifie that they go Este / west / 
North, and South / to preach gods word (how be it
theire foure corners maye as well signifie that they
haue destroyed the foure Euangelistes, &amp; in the stead
of them set vp their owne traditions) they haue sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
crownes / to signifie that their mind is in heauen,
and chat they care for no worldly thing. They haue
syde gownes and them commonly blacke / which be
tokeneth sadnes of maners / and mortifying of theire
fleshe / they haue tippets about their neckes / to beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that they haue taken vpon them the yoke of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitye.
They weare white Ratchetes and surplesses / 
sometime aboue their other clothes, to signifie the
simplicity of a Lambe, and the innocency of the same.
But I haue proued before that inwardlye they are
rauening Wolues, therefore these are the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets / 
that Christ bad vs beware of. Matth the 15. &amp;
Marke the 7. declare that the property of the phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which were false prophets / is to set vp their owne
<pb facs="tcp:1406:30"/>
traditions / and therby to breake and tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that all the vnlearded persons in Englande came

vpon them to be higher in dignity / then their fellowe
priests and apostles / and exercise lordship ouer them / 
are not sent of Christe who made not one Apostle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
another but gaue them all like auctority as the
gospels in diuers places beare witnes namely Mat.
the 18. and 20. Mark the ix. and x. Luke the 22. and
in diuers other places. Where haue the massaying
priests any word in the new testament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherwith thei
are able to proue that they ar sent of Christ? no wher
I warrant you in all the new testament. The newe
testament is in all places against this kinde of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode.
Then when as neither the masse priestes ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the proud lordly byshops are sent of Christ / it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that they are theeues and robbers / and so false
prophets and Wolues Christ in the 24. of Matthew
describing the salfe prophets that should come in the
end of the world / sayth that they will say / that Christ
is here / and Christ is there / that he is in this pix and
in that pix / in this bread and in that bread / and so doe
Gardiner with all his sacramentary sacrificers.</p>
               <p>Therfore they are false prophets that Christ prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyed
of that should come in the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Paule where as hee Prophecyeth in the former
Epistle to Timothi / of the false Prophets that
should come in the latter times of the world / sheweth
two notable properties / wherby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.
The former is / that they should forbid mariage / 
and the Seconde is to forbidde certayne kyndes of
<pb facs="tcp:1406:31"/>
meates, that god neuer forbad / these two properties
haue they nowe / whom I call Wolues and false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets / 
for Gardiner and his fellowe Bonar / will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
no man to be an elder in Christes church / except
he first forsweare mariage / or make a solemne vowe
that he will neuer mary. As for the forbidding of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
meates / at certaine times / euery man knoweth
that they forbid more earnestly the eating of certaine
meates / at certaine times / then they forbid swearing / 
or foreswearing / and single fornication / and that they
punish more greeuously him that eateth fleshe in lent / 
then him that defileth a mans daughter / or blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the name of God. Iudas in his epistle descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
false prophets / among oiuers other properties / 
rehearseth these three. The first is that they are moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in their dreames / aud defile their flesh. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is / that they speake swelling words. The third
is / that they wonder and greatly regard persons for
aduauntage sake. Whether the solemne sort of wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
sacrificers / are defiled in their dreames or no / the
boyes that maketh their beddes / the prists that heare
their confessions / and the launderers that wash their
sheetes can beare witnes against them. And yet they
will not vse the lawful remedy that god ordeyned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such abominable and stinking defiling of their
bodyes with the imagination of actuall letcherye / 
wrought by the deuill in their dreames. As for proud
words / Winchester &amp; his gard of papistes they want
none / for he (as thoughe he had bin king) offered in
his owne name, (as it was reported vnto me) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vnto maister Latimer / if he would turne from
his religion. Howe proud and loftly his communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to iudge Hailes / they that were by &amp; heard
his talke can t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l. How flattering he hath bin always
to the noble men / and howe he hath regarded persons
for aduauntage sake / all they knowe well ynough / 
that haue seene a greate number of gentelmens sons / 
knightes sonnes / and lords sonnes / with him in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb facs="tcp:1406:31"/>
with him at one time. Now haue I proued by
the open texte of the newe Testament also that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar / 
with all his garison of masse mumbling mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes / 
are wolues / theeues / robbers and false pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets.
As touching that part of your saying / wherin
you would haue excused the Byshoppes from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / 
because (as ye say) they killed not them that I
rekened / but the kings officers: I say that if our by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
and priests are not gilty of the bloud of Bay
nam / Barnes / and Bayfeld, and the reste that were
burnt in England / then were not the scribes / phars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and hye priests / guilty of Christes death / because
the secular rulers put him to death. Sayd not the hye
priestes / we may not kill any man / but wee haue a
lawe / and according vnto that, he must dye / The hye
priestes / when Pilate asked them what they had to
laye to Christes charge / aunswered and sayd. If hee
were not an euill man / we had not deliuered him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee. After the ame maner the priests of England
with their hyred slaues / gaue vnto the shrife of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
maister Barnes and his fellowes / and when
Barns asked the cause of his death / the shirife could
shewe no cause at all / and so might haue well sayd as
Pilate said vnto Christ. Thy owne countrye men
and hye priestes, haue deliuered thee vp vnto me</p>
               <p>And the shirife might haue sayd vnto the hye priests / 
I can find no cause of death in him. But the hye
priestes were guilty of Christes death and were the
murderers of him / whiles they sayd we haue a lawe
and according vnto that the muste dye. And euen so
was Stephen Gardiner / Edmund Bonar with the
rest of the hye priestes / of England / the killers &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derers
of doctor Barns, and of all them that were
burned in Englande / for holding with Gods holye
word / whiles they sayd that they were heretikes / al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the lay men against their willes / were fayne
to be their tormentors and hangmen. Nowe haue I
proued both by the newe Testament and olde / that
<pb facs="tcp:1406:32"/>
all the masse priestes and byshops of Englande / are
wolues and false prophets. The same may be proued
also by the Poets and Philosophers for they haue
the properties that Poet and Philosophers giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wolues / it is a common prouerbe amongst learned
men. <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> a man is a Wolfe vnto a
man / that is / one man killeth another / therefore hee
that is a kilier of his brother / as Gardiner is / may
well be called a wolfe. The property of a Wolfe is / 
that if a man see the wolfe afore the Wolfe se the man / 
that then a man shall not be dumme. But if the wolfe
see the man before the man see the Wolfe / then is the
man by the sight of the wolfe made dumme / or at the
least so horse that he can scarcely speake. I report me
vnto all the honest men England / whether that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner / 
comming hastelye out of the Tower his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

within xiiij. dayes? I saw him of late but thorowe a
little hole for feare that if he had seene me / as I sawe
him / he should haue made me dum too / by casting me
into prison / where as no man coulde heare my voyce / 
as he handled a great sort of my brethren of late. An
other property of a wolfe is / when he is mad / (for he
is some time mad as a dogge is) by his teeth to poure
into the man that he byteth / the same ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>e &amp; poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that he hath and if the man bee not healed within
a short whyle after that he is bytten / he becommeth
as mad as the Wolfe was that bote him / and plaieth
the Wolfe both in bytting and crying after the maner
of a wolfe. The wood Wolfe of Winchester aboute 8.
or 9. yeeres ago / bote with his poysoned teeth / doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
Crome / and doctor Shaxton / whereof the one
doctor Crome / seeking remedy betime / was helpt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the woluish poyson and madnes. But Shaxton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
to long hath nowe the same poyson that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner
had / and speaketh as like the wolfe of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster / 
as any Wolfe in England doth / if it be true that
I haue heard tell of late. Therfore I may calle all
<pb facs="tcp:1406:32"/>
the other massemongers in England Wolues / by the
newe Testament and olde / and Gardiner by the sam / 
a Wolfe / and by philosophye also / both a wolfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a
