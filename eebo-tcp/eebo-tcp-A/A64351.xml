            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM Lxxviii. 5, 6.</bibl>
                  <p>V. 5. ... He established a Testimony in Iacob, and
appointed a Law in Israel, which he commanded our
Forefathers, That they should make them known to
their Children.</p>
                  <p>V. 6. That the Generations to come might know
Them, even the Children which should be born, who
should arise and declare them to their Children.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Title of <hi>Benefactor</hi> does principally belong to
those who are at present useful, and likewise
oblige Posterity.
Such a one was King <hi>David,</hi> who Serv'd his own Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
very Faithfully; and having finish'd his Course,
delivered his <hi>Lamp</hi> to the succeeding Age. Of this,
as many are convinced, as either read the History
of his Life, or peruse his <hi>Psalms</hi> with Application of
Mind.</p>
            <p>And it was his care, amongst his other pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
to continue the <hi>Memory</hi> of God's Wonderful
Works from <hi>Age</hi> to <hi>Age;</hi> to the end that the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Power and Goodness might effectually
move them to obey his Laws. Of such Remembrances
they stood in great need, being apt no longer to think
upon the Miracles of Divine Mercy, than whilst they
saw them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore God himself prescribed this way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Statutes, and rehearsing the History of his
Mighty Acts, (and especially those at <hi>Horeb</hi>) to <hi>their
Sons,</hi> and their <hi>Sons Sons.</hi> Deut. 4. 9.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Isrealites</hi> might not err in the repetition,
he caus'd those Statutes and wonders to be written down;
not leaving them to the uncertainty of Oral Tradtion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101747:3"/>
which sometimes either passeth by things of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or delivers them down very imperfectly, and too
often brings it to pass, that the Legends of one Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
History in those that follow.</p>
            <p>God established a Testimony in Iacob, and appointed a Law
in Israel, which he commanded our Fore-fathers; that they
should make them known to their Children.</p>
            <p>That the Generations to come might know them, even the
children which should be born, who should arise and declare
them to their children.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Doing Good to Posterity,</hi> being set forth
in these words, not by any General Precept, but only
by the especial Instance of propagating the Knowledge
of his Law; I shall use them rather as the <hi>Occasion,</hi> than
the <hi>Ground</hi> of this Proposition.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That a Good Man, according to his Talent and
Circumstance, does endeavour in such manner to <hi>Do
good</hi> in his time, that the next Age also may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
reap the benefit of it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Concerning this kind of <hi>Charity,</hi> I purpose to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How fit and just a thing it is to put it in Practice.</item>
               <item>2. That, notwithstanding its fitness, there is too general a
disuse of it.</item>
               <item>3. Whence it comes to pass that there is of Common a failure
in so necessary a Duty.</item>
               <item>4. By what means the Exercise of it may be made more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and more frequent among us; that so the ages to come
may have just cause to Bless Almighty God for the advantages
derived to them from this Generation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. Now, <hi>First of all,</hi> the <hi>doing of Good to Posterity,</hi> may
appear a fit and reasonable Practice;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From a common Rule of Good and Evil.</item>
               <item>2. From the Obligation which man is under, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
God.</item>
               <item>3. From the Gratitude we owe to former Ages.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. This is a Common rule concerning <hi>Good,</hi> not
only that it is to be done, but that we are to do what,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101747:3"/>
               <hi>upon the whole matter,</hi> is the <hi>greatest good</hi> which we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of doing in our Sphere and Condition. Now
Good is increased as well by the <hi>Duration</hi> of Benefits, as
by their <hi>Magnitude</hi> and <hi>Number;</hi> so that if the Good be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in other respects, he that does the Charity that
lasts <hi>but a day,</hi> does well; but he that does the Good that
lasts <hi>some years,</hi> does still better. He who out of good
will, gives <hi>a cup of cold water</hi> to a thirsty man, performs
a Charitable Office; but that Person is, by much, the
greater Benefactor, who opens a <hi>Fountain</hi> which from
time to time may give refreshment to Man and Beast.
Wherefore by the Reasons and Proportions of <hi>Good,</hi> a
man is requir'd, according to his ability, to look beyond
the term of his own few and uncertain days, known on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to God how few they are.</p>
            <p>He is,</p>
            <p>2. Required to <hi>benefit Posterity,</hi> that he may be a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of God in true Religion, which is the <hi>imitation</hi> of
Him who we worship: And by doing Charities which
may last, we are made, in some measure like to Him;
for all Generations partake of the Goodness of God.</p>
            <p>He so framed the Material World at the beginning,
that by the same Order of Nature (the same for the
main) it might in its several Ages conveniently subsist;
and the same <hi>Sun</hi> that shone on <hi>Adam,</hi> enlightens
us.</p>
            <p>God permitted men in the <hi>first</hi> Age of the World, to
live very many Years, that by their Experience (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Course of the Stars, which required length
of time for observation) the <hi>following</hi> Ages might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>useful</hi> Instruction; <hi>useful,</hi> not only in secular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
but in Religion; the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>more they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
declaring the more the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> ordained the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Passover,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
of the Lords Supper, not merely for the men of any <hi>one</hi>
Age, but as <hi>Memorials</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> of the <hi>Deliverance</hi>
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the meritorious <hi>Passion</hi> of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for many Generations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101747:4"/>
He sent his Blessed Son <hi>once</hi> to offer a Sacrifice,
whose Virtue might be communicated to all true
Christians, as long as there should be a Church on
Earth.</p>
            <p>He caused Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be written for the good of
all following times; and the things which were written
of old, were written for our Admonition, upon whom
the <hi>ends of the world are come.</hi> For instance; we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to <hi>Remember the wife of Lot,</hi> who, so many Years
ago, (looking <hi>back towards Sodom</hi>) was turn'd into a
Pillar of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur, Gen. 19. 25. 26. S. Luke
17. 32. Deut.</hi> 29. 23. being punish'd in the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
way with those unclean Sinners who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in it.</p>
            <p>3. There is not a fitter expression of our <hi>gratitude to
former Ages,</hi> than a hearty endeavour to procure advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to those who come after us, as we have received
benefit by those who went before us; borrowing Light
from their Light, and living upon the Effects of their
Benevolence. If nothing had been done for us, in how
misirable an Estate should we have come into the World
and lived in it? Much more miserably than <hi>Adam,</hi> who
in the state of Innocence, enjoy'd the Earth, without
the Curse which Disobedience brought upon it. If all
Arts, and Sciences, and Buildings, and other such
Helps and Conveniences of <hi>Humane Life,</hi> were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and begun with every Age, how rude, how
mean would the condition of it be? How heavily
would it be pressed with the burthen of Necessity? How
much more painful and laborious would this render the
Pilgrimage of man, which as it is, with all its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
has still its sufficient share of trouble? In what
darkness had we fate in reference to the means of our
Redemption, if it had not pleased the God of Wisdom,
through the hands of the Christians of former Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
to deliver down to us the Holy Bible?</p>
            <p>It does therefore well become us to have a sense of
the Favours of those who died before our times, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101747:4"/>
still live in their benefits; and gratefully to celebrate
their just Praise, and to have a perpetual inclination,
when we have not further power, <hi>to go, and to do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>just</hi> as this <hi>Practice</hi> is, there seems to be</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Too general a disuse of it,</hi> Some are careful even to
Anxiety, but they show that the solicitude is for their
selves, by their backwardness in disposing of anything
so much as by a WILL. Some let <hi>Receits</hi> and <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
dye with them, by which great numbers in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages might have been profited. Some are not
provident for <hi>their selves,</hi> and therefore not likely to
take due care for Posterity. They will not put a
<hi>stone</hi> into a decaying Building, or drop an <hi>acorn</hi> into
the Ground for the sake of those that shall follow them;
much less have they a zeal for the supporting of Gods
Church in difficult times, or the planting of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in places that want the blessing of it: Insomuch
that when they give up their wretched lives (as give
them up they must, what aversion soever they have to
it) they appear as a Place surrendred after a long and
tedious Siege, where little remains, besides dead Corpses
Rubbish, and Ruins.</p>
            <p>And this puts me in mind of still a worser <hi>sort of men,</hi>
who by their <hi>inhumanity,</hi> make such desolations in their
times, as late Posterity can scarce repair. Their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
lies not in promoting <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Holy Worship,</hi> but
in forcing Error and Idolatry; not in Building and
Planting, but in plucking up and destroying. They
are imitators of <hi>Apollyon</hi> the God of this World, whose
<hi>Delight</hi> is Mischief, whose Triumphs are Barbarities,
Fire and Sword are the Instruments of their <hi>Glory:</hi> They
spare neither the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the Living, nor the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the Dead. They lay wast in a few hours, strong
and beautiful Cities, which were the fruit of the Arts
and Labours of former Times. One would think they
would anticip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Doomsday it self, if their Force were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101747:5"/>
equal to their Pride and Malice: Though that sort of
men, of all others in the World, have the least reason
to hasten the Day of Judgment. When their Acts shall
be rehearsed before the <hi>Children that are yet unborn,</hi> they
will rise up with just indignation, and call their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
accursed.</p>
            <p>If (as we have proposed in the <hi>third place</hi>)</p>
            <p>3. We inquire into the Causes of this Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we shall without much difficulty, find them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>ill Principles</hi> and disorderly <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi>
and <hi>Humours</hi> of unreasonable men. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</p>
            <p>The <hi>Atheistical,</hi> if they follow the consequence of
their Opinion, terminate their <hi>Designs,</hi> as they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
they do their humane <hi>Beings,</hi> in this
<hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who live by <hi>Sense,</hi> whose Objects are <hi>present,</hi>
have no regard for such as they shall never live to see;
for such as are not capable of returning them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
thanks, of making them Presents, of pleasing them
with flatteries, of rendring them such services as are most
grateful to flesh and blood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>slothful</hi> will not be at the pains to build or to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
to manure or cultivate, to catechise a Child, or
instruct a Servant, or discreetly to reprove an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Neighbour: They will let their <hi>own Vineyards</hi>
be over-run, in their own times with Briars and
Thorns.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Careless</hi> and <hi>Voluptuous</hi> are contented to think (if
thinking be at any time the exercise of such Affectors of
of Ease) that Peace and Plenty will last for their Days;
and that is all the Eternity they care for; though by
such neglect, Ruin often comes down upon their Heads
before the term of their Life is expired. So it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happens to the <hi>Prodigal</hi> who inspect not their Affairs,
and believe their Fortune to be <hi>sufficient for their Time;</hi>
And in that Imagination, say to their Souls, <hi>Take your</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase: and dream on till they are surpriz'd by Poverty:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101747:5"/>
And, if their loose and swift way of living permits them
to number many Years; there remain to them the
fewest Supplies in <hi>that Age</hi> which has the most
and greatest needs, the Age of <hi>Labour and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ill-natur'd</hi> hate the rest of the World, and are
not pleased that the state of it should be bettered by them.
Out of the abundance of such an ill Heart came that
worst of Sayings pronounced by one of the Brutal Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
<hi>When I leave the World, let Earth and Fire mingle;</hi>
or, let the Frame of Nature be immediately dissolv'd.
He would have forborn those wicked Words, if
he had but just thought of that more dreadful Fire
which Divine Justice has prepared for the Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> the <hi>Proud</hi> and the <hi>Designing,</hi> who are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ignorant, will on purpose deny a leberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to those Children who are under their Conduct,
lest they grow too wise and sensible for them.</p>
            <p>From the same <hi>Passion</hi> it is, that Wicked Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to hinder both present and future Good, by
depressing generous and worthy Persons, giving them
occasion to complain, with that great Warrior <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisarius;</hi>
               <q>It was not a <hi>Crime</hi> that hurt us but En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Likewise,</hi> the <hi>Covetuous</hi> either stifle the <hi>Wills</hi> of the
Charitable, or forbear to fulfill them; converting
that to their own use, which was piously intended for
others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Also,</hi> the <hi>Malicious</hi> study on purpose to leave <hi>That
which must go to others,</hi> in a ruinous Condition. It may
be, without a House for shelter, or a Tree for shade,
or a Field worn out with perpetual bearing, or a Paper
for Direction, and for the determination of Strife; much
more withour a Prayer for the Prosperity of those who
shall come after them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> of some Men of revengeful Dispositions, it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101747:6"/>
has been said, That on their very <hi>Death-Beds,</hi> [a solemn
Time in which nothing should supplant the Love of God
and Man; when their abundant Charity should, through
Christ, prepare their way to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God before
whom they are suddenly to appear] that, being engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in vexatious Suits and Quarrels with others, they
have given it in charge to the Heirs of their Families,
to keep up the Grudg, and to continue the Controversy
from Generation to Generation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Where this Evil Tempter abounds, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails
Trouble and Confusion: For it requires little skill
to unfix and embroil, but a great deal to establish. May
That (as we hope, and as we pray) be, for the future,
the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of this Age, to the end that it may flourish
in True Religion, in Unity, in Plenty, Peace and
Health, and by that means become a Blessing to these
Lands for ever.</p>
            <p>These Evil <hi>Principles, Lusts, Passions,</hi> and <hi>Humours</hi>
which I have mentioned, are the <hi>Causes of the Decay</hi>
of that generous Charity so beneficial to the Ages to
come.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us not follow the inordinate Affections and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Customs of the Men of this World, but be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with to imitate <hi>David?</hi> or rather, the God of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
who hath a Blessing for every Age; and who, when
he rested from the <hi>Work of Creation,</hi> did not forbear the
Works of <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That we may be capable of practising this sort
of Charity, the forementioned <hi>Passions</hi> are to be subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by pious Consideration, by Prayer for the especial
Grace of God, by firm and steadfast Resolution, by
Conversation with Christians whose Hearts are enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
by reading the holy Scriptures, and in them, the
History of God's Power and Goodness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> being thus made capable of doing present
and future Good; that we may do it as we ought,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101747:6"/>
the <hi>Good-will,</hi> the right <hi>Scope,</hi> the <hi>Decence,</hi> the <hi>Iustice</hi>
of It, are well to be weighed.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>First, Good-will</hi> ought to be the Spring which
moves Men that benefit those who succeed them; for it
is no Virtue to <hi>leave that behind us,</hi> which Death will
not permit us to <hi>carry away. Dives laid up Goods for many
years,</hi> and he left them to Others, without being to
them a Benefactor; for, <hi>he laid them up for himself,</hi> upon
a vain and presumptuous supposition of long Life; in
which he was miserably disappointed, by the surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Justice of that Righteous God, who said to
Him, <hi>Thou Fool! this Night thy Soul shall be taken from
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> This <hi>Good-will</hi> is to be directed to a right and
profitable <hi>Scope;</hi> that Charity may not be blinded by
<hi>Superstition,</hi> which hath founded many <hi>Societies,</hi> and
left great Revenues, and enriched many <hi>Shrines,</hi> to the
<hi>hurt of Posterity,</hi> by promoting the Honour of false De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
and Saints; and by encouraging a Worship from
Age to Age, in which the True God can take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>There is also to be observed, in this Practice, a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi>
which forbids a Man to be severely <hi>Penurions</hi> all
his days, for <hi>the doing a greater Good at the last.</hi> It is true,
He is not to be condemned for cutting off unnecessary
Pomps and Expences in order to so good an End: And
he may be bold with himself. But, though there may
be a <hi>laudable Frugality,</hi> there must not be a <hi>sordidness</hi> in his
Selfdenial.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Add to this,</hi> That <hi>Iustice,</hi> as well as <hi>Decency</hi> becomes
all Men who piously design to be Benefactors to Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
They are not to do Evil that Good may come of
it; or, to be unjust, Oppressors, Extortioners in one
Age, that they may be bountiful to another. Yet, such
is the manner of the Covetuous, who love not Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
nor their very Off-spring as Men, but in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of their second-selves: They run the hazard even
of Damnation, for the greatning of those, who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101747:7"/>
spend with vicious profuseness all that Wealth
which, with such guilt of Conscience they had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Having found out such <hi>Rules</hi> as these for
the governing of our Practice, we may render our
selves more fit for the discharge of so Excellent a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By removing certain Discouragements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By attending to some further Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Discouragements</hi> are of <hi>Two</hi> Kinds.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Suspicions</hi> of <hi>Ability</hi> to do such good.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Hindrances</hi> of <hi>Willingness</hi> in Those who are able to
do it; and in some of them who are not ill inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>1. Men of <hi>inferiour Condition</hi> suspect their <hi>Ability;</hi> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining,
that he who would become a Benefactor,
must be arm'd with great Power and Authority indued
with high degrees of Wisdom, and furnished with such
heaps of growing Wealth, as may supply Charity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sensible Diminution.</p>
            <p>Whereas there are divers waies by which Persons, in
meaner Circumstances, may, in <hi>their Age,</hi> be useful
both to <hi>that</hi> and the <hi>next.</hi> A poor Man, as we read in
<hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> did by his prudent Counsel deliver a City.
And that Place had, probably, the Benefit of his good
Advice a long time after; tho' whilst his wisdom made
him considerable, his Poverty exposed him to the Scorn
and Neglect of the Proud and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>grateful. There are
true Benefactors in the World besides such who have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to make <hi>Publick Waies,</hi> to repair <hi>Breaches</hi> of the
Sea, to calm that which is tumultuous, the Rage of the
People; to build Houses for God's Worship, to found
Colledges and Hospitals, to subdue public Enemies,
and to enact wholsom Laws, which are the Nerves of
Society, and by the strength of which we a while (by
God's Blessing) subsisted, though Popish Superstition
did so furiously assault us. Many may communicate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101747:7"/>
to their Neighbours a wholsom <hi>Medicine,</hi> though they
cannot erect a House for the Sick, and Wounded, and
Impotent. Every Master of a Family in <hi>Israel.</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to shew his Children the Reason of the <hi>Paschal
Feast,</hi> and to teach them the Law of God. Those,
therefore, were not Performances out of their Power,
for then they could not have been their Duty. And to
Christians their great Master saith, What excellent
things do ye? What do <hi>ye more than others?</hi> Much Good
they may do by rehearsing the Holy History of God's
Law and his wonderful Works before others, that they
may learn it and transmit it to the next Generation.
Much Good they may do by teaching of necessary Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
to Youth, and by forming the manners of those
who are likely to outlive them. They may instil into
them betimes such Christian Principles as may grow
up with them, and <hi>bring forth Fruit in their Age.</hi> He
who hath a small proportion of Silver or Gold, may
yet be sometimes capable of leaving behind him a more
valuable Legacy: By giving the World a <hi>Book of Piety,</hi>
such as that of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> by which the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
and modest Author hath done a greater Good to
those who lived in and after his Time, than if he had
poured forth other Riches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on them in overflowing
measure.</p>
            <p>Most are capable of doing a durable Charity by good
<hi>Example,</hi> which may operate when they are dead and
gone. To how many Generations has the Instance of
afflicted <hi>Iob</hi> administred Courage and Support, whilst
they have called it to Remembrance in the Time of their
Trouble? And there is great need of <hi>virtuous Example</hi>
for the ballancing of that which is <hi>Bad;</hi> the Contagion
of which sticks like Leprosie in Families, Churches and
Kingdoms. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat</hi> made <hi>Israel</hi> to
sin 1. King. 14. 16. [to commit that great Sin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
by worshipping the true God by an Image] both
in <hi>his Time,</hi> and after he was gone to answer both
for his own and for other Men's Sins. But what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101747:8"/>
could he make for either? Either was a Burthen
too heavy for him to bear.</p>
            <p>Then, <hi>for the Charity of Prayer,</hi> who is there that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
call on God for a Blessing on Persons and Families,
on Churches and States, after they shall have left this
unquiet Stage, and that <hi>Sche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 34. 7. Deut. 7. 9.</p>
            <p>In sum, all <hi>Wicked M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ked, are hurtful, and
all <hi>Good Men,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> good, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re beneficial both at present and
for the future. Blessing and Cursing persue Families
very often, according to the Righteousness or Impiety
of the first Heads of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are <hi>Discouragements</hi> which hinder
Men, who are able to do Good to other Generations,
from being <hi>Willing.</hi> That is to say, The Instance of
<hi>Backwardness</hi> in Public Mannagers to <hi>reward</hi> those who
have undone themselves by some <hi>useful Invention,</hi> which
generally ruines the first <hi>Projestors,</hi> whilst Posterity reaps
the fruit of their Wit, Labour, and Expence. Also
the Instances of <hi>Failures</hi> and <hi>Frauds</hi> of smothered or
abused Legacies, in <hi>Trust,</hi> of the converting of
that to the use of the Rich, which is bequeathed
to the Poor; together with the Consideration of the
<hi>uncertainty of Times,</hi> in which, by Wars and tumultuous
Violences, the Effects of publick Charity do often perish.</p>
            <p>There is much Truth in this <hi>Objection,</hi> but yet not so
much as makes it <hi>unanswerable. Useful Inventions</hi> are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
greater Charities than could have been done by the
Pains and Wealth which they cost. <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Abuses</hi>
do not alwaies happen: They do not alwaies come;
and <hi>wo to them,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who are injur'd by them, but by
<hi>whom they come.</hi> And the Observation of such acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Miscarriages should, indeed, <hi>increase the Caution,</hi> but
not prevent the Charity of wealthy Men. It is, also,
profitable for us to remember, That whatsoever Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
<hi>Good Works run,</hi> the Soul that has done them in
Christian Manner, shall be safe in the Hands of their
Mediator. Christians know in whom they have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101747:8"/>
and how able he is to keep that which is committed
to <hi>his Trust</hi> to <hi>that Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seasons,</hi> that's an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against doing Good in all Ages; for Heaven only
is <hi>a Kingdom which cannot be shaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, laying aside these Impediments, cast
in our Way by too great a Degree of Jealousie, let
us,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Provoke our selves to Piety and to Good
Works, by laying before our Thoughts such further
<hi>Motives</hi> as these.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> may be taken from the <hi>true pleasure</hi> which is
found in all <hi>good Acts,</hi> and particularly of those of that
kind of which we have been speaking. <hi>Pleasure</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
springs up in the Mind, when we think of any
thing we much value, as <hi>continuing</hi> and <hi>prospering.</hi> A
great degree of happiness consists in <hi>hope,</hi> and in hope
cherished by <hi>proceeding.</hi> The Mind is <hi>damp'd</hi> when it is
<hi>stinted,</hi> and when it sees an end of any thing in which it
took content. And if pleasure is derived to us from the
growth and progress even of our humblest <hi>Plants,</hi> much
more shall we be pleased by the extent of our goodness to
Christian Men, and in the duration of it. It is a blessed and
comfortable Thought, that God will vouchsafe to use
such frail earthen Vessels, as Instruments of <hi>good;</hi> by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
by Example, by Prayers, by Alms, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Span of our Life, but <hi>for many years to come.</hi>
It was a strong Consolation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his
Off-spring all the <hi>Nations of the Earth should be bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Motive</hi> may be taken from <hi>Honour,</hi>
which is <hi>Fame</hi> acquired by doing of <hi>worthy things.</hi>
After this Men so naturally thirst, that some
have affected the Name of <hi>Benefactors,</hi> Luke 22.
25. who have turn'd their Power into Oppression; for
of that number (as <hi>Philo</hi> shews us) was <hi>Caius Caligula.</hi>
They understood what was venerable, but they did not
pursue if.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101747:9"/>
Even the <hi>Charity</hi> which is <hi>transient,</hi> is honourable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Woman who with her Spikenard <hi>anointed our
Saviour to his burial,</hi> is to this day honourably remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
wheresoever the History of the Gospel is read. And
if to <hi>transient good</hi> our Praise is due, certainly to that
which is <hi>lasting</hi> it ought not to be denied. Wherefore
the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> considering the Salvation of the World
by Christ, whose Mother she was become through God's
special favour, believed not her <hi>Magnificat</hi> to be a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
<hi>Hymn,</hi> but said with humble Joy, <hi>God hath regard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the lowliness of his Hand-maiden; for behold from henceforth
all Generations shall call me blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>greatest Motives</hi> of all are, <hi>Conscience,</hi> which
requireth us to do <hi>good,</hi> as our Christian Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religious Fear,</hi> which sets before the <hi>Unprofitable</hi> (the
unprofitable to Men, for God we cannot profit) the
<hi>Terrors</hi> of the <hi>great Day.</hi> And, last of all,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religious Hope,</hi> which moves us to be useful, in all our
Capacities, whilst time lasts, upon the most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prospect of an Eternal Recompence.</p>
            <p>O the blessed Day, when those <hi>who abound in the work
of the Lord Iesus,</hi> shall find <hi>their labour not to be in vain in
the</hi> same Lord. When the penitent, pious, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
shall behold the general Assembly of those <hi>great
Souls</hi> who neither <hi>liv'd nor dy'd to themselves.</hi> May God
prepare us for this Felicity, by Faith, and Repentance,
and Good Works, through him who was both the <hi>desire</hi>
and the <hi>blessing of all Nations, Iesus Christ the Righteous,</hi> to
whom with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> be all Honour
and Glory, World without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>
