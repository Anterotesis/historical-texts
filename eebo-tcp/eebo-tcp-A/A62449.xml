            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT was the Judgment of
the Learned <hi>Philip
Carriana,</hi> That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Latin Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
there was not any one,
who was to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> if equall'd to
him, either for the Solidity of
his Inſtructions conducing to
Civil Life, or for his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:37902:3"/>
of Conciſe and Judicious
Writing; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that all his words are as
ſo many Sentences. There
is nothing unprofitable, <hi>ſays
he,</hi> in his Writings, nothing
of Hyperbole, nothing of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution
in his words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marquiſs Virgilio
Malvezzi</hi> ſpeaks this farther
of him, That his Hiſtory
conſiſts in recounting the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Soveraign Princes;
and the Benefit that accrews
to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s from thence is this,
<pb facs="tcp:37902:3"/>
that we may learn thereby
thoſe things which may be of
great uſe to us in an Age,
wherein almoſt all the Eſtates
of the World are under
Monarchical Government.</p>

                  <hi>The meaning of the Text is,</hi> That
there was no want of Egregious and Spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Wits, till they were Stupifi'd by Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<hi>D'Ablancourt renders it,</hi> While
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37902:6"/>
there was no ſpeaking of Truth without
a Candid Complacency, <hi>Which does not</hi>
does not ſufficiently expreſs the Sence of
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> whoſe meaning is, that where Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
Reigns, there follows a decay of Towring
Ingenuities, for that all Recompences and
Rewards go to the Flatterers. <hi>Therefore
Monſieur</hi> Harlay Chanvalon, <hi>has render'd
the words much better, thus, till Noble
Ingenuities had debas'd themſelves by
Flattery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There needs no other Comment upon
theſe words, then that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> himſelf.
Many Authors, ſaith he, have Compil'd
us the Hiſtory of the Seven Firſt Ages of
the Roman Commonweal, at what time
they Wrote with no leſs Freedom then
Eloquence: but after it was the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of Peace that the Supream Power
ſhould be devolv'd upon one ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
thoſe lofty Genius's were ſoon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips'd.
And the Reaſon was, for that
Dominion having depriv'd Equality of
all Command, every one ſtrove to pleaſe
and comply with the Prince, that he
might render himſelf capable of Honours
and Preferment, to which he could not
aſcend, but by the ſteps of Servitude.
For ſo it is, that Servitude and Flattery
are two inſeparable Companions: And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37902:6"/>
it was upon the occaſion of the ſhameful
Flatteries of the Senate, that <hi>Tiberius</hi>
himſelf was wont ſo often to Exclaim:
<hi>Poor Souls prepar'd for Slavery.</hi> The youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<hi>Pliny,</hi> whom we ſhall frequently cite,
by reaſon of the Conformity of his Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
with thoſe of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> whom he caus'd
to examine his Writings, ſpeaking of his
Uncles Books, makes an excuſe for eight,
which were not wrote in the ſame
Stile, and wanted thoſe Sinews of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that gave manly force to all the
Reſt; becauſe they were Written under
the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> when the Servile
Fears of Men would not permit 'em to
write with Freedom. And in one of his
Epiſtles, he adds, That he liv'd in the
Reign of another Emperour, when the
Senate was become altogether Mute, and
meerly Stupifi'd, by reaſon of long Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

               <p>Princes of the Youth; that is to ſay,
Preſumptive Heirs of the Empire. <hi>D'Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt</hi>
renders it thus. He had Adopted
the Sons of <hi>Agrippa, Caius</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi>
and caus'd 'em to be Proclaim'd Princes of the
Youth, and earneſtly deſir'd they might be in

to have it ſo.</p>
               <p>Flattery is always the Companion of
Advanc'd Fortune. For <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi>
were no ſooner admitted into the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Family, but the Senate and Roman
People deſign 'em for the Empire. And
that which is yet more remarkable is
this, That theſe two Princes, who had
not as yet aſſum'd the Robe of Manhood,
and conſequently were not capable of
Publick Employments, were already Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls
Elected by the Senate and People,
altho' <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> out of an Affected Modeſty,

as if <hi>Tacitus</hi> would ſeem to intimate, that
they began even to neglect <hi>Augustus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
as it is the Cuſtom of Subjects,
more eſpecially Courtiers to adore the
Riſing Beams, and forſake the Setting
Sun. Flattery has been always ſway'd by
Intereſt, and Mercenary. When Princes
grow in Years, and begin to ſtoop to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Grave, Flattery removes her
Altars, and offers her Incenſe to thoſe
who are to Succeed, to the end ſhe may
be ſure betimes to make ſure of their
earlieſt Favour and good Opinion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was a Sentence of <hi>Galba,</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon good Reaſon, that <hi>Flattery was
vaid of Love;</hi> and that there was not any
Poiſon more dangerous then hers. And
I wiſh it were the Will of Heaven, that
all Princes were as well Convinc'd of this
Truth, as <hi>Galba.</hi> Surely it would be
much better for the General Proſperity
of their Affairs; and their Reputation,
of which they can never be too jealous,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37902:8"/>
would advance it ſelf to a higher Pinacle
of Grandeur. For then they would have
Subjects that would adore their Perſons,
whereas thoſe Many Flatterers that croud
about their Thrones, Idolize nothing but

               <p>What a ſtrange thing Flattery is! The
Diſpute was about the Election of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
for which Office there were ſeveral
that ſtood. <hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Germanicus,</hi> the
Sons of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> favour'd a Kinſman of

thoſe who had the moſt numerous
Iſſue. However, notwithſtanding the
Election was hotly bandy'd and oppos'd
by the Senate, yet Favour at length car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
it above the Law. Which is no
more then what happens every day in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Courts, However let Princes be
never ſo Vertuous and Moderate, yet they
always take delight to prefer their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
above the Laws, while it gives
them the Opportunity of reaping to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37902:15"/>
themſelves the ſole Glory of ſubmitting
afterwards. Thus it was that <hi>Tiberius</hi> one
day Depreſs'd himſelf, to advance the high
Opinion of his Moderation, returning in
anſwer to the Flattery of a Senator, That
the Cuſtomes of a Country prudently
Eſtabliſh'd, and with which the People
had always all along been ſatisfi'd, were
not to be Chang'd, but upon mature and
deep Premeditation: That Princes
had too much Buſineſs already, and too
much Power: That while they labour'd
to advance and extend their own, they
did but weaken the Authority of the
Law. Laſtly, That there was no need of
Application to a Prince, when the Laws
were ſufficient to reform the Grievance.
Here by the way we muſt obſerve, that
in Republic's they ſay, The Laws are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Princes: But in Monarchies, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of State requires that the Prince
ſhould be above the Laws: I ſpeak of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary

where the Government is Ariſtocratico-Monarchical.</p>

               <p>Says <hi>D'Ablancourt,</hi> He ſeverely reprov'd

               <p>There are ſome Flatterys, that render

Contemn'd, had he accepted of a Title,
which <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whoſe Example had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with him the force of a Law, had
refus'd by a Decree. And for that reaſon
it was that he thunder'd out his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt Thoſe, who call'd him
LORD. He was a Lord in Reality,
but he would not that People ſhould call
him ſo, as being deſirous they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he did not look upon himſelf ſo to
be. Politic Princes are contented with
the Subſtance of their Power, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
part with all the reſt as meerly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37902:16"/>

who was nothing troubl'd that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſo long as he did not wear the Scars and

made in taming the Senate with the
vain ſhew of Liberty, the more he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd
and eſtabliſh'd his Power. The
more Popular his Words and Actions
were, the more plyable he found the
Great Men, and the more eaſily led to
Servitude. He was offended with thoſe
who call'd his Occupations, <hi>Divine;</hi> for
becauſe he knew himſelf not undeſervedly
to be tax'd with the Common Stain of his
Family, which was Haughtineſs, he was
deſirous that the People ſhould believe he
went hand in hand with the Senate in the
Government. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I am but a
Mortal Man, and ſubject to all the Frailties
of Humanity, and therefore 'tis enough for me
to be Honour'd with the firſt Seat in the Senate,
and more then enough if I ſupply it well.</hi>—Princes
are Mortal, but the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is Eternal. By this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he was no more then a Member,
and he permitted thoſe Honours that
were pay'd him no otherwiſe, then as they
were aſcrib'd to the reſt of the Senators.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37902:16"/>
Who though they gave little Credit to
what he ſaid, yet were they pleas'd to
hear him deliver himſelf with ſo much
Modeſty, ſo much the rather becauſe it
was not always his luck to be Popular for
all that. Obſerve moreover, that by
the Difference which he made between
Princes as Mortals, and Commonwealths
as being Eternal, he ſeem'd to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that he was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
LORD of the Empire, that he had
little Concern in the Government of it;
only his Eternity reſided in the Body of

               <p>To hate Flattery is to love Liberty;

Nevertheleſs <hi>Tiberius</hi> hated both the one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37902:17"/>
and the other. A ſtrange thing, ſays
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> that a Prince who left remaining
not the leaſt Footſtep of Liberty, ſhould
be tir'd and diſcontented to behold in
the Senate, ſuch an Effeminate and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Complacency. Certainly 'tis a very
difficult thing to find the way how to
pleaſe the Palate of a Politic Prince. If
you Flatter him continually, you incur his
Contempt; if you deal too frankly and
freely with him, you meet his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How Vertuous ſoever he be, too
much Liberty offends him; becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not ſo reſpectful as Flattery. And
if they are wickedly enclin'd, Flattery
then becomes ſuſpected; becauſe her Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
are oftentimes the Reproaches
of Vices, which are oppoſite to Vertue.
Therefore had <hi>Tacitus</hi> reaſon to ſay,
that a Man has enough to do, who has to
deal with a Prince that underſtands what

as one that could not hope to reap the fruit

               <p>The ſame thing happen'd to <hi>Tiberius,</hi>

Champions, diſpute for Preheminence in

ſteps up, and propoſes that the

little heeding that while he Honour'd

that if the Alteration of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical

highly injurious to Majeſty, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
neither Equality nor Dependency.
And thus ſee how Flattery oft-times ſplits
it ſelf upon the Rocks of Imprudence,
and becomes Affrontive where ſhe ſtudies
moſt Obſequiouſneſs. As for <hi>Quintus
Haterius,</hi> his Flattery was ſo ill reſented by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37902:24"/>
                  <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that his Propoſal was look'd
upon as Extravagant. And that which
render'd him moſt ridiculous, was his
Old Age, that put him out of hopes of
ever living to reap the Fruit of <hi>Druſus</hi>'s
acknowledgement; ſo that there nothing
more remain'd for him, but the ignominy
of having been the Author of a Propoſal
ſo much beneath a Perſon of his Years
and Quality: for he was of an Illuſtrious
Family, and moreover highly eſteem'd
for his Eloquence. Whence you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

wonderfully ſympathize one with

to be a cunning and dextrous Flatterer

without Adulation. And this is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,

That Eloquence is not to be learnt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt, Ennius</hi> a Roman
Knight was accus'd of High Treaſon, for
having melted a Statue of the Prince, to
change it into Silver Plate for his own uſe.
But <hi>Tiberius</hi> diſcharg'd him; tho' <hi>Capito</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37902:26"/>
oppos'd him, crying out as if he had ſtood up
in defence of the Public Liberty, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him not to let ſo great an Offender go
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npuniſh'd; that he might Pardon his own,
but not the Injuries of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flattery is never more wicked, then
when ſhe diſguiſes her ſelf in the habit
of Liberty.</hi> Capito <hi>was not to learn that</hi>
Tiberius <hi>hated Flattery, and that on the
other ſide he was no Friend to Liberty;
and therefore he intermixes both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
What? <hi>ſays he,</hi> will you let go a
Criminal, that has thus daringly diſplay'd
his contempt of your Perſon, by melting down
one of your Statues; and had this Offence
been committed againſt You alone, you might
have pardon'd it, and the Senate could not
have oppos'd it; but ſince it is a Crime that
<hi>Ennius</hi> has committed againſt the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public,
the Puniſhment belongs to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; ſince
it is not juſt that you ſhould be ſo merciful
at the Expence of our Authority.</p>
               <p>Certainly no piece of Flattery could ever
have out-done this Reprimand. <hi>Capito,</hi>
who was not ignorant of the cruel Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> would inſinuate that all
the Injuries done to the Prince, ſhould
be look'd upon as done to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal;
to the end that under that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

pretence, while the Senate ſatisfi'd
the Emperours Revenge, <hi>Tiberius</hi> might
be diſcharg'd of the <hi>Odium</hi> which was
like to fall upon him, had he been Carver
for himſelf. Thus Sycophants cheriſh and
foment the Vices of Princes, and teach
'em how to be Tyrants. Obſerve by the

learn'd in the Laws, both Human and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and moreover accounted one of the
Chief Men in the Senate, yet all his
Learning ſerv'd but to ſtain his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Eternal Reproach; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>This was the True means to preſerve

are too open to the Charms of pleaſing

their Lips, Princes would never be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided,

likewiſe <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> to the

               <p>The High Prieſt, <hi>ſays D'Ablancourt,</hi>
when they made their Vows for the Emperour,
recommended to the Protection of the ſame
Gods, <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Druſus,</hi> not ſo much
through any Affection as out of Flattery,
the Exceſs or Omiſſion of which are equally
dangerous.</p>
               <p>We have already aſſerted, that Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
is void of Love, and that by ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Flattery, Men often looſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Mazes of Folly and Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And certainly it was a great piece
of Imprudence to equal to the Perſon of
the Emperour, two young Striplings
that were but juſt coming into the World.
Majeſty endures no Companion or Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
in Honours. When others
mount, ſhe muſt deſcend. Flattery's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinary;
and is always for him that bids
moſt. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was now in his declining
years, and <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> in the prime
of their Youth. The High Prieſts look'd
upon the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as a Reign
that would be ſoon at an end; and the
Fortune of <hi>Nero,</hi> as a Sovereignty that
was ſhortly to Commence. Therefore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37902:30"/>
it was not through Affection but Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
that they made ſo little a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between the two Brothers and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi>
who having loſt his Son, ſeem'd
to have no more then a precarious and
languiſhing Authority. And this was the
meaning of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he told the
Pontiffs, That he was glad to ſee Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
equall'd to his Hoary Age; which
was a wipe by the by, to let 'em under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
they had been too haſty to appoint
him a Succeſſor. And thus you ſee what
an ill reception Flattery finds, when once
it knows no bounds. But the Omiſſion
of Flattery is no leſs diſpleaſing to
Princes, as aſcribing the cauſe of that
neglect to Haughtineſs, to Contumacy,
or Contempt. And therefore it was that
<hi>Tiberius</hi> ſo often complain'd of the Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
and Indocibility of <hi>Agrippina,
Germanicus</hi>'s Wife; and that under <hi>Nero,</hi>
it was objected againſt <hi>Thraſea,</hi> for no
leſs then High Treaſon, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
either applauded, or countenanc'd
the Flatteries of others, and that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
abſented himſelf on purpoſe, when
the Magiſtrates were to take their Oaths
of Allegiance, or made any Vows for the
Proſperity of the Prince: That he had
never Sacrific'd in return of Thanks for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37902:31"/>
his Charming and Celeſtial Voice, that
he would never acknowledg <hi>Poppea</hi> for
a Goodeſs; that he had forboru coming
to the Senate for three Years together,
becauſe he would not conſent to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees;
to ſhew that none of his Majeſties
Actions pleas'd him, though he would
not declare his mind by any open Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or Oppoſition. That he left the
Senate one day, when they were making
Speeches againſt the Memory of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Nero.</hi> And thus you
ſee in one Man, almoſt all the ſins of
Omiſſion, which a Courtier could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in the concerns of Flattery. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
there are ſome Occaſions where the
Subject cannot diſpence with Flattery as
others do. Such are thoſe which we call
Congratulation, or Condolement. Tho'
had <hi>Thraſea</hi> been preſent when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
took their Oaths, had he made
his Vows for the Prince, or appear'd at
the Funeral of <hi>Poppea,</hi> it could have been
no ſtain to his Reputation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it does not become a Subject to be
too ſtiff neither; but on the other ſide
to comply with the Times and Humours
of the Prince, as much as it is poſſible,
more eſpecially ſo far as the Rules of
good Breeding and Civility extend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:37902:31"/>
Thus the younger <hi>Pliny</hi> being deſign'd
Conſul, refus'd to decree new honours to
<hi>Trajan,</hi> as the Conſuls Elect had wont
to do to other Princes. <hi>But,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>I did not abſtain from this ſame outward
Appearance of Flattery, through any motive
of Liberty infring'd, or of Conſtancy, but
becauſe I was aſſur'd of the Moderation of
my Prince, therefore believing it would be
much more to his Honour, for me to refuſe
the making any ſuch Decree; altho' ſo juſt a

unleſs they love Reciprocally; for
Love it ſelf is Maſterleſs, that to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd

                  <hi>LEpidus</hi> for the moſt part, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
for the better, from the
ſevere Adulations of others; and
yet he carry'd himſelf ſo exactly
poys'd that he flouriſh'd under <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
with an equal ſhare of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and his Princes Favour. So
that I am conſtrain'd to doubt whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Inclination of Princes to
ſome, and their Averſion to others,
be not guided as many other things
are by fate and the ruling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations
at our Birth: And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be in our power to walk in a
Path free from Ambition and Dan-
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37902:34"/>
between untractable Contumacy,
and deformed Servility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt,</hi> Many times he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd
the over-rigorous advice of others, not
failing nevertheleſs in his Reſpect to his
Prince, and by that means preſerv'd two
things moſt difficult to be preſerv'd; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his Employment, and his Majeſties
Favour. Which makes me frequently doubt
whither the Favour of Great Men, and their
Hatred, be not rather the effects of Deſtiny,
and the Stars that governour Nativities, as
are all other Accidents that happen in the
World, then of Human Prudence, that ſo
much pretends to have a ſhare therein.</p>
               <p>The Moderation of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Teſtimony, that rhere may be
ſome great Perſonages, impenetrable to
Flattery and Injuſtice under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
even of the moſt wicked Princes, and
that there never was any Age ſo barren
of Vertuous Courage, but has offer'd us
Examples of ſuch a noble Generoſity.
Prudence underſtands to chooſe out ſuch
a way that leads neither to the Precipice
of Liberty, nor the Abyſs of Servitude.
She is neither <hi>Libertine</hi> nor <hi>Slave,</hi> but
obſerves an equal Temper, ſo as neither
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37902:34"/>
to be offenſive to Majeſty nor Juſtice. Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
gives to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that which belongs to
<hi>Caeſar;</hi> that is to ſay, Obedience and
Duty: To God, that which is Gods, or
whatever is required by a ſincere Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If at any time ſhe Flatters, (for
ſhe cannot always avoid it) ſhe makes
uſe of ſuch a ſort of Flattery, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
informs then miſleads the Prince,
and ſerves as an Incitement to provoke
him to ſome Generous Act, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
perhaps he might not think of. For
example, <hi>Lepidus</hi> to ſave the Life of
<hi>Lutorius Priſcus,</hi> whom <hi>Haterius Agrippa</hi>
had ſentenc'd to Death, for a certain
Elegie made upon <hi>Druſus,</hi> makes it his
buſineſs to applaud the Moderation of
<hi>Tiberius;</hi> telling him, <hi>That after he had
ſeveral times heard him complain of thoſe
that had prevented his Clemency, he could
not believe ſo juſt a Prince would ever confirm
ſo rigorous a Sentence.</hi> In ſhort, when <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi>
(who was then in the Country)
underſtood that <hi>Druſus</hi> was Executed, he
blam'd the Senate, tho' the Reprimand
were very gentle, and commended the
Prudence of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> tho' on the other
ſide, he did not rebuke <hi>Agrippa</hi> for his
ſeverity. Now it is certain, that if <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
had been repreiv'd, <hi>Tiberius</hi> would
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37902:35"/>
never have taken away his Life, <hi>Lepidus</hi>
ſo well underſtood to make him ſenſible
of Honour.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, the Preſident was quite
the contrary. For the <hi>Pretor, Antiſtius,</hi>
who had made a bloody Lampoon againſt
him, was ſav'd by <hi>Thraſea,</hi> who after he
had ſpoken of <hi>Nero,</hi> as it is Cuſtomary
to ſpeak of a good Prince, and had bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
enveigh'd againſt the Inſolence of
the <hi>Pretor,</hi> further added that the cruelty of
preceding Reigns was out of date; that
without putting the Criminal to thoſe
Torments which he deſerv'd, he might
be Puniſh'd in ſuch a manner, that he
ſhould have no reaſon to object againſt
his Judges; and laſtly, That his Life
would be a ſolemn Teſtimonial of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Clemency. This Advice was no leſs
prudent nor leſs reſpectful, then that of
<hi>Lepidus;</hi> but it was as ill receiv'd by
<hi>Nero,</hi> as the other was well receiv'd by
<hi>Tiberius. Thraſea</hi> incurr'd the Hatred of
<hi>Nero,</hi> and in a few years after loſt his
Life, for having ſav'd <hi>Antiſtius,</hi> whom
the Prince would fain have put to death.
<hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> reſembl'd each other
in Cruelty; <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Thraſea</hi> were
Competitors in Vertue, <hi>Priſcus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtius</hi>
equall'd each other in Arrogance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37902:35"/>
and Sawcineſs; for the one had the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to repeat his Elegy to a company of
Ladies, and the other to read his Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon
at a Public Feaſt. <hi>Thraſea</hi> pleaded
for <hi>Antiſtius,</hi> as <hi>Lepidus</hi> had done for
<hi>Priſcus;</hi> and yet that which made for <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi>'s
Honour, turn'd to the perdition
of <hi>Thraſea.</hi> And thus you ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
effects of that Fatality, which <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
attributes to that ſame natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which Princes have for ſome, and
that natural Antipathy which they have
for others. But if we more narrowly
pry into the real Character of <hi>Lepidus,</hi>
and <hi>Thraſea</hi>'s <hi>Genius,</hi> we ſhall eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that tho' they were both highly
Prudent, and equally averſe to Flattery,
yet there was a Remarkable difference
between 'em; for aſſur'dly, <hi>Lepidus</hi> was the
more prudent of the two. <hi>Lepidus</hi> was
Feaſible and Complaiſant, yet without
any thing of low-ſpirited Meanneſs, or
abject Condeſcention: <hi>Thraſea</hi> prided
himſelf altogether in his Stedfaſtneſs and
Conſtancy. <hi>Lepidus</hi> ſhap'd himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Times he was born in,
and the Humour of the Reigning Prince,
as it is the duty of every good Subject ſo
to do. <hi>Thraſea</hi> was a little too obſtinate
and hardy in what he thought Juſt and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37902:36"/>
Reaſonable, which occaſion'd that ſaying
of <hi>Nero,</hi> That he wiſh'd <hi>Thraſea</hi> lov'd
but him, as well as he did Juſtice. The
latter was the better Man, the other the
better Subject. By which Parallel it is
apparent, that Prudence has a great ſhare
in the Conduct of Human Affairs, and
that the Favour and Averſion of Princes,
are not always the Effects of their
Fancies.</p>

               <p>SOme things he had added more

               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt, Serenus</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
his Ingratitude, in terms more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
then the nice and tender Ears of a
Prince could endure.</p>
               <p>The Ears of Princes are not accuſtom'd
to the rude touches of Inſolence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation.
When we ſpeak to Princes,
(ſaid one of the Ancients) we muſt make
choice of words either all Silken, or all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37902:36"/>
Honey; that is to ſay, our Language
muſt be temper'd with Modeſty, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Submiſſion. The Contumacy
of Inferiours, cauſes the Superiours to
lay aſide his Clemency. Let a Subject
have never ſo juſt reaſon to complain, he
is not however allow'd to do it Arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for Submiſſion and Reſpect are claims
and rights never to be alienated from
Majeſty: There remains to the Subject
nothing but the honour of Obedience.
He that upbraids him with his Services,
deſtroys the Fortune and Grandeur of a
Prince; and generally ſuch Reproaches
are the fore-runners of Rebellion. And
therefore upon this Foundation it was,
that the Accuſation was grounded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
againſt <hi>Serenus</hi> by his Son, that he
had Conſpir'd againſt <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and ſent
Incendiaries into <hi>Gallia,</hi> to kindle a War
in that Province. Laſtly, It better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Subject to be a Flatterer, then
to be too laviſh of his Tongue, when he
ſpeaks to his Prince: But if he can avoid
it, 'tis better for him to be neither the
one, nor the other.</p>

               <p>'Tis no great Difficulty, <hi>ſays D'Ablan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>
for great Perſonages to diſcover, when
the Praiſes which are given 'em proceed from
Flattery, and when from a real ſentiment of
Affection.</p>
               <p>Politic Princes are not eaſily to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by Flattery, for they conſult not
their Ears, but their Hearts, which are
ſufficiently Conſcious, whether or no
they merit thoſe Praiſes that are beſtow'd
upon 'em. They underſtand by what
their Flatterers ſay, the undiſclos'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of their Hearts; well knowing,
that when ſuch People make their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to their Perſons, 'tis their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes

deceives 'em, when ever they put it

delightful to their Ears, becauſe they
are apt to believe they Merit what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

And afterwards he adds, That

               <p>THE Fathers decreed the Books

Publiſh'd afterwards. Which gives
us an occaſion to deride the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

that which both <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſeem

which makes me laugh at their Impertinency,
who think by vertue of a ſoon Expiring Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

               <p>Flattery and Hiſtory could never well
agree together, for the one is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to Falſhood, the other to Truth.
The one deludes, the other informs and

<hi>Rome</hi> there remain'd alive no other then
ſuch as ſacrific'd all to Favour. For here
the Senate gave the Appellation of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides
and Robbers to two Men, whom
Hiſtory had celebrated for Illuſtrious
and Famous Perſonages. So that <hi>Cordus</hi>'s
only Crime was this, That he had ſpoken
like a faithful Hiſtorian, and that he was
adjudg'd capable, to Write with the
ſame Liberty, the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37902:39"/>
after the death of <hi>Druſus,</hi> began to grow
worſe and worſe; and to diſplay the
Actions of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> who ſo inſolently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd

delude themſelves, when they think
their Reputation ſhelter'd by the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Books, that diſcover their Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.
For to burn Books, is but to
kindle in others a Curioſity to read 'em,
whereas the taking little or no notice at
all of 'em, renders 'em leſs priz'd by thoſe

Itch in others, to be prying into a ſubject
little regarded. 'Tis an eaſie thing for Men

Language with which his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation

receiv'd a Bloody Affront. For a certain
Officer in the Army, coming in as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt one <hi>Montanus,</hi> who had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
hainous Language againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
in a full Senate repeated the
Words as they were ſpoken, to add the

more the Senators ſhew'd their unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to underſtand him, as deteſting
his Impudence, the more obſtinate the
Officer was to make good his Accuſation.
So that conſidering <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s humour, a
Prince ſo politic and dextrous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
his Vices, and deſigning 'em into
Vertues, it was no wonder he ſhould be
more enrag'd againſt the Teſtimony, then

that which oblig'd him to proteſt with

               <p>Now when a Prince goes about to inſiſt
upon his Juſtification, eſpecially when the
Imputation from which he thinks to clear
himſelf is true, and known to all the

and Oblcquie moſt outragious, when
they believe themſelves moſt ſecure; that
is to ſay, when Men are venting their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts
among their Intimate and moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Acquaintance, where every one
diſcovers the very bottom of his Heart.
So that it is the moſt certain Mark of a
good Prince, when his Subjects diſcourſe
of him in their Private Houſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,
as he is cry'd up at Court.
And this it was which the younger <hi>Pliny</hi>
intended, when ſpeaking to <hi>Trajan. This
day,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it is, that we have just reaſon
to complain, that our ſecret diſcourſes are
not ſpy'd and obſerv'd but by Princes which
hate us: For if good Princes were ſo Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
as the bad, what a pleaſure would it be
to Thee, to hear what we diſcourſe of Thee
in our private Dwellings, to our Wives, our
Children, and our Servants? Then thou
would'st know the full extent of our Love
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37902:42"/>
and Admiration of thy Vertues, and how we
power forth our Prayers continually for thy
long and proſperous Reign. Then, tho' Love
and Hatred are perfect Contraries, thou
wouldſt underſtand, that in our Houſes there
is ſo far a kind of Reconciliation between
thoſe oppoſite Paſſions, that we adore and
reverence Vertuous Princes with the ſame
exceſs of Cordial Affection, as with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

he makes his Addreſſes; for otherwiſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37902:44"/>
he loſes his Aim, while contrary to his
Expectation, his Flattery becomes offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
<hi>Gallio</hi> thought he had highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> in decreeing a new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Soldiers of the Pretorian
Guards. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> was offended, that
he ſhould take upon him to meddle with
rewarding the Soldiers. <hi>What has</hi> Gallio
<hi>to do,</hi> ſaid he, in his Anſwer to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<hi>with the Priviledges of the Pretorian
Soldiers? who being under the Command of
none, but only the Emperour, ought not to
have their dependance but upon him alone? Does
he believe he has found out an Expedient
which</hi> Auguſtus <hi>never dream't of? Rather
may it not be thought that this ſame Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of</hi> Sejanus, <hi>ſought to bring an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into Military Diſcipline, on purpoſe to
prepare the Soldiers for Rebellion?</hi> Theſe
Expreſſions of <hi>Tiberius</hi> demonſtrate, that
he had reaſon to be offended with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
which perhaps a Prince leſs Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
then he, would have taken for an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
For had the Soldiers of the Guards
obtain'd this Priviledge to ſit equal with
the Roman Knights, they had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
for their Honour only to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
To which we may add, that ſuch

The Senate has decreed to <hi>Pallas</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments

of a Million, for his Fidelity and Zeal

then Judgment. More eſpecially this
Inſcription taught me a new Leſſon, what a
ſtrange Impertinency thoſe Men were guilty
of, who decreed Honour to d Scoundrel; and
what an unuſual Impudence poſſeſs'd that
Raſcally Fellow to accept the one, and refuſe
the other; and to transfer theſe refuſals to
Poſterity, for an Example of Modeſty. But
to what purpoſe doe I ſeem to be offended at
it? Were it not more proper for me to make
it the ſubject of my Deriſion, to the end they
may not think to have gain'd any great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who by their good Fortune, do but ſerve
to be the Sport and Contempt of other
Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In another Letter, after he has told ye,
that as Lofty as this Inſcription ſeems
to be, yet it appear'd both Modeſt and
Humble, in reſpect of the Decree which
he found among the Regiſters of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
he adds the following words.</hi> I
omit to tell ye, that the Pretorian Ornaments
were offer'd to a Slave, becauſe they were
Slaves themſelves that offer'd 'em: And that
it was Decreed, not only to beſeech him,
but alſo to force him to wear the Rings of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37902:57"/>
Gold. For it was a Diſhonour to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of the Senate, for a Pretorian to wear
Rings of Steel. But this is nothing; that
which is moſt worthy Obſervation, is this,
That the Senate return'd Thanks to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
in the name of <hi>Pallas,</hi> for having
ſpoken ſo advantageouſly in his behalf, and
given leave to the Senate, to give him thoſe
Teſtimonials of their Reſpects and good Will
toward him. For what could be more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to the Senate, then to ſhew their
Gratitude to <hi>Pallas?</hi> The Senate knowing
how averſe <hi>Pallas</hi> was from ſuch Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
deſires, ordain that an Addreſs ſhould
be made to the Emperour, to beſeech him
that he would oblige <hi>Pallas</hi> to accept the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
Kindneſs. There could not be a more
Servile Condeſcention then this, that the

ſo far, as to bring him to vouchſafe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance

do but imagine you ſaw <hi>Pallas</hi> oppoſing the

refuſing a Million, which was given him as

Intreaties, or rather Commands of a Bond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
man Enfranchis'd, in the preſence of the
Senate. Then take a view of the Senate,
who recite in their Decree, that among other
Honours decreed to <hi>Pallas,</hi> they thought it
material to add this Donative, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the Services he had done the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and that they did not deſiſt from their
Importunities to <hi>Pallas,</hi> that he would be
pleas'd to accept their Donative, but only in
Obedience to the Emperour, whoſe Will and
Pleaſure it was not lawful for them to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
in any reſpect. The concluſion will be,
that it requir'd no leſs then all the Modeſty
of <hi>Pallas,</hi> and all the Complaiſance of the
Senate, to excuſe <hi>Pallas</hi> from accepting a
whole Million of the Public Treaſure. To
which the Senate would never have conſented,
but that they thought it contrary to their
Duty to diſobey the Emperour. Now do you
believe that this is all? No, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worſe behind. It was Ordain'd that
this Decree ſhould be Engrav'd in Braſs, and
ſet up next the Armed Statue of <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi>
'Twas not enough for the Senate to be
the Teſtimony of ſo great a piece of Infamy,
they made choice of a moſt remarkable Place,
where it was to be read by the Living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
tranſmitted to Poſterity. It was their care,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37902:58"/>
that all the Honours offer'd to an Inſolent

he had refus'd, and what he had accepted.
His Pretorian Ornaments were Inſcrib'd upon

the Antiquity of his Deſcent, and the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of his Anceſtors, Enumerating at length
their Conſulſhips and their Triumphs.
Thence he proceeded to applaud his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and told the People how that the Empire
had ſuffer'd no Dammage during all his
Reign. All which was heard attentively
without the leaſt Murmur; but when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

they could not forbear Laughing.</p>

Ridiculous. Many People Flatter, but

<hi>Seneca,</hi> who as great and piercing a Wit

of the Harangue which he had

made for his Pupil, till he found it to be

For as it is then the time that Flattery
ſets all her Springs at work, to make her

likewiſe then that he acquires a ſolid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,

of Adulation. And therefore it was, that
the Senate were ſo profuſe of their
Praiſes to <hi>Nero,</hi> to pre-ingage him by

For there is a ſort of Adulation
allowable and wholeſome, which infuſes
into Princes and great Perſonages a love
of Vertue, wherein conſiſts their chiefeſt

               <p>IN this ſame Conſternation, the
Flattery of the Centurions and
Tribunes firſt erected his drooping
hopes, crowding to kiſs his Hands,
and congratulate his Eſcape from
the unſuſpected and horrid Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances

               <p>

Flattery is a Contagion that ſpreads it
ſelf from Man to Man. When ever any
one has led the way, all the reſt are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
at ſtrife who ſhall out do him. <hi>Nero</hi>
had but juſt embru'd his Hands in a moſt
inhuman Parricide, and the People ſtood
gazing one upon another with Fear and
Aſtoniſhment. <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf was almoſt
at his Wits end. But no ſooner had
the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Officers kiſs'd his Hands,
and aſſur'd him of their Fidelity, but the
Courtiers, a ſort of People always ready
to unmask, were not aſham'd to kneel
before the Gods; nor the Neighbouring
Cities to offer Sacrifices for joy of ſuch a
perpetrated Crime, which cry'd aloud
for Vengeance on the Deteſtable Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.
Horrid Thankſgivings, more
Impious then the Parricide it ſelf. But
the Senate acted higher yet, and worſe:
They decreed Public Interceſſions for the
Welfare of the Prince, and put the day
of his Mothers Nativity among the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Days; and that upon which her
pretended Conſpiracy was diſcover'd,
among the moſt Solemn Feſtivals of the
Year. So true it is, that never greater
Honours are decreed to Princes, then
when they are extreamly hated. For
Diſſimulation is more ingenious then

him to go on, and fear nothing; for
that they ſhould find the Affections of the
People redoubl'd by the death of <hi>Agrippina,</hi>
whoſe very memory they Execrated; and
therefore that he ſhould go Couragiouſly to
reap the fruit of his Renown and Glory.</p>
               <p>Tho' Princes are made believe that
they have an abſolute Liberty to do what
er'e they pleaſe, yet are they touch'd
with an inward Remorce, when they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do or have committed any Act which
is in it ſelf unlawful. After <hi>Nero</hi> had
caus'd his Mother to be murder'd, he
durſt not ſhew his Face, he wander'd
from City to City, thinking to diſſipate
thoſe Fears and Jealouſies with which the
apparition of his Crime that haunted
him where er'e he went, continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
his mind. But his Flatterers,
accuſtom'd to extoll the moſt hainous
miſcarriages of great Perſonages, ſoon
Cur'd him of his Shame and his Fear;
perſuading him that all the People of <hi>Rome</hi>
rejoyc'd at <hi>Agrippina</hi>'s death, and thought
themſelves beholding to him for having
rid her out of the way, tho' every Body
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37902:64"/>

of Injuſtice, that had been committed in
<hi>Claudius</hi>'s Reign. He whom ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
from Exile, and advanc'd to be Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to her Son, where he had rammaſs'd
together above ſeven Millions of Gold in

how better to diſcourſe of <hi>Benefits</hi> and

that the Senate and the People paid him

promis'd; and that the City had ſet up
Scaffolds to behold him make his Entry,
as if he had led all the Barbarian Kings

Parricide was lookt upon as a noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit;
and that by conſequence, there
was not any thing which he might not

here it was, that <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>
both Men of great Prudence and
Policy, were much deceiv'd, while they
thought, that their condeſcenſion to any
ſingle Ridiculous Pleaſure of their Pupil,
would in a ſhort time make him weary

time one while in playing the Charioteer
in an enclos'd piece of Ground, where
no body had liberty to enter; he would
needs have Spectators afterwards, whoſe
Applauſes did but ſerve to encourage
him in the continuance of that Exerciſe,
which his Governours were in hopes

after he had been a Charioteer, and had

They aſſail <hi>Seneca</hi> with
various Accuſations. They objected
his aſſuming to himſelf alone the
Pre-eminence in Eloquence, and his
making Verſes more frequently, ſince
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37902:67"/>
                  <hi>Nero</hi> had addicted himſelf to the
ſtudy of Poetry: That he openly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
againſt the Prince's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
That he contemned his Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the management of Horſes;
and derided his Voice when he ſang.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>(ſays</hi> D'Ablancourt) was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
enclin'd to follow the worſt Counſels.
Thereupon it was laid to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Charge,
That he aſcrib'd to himſelf the Glory of being
the only Eloquent Perſon in the City; and
had made Verſes more frequently, ſince <hi>Nero</hi>
began to eſteem Poetry. That he forbore not
in public to find fault with his Divertiſements,
and to laugh at his Activities in driving Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots;
and derided his Excellency in Muſic.</p>
               <p>When once a Prince begins to lend his
Ears to Flatterers, Calumny forthwith
makes open War with Men of Vertue.
They that accus'd <hi>Seneca,</hi> were certain of
over-ruling <hi>Nero,</hi> to his Deſtruction:
For that <hi>Burrhus</hi> and He were always
averſe to his Pleaſures. For the Court
is always full of certain People, who
make it all their buſineſs to ſound the
Diſguſts and Diſcontentments of Princes,
&amp; incenſe 'em againſt them who are both
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37902:68"/>
the Object &amp; the Cauſe of them. And thus
it was, that <hi>Sejanus</hi> exaſperated <hi>Tiberius</hi>
againſt <hi>Aſinius Gallus,</hi> and that <hi>Coſſuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Capito</hi> and <hi>Eprius Marcellus</hi> perſwaded
<hi>Nero</hi> to rid himſelf of <hi>Thraſea.</hi> As to
what the Courtiers laid to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s
Charge, that he aſcrib'd to himſelf the
ſole Glory of ſurpaſſing all others in Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that was only an Artifice, by
which they render'd him ſo much the
more odious to <hi>Nero,</hi> in regard that he,
continually making uſe of him for the
compoſing thoſe Orations and Speeches
which he had to make to the Senate,
ſhould thereby take notice, that <hi>Seneca</hi>
made Merchandize of this Eloquence;
while 'twas the general ſaying, that
whatever he ſpoke or did, either Handſom
and Noble, ſtill <hi>Seneca</hi> reap'd all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of it, as being the firſt Compoſer.
However, that <hi>Nero</hi> was paſt a Child,
and by conſequence needed no more Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the Examples of his Anceſtors being
ſufficient to inſtruct and adviſe him in the
management of his Government. By the
way obſerve, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſeems obliquely
to reprove the Vanity, or rather Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory
of <hi>Senca,</hi> in ſaying, That he caus'd
<hi>Nero</hi> to pronounce ſeveral Popular Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,
to ſhew the good Education
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37902:68"/>
which he had given his Pupil, or elſe in
Oſtentation of his own Wit. So true it
is, that the wiſeſt of Men are ſubject to

               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt; Tigellinus</hi> grew

render himſelf yet more conſiderable, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to plunge <hi>Nero</hi> deeper &amp; deeper in Vice,
as being the only Craft of which he was the
abſolute Maſter. Seeing therefore that the
Perſons whom the Prince moſt fear'd, were
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37902:69"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Rubellius,</hi> he endeavour'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Exile ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rubellius Plautus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Sylla,</hi>
were Perſons ſuſpected and dreaded by
<hi>Nero</hi>- The firſt, becauſe he was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> by the Mothers ſide,
and in the ſame degree next of Kin to
<hi>Nero;</hi> beſides that, he was vaſtly Rich.
The ſecond, for that having eſpous'd
<hi>Antonia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to <hi>Octavia, Nero</hi>'s Wife, he ſeem'd
to have ſome Right, or at leaſt ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
to the Empire. For which reaſon
he had procur'd their Exilement, the
one being Baniſh'd into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the
other into <hi>Gallia.</hi> But <hi>Nero</hi> (as it is the
cuſtome of bad Princes to be prone to
Fears and Jealouſies) had ſtill the ſame
ſuſpitions of theſe two Men, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the diſtance of their Conſinement:
Wherefore <hi>Tigellinus,</hi> who was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the innate Cruelty of his Maſter,
and underſtanding from whence his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
aroſe, infuſes into his mind, That
two Perſons of ſuch Illuſtrious Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had the ready opportunity to revenge
themſelves in their Exile, where they
were at hand to debauch both the Eaſtern
and German Armies. That <hi>Nero</hi> might
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37902:69"/>
ſecure himſelf from the Contrivances of
his Enemies at <hi>Rome,</hi> where his preſence
was ſufficient to curb the growing Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of Mutiny and Diſorder, but that
it would be a difficult thing for him to
put a ſtop to Deſigns well laid in diſtant
Provinces. That the <hi>Gaules</hi> already caſt
their Eyes upon <hi>Sylla,</hi> as a Noble Branch
of the Dictators Family; and that the
hopes of <hi>Aſia</hi> were no leſs in the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
of <hi>Druſus.</hi> That <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Poverty
was a ſufficient incitement to puſh him
forward in the proſecution of bold and
daring Attempts, and that he only affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a counterfeit Supidity, till he met
with an opportunity to ſhew his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
On the other ſide, that <hi>Plautus</hi>
was a Perſon of prodigious Wealth, and
ſo far from ſeemiog to love Repoſe and
Quiet, that he took a pride in imitating
the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and in practiſing the
Maxims of the Stoicks, a Sect that teaches
Men to be arrogant, turbulent, and daring.
Theſe are the dangers that attend Great
Perſonages: The Flatterers tell the
Prince, that the exceſſive Wealth of a
Subject, is fatal to Domination; that
they are too High for the Condition of a
Private Perſon, and over-ſhadow the
Grandeur of a Prince. And therefore it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37902:70"/>
was, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a Propoſal that was made him,
only to beg and have ſuch a Government as
he ſhould himſelf deſire, <hi>That he had Wealth
and Eſtate ſufficient, to preſerve himſelf by his
good Services and Loyalty; that if he had
more, it would but render him juſtly ſuſpected
to the King, who could have no other reaſon
to Ruine him, but only becauſe he was too
Great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they are Poor, then they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Prince as Malecontents, who
ſtudy all opportunities to meliorate their
Fortunes at the Expence of the Public
Tranquillity; that if they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
their Miſery will hurry 'em to
Deſpair; and their Deſpair to Revolt;
and that therefore there is a neceſſity to
haſt'n their Deſtruction. If they are
Perſons of mean Parts or little Courage,
thoſe Feebleneſſes are interpreted to be
refin'd Policy and Diſſimulation. But if
they are Perſons of Courage and Merit,
then they are branded for Dangerous
Perſons, that will ſoon be their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's
Maſters, if once admitted to the
Helm of State. Or if excluded, that
they will meditate Revenge, unleſs cropt
in the budd of their Reſentment. <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
tells us, That <hi>Plautus</hi> led a retir'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37902:70"/>
Life, went mean and plain, and kept his
Family in good order: But the more he
conceal'd himſelf in privacy from the

               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancorut;</hi> Some advis'd him to
leave the beſt part of his Eſtate to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,

That after he had liv'd ſo long in Honour, he
would not fully the end of his Life with a
ſervile Act—Nor would <hi>Petronius</hi>
Flatter in his Will, either <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi>

They who never committed any dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Act in their life-time, are careful
to preſerve their Reputation to the laſt
gaſp. Nor can there be a ſmarter incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to die like a Man of Honour, then to
have always been ſo. Therefore <hi>Cocceius
Nerva,</hi> the beſt Friend <hi>Tiberius</hi> had, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Emperor grew more vicious
every day then other, while his Health &amp;
Eſtate were yet in a good condition, and
his Reputation unblemiſh'd, choſe to die.
And <hi>Thraſea,</hi> whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls the Patern
of true Honour, made anſwer to thoſe
who advis'd him to delay his Death,
That he had nothing more to do but to
die as he had liv'd; that is to ſay, untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
unpolluted, and imitating the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Exit</hi> of thoſe whom he had emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>TRuth was ſeveral ways ecclips'd
and interrupted; firſt through
ignorance of Public Affairs, now
mannag'd by a few; then by the
contagious luſt of Adulation, or elſe
by the general hatred of thoſe that
were in Power. So that what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thoſe that were Diſguſted,
and thoſe that were Obnoxious, there
was no care taken of Poſterity.
But 'tis eaſie for thee to diſcry and
ward off the Flatteries of a Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
tho' Detraction and Envy are
heard with willing Ears. For there
is a kind of reſemblance between the
foul Crime of Servility and Adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but in Malignity, there ſeems
to be ſome ſimilitude of Liberty.
We cannot deny our Preferment
begun by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> augmented by
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> and farther advanc'd by
<hi>Domitian;</hi> but they that pretend
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37902:77"/>
to an inviolate Fidelity, muſt never
be ſway'd by the Affections either of
Love or Hatred.</p>
               <p>Truth, <hi>Says D'Ablancourt,</hi> was clouded
and obſcur'd through ignorance of Public
Affairs, wherein few were concern'd; and
ſophiſticated either by Flattery or Hatred.
The Hiſtorians took no care of Poſterity,
minding only their Revenge or their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But tho' Flattery and Obloquie both
equally diſguiſe the Truth, it is more eaſie
for a Man to ſecure himſelf from the one
which is odious to all the World, then from
the other, which deceives us under the falſe
ſhew of Liberty. 'Tis true, I owe the firſt
riſe of my Fortune to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and the
progreſs of my Advancement to his Children.
But when a Man once goes about to write a
Hiſtory, he muſt forget Favours as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.
Wherein <hi>D'Ablancourt</hi> miſtakes the
words of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who ſays no ſuch thing,
but only that no Hiſtorian ſhould ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be byaſs'd, either by his Love or by
his Hatred.</p>
               <p>Were it abſolutely neceſſary for a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian
to underſtand not only the Events
of things, but alſo the Reaſon and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37902:77"/>
Cauſes which produc'd thoſe Events; it
would be impoſſible for any Man to be a
good Hiſtorian, that never had any ſhare
in the mannagement of Public Affairs.
For the Succeſs and Events of things are
known to all the World, but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
the Intereſts, the Accidents, the
Springs, that enliven'd, mov'd, and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
thoſe Affairs, and were the Cauſes
of their proſperous accompliſhments or
miſcarriage, are only known to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
and Artificers themſelves. And
for that Reaſon it is, that Hiſtorians of
Republics have more advantage to write
the Truth of things, then the Subjects
of Soveraign Monarchs: Where the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
lies lockt up in the Breaſt or Cabinet
of the Prince, ſo that they may be well
call'd ſtrangers to the Government.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which diſguiſes and
disfigures Hiſtory is Flattery, which in
Republics is but little practiz'd, where
Servility is incompatible with Equality:
But is of abſolute uſe in Monarchies,
where it is hard to attain to Honours and
Imployments, or long to enjoy 'em, but
by gaining the favour of the Ruling So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
by the cuſtomary and uſual ways
of Aſſentation and Obſequiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:37902:78"/>
The third Rock that Shipwracs Truth,
is Hatred; which takes place of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
after the Deceaſe of the Prince.
So long as <hi>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius,</hi>
and <hi>Nero</hi> Reign'd, ſays <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Fear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
and ecclips'd the Truth, but ſo
ſoon as they were Dead, Hatred pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
with aggravations, what Fears
ſuppreſs'd before. Whence we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that the Hiſtories of bad Princes,
are never faithfully Written, neither
when they are Alive, as being dreaded
then; nor after their Deceaſe, when Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
takes her full ſwinge to diſgrace
their Memories. When Princes are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
men are willing to believe whatever
is reported of 'em, tho' never ſo hainous
and horrid; nay, many things too,
which are altogether impoſſible. And
for this Reaſon it is, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> deſires
of thoſe that ſhall read his Works, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to prefer vulgar Reports and Tales
Incredible, tho' greedily ſwallow'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
plain and downright Truths, not
yet corrupted into miracle. There are
ſome Hiſtorians that ſeem to have no
other deſign, then to abuſe Poſterity,
tranſmitting to future Ages, Things not
to be believ'd. And ſome Perſons there
are, ſo unjuſt and empty in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37902:78"/>
that no Hiſtories will pleaſe their
Appetite, but ſuch as are ſtuff'd with
Scandals and Abſurdities. And this
proneneſs of the one to Credulity, and
of the other to Falſhood it is, which is the
occaſion that all Affairs of Importance
are communicated to our underſtandings,
quite otherwiſe then as they were really
tranſacted. Add to this, that many
times they who have been the mannagers
of theſe Affairs, and encourage the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Story, having ſometimes
acted by the ſway of bad Principles, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Writer with Memorials, ſo far
from diſcovering the real Truth, that
they rather ſtifle it in thoſe politic Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities,
from whence it is impoſſible
to Diſinvelop it. Whence it comes to
paſs, that the Hiſtorians themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt deceiv'd, the Reputation of
their Fidelity ſerves only to delude o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Moreover the ſeverity of Hiſtory
is ſuch, as not to ſuffer that her Authors
ſhould diſcover the leaſt reſentment of
Injuries or Favours; She would be ſhown
to the World without Hatred or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
without Fear or Hope; without
refin'd Subtlety or Affectation; not to
Criticiſe, but to Inſtruct; nor to kindle
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37902:79"/>
any hatred againſt the men themſelves,
but a deteſtation of their Vices.</p>

thence it is, that Princes being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd

at a Nonplus how to pleaſe their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,

Thou perhaps wilt retain thy

requir'd. To be Begotten or
Deſcend from Princes is meerly Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious,
nor is valu'd any farther.
<hi>Nero</hi> will be alſo always wiſh'd for
by the worſt of Men; however it muſt

But this is not a time to inſiſt
longer upon Admonitions. The
moſt profitable and the ſhorteſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in the regulation of thy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is to conſider what thou wouldſt
require, and what not, from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prince. For thou art now to
Govern a People that will not brook
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37902:80"/>
an Abſolute Servitude, add will be
as impatient of Abſolute Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt,</hi> Proſperity has more
powerful Incentives then Adverſity, for we
give way to the one and reſiſt the other.
<hi>(Which words are more obſcure then the</hi>
Text <hi>it ſelf.)</hi> Tho' thy Inclinations prompt thee
to preſerve thy Vertue, they that have acceſs
to thee, will have loſt their own. <hi>(Which
is quite contrary to the ſenſe of</hi> Tacitus.)
There is nothing ſo eaſie as Complaiſance,
and therefore all Men are ready to make uſe
of it. But there are few Perſons that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
Princes what they ought to do, becauſe it
is a Task of too great difficulty. <hi>(Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is the ſenſe of</hi> Tacitus <hi>again miſtaken.)</hi>
'Tis by Fortune that Men are born Sovereign
Princes. <hi>(Here again</hi> Tacitus <hi>expreſſes
himſelf more at large.)</hi> Only, Do thou
learn that the ſhorteſt way to Govern well, is
to conſider what is to be Approv'd, and what
Condemn'd in other Princes; to avoid the
one, and follow the example of the other.
<hi>(Which latter words are ſuperfluous.)</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were more Noble, nor more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Admonitions given to Princes, to guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves
from the contagion of Flattery.
Here they are warn'd, that Proſperity runs
'em headlong into more Impieties then Adver-
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:37902:81"/>
for that it uſually plunges 'em into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Luxury, and all that <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls
the <hi>Licence</hi> of Regality. Which was the
Reaſon of that Saying of <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelf,
That the more Puiſſant he was, the more in
danger he was of Falling; and that he could
not have his Authority, without Diminiſhing
the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus what</hi> Galba <hi>ſays to</hi> Piſo, <hi>that the
obſequious Reſpect which all men would
pay to his Perſon would corrupt his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
is a wholeſom Admonition which he
gives to all Princes, not to confide in the
conſtancy of their own Reſolutions, nor
in their natural inclination to Juſtice, in
regard that if they bow their Ears to
their Flatterers, Adulation by vertue of
her alluring Blandiſhments, will glide at
length through the Ears into the Heart,
and tear from thence all Shame, all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
Docility, Gratitude, Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and all other Vertues whatever that
harbours there.</hi> Mezeray <hi>gives us a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Example of this, in the Perſon
of</hi> Henry <hi>III.</hi> His Reign, <hi>ſaith he in his
Life,</hi> might be call'd the Reign of Favorites
<hi>(and conſequently of Flatterers)</hi> they
brought to perfection their Deſign, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Enervated whatever he had of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37902:81"/>
Reſolution, and at length diſſolv'd him
into all Voluptuouſneſs. And that they might
poſſeſs him wholly to themſelves, they perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him not to ſhew himſelf ſo frequently and
ſo publicly to his Subjects as his Predeceſſors
had done, but to keep himſelf reſerv'd and
cloſe like the Eaſtern Monarchs; or if he did
at any time appear among 'em, that it ſhould
be with all the dazling Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
imaginable, or elſe to let 'em know him
by the Abſoluteneſs of his Commands; but
above all, to break the Neck of that Cuſtom
among the <hi>French</hi> of making Remonſtrances,
and to make 'em underſtand that there was no
other Juſtice but his Will. <hi>(For according
to the Dictates of Flattery, 'tis but a
precarious Reign, and an Acquieſcence in
ſingle Authority, which extends it ſelf no
farther, then only Things permitted.)</hi>
With theſe Flatteries they rais'd him to a high
Opinion of himſelf, and fill'd him with a
Conceit, that he was the Greateſt Prince in
the World: That all the Politics of his very
Youth, were Maſter pieces; and that all the
Prudence of the moſt Cunning Artiſts in that
Profeſſion, was but meer Ignorance in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of his.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any Prince whatever, to
whom at leaſt ſome of their Flatterers do
not ſay as much: A ſufficient demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37902:82"/>
that they ſpeak not to the Perſon,
but the Fortune of the Prince, which is
the ſole object of their Adorations. As
for the advantage of being born a Prince,
<hi>Galba</hi> tells <hi>Piſo</hi> 'twas only an accident of
Fortune, to let him underſtand, that it
was not an Honour to be ſo highly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
in by Princes, as being that which
they receiv'd from another, and was no
Honour to 'em farther, then they gave it
luſtre by the brightneſs of their own
Vertue. They that told <hi>Nero</hi> he needed
no other Rule whereby to govern himſelf
then the Examples of his Anceſtors,
while they Flatter'd him with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Birth, did but give him an
oblique hint, that having <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for
his Great Grand-father, and <hi>Germanicus</hi>
for his Grand-father, it beſt became him
to derive his Glory from the Imitation
of thoſe two Perſons: For it is not No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Extraction that makes a Prince.
<hi>Caligula, Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> were all
Illustrious by Deſcent, but Scandals to
the Empire and the Family of the <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
Neither is it the vaſt extent of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that makes an Emperour; but on the
contrary 'tis rather a Burthen, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerves to diſplay the Weakneſs of the
Prince, and by conſequence to render
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:37902:82"/>
him Contemptible, when he is found to
be incapable of Government. Witneſs
<hi>Galba,</hi> who when he came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
through his want of Parts, loſt all
the Reputation which he had acquir'd,
while he was only Governour of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
whom all Men would have judg'd
moſt fit for the Imperial Dignity, unleſs
he had Reign'd.</p>
               <p>A Prince therefore is never to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
a Great Prince, unleſs the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Merit be equal to thoſe of his
Fortune. Hiſtorians, ſays <hi>Matchiavel,</hi>
gave greater Applauſes to <hi>Hiero</hi> of <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi>
while he was but as yet a private
Perſon, then to <hi>Perſeus,</hi> when he was
King of <hi>Macedon;</hi> for that <hi>Hiero</hi> wanted
nothing but a Kingdom to be a Prince,
whereas the other had nothing in him of
a King, but his Kingdom. An Argument,
that Poſterity conſiders neither Royal
Birth, nor Royalty it ſelf, as not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
its Eſteem, but how the Prince ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
his Affairs, and carry'd himſelf in
ſo high and difficult an Employment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And in this ſenſe it was, that <hi>Tiberius</hi>
pray'd the Gods to grant him a quiet
Mind to the end of his Life, and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Underſtanding of the Law of
God and Man, that after his Deceaſe, his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37902:83"/>
Name and his Actions might be Honour'd
with the remembrance and approbation
of all his Subjects. Obſerve by the way,
that in the ſame place he tells the Senate,
how highly Honour'd ſhould he deem
himſelf, if Poſterity do him but that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to acknowledge him for a Prince
worthy his Anceſtors, Vigilant, Reſolute
in Dangers, and Zealous for the Public
Welfare, fearleſs of Envy or Hatred.
To inform thoſe who are Born Princes,
that it ought to be their chiefeſt Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſhew themſelves worthy of their
Illuſtrious Extraction, in performing glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Actions, deſerving the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of all ſucceeding Ages. And this
was that which <hi>Octavius</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
when his Mother and his Father
in Law diſſuading him, to acknowledge
himſelf Heir to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> he rejected
their Counſel, affirming, 'twould be a
ſhame for him to think himſelf above a
Fortune that <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought him worthy
of: To whoſe Opinion he would rather
ſtand then theirs, who underſtood not
his Worth. But to return to <hi>Galba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nero,</hi> ſaid he, will be always lamented
and wiſh'd for by the Wicked; but it
muſt be our Duty ſo to behave our ſelves
that good Men too, may have no reaſon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37902:83"/>
to lament his loſs; <hi>which certainly they
will do, if we prove no better then He.</hi>
This is an Admonition ſo much the more
neceſſary for Princes, in regard that Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
by applauding their Actions
whether good or bad, and by infuſing a
Conceit into their minds, that they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
all their Predeceſſors, make 'em
ſometimes worſe then they, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
are become moſt odious. 'Tis a
burdenſom thing to ſucceed a Vertuous
Prince, ſays <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Panegyric,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it is a difficult labour to gain that
Affection which he had done. Which
was the Reaſon that the younger <hi>Pliny</hi>
told <hi>Trajan,</hi> that no Body would covet
to Succeed him, becauſe no Body could
preſume to equal him. But it is no leſs
dangerous to ſucceed a bad Prince; for
inſtead of this happy Effect, that the
vertue of a Predeceſſor ſhould ſerve to
enflame the Emulation of him that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
it happens that while he fears to
be deſpis'd or hated upon the neglect of
his Duty, the Vices of the Predeceſſor
ſeem to authoriſe, or at leaſt excuſe the
the miſcarriages of the ſucceeding Prince.
Whence it happens that the latter, not
having any recent Example of moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to upbraid his Liberties, and check
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37902:84"/>
his Irregularities, he throws of his Mask,
and abandons himſelf to all manner of
Luxury and Impiety, inſomuch that his
Predeceſſor, though he had been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
is many times recall'd again in
wiſhes for a good Prince. Thus the loſs
of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was bewail'd in the Reign of
<hi>Caligula, Caligula</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi>
and <hi>Nero</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Domitius:</hi> So
true it is, that wickedneſs finds out new
Rivals every day, eſpecially among bad
Princes, that ſuffer themſelves to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by their Flatterers; that bad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
can never ſtop their career, when
once they have begun; but that when once
they are ſtray'd out of the high Road, they
never ſtop till they precipitate themſelves

to gain the Eſteem and Love of the
People over which thou art to Rule, call
to thy remembrance whatever has been
applauded or condemn'd in the Princes
that have Reign'd in thy time, and then
do thou of thy own accord, as formerly</hi>
Mecaenas <hi>advis'd</hi> Auguſtus, <hi>ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the conduct of thy Rule, as thou
wouldſt expect another Prince ſhould do,
wert thou a Subject to the ſame Perſon.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37902:84"/>
The Younger</hi> Pliny <hi>commends</hi> Trajan <hi>for
his obſervance of this Precept.</hi> Long haſt
thou liv'd among us <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> and ventur'd
with us through the ſame danger, and thereby
thou giv'ſt us an apparent demonſtration, that
thou art not forgetful of the Wiſhes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
which thou weret wont to make among
us, for in thy Sovereignty doſt thou fulfil,
whatever thou didſt once deſire ſo ardently,
when a private Subject; only with this
difference, that thou art more benign and
clement toward us, then thou didſt then deſire
the Prince ſhould be moderate toward thy Self.
And thence, whereas before we wiſht for no
other happineſs, then to have a Prince but
ſomewhat better then the worſt of all that ever
we had <hi>(ſpeaking of</hi> Domitian) we are now,
by thy means, become ſo nice and difficult,
that we cannot endure any other then the Beſt
of Emperors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in ſeveral other parts of the ſame
Panegyric,</hi> Thou mak'ſt the choice of thy
Friends, among the moſt Vertuous; and
truly it is but juſt, that they ſhould be belov'd
hy a good, who have been hated by a wicked
Prince. Thou know'ſt the difference between
Domination &amp; Supreme Rule, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that they who are now moſt acceptable to
the Prince, have the greateſt Antipathy to a
Tyrannical Maſter. Thou know'ſt, that there
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37902:85"/>
can be no Power ſo great conferr'd on any
ſingle Perſon, but that Liberty ſtill is more
deſirable then Maſterleſs Superiority. And
yet ſo far art thou from triumphing over our
Patience, that thy Triumphs are only o'er
the pride of wicked Princes. Thou liv'ſt
among us like a Father with his Children.
'Tis lawfull to approach thy preſence, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company,
and ſpeak to thee. Nor is it thy
Pride that puts a concluſion to the Diſcourſe,
but a modeſt ſhame and fear of being too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate.
Thou Govern'ſt us, and we Obey,
but yet no othewiſe then we Obey the Laws.
Thou haſt barr'd up the paſſage to thy Ears
againſt greedy Sycophants, who excited thy
Predeceſſors to nothing but Rapine and Violence.
And now there being no ſuch Prince that will
afford a ready Ear to pernicious Counſels,
there are none that now will undertake to give
it. Inſomuch that being highly oblig'd to
Thee, for the Integrity of thy Manners, we
are yet more engag'd to thy Vertues, for the
amendment of our own, which the Servility of
former Times had ſo horribly perverted.
<hi>So powerful is the Example of a Vertuous
Prince, whether out of that veneration
which all Men pay him, or the deſire which
we have to pleaſe him in our Imitation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>PIſo</hi>'s Oration was modeſt and
civil; nor did he want the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the <hi>Father</hi>'s; many out of
pure good will and affection; more
vehemently they that leaſt deſired it;
the Middle ſort, and the Moderate
party were the moſt, all meditating
private Intereſt, while obviouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious
without Care of the Public.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt; Piſo</hi>'s Oration was
very modest, and receiv'd with applauſe by
the Flattery of ſome, and the Affection of
others. They who had the least deſire, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
the most, and every one ſuffer'd himſelf
to be buſy'd by his particular Interest, without
any Care of the Republic.</p>
               <p>A new Prince always occaſions the
growth of new Intereſts, new Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and new Sycophants. And Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
was the more exceſſive toward <hi>Piſo,</hi>
while every one believ'd that Sycophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
could not chooſe but be acceptable to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37902:86"/>
a Perſon who had always been the Mark
of Adverſe Fortune. For there is nothing
ſo lulling to the Sences, as to be Flatter'd,
Careſs'd and Honour'd, after a Man has
been a long time Unfortunate. And for
that reaſon it was that <hi>Galba,</hi> putting
him in mind of his former condition, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>thou hast only experimented
the Cruelties of Fortune; now ſhe begins to
look upon thee with a favourable Eye: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be ſure to ſtand upon thy Guard, for it is
more eaſie constantly to undergo Adverſity, as
thou hast done, then to reſist Allurements of
Proſperity, ſo ingenious in depraving our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.
'Tis not to be question'd but that
thou art a Perſon of great Vertue, but if once
thou giv'st admiſion to Flattery, ſhe will ſoon
impair thy Vertue.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like
were <hi>Galba</hi>'s Expreſſions (ſays <hi>Tacitus)</hi> to
<hi>Piſo,</hi> as to a Private Perſon, whom he
was about to make an Abſolute Prince,
but all the reſt he ſpoke as to a Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Enthron'd. To let us underſtand that
<hi>Galba</hi> ſpoke to the Perſon of the Prince,
whereas Sycophants make their Addreſſes
only to his Fortune: That the firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd
him, as a Father and a Prince;
but that others Flatter'd him, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that already was their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
That Subjects are only capable of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37902:86"/>
Flattery, becauſe they only ſeek to pleaſe;
whereas the Prince who makes his Choice
of a Succeſſor, beſpeaks him cordially and
ſincerely, and gives him no other then
only the beſt of Counſel.</p>

               <p>THE moſt Favour'd of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiz'd
Slaves, and other
Servants, laid before him the Pomp
of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court, his Luxury, his
Adulteries, his Divorces, and ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous
Wedlocks, and all thoſe
other Pleaſures of Imperial Reign,
all which he thirſt'd after, and which
if he had the Courage, were his

would be another's.</p>
               <p>His principal Domestics, <hi>(ſays</hi> D'Ablan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court)
ceas'd not to lay before him the Luxury

               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:37902:87"/>
Thus we ſee the gay Allurements that
Sycophants make uſe of to provoke the
Appetites of Princes, and incenſe 'em to
Luxury. This is that which they call,
<hi>Releaſing Kings from the Subjection of Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi>
but indeed (ſays <hi>Mezeray) Is the
putting them beſide their Sences and their
Reaſon. Otho</hi> had ſpent his Youth in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,
and had inſinuated himſelf into
<hi>Nero</hi>'s Favour and Confidence, by the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Voluptuouſneſs and Vices.
<hi>Piſo,</hi> on the other ſide, had always liv'd
a ſober Life, and without Scandal, but
the ſeverity of his Manners, which pleas'd
<hi>Galba,</hi> diſpleas'd the old Court, which
<hi>Nero</hi> had accuſtom'd to honour a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
Prince, no leſs then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they were wont to reverence a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and Moderate Sovereign. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was that <hi>Otho,</hi> who was of the
ſame temper with <hi>Nero,</hi> and as ſuch a one,
deſir'd by all the Courtiers, was ſo highly
encourag'd by his Domeſtics, and his
Friends, to take Poſſeſſion of the Empire.
For the looſer and more extravagant ſort
of Courtiers are afraid of nothing more
then a Vertuous and Vigilant Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Intereſt is incompatible with
his Duty. <hi>The young King</hi> (ſays <hi>Meze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi>
ſpeaking of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII.) <hi>was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37902:87"/>
enclin'd to the study of Vertue, addicting
himſelf, as much as his leiſure would permit
him, to the reading of good Authors, and to
converſe with learned Men. But the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
to whoſe humour, a ſerious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Prince is a burthenſom Master, before
the Year was out, plung'd him again into the
love of Toys and Women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find moreover two or three things
more to be obſerv'd upon the Choice
which <hi>Galba</hi> made of <hi>Piſo</hi> to ſucceed him,
rather then <hi>Otho,</hi> who being the firſt who
had declar'd himſelf for <hi>Galba,</hi> was in
hopes to have been adopted for his Son.
The firſt is, that <hi>Galba</hi> rather choſe to
expoſe himſelf to <hi>Otho</hi>'s Reſentment, to
whom he was ſo highly oblig'd, then to
advance to the Empire a Perſon, who
was guilty of all <hi>Nero</hi>'s Vices; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that would be of little benefit to the
Publick-weal to have eſcap'd <hi>Nero</hi>'s Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
ſhould it relapſe under the
power of his Companion in Debauchery.
The ſecond thing is, that Vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
make it their chiefeſt Glory to chooſe
a good Succeſſor; whereas a bad Prince
en deavours to find a worſe then himſelf,
to the end he may be miſs'd, when gone.
<hi>Augustus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Galba</hi> to <hi>Piſo) made Choice
of a Succeſſor out of his own Family, but I
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37902:88"/>
chooſe mine out of the Commonwealth: Not
that I am destitute either of Kindred or
Friends, but becauſe of all my own and thine,
thou ſeem'st to me most worthy to be the Heir
of my Fortune. My Age permits me not to
do the</hi> Roman <hi>People any other kindneſs, but
only to leave them a Vertuous Succeſſor. But
thou who art in the flower of thy Youth, hast
it within thy power to bleſs 'em with a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Prince and long Tranquility.</hi> The
Younger <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that <hi>Nerva</hi> was
belov'd and lamented by all good Men,
for that he had made ſuch Proviſion, that
no body ſhould have cauſe to miſs him,
and being a moſt worthy Prince himſelf,
he was not afraid to make Choice of one
that might exceed him. And in another
Place he ſays, That a good Succeſſor is a
moſt evident Mark of the Divinity of the
Prince that makes the Election.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing is, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Advice which Princes give to
their Succeſſors, and that which Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
give to Princes. When a Prince
admoniſhes another, 'tis his uſual cuſtom
to tell him, that Sovereignty is a weighty
Burthen, and a Condition above all others
moſt ſubject to the Capriccio's of Fortune:
That the Higher a man is exalted, the
more in danger he ſtands of the Precipice:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37902:88"/>
That Power is never truly ſecure, when
exceſſive, and rarely longer permanent
then the Life of him that exerciſes it:
That there is nothing in the World ſo
unſtable, or ſo difficult to preſerve, as
the Fame of Power that reſts not on its
proper foundation, of Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
That it is impoſſible for a Prince to
know or act all things himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had need of good Counſel and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
That his Miniſters and He, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
unanimouſly together, the Public
Affairs will be better manag'd: That he
ought not to ſtudy Dominion over Slaves,
but equal Government over Children and
Subjects accuſtom'd to rational and not
to blind Obedience: That Loyal Subjects
never grudge to pay Taxes or Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but ill brook the Violence, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and Avarice of the Officers: That a
Government cannot long ſubſiſt between
unjuſt Command and forc'd Obedience.
I do not Intereſt my ſelf, ſaid <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in
in the Choice of Edils, Pretors or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls;
ſomething greater and more ſublime
is expected from a Prince; nor do I make
uſe of Power, where I can act by Law.
Then he goes on, that Liberality, when
exceſſive, proves pernicious, as forcing to
repair by Injuſtice, what Extravagancy
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37902:89"/>
has diſſipated; That Clemency advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Reputation of Princes; and that
having all things at their Command,
there remains nothing for them to deſire
more, then only to Eternize their Happy
Memories. Theſe are the Temples, thoſe
the Noble Statues, ſaid <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that I
deſire to be erected in your minds; for
as for thoſe that are built of Stone, ſhould
I deſerve the hatred of ſucceeding Ages,
they would be ſcorn'd, and ſoon defac'd.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, Sycophants infuſe
into the ears of Princes, that they have
not only an Abſolute Power, but a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Underſtanding, and that their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
can pretend to nothing but only the
Honour of a blind Obedience: That the
Will and Pleaſure of a Prince, is the Rule
of Juſtice, and by conſequence, that all
the Actions of Kings are Infallibly Juſt:
That a Prince who Governs according to
Laws, is only a Precarious Prince; and
that he who liſtens to the Advice of his
Counſel, is a Pupil: That all ways and
means whatever which conduce to the
preſervation of Authority, are honeſt and
lawful, provided they be ſucceſsful:
That the Impov'riſhing of the People,
and keeping the Nobility Low, are the
main Pillars of Imperial Power. That
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:37902:89"/>
Privileges, Exemptions and Moderate
Taxes ſerve only to render the People
untractable and mutinous; whereas they
are ſupple, ſubmiſs and yielding, when
they have nothing to loſe: That Luxury,
Adulteries, Revelling and choice of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
are the Rewards of Principality:
That it is of little importance to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
but of great moment to be fear'd;
for that Fear is ſupported by the dread
of Puniſhment, which never ceaſes; but
that Love is preſerv'd only by a certain
tie of Complaiſance, which Men as often
break, as fancy and humour inſpire 'em:
That Clemency is a dangerous Vertue,
and Modeſty fitting only for a Citizens
Wife. And laſtly, That Princes never
need take any care what Poſterity ſays of
'em, as being no competent Judge of the
Truth or Falſhood of thoſe that applaud
or diſcommend, ſince 'tis the Fate of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,
to be always ſuſpected either of
Flattery or Malice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Otho</hi> was Proclaim'd Emperor, and
<hi>Galba</hi> now no longer in Poſſeſſion of the
Sovereignty; nevertheleſs there were
ſome People that Flatter'd the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Prince, as if after he had loſt the
Empire, he had ſomething of higher Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to loſe. An evident proof, that
Sycophants never can find in their hearts
to ſpeak ſincerely to Princes; and that
Princes are Flatter'd, becauſe 'tis the
Mode, without the leaſt anxiety for their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37902:90"/>
good or ill ſucceſs. Sycophants never tell
'em any thing but what is grateful, tho'
it be ne'er ſo prejudicial. They who
ſooth'd up <hi>Galba</hi> at ſuch a Conjuncture,
when the preſervation of the Imperial
Dignity, and his Life lay at ſtake, were
ſo much the more to blame, in regard
they knew that <hi>Galba</hi> was always deſirous
that the Truth ſhould be told him, as one
that deteſted Flattery; and that his Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then depended upon true Intelligence
of the imminent danger. But in ſhort,
it is the Fate of Princes to be deluded,
even to the laſt minute of their Lives.
<hi>Mezeray</hi> tells us, That after the <hi>French</hi>
had loſt the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> between
<hi>Padua</hi> and <hi>Milaine</hi> the moſt prudent
Captains (and particularly <hi>Lewis de la

the Firſt ſhould raiſe his Siege, laying
before him, <hi>That his Army was wasted a

<hi>from them; and that the Enemies
Army, for want of Pay, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Disband within fifteen days at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest.
But thoſe Reaſons were not of force
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:37902:91"/>
ſufficient to alter his Reſolutions. The Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantries
of his Favourites, over-rul'd the

would have thought himſelf diſhonour'd
to have made a Parallel between his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,

                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt,</hi> 'Tis neither Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>There are very few Princes that are
belov'd, or indeed that can eſcape Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and Bruitiſh Hate: But they are all
Flatter'd without exception. For that
Flattery never makes its Addreſſes to the
Perſon, generally the Objects of it will,
but to their Fortune which is always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd;
<hi>Galba</hi> was deſpis'd becauſe of his
Old Age, and hated for his Severity, and
his Covetouſneſs: Nevertheleſs, both
People and Grandees could not forbear to
Flatter him, while they demanded <hi>Otho</hi>'s
Life, and the Baniſhment of all his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices,
ſo long as they thought the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37902:93"/>
Conſpiracy would be cruſh'd before it got
to a head. And when the Report was
ſpread abroad that <hi>Otho</hi> was kill'd, they
not only expreſs'd their Joy by public
Acclamations and Congratulations, but
a great number of the Knights and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
who thought <hi>Otho</hi> dead, crouded to
the Palace to Congratulate him, bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their hard Fortune, that had reſcu'd
<hi>Otho</hi> from their Revenge. An evident
Example to teach us how little truſt or
heed there is to be given to the fair words
or ſervices of Sycophants, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
thoſe Princes are that put their
Confidence on ſuch weak and failing Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
They were therefore in the Right,
who to encourage <hi>Flavius Salinus</hi> to take
up Arms for his Brother <hi>Veſpatian</hi> againſt
<hi>Vitellius,</hi> told him, that the People, who
ſeem'd to love <hi>Vitellius,</hi> would change
both their Opinions and their Notes, ſo
ſoon as he ſhould declare himſelf; and
that all the Flatteries, and Acclamations,
which the Multitude hollow'd forth to
<hi>Vitellius,</hi> would as loudly fill the Fire and
Honour of <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> ſo ſoon as they
found the ſtrength of his Party.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37902:94"/>
I ſhall add no more then one ſingle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
of <hi>Particulars,</hi> which is, That
Flattery is for the moſt part attended
by Treachery. For in regard that Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants

Perſon of the Prince, they ſoon exchange
their <hi>Perſon,</hi> when the <hi>Perſon</hi> exchanges

againſt <hi>Galba,</hi> meerly to reconcile
themſelves to <hi>Otho,</hi> whoſe Life they had
demanded but ſome few Hours before,
for a Sacrifice to their fury. So that <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
might well ſay, that whoever had
beheld thoſe Hurries, would never have
believ'd but that they had been another
Gang of People, and quite another Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
Which brings to my remembrance
what a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator ſaid to <hi>Plancus,</hi>

true it is, that all ſorts of Friends never

of other Mens, without either
Moderation or Judgment: And thus
they interpreted for Vertues, moſt
Egregious Vices, in greedy hopes to
Command their Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt;</hi> His readineſs to
give away both his own and the Eſtates of

look'd upon as Liberality and Genoroſity, tho'
they that cenſur'd more ſeverely, call'd it
his Weakneſs and Prodigality. But the eager
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37902:96"/>
deſire of Dominion, made 'em diſguiſe his
Vices under Vertuous Appellations.</p>
               <p>Sycophants extol the Vices of Great
Men, becauſe it is their Intereſt to foment
and cheriſh 'em. So that if Princes had
not their Vices, at what a loſs would
Flatterers be, who have only that Sally-Port
open to creep into their Favour, and
only that ſame ignominious means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what they have once attain'd?
The Younger <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, that Princes
have no need of Maſters to inſtruct 'em
to be wicked; yet let 'em be ne'er ſo bad,
yet they learn many things which elſe
they never would have thought of, had
not Sycophants been their Tutors. Nor
is there any Vice to which a Prince may
be prone, which they more ſeduliouſly
labour to foſter and cheriſh, then his Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury
and his Prodigality, in regard they
are Perſons that get the largeſt ſhare of
his Profuſions. <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> was

<hi>and to go to the Parliament, by his Preſence
to force their Confirmation. And this was
one of the chief Cauſes of the ruine of that
Prince, by his loſing inſenſibly that Reſpect and
Affection which the People had for him: Nor
did the Heads of the LEAGVE fail to
make their advantage of it, by augmenting
their Contempt and Averſion to his Perſon.
To which the Inſolency of his Favourites did

that as Fortune, the Gods and <hi>Otho</hi>'s

ſo would they alſo aſſiſt his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes:
A piece of Flattery which

               <p>Otho <hi>(ſays D'Ablancourt)</hi> was willing
to give Battel, ſeconded by his Brother, and
the chief of the Pretoriun Countiers, who
ſpunr'd him on for want of Experience, and

               <p>There is no ſort of Flattery ſo bad,

raſh and over-haſty execution of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
where there can be no miſcarriage
twice committed. In the moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Affairs of Private Perſons, there is
always ſome hope, or ſomething of laſt
remedy, to which he may have recourſe;
ſo that a Man with the abſolute ruine of

the Affairs of Princes, eſpecially ſuch as
are advanc'd of a ſudden from a Private
Condition to Abſolute Dominion, and
whoſe unſtable Fortune is ſtill upon the

and depend upon ſo many Circumſtances,
that the ſmalleſt Error is enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge
the whole Frame of their Deſigns

Advice in the Perſon of <hi>Francis</hi>
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> III. of
<hi>France,</hi> who loſt <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> by

without Honour or Fidelity, among the reſt</hi>
Quinſay <hi>his Secretary,</hi> Fervaques, <hi>and</hi>

ſuch other Effeminate Qualities, more proper
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37902:99"/>
for the Affection of a Young Lady, then a
Great Prince, had rais'd to the higheſt degree
of his Maſter's Favour. Theſe People keeping
him ſtill at defiance with the Duke of</hi> Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſier,
<hi>and other Men of Honour, ſpurr'd
him on continually to make himſelf Maſter of
thoſe Towns and Places of which he promis'd
them the Government.</hi> For the Counſels
of Sycophants are always byaſs'd. And
for that reaſon it is that all Princes, who
lay the Foundations of great Deſigns,
ought ſeriouſly to deliberate, whether
their intended Enterpriſes will turn to
their Honour, and the Benefit of the
Public; whether the Execution will be
eaſie; or at leaſt, whether it be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their Strength and their Induſtry;
and, whether they that advize 'em, have
Courage and Fidelity enough to venture
equal Dangers with 'em and for 'em: For
many times they happen to Engage
themſelves in a War, of which they know
not how to make an Honourable end
when they have begun it: In regard that
if they repent, their coming fairly off
is in the power of another. Beſides that,
their own Authority leſſens, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of their Generals encreaſes.
Therefore <hi>Tiberius</hi> rather choſe to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
his Differences by Treaty, then by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37902:99"/>
Arms; and always conceal'd his Loſſes
upon the Frontiers of the Empire, becauſe
he would not be oblig'd to give the
Command of his Armies to Perſons that
might find him work at home. <hi>There is
not the ſame equality of Proſperity and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
(ſaid <hi>Mucienus</hi> to <hi>Veſpatian) between
Thee and Me: For if we Vanquiſh, I ſhall
enjoy no more Honour, then what thou wilt
be willing to confer upon me. But if we fail
in our Enterprize, we ſhall ſhare alike in our
Misfortune.</hi> All Generals ſpeak the ſame
words; but when once they become
Victors, they change their Language,
and many times their pretenſions are too
exceſſive, that their Victory would prove
a Burthen to the Prince and State, ſhould
they be gratify'd to the utmoſt of their
demands. For, according to the ſaying
of <hi>M. de la Rochefoucauld, 'Tis a difficult
thing for a Man to contain himſelf within
the limits of Moderation, after the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of great Services, which inſpire ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Thoughts of Rule and Dominion into
thoſe that never think their Merits rewarded
to the full. Then as to the point of giving
Battel</hi> (ſays <hi>Comines) whoever he be, it is
expedient for him to conſider, before he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
his Kingdom upon a Battel; for the
loſs of a ſmall number of Men, diſmays the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37902:100"/>
Courages of all the reſt beyond belief; and
inſtead of terrifying the Enemy, begets a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Loſer.</hi> And ſome few lines after,
<hi>Let it be how it will, a Battel lost, draws
a large Train behind it, to the prejudice of
whoever is vanquiſh'd.</hi> And in another
place (ſpeaking of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI.) <hi>The King,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>whatever could be ſaid or argu'd to
the contrary, was reſolv'd he would not Fight,
as being reſolv'd not to venture the Fortune of
a Battel.</hi> And in my Opinion, he took
the moſt prudent courſe. To conclude,
I ſhall only add one ſingle Reflexion more,
and more remarkable then the former,
out of the ſame <hi>Comines,</hi> upon another
uſual piece of Adulation which Flatterers
daily inſinuate into the ears of Princes,
that they ſhould rely upon their own good
Fortune, and deſpiſe their Enemies. <hi>A
notable Example,</hi> ſays he, (ſpeaking of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
IV. King of <hi>England,</hi> who was driven
out of his Kingdom in fifteen days,) <hi>for
Princes to take notice of, who pretend to be
always fearleſs of their Enemies, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
and ſcorn an Armed Foe. 'Tis true,
the chiefeſt part of their Courtiers, uphold
'em in their vain Conceits, to pleaſe their
Humours: And they think they are to be
eſteem'd and valu'd for it; and that People
will applaud 'em for their couragious advice.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37902:100"/>
But the wiſer ſort look upon thoſe Rodomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadoes
as meer Folly; ſince it is a vertue to
fear with Prudence, and provide againſt it.</hi>
'Tis a great Treaſure for a Prince to
have a Wiſe Man at his Elbow, provided
he believe him, and that he have <hi>permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

is more likely to Ruine himſelf, then he

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:37902:101"/>
and <hi>Proculus,</hi> That it was not the ſafeſt
courſe to give <hi>Vitellius</hi> Battel; alledging
that <hi>Vitellius</hi> had all the reaſon in the
world to be deſirous of Combat, and
<hi>Otho</hi> to ſpin out the time in delay; for
that the Enemy had all the Force he could
make, as not being out of hopes of any
Succour from <hi>Gallia,</hi> that began already
to totter; nor could they expect any
Recruits from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which would
be then expos'd to the Incurſions of the
<hi>Barbarians;</hi> that his ſupplies out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had the Seas to croſs, and an Enemy
to oppoſe 'em already; that <hi>Spain</hi> had
but few Soldiers. That <hi>Gallia Narbonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
was ſufficiently Infeſted by <hi>Otho</hi>'s Navy,
and had not yet forgot the misfortune of
their laſt Engagement: That the Army
of <hi>Vitellius</hi> lay enclos'd between the <hi>Po,</hi>
and the <hi>Alpes,</hi> without any hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
by Sea, and could not ſubſiſt long in
a Country harraſs'd as that had been, by
the continual March of ſo many Legions;
that if they could but ſpin out the War
till Summer, the very change of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
would bring Diſeaſes among the
<hi>Germans,</hi> who were the moſt hardy Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
among all the <hi>Vitellians;</hi> and that
many Armies who have driven all before
'em at firſt, had been forc'd to diſſipate
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37902:101"/>
for want of meeting an Enemy to fight
with. On the other ſide, that <hi>Otho</hi> had
plenty of all things; that <hi>Pannonia, Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
Dalmatia,</hi> and all the Eaſt were at
his Devotion, with numerous Succours;
and more then all this, that he had <hi>Rome</hi>
at his back, the Seat and Rudder of the
whole Empire; together with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Senate, whoſe Majeſty had
been always held in Veneration, tho' it
might be for a time Ecclips'd; that the
Immenſe Treaſures which he had in his
Poſſeſſion, would ſoon render him Maſter
of the whole; in regard that Money was
far more prevalent in a Civil War, then
the edge of the Sword; that the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were accuſtom'd to the heats of <hi>Italy:</hi>
That the River <hi>Po</hi> was a ſufficient ſtop to
impead the farther march of the Enemy,
upon which he had ſeveral Cities well
Fortifi'd and Garriſons, which as he
found already by the Reſiſtance that <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia</hi>
had made, would with no leſs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Fidelity oppoſe the Enemy:
That therefore his buſineſs was to ſpin
out the War, or at leaſt to ſtay for the
fourteenth Legion, ſo highly eſteem'd for
their Valour, together with the Forces
out of <hi>Moeſia,</hi> which were all expected
within a few days: That then <hi>Otho</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:37902:102"/>
might again deliberate what he had to
do, and if he thought it his wiſeſt courſe
then to give Battel, he might do it much
more to his Advantage, with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of that new Reinforcement.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons were ſo Convincing,
that neither <hi>Titianus</hi> nor <hi>Proculus</hi> had any
thing to reply. But in regard that <hi>Otho</hi>
was ſo extreamly deſirous of Battel, as
one that was impatient of Languiſhing ſo
long between Hope and Fear, both <hi>Titi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
and <hi>Proculus</hi> Flatter'd him to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
by telling him, that all things
would give way to his Fortune. A piece
of Sycophantiſm, that was one of the
principal Cauſes of his Ruine; whereas
if they had liſten'd to the wholeſome
Advice of <hi>Paulinus</hi> and his Collegues,
<hi>Otho</hi> might have been perſuaded to have
chang'd his Reſolution. But that which
is here moſt obſervable is this, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
(as it is the cuſtome of Favourites,
and Sycophants) had not only a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Antipathy againſt thoſe three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
to whom he was inferiour both in
Probity and Underſtanding, but made
it his buſineſs to Calumniate, the high
Reputation of <hi>Paulinus, Celſus</hi>'s vigour,
and the accompliſh'd Experience of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
ſo that being now miſtruſted
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37902:102"/>
and ſuſpected by their Soveraign, they
were only Nominal Generals, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
and chief perplexity it was,
to ſee their Prudence made a Cloak to
cover the Miſcarriages and Ignorance of
others. A misfortune that happens too
often in the Courts of Princes, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themſelves to be made a Prey to the
paſſions of their Favourites.</p>

               <p>THE Death of <hi>Otho</hi> being
known, the Senate preſently
decreed him all thoſe Honours that
had been ſtudy'd in the longeſt
Reigns of Preceding Princes. A
return of Thanks was alſo order'd
to the <hi>German</hi> Armies, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
were ſent likewiſe to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate
their Obſequious Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt,</hi> The Senate heap'd
upon the new Emperour all the Honours, which
others had obtain'd during a long Reign, and
order'd Thanks to the <hi>German</hi> Legions, with
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37902:103"/>
a Deputation to the Prince, to Congratulate
his coming to the Imperial Crown.</p>
               <p>Here are three Things to be obſerv'd.
Firſt, That upon the firſt intelligence of
<hi>Otho</hi>'s death, and that the Soldiers had
ſworn Allegiance to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
of the Governour of the City,
the People Crown'd with Flowers and
Lawrel Garlands, carry'd the Images of
<hi>Galba</hi> round the Temples as it were in
Proceſſion; and paſſing by the place
where he had ſpilt his Blood, they cover'd
it with a Pyramid of Garlands, as it
were to Erect him a Monument. Which
was done to blacken <hi>Otho</hi>'s Memory, who
had wreſted from him both the Empire
and his Life; and in Honour to <hi>Vitellius,</hi>
who ſeem'd to be the Avenger of his
Death.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Thing is, That when Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
were brought to <hi>Rome</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt</hi>
of the <hi>German</hi> Legions, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Vitellius</hi> to the Empire, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and People of <hi>Rome</hi> openly declar'd
the Calamity of the Commonwealth,
which was fallen into the hands of two,
the Vileſt and moſt Infamous Perſons in
the World. Shall we repair to the
Temples cry'd they, to offer up our
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:37902:103"/>
Prayers for <hi>Otho</hi> or <hi>Vitellius?</hi> Certainly,
moſt Impious and Deteſtable will be our
Devotions, either for the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe two Rivals, of which two
whoever proves the Victor, will be ſtill
the worſer Nevertheleſs the ſame Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and People that Curs'd <hi>Otho</hi> and
<hi>Vitellius,</hi> as two Subjects fatally elected
the Ruine of the Empire, now decreed
to <hi>Vitellius</hi> thoſe Honours which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
given to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf. So ſtrangely
do Sycophants and Flatterers differ from
themſelves, and ſo ſubject are they like
Bulruſhes, to bend with every wind of
the Court.</p>
               <p>A third Remark is this, That when
the two Armies that had Proclaim'd theſe
two Emperours, came to underſtand how
unfit they were to manage ſo high an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and conſequently began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of the bad Choice they had made ſo
much to their Diſhonour, preſently ſome
time before <hi>Otho</hi>'s death, they fell
to deliberate Conſiderations about a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
one among another, for the
Election of an Emperour to the general
Satisfaction, and to reſtore Peace and
Concord to the Empire. For the Senate
therefore to give the <hi>German</hi> Legions
thanks for the Choice which they had
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37902:104"/>
made of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> the Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Mankind, was one of the pooreſt
and meaneſt Condeſcenſions imaginable.
And thus you ſee there is nothing ſo vile
and abject, which Flattery will not ſtoop
to.</p>

               <p>BUT when the Army impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
him to honour with the
Dignity of Knighthood his Enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiz'd
Vaſſal <hi>Aſiaticus,</hi> he reprov'd
their Immodeſt Flattery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt;</hi> But upon the requeſt
of the Army, to make his Enfranchiz'd
Slave a Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> he put a ſtop to
their Flattery.</p>
               <p>'Tis one of the meaneſt and the loweſt
condeſcenſions of Flatterers, to ſeek to
ingratiate themſelves with the Prince,
by ſoliciting the Intereſts and Aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement
of ſuch as they know to be their
Favourites, tho' Perſons of never ſo baſe
an Extraction, without Merit or Honour.
In the Fifty fourth and Fifty fifth Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37902:104"/>
Heads, we have diſcours'd at large of
all the ſervile Flatteries, to which the
Senate ſtoop'd, while they labor'd to
heap up Honours upon the Enfranchiz'd
Vaſſal of <hi>Claudius. We Courted</hi> Satrius
<hi>and</hi> Pomponius (ſaid a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight to
<hi>Tiberius) and we held it for an ineſtimable
Honour to be accounted then Enfranchiz'd
Slaves and Porters to</hi> Sejanus. <hi>Mezeray</hi>
reports, <hi>That the Cardinal Chancellor</hi>
de Birague, <hi>had a greater eſteem for one
of his Lacquies that was his Favourite, then
for all the Laws of the Kingdom:</hi> For it was
his ſaying, <hi>That he was not the Kingdoms,
but the King's Chancellor.</hi> An Expreſſion
becoming an <hi>Italian</hi> Sycophant. As for
<hi>Vitellius,</hi> we are to obſerve, that after he
he had refus'd to grant this favour at the
requeſt of his whole Army, which was to
beſtow Gold Rings upon <hi>Aſiaticus,</hi> and
thereby to dignifie him with the Order of
<hi>Roman</hi> Knighthood, yet he conferr'd the
Honour upon him afterwards at a great
Banquet. So difficult a thing it is for
Luxurious Princes to withſtand the force
of Flattery, and to guard themſelves from
the inſinuating Artifices of certain ſmall
Officers that creep into their favour by
unwarrantable means, as <hi>Aſiaticus</hi> did.
Therefore it was the ſaying of the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37902:105"/>
                  <hi>Pliny,</hi> That a Prince who preferrs
mean and abject People, can be no great
Prince himſelf. And in another place he
thus addreſſes himſel to <hi>Trajan. Tho' thou
beſtow'ſt the marks of thy favour upon thy
Enfranchiz'd Vaſſals, yet they are no other
then ſuch as are only convenient for their
Quality. Thou form'ſt 'em ſo, and haſt ſuch
an eye over 'em, that they dare not preſume to
meaſure themſelves by thine, but by their own
Fortune.</hi>

               <p>BEing heard, they made uſe of
Juſtifications rather uſeful
then ſeemly: For they acknowledg'd
themſelves guilty of Treachery to
<hi>Otho,</hi> of their own accords; as if
they had deſign'd the long march of
the Army before the Battel, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the <hi>Othonians,</hi> and the Peſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Battalions with Carriages
on purpoſe, and attributed to their
own perfidiouſneſs ſeveral fortuitous
Events, which only Chance produc'd.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37902:105"/>
Thereupon <hi>Vitellius</hi> ſeem'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Perfidie, and abſolv'd
'em from the Crime of forfeited Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to <hi>Otho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Paulinus <hi>and</hi> Proculus <hi>(ſays D'Ablan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court)</hi>
had Audience, and defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by Excuſes not ſo honeſt as neceſſary:
For they aſcrib'd to their own Cunning the
long march of the Army before the Battel,
and the encumbrances of the Baggage, with
ſeveral other accidents of Fortune, to make
out their Fidelity to <hi>Vitellius</hi> by a ſuppos'd
Betraying of <hi>Otho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold an Example of what I have in
other places alledg'd, that Flattery is
always byaſs'd by Intereſt. <hi>Paulinus</hi> and
<hi>Proculus</hi> rather choſe to be accounted
Traytors, then Perſons of Honour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Treaſon was a meritorious
act, and advautagious to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and by
conſequence ſecur'd 'em from his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Another Prince then <hi>Vitellius,</hi> who
had no ſentiments of Generoſity, would
have deſpis'd their Submiſſions. For if
Traytors are odious to themſelves, whoſe
Party they embrace, the ſuppos'd Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
that is to ſay, they who to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:37902:106"/>
themſelves with the new Prince,
falſly accuſe themſelves to have betray'd
his Rival, are no leſs Treacherous and
Criminal then others. And for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, That the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Proculus,</hi> were rather
ſuch as neceſſity requir'd, then honeſty.
For, for a Man to boaſt himſelf a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
to the Perſon to whom he had been
Faithful in his Life-time, was an open
acknowledgment, that he ne'er was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but for his own Intereſt; and that
he only ſtudy'd to enrich himſelf by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of Treachery. For that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it was, that the Conſul <hi>Marius Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
who never ſtirr'd from <hi>Galba</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
frankly confeſsd before <hi>Otho,</hi> that
he had always adheard to <hi>Galba</hi>'s Fortune;
and that if he liv'd longer, he would have
ſerv'd him with an inviolable Fidelity.
And that with the ſame integrity he ſtuck
to <hi>Otho</hi> againſt <hi>Vitellius,</hi> who nevertheleſs
continu'd him in his Conſulſhip, for which
another had offerr'd Money. So highly
is fidelity eſteem'd by them, that have
us'd all their endeavours themſelves to
vitiate it in another. And therefore <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
not only acquitted a perſon that
had the courage to acknowledge himſelf
one of <hi>Sejanus</hi>'s Friends, and caus'd his
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:37902:106"/>
Accuſers to be puniſh'dd with either Death
or Exilement. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had always a
high eſteem for <hi>Aſinius Pollio,</hi> tho' he
ne'er would attend him to the War of
<hi>Actium;</hi> in excuſe of which he gave him
ſuch a reaſon, as ever after afterwards
excus'd him to his favour. <hi>The good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>which I have done for</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,
<hi>are greater then the Benefits which I
have receiv'd from Him; but what he has
done for me, is better known to the World,
then what I did for him: And therefore I
leave him to determin your Differences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
declaring for the one or the other, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to be a prey to the Victor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Men of Courage always abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
whatever has the leaſt Tincture of

diſingag'd from all Obligations of

               <p>
                  <hi>Says D'Ablancourt;</hi> There were nothing
but Accuſations of the Rich, and Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Eſtates; Violences inſupportable to
the People, but excus'd through the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of the War. Nevertheleſs <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>
corupted by his good Fortune, and inſtructed

Equal but only for that (ſays <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus)</hi>
to the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Captains.
His Flatterers fomented and cheriſh'd this
ſame failing of his, which he had ſome
thoughts of reforming at the beginning
of his Reign, at which time he carry'd
himſelf with ſo much Moderation, that
it was ſaid of him, That he was the only
Private Perſon advanc'd to Sovereignty,
who ever chang'd for the Better. But
they that are always at the Elbows of
Princes, make it their ſtudy to corrupt
and enervate their vertuous Intentions
by the force of Pleaſure, which they ſtrive
no leſs to make habitual to 'em, that ſo
they may have neither leiſure, nor any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

Proclaim'd another Emperour. They
made him believe, and he himſelf had
divulg'd It among his Soldiers, that
there was no fear of a Civil War, and
yet at the ſame time there was one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
begun, while the Empire was ſhar'd

perceiv'd that <hi>Vitellius</hi> was Exaſperated,

out of a deprav'd Emulation hated <hi>Bleſus,</hi>
whoſe high Reputation was an Eyeſoar to a
perſon ſully'd with all manner of Infamy,
and engag'd him to undertake the Accuſation
of his Rival. <hi>L. Vitellius</hi> thereupon entring

the Emperour's Chamber, took his little Son in

<hi>Antonius</hi>'s, and who daily corrupted the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
of the Soldery, by his Trayterous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
and Careſſes. That all the World
lookt upon him as already Emperour, to the
contempt of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> who ſlighting equally
both his Friends and his Enemies, ſuffer'd
the Fortune of a Rival to grow great, who
rejoyc'd to behold in the midſt of a Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

the Bed of Sickneſs. And therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd
him to let him taſte the ſorrows of a

that was lame of one Hand, implor'd him
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:37902:116"/>
likewiſe but only to touch the part Affected

rejected both their Sollicitations at firſt with
Scorn and Laughter, till preſs'd by their

Phyſitians whither ſuch a thing were poſſible
to be done, waving between the Flatteries of

Ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Tacitus <hi>makes the Commentary upon

Commanded the Phyſitians to conſult among
themſelves, whether Humane Remedies could
ſurmount the Nature of thoſe two Infirmities.
The Phyſitians after they had argu'd the
Point, concluded, that the Blind Man not
having as yet quite loſt his viſual Faculty,
the ſight of his Eye not being utterly Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
away, his ſight might be reſtor'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Impediments were remov'd: And
that the other's Hand might be recover'd, ſo
that the Nerves that were ſhrunk, could be
mollifi'd and ſtretch'd out to ther natural
uſe: That the Gods perhaps made choice of
him to effect this great Miracle: Moreover,
that the Glory of the Cure would redound to
his Immortal Honour, whereas if it did not
ſucceed, all the Laughter and Deriſion of the
Cure in vain attempted, would fall upon the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:37902:116"/>
Credulity of thoſe unfortunate Perſons.
<hi>Veſpaſian</hi> therefore believing all things would
ſubmit to his Fortune, with a chearful Air
