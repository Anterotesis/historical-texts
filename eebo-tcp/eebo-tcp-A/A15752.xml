            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2 An oriental Dial looketh to the East, and the forenoone houres onely must bee set in this Dial, and therefore the substilar line sheweth six of the clocke in the morning; from which towards the South are the morning houres before sixe, <hi>viz.</hi> 5. 4. 3. &amp;c. but towards the North after six, 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. as in the 3 figure.</p>
            <p n="3">3 An occidental Dial looketh directly West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and onely the houres after noone can bee set into this dial. Therfore the substilar line sheweth the sixt houre after noone: from which toward the North are the houres before six in this order. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. but towards the South after six thus. 7. 8. 9. &amp;c. as in the 4. figure.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In Dials not Meridian, if a ruler laid to the center of the aequinoctial and the beginning of the diuision thereof doe crosse the touchline; then the houre line drawne by that crossing is the line of twelue a clocke. But if it cannot crosse the touch line, imagine notwithstanding, that crossing and the twelue a clocke line, drawne thereby without the bounds of your Dial, whereabouts you thinke it would bee, if the ruler and touch line were
<pb facs="tcp:11861:16"/>
continued foorth long inough.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Then in al Dials not meridian, imagine the stile to be fastned in his place, in aequinoctial Dials perpendicularly erected out of the Center. In Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als that be not Equinoctial, conceiue it to be placed exactly ouer the substilar line, so much raised from the same as the stilar line in your paper or pastbord, is distant from the substilar line.</p>
            <p n="6">6 After this, place your paper or pastebord (wheron the figure of your Dial is described) in the same site or position that the dial ground is, or must be placed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that the quarters of the world writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereupon, may answer in like position to the quarters of the world as they lie in respect of your dial ground: for then if the 12. a clocke line be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, from the stile it is the line of the 12. houre of the day. From hence therefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West are the forenoone houres, 11. 10. 9. 8. 7. &amp;c. and toward the East, the afternoone houres, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7 But if the 12. a clocke line bee Southward from the stile, it is the line of the twelfth houre in the night from thence: therefore on both sides are the night houres: toward the West, after midnight, 1. 2. 3. 4. &amp;c. towards the East before midnight, 11. 10. 9. 8. &amp;c.</p>

And let paralels to the substiar line be drawn by those prickes, for they shall bee the houre lines we seeke for, set into the dial ground.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The stile must be paralel to the substilar line, and must be placed directly ouer it, so much distant from the same, as the stilar line is distant from the substilar in the figure of your Dial drawne on the pastbord or paper.</p>

            <p n="7">7 The stile must bee fastned in the center, and must hang directly ouer the substilar, eleuated so much from the same, as the stilar line in the figure of your dial is distant from the substilar.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But in Dials that be not polars, wherein the eleuation of the stile from the substilar is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, let the substilar line bee described in the Dial ground so much distant from the Meridian, which you first described therein, as the substilar is dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the Meridian in the figure of your dial.

The stile must hang perpendicularly ouer the substilar line, so much distant from the same, and from the secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof with the lines of contingence, as the stile augmented in the figure of your Diall is distant from the substilar.</p>
