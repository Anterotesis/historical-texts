            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas an Actuall and open Rebellion is raiſed, and ſeverall Armies marching againſt Us, under the command and conduct of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of Eſſex, and other Perſons under his Commiſſions and authority, who falſly pretend that what they do is by Vertue of Our Authority, &amp; for Our Service, and ſo ſeduce many of Our weak Subjects from their Duty and Allegiance into this horrid and odious Rebellon againſt Us. We doe therefore once more declare the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of Eſſex, and all ſuch who by any Commiſſion under him, have levied or doe command any Souldiers to bee guilty of High Treaſon; and that this Rebellion is raiſed to take away Our Life from Us, to deſtroy Our Poſterity, to change the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by the Lawes of the Land, to ſuppreſſe the Law of the Kingdome, to take away the Liberty of the Subject, and to ſubject both to an unlimited arbitrary power. And We doe therefore Will and Command all Our loving Subjects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Allegiance, and their Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, that they apprehend the ſaid Earle of Eſſex, and all ſuch who, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any Commiſſion under him, have levied, or doe now command any Souldiers in any places of this Kingdome, as guilty of high Treaſon.</p>
            <p>And whereas We underſtand that, at this time, the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of Eſſex, and ſome other Commanders who have equall or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent authority from him, doe traiterouſly lay ſiege to, and intend to aſſault Our Towne of Redding, We, conſidering that the moſt part of thoſe Commanders and Souldiers are ſeduced by ſpecious pretexts above ſaid, have, out of Our Princely Grace and Clemency, thought fit, and doe hereby declare, That We are pleaſed to grant Our free and generall Pardon as well to all Captaines and inferiour Officers (not formerly excepted in any of Our Declarations or Proclamations) as to all common Souldiers now before Our Towne of Redding, or elſewhere, as to Perſons ſeduced by the cunning &amp; falſhood of the authors of the preſent Rebellion: If ſuch Captains, inferior Officers and ſouldiers ſhall disband within ſix dayes after the publiſhing of this Our Proclamation, ſo as they commit no hoſtile Act in the meane while. And We doe farther declare, That ſuch Officers as aforeſaid, ſhall returne to their due Obedience to Us, and render themſelves to the Lieutenant-Generall, or other principall Officer of Our Army, or to the Governour of that Our Towne of Redding, and be willing to ſerve Us, ſhall be entertained in Our Army, or if they be not willing to ſerve, ſhall have Our Pardon and free Paſſe, provided they take an Oath never to take up Armes againſt Us. And that ſuch common ſouldiers as ſhall lay downe their Armes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Our Proclamation, ſhall receive Our like Gracious Pardon, and be entertained in Our ſervice, if they ſhall be willing, or otherwiſe, taking the aforeſaid Oath, have five ſhillings in money given them, and a Paſſe to carry them to their dwellings. But in caſe this Our Gracious Mercy to them, produce not thoſe good effects We hope for, ſuch extremity of puniſhment they are to expect, as the highneſſe of ſo Treaſonablean Act in its owne nature deſerves.</p>
