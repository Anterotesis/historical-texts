         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am under a neceſſity of begging Excuſe for what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
becauſe it will come ſhort of the Title-Page,
which promiſes three Letters. The Truth is, the third
was in a manner ready; when ſo many freſh Inſtances
of the Barbarity uſed to the poor Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> came
to my hands: that I found my ſelf obliged either to defer any
account for ſome time; or elſe to publiſh theſe two Letters by
themſelves: But I muſt confeſs I was not long in taking my
choice. For I ſaw it ſo requiſite to ſay ſomething preſently:
that I reſolved out of hand to publiſh theſe my two firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The Enemy has been ſo industrious as to way-lay theſe
poor people: and whilſt they will not ſuffer them to live in
<hi>France,</hi> they endeavour to prevent their ſubſiſting any where
elſe. Amongſt ſome they are repreſented as Enemies to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
eſtabliſh'd; however, they profeſs the ſame Faith, and
deſire to be eſteemed as Brethren. Amongſt others they are
made to appear a mix'd multitude, part Proteſtant, part Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt:
whereas it is as impoſſible for any number of Papiſts, or
indeed almost any to thruſt themſelves in amongſt them undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
as it would be for a Black amongſt Whites. Their
Miniſters are ſuch as have had their Education amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:46344:3"/>
them, well known and approved, before admitted to that Office;
ſtrictly obſerved, and under a careful Diſcipline after admiſſion:
their people well acquainted and obſerved among themſelves, as
is uſual for ſuch as are under a perſecution, or the jealous eye
of their Superiors. Beſides greater care cannot be taken, than
is by the <hi>French</hi> Churches, to whom the recommendation of all
that come over is remitted, to ſee that their Attestations and
Teſtimonials are true and ſubſtantial: and I hope the Printed
Advertiſement has already given ſatisfaction in this point.
But that nothing may be wanting to augment the miſery of theſe
poor Fugitives, and render them at the ſame time worſe than
unprofitable to their Brethren: It is ſuggested to the common
people, that they come to take the Bread out of their Mouths,
by over-stocking thoſe populous Manufactures, which ſeem already
rather to be overcharged, and by ſurfeiting the Land with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Which Objection, if we conſider ſtrictly according to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
comes not up to any weight or conſideration. For many
of the Manufactures they bring over, are ſuch as we had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and by conſequence of the greatest and most unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
benefit to us. Others, tho not wholly new, yet bring ſo
great improvement to thoſe we had already of the ſame kind:
that they do in a manner create a new Manufacture. There are
likewiſe that give help to a full Trade that wanted hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſupply it. And now if any are ſo unfortunate, as to
bring over ſuch as we are more than fill'd with already: I
would beg, that as men we would conſider the common Laws of
Humanity, and let neceſſity take place of inconvenience, and
as Chriſtians, to have eſpecial regard to thoſe that are of the
Houſhold of Faith. Now that we ſhould be over-peopled, I
<pb facs="tcp:46344:3"/>
think there is no danger; when no conſidering man but will allow
that our Nation wants more than a million of people, and that
no Country is rich but in proportion to its numbers: for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
create ſcarcity, and that induſtry. But be the politick
conſideration what it will; never was there greater objects of
Chriſtian Charity and Compaſſion, than theſe poor people. 1.
If we look upon the privileges of mankind, we ſhall find them
here infringed to the ſcandal of our being. Men not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to renounce their thoughts, and ſay the contrary to what at
the ſame time they declare themſelves to believe; but having by
violence Holy Water cast upon them, and dragged at a Horſe-tail
to Maſs, they ſhall be pronounced Roman Catholicks, and
made to ſuffer as Relapſe, if they dare renounce what they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſented to. They are neither permitted to live at home,
nor to go abroad. The Holy and Religious Duty (as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
account it) of Confeſſion is proſtituted to Oppreſſion, and
polluted with the intermixture of ſecular Concerns. For the
Confeſſors now in <hi>France</hi> conjure their Penitents, upon pain of
Damnation not to conceal any Debt they owe to a Protestant,
and when revealed, immediately they attach it in the Debtors
Hands, under the ſame penalty. 2. If we conſider them as
they are Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> never had people greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
better ſettled, nor upon juſter grounds; of which the
first Letter will abundantly convince any reaſonable perſon.
And yet it will appear by the ſecond Letter, that no people were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reduced to a more miſerable Eſtate, and lived. But that which
ought to move an Engliſhman in all diverſities of his paſſion at
once is, not only that they are of our Communion, or that our
Kings are Garantees for the Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> but that we
<pb facs="tcp:46344:4"/>
are in a manner puniſhed in them. For a great inducement to
this inhumane Uſage, not only ſeems to be, but is really owned
by them, to be from the rage they have conceived againſt us for
preventing their bloody and helliſh Deſigns by the exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of ſome Popiſh Traytors. Nay, if they durſt for
ſhame ſpeak out, I am ſure they would tell us, That ſince they
could not execute their malice upon Engliſh Proteſtants, they are
reſolved to wreak their Revenge upon the <hi>French,</hi> and ſcourge
them for our ſakes.</p>

               <p>YOu are not at all miſtaken; I can now eaſily ſatisfie you in what
you deſire to know concerning the Proteſtants of <hi>France.</hi> One
that is a Friend to us both, who is lately come thence, hath
fully acquainted me with the condition they are in. I ſaw
him the day after his arrival, and found him ordering his Books,
and looſe Papers, which were juſt opened. After our firſt Salute, I ask'd
him what they were. They are, ſaid he, French Books; and thoſe Printed
Sheets, are the new Edicts, Declarations, and Acts which the King of
<hi>France</hi> hath lately publiſh'd againſt the Proteſtants of his Kingdom. I
am very happy, ſaid I, in lighting on you at the opening of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
I was extremely impatient of knowing, with ſome certainty, what
it was drove ſo many of them from their Native Country; and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46344:5"/>
by the care you have taken to collect all the pieces which concern
them, that I could not have met any one who might better ſatisfie my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.
They come hither in Troops almoſt every day, and the greateſt
part of them with no other Goods, but their Children. The King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his accuſtomed Goodneſs, hath had pity on them, ſo far as
to provide means whereby they may be able to gain their Lively-hood;
and amongſt other things, he hath ordered a general Collection for
them throughout the Kingdom. We were all reſolved to anſwer the
charitable Intentions of our Gracious Prince, and were beginning to
contribute freely. But to tell you the truth, we were extremely cooled
by certain Rumors. It is confeſs'd, that their King is very earneſt to make
them embrace his Religion: but they aſſure us, that he uſes none but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>reaſonable Means,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 17th. of <hi>June,</hi> 1681.</note> and that they who come hither with ſuch Outcries,
are a ſort of People not <hi>gifted with much patience,</hi> who eaſily forſake
their Native Country, being diſſatisfied, that their merit, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
is not ſufficiently rewarded. Beſides, they are repreſented to us
very much ſuſpected in the point of their Obedience and Loyalty. If we
may believe many here, they have been very factious and rebellious; ſuch
as in all times have ſtruck at the higher Powers both in Church and State;
which, you muſt needs ſee, would not be much for our purpoſe in theſe
preſent Conjunctures. In truth, this is intolerable, (cry'd our Friend)
I cannot endure that the Innocence of theſe poor people ſhould be run
down at this rate: I perceive Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> is not content to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
them in their own Country with the utmoſt cruelty, but trys all ways
to ſhut up the Bowels of their Brethren in foreign parts: he endeavours
to ruine, and to famiſh them every where; in <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>France:</hi>
A Hatred ſo cruel, and, if I may ſo ſay, murderous, agrees not ſo well
with the Goſpel of the Meek <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe Companion Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>
ſtyles himſelf. For, he came not to deſtroy men, but to ſave them.
Let this Jeſuite alone, ſaid I, and his Emiſſaries, I do not doubt but he
hath too much to do in all the Affairs of Proteſtants. But tell me inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly,
do they give juſt cauſe to them of <hi>France,</hi> to quit their Country
as they do, and are they perſons whom the State and the Church may truſt?
You your ſelf ſhall be Judge, ſaid he, and that you may be fully inform'd
of the Cauſe, I will give you a particular Account of the State of theſe
poor People. But before I ſpeak of the Evils they have ſuffered, it is fit
you ſhould know, what it is that they have right to hope for from their
King, and from their Countrymen; you will then be more affected with
the uſage they find.</p>
               <p>You cannot but have heard of the Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi> Here it is, ſaid he,
(taking up one of the Books that lay upon the Table.) It is a Law which
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth confirmed to eſtabliſh their Condition, and to ſecure
their Lives and Privileges, and that they might have liberty freely to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46344:5"/>
profeſs their Religion. It is called the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> becauſe it was
concluded of at <hi>Nantes</hi> whilſt the King was there. It contains 149 Articles,
93 general, and 56 particular. You may read it at your leiſure, if you
pleaſe: I will only obſerve ſome of them to you at preſent. Look, I
pray, (ſaid he) on the ſixth general, and the firſt particular Article.
Liberty of Conſcience, without let, or moleſtation is there moſt expreſly
promiſed, not only to them who made profeſſion of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
at the eſtabliſhment of the Edict,<note place="margin">Art. 1. Pa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</note> but, (which is principally to be
obſerved) to all thoſe who ſhould imbrace and profeſs it afterwards. For
the Article ſaith, that Liberty of Conſcience is granted for all thoſe who
are, or who <hi>ſhall</hi> be of the ſaid Religion, whether Natives or others.
The ſeventh general Article grants to all Proteſtants the right of having
<hi>Divine</hi> Service, Preaching, and full exerciſe of their Religion, in all their
Houſes who have <hi>Soveraign Juſtice:</hi> that is to ſay, who have the privilege
of appointing a Judge, who hath the power of judging in Capital Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
upon occaſion. There are a great many Noble Houſes in <hi>France</hi>
which have this privilege. That ſeventh Article allows all Proteſtants
who have ſuch Houſes, to have Divine Service and Preaching there, not
only for themſelves, their own Family and Tenants, but alſo for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who have a mind to go thither. The following Article allows even
the ſame Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion in Noble Houſes which
have not the right of Soveraign Juſtice, but which only hold in Fee-ſimple.
It is true, it doth not allow them to admit into their Aſſemblies
above thirty perſons beſides their own Family. The ninth Article
is of far greater importance: it allows the Proteſtants to have, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the exerciſe of their Religion in all thoſe places where it had been
publickly uſed in the years 1596, and 1597. The tenth Article goes
farther yet, and orders that that Exerciſe <hi>be eſtabliſhed</hi> in all places where
it ought to have been by the Edict of 1577, if it had not been; or to be
<hi>re-eſtabliſhed</hi> in all thoſe places if it had been taken away: and that Edict
of 1577, granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, declares, that the Exerciſe of
the Proteſtant Religion ſhould be continued in all places where it had
been in the Month of <hi>September</hi> that ſame year; and moreover, that
there ſhould be a place in each Bailywick, or other Corporation of the
like nature, where the Exerciſe of that Religion ſhould be eſtabliſhed,
tho it had never been there before. Theſe are thoſe places which ſince
have been called, with reference to the Exerciſe of Religion, <hi>The firſt
places of the Bailywick.</hi> It follows then from this tenth Article of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
of <hi>Nantes,</hi> that beſides the Cities and Towns in which the Exerciſe of
that Religion ought to be continued, becauſe they had it in the years
1596, and 1597, it ought to be over and above in all thoſe places where it
had been in the month of <hi>September</hi> in the year 1577, and in a convenient

The eleventh Article grants alſo this Exerciſe in each Bailywick, in
a ſecond place where it had not been either in the Month of <hi>September,</hi>
1577, or in the years 1596, or 1597. This is that which is called <hi>The
ſecond place of the Bailywick,</hi> in diſtinction to that other place of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is granted by virtue of the Edict of 1577. When <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth ſent Commiſſaries into the ſeveral Provinces to ſee his Edict put
in execution, there was ſcarce found any conſiderable City or Town
where the Commiſſaries did not acknowledge that the Exerciſe of the
Proteſtant Religion had no need to be confirm'd, or re-eſtabliſhed, becauſe
it had been uſed there in ſome one of the three years above-mentioned:
in ſo much, that there were whole Provinces which had no need of thoſe
two places, granted out of pure favour, I mean, the two places of each
Bailywick; all the Cities, and all the Towns of thoſe Provinces claiming
that Exerciſe by a better Title.<note place="margin">Ann. 1599, p. 285, <hi>and</hi> 286, Edit. Amſterdam, 1664.</note> This is it which made the Biſhop of <hi>Rodes,
(Monſieur Perifix</hi>) afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Life
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, to ſay, that that Prince by his Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> granted
to <hi>the Proteſtants Liberty of Preaching almoſt every where.</hi> But he granted
them farther, the means and full power of breeding up, and teaching
their Children. Read, as to that, the thirty ſeventh particular Article.
It declares, that they ſhall have publick Schools and Colleges in thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Places where they ought to have the publick Exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
The Edict having ſecured, as you ſee, the Exerciſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, ſecures alſo the condition of them who ſhould profeſs it,
to the end that they might, without any moleſtation, each one according
to his quality, follow thoſe Trades, Employments and Offices which are
the ordinary means of mens Livelyhood.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the thing of it ſelf ſpeaks this. For it is plain that they do
not grant in good earneſt the free Exerciſe of a Religion, who debar the
perſons that profeſs it the uſe of means neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence.
Nevertheleſs for their greater ſecurity, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth hath declared
to all <hi>Europe</hi> by his Edict, that he would not that there ſhould be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
as to that point, between his Proteſtant and his Papiſt Subjects.
The thirty ſeventh general Article, as to that is expreſs. This it is:
We declare all them who do or ſhall make profeſſion of the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, capable of holding and exerciſing all Conditions, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
Honours, and publick Charges whatſoever, Royalties, Seigneuries,
or any Charge in the Cities of our Kingdom, Countries, Territories, or
Seigneuries under our Authority. The fifty fourth Article declares, that
they ſhall be admitted Officers in the Courts of Parliaments, Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
Chamber of Accounts, Court of Aids, and the Offices of the general
Treaſurers of <hi>France;</hi> and amongſt the other Officers of the Revenues
of the Crown. The ſeventy fourth Article puts them in the ſame ſtate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46344:6"/>
with their Fellow Subjects, as to all publick Exactions, willing that they
ſhould be charged no higher than others. Thoſe of the ſaid Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly
Reformed (ſaith the Article) may not hereafter be overcharged
or oppreſſed with any Impoſition ordinary or extraordinary, more than
the Catholicks: And to the end that Juſtice might be done and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
impartially, as the Edict explains it ſelf, the 30th. 31ſt to the
57th Articles ſet up Chambers of the Edict in the Parliaments of <hi>Paris</hi>
and <hi>Roan,</hi> where the Proteſtant Counſellors ought to aſſiſt as Judges: and
Chambers <hi>Miparties</hi> in the Parliaments of <hi>Guienne, Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi>
conſiſting each of two Preſidents, the one Proteſtant, the other Papiſt,
and of twelve Counſellors, an equal number of each Religion, to judge
without Appeal, (excluſive to all other Courts) all Differences of any
importance which the Proteſtants might have with their Fellow Subjects
as well in Criminal, as in Civil Matters. In ſhort, this great Edict for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
nothing which might make the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> to live in peace,
and honor: It hath not fail'd even to explain it ſelf, as to the Vexations
which might be created them, by taking away or ſeducing their Children.
For, read the eighteenth general Article. It forbids all Papiſts of what
quality or condition ſoever they may be, to take them away by force, or
by perſwaſion againſt the will of their Parents: As if it had foreſeen that
this would be one of the ways which their Perſecutors would uſe, to vex
and ruine them. But the 38th. Article goes farther yet: That Wills,
that even after their death, Fathers ſhall be Maſters of the Education of
their Children, and conſequently of their Religion; ſo long as their
Children ſhall continue under Guardians, which is by the Laws of <hi>France</hi>
till the 25th year of their Age: <hi>It ſhall be lawful for Fathers, who profeſs
the ſaid Religion, to provide for them ſuch perſons for their education, as they
think fit, and to ſubſtitute one or more, by Will, Codicil, or other Declaration
made before Publick Notaries, or written and ſign'd with their own hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You perceive then plainly, continued our Friend, that by this Edict
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth made the condition of the Proteſtants equal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in all things to that of his other Subjects. They had reaſon then to
hope that they ſhould be allowed to exerciſe their Religion, to breed up
and inſtruct their Children in it, without any diſturbance; and that they
ſhould have as free admiſſion to all Arts, Trades, Offices and Employments
as any of their Fellow Subjects.</p>
               <p>This is very clear, ſaid I, and I am much obliged to you for explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me what this famous Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> is, which I had heard ſo much
diſcourſe of. But they who have no affection for the Proteſtants tell us,
that it is a Law which was extorted by violence; and conſequently, is not
to be kept. I will not ſtand now (ſaid our Friend) to examine whether
that conſequence be good; you cannot but perceive that it is dangerous.
But I dare aſſure you that the Principle from whence it is drawn; namely,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46344:7"/>
that the Edict was extorted by violence is very falſe. I would not have
you take my word for it. But I will produce an unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It is the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris;</hi> he who writ the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth. <hi>That</hi> one Witneſs is worth a thouſand; for he was a declared
Enemy of the Proteſtants. According to him: The general Peace was
made, the Ligue extinguiſh'd; and all perſons in <hi>France</hi> had laid down
their Arms, when this Edict was granted in favour of them. It is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
now, to ſay, that it was extorted by violence, there being then
no party in all the Kingdom in a condition to make the leaſt attempt with
impunity. Moreover, that Prelate could not forbear owning expreſly what
it was mov'd the King to grant them that Edict: It was the ſenſe of the
<hi>Great Obligations</hi> he had to them. See the Book it ſelf; read the Paſſage.
The <hi>Great Obligations which he had to them would not permit him to drive them
into deſpair; and therefore to preſerve them a juſt ballance, he granted them
an Edict larger than any before. They called it the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Indeed the Obligations he had to them were not ſmall. They had teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
an inviolable Loyalty to him in all his Troubles. They had ſpent
freely their Lives and Fortunes to defend his Rights, and his Life againſt
the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who made ſo many Attempts to keep him from
the Throne of his Anceſtors, and to uſurp his place. Had it not been
for their Valour, and their Loyalty, the Crown had gone into the hands
of Strangers; and (ſince we muſt ſpeak out) had it not been for them,
the Blood of the <hi>Bourbons</hi> would not this day have been poſſeſſed of the
Throne.</p>
               <p>The Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> then, was the Effect and the Recompence of the
Great Obligations which King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth had to his Loyal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
and not as is ſlanderouſly reported, the fruit of any violence,
gained by force, and granted againſt the hair. But farther, the Law of
Nature and common policy might challenge ſuch an Edict for them as
well as Gratitude. It is true, that Soveraign Magiſtrates are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God to preſerve the publick peace, and by conſequence, to cut off,
or prevent, as much as in them lies, whatever may diſturb it: It is true
alſo that new Eſtabliſhments in matters of Religion may cauſe great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in a State, and that there are Religions which have Maxims ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
that when Magiſtrates are of a different opinion, or but ſo much
as tolerate ſuch a one, their Lives and their Kingdoms are never in ſafety.
But <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth found the Proteſtant Religion wholly eſtabliſh'd in
the Kingdom when he came to the Crown: Beſides, he who had ſo long
profeſs'd it, knew perfectly well that it had none of thoſe dreadful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims,
which makes Princes and States jealous; that on the contrary, in
it, Loyalty and Obedience of Subjects to Soveraigns of what Religion,
and what humor ſoever, was to them an Article of Faith, and an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Conſcience. He knew that Proteſtants, by their Religion were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46344:7"/>
peaceable men, who ſought but to ſerve God according to his Word, and
were always ready to ſpend the laſt drop of their blood for the ſervice and
the honor of their King.</p>
               <p>But he knew alſo that the zeal of the Romiſh Clergy always animated
the Popiſh Common People againſt them, and that they would be ſure to
fall upon them, unleſs he took them into his protection. The Law of
Nature then did not permit him to abandon to the rage of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
ſo many innocent perſons; and common policy warned him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſo many faithful Subjects for the State, ſo capable of ſupporting it
on occaſion, as he had ſo freſhly experienc'd. It being certain, that had
it not been for them, the Pope and the Ligue had ruin'd the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
But it was not poſſible, either to defend them from the fury of the
People, or to preſerve them for the ſervice of the State, if he had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in favour of them any thing leſs than the Edict of <hi>Nantes:</hi> ſo that this
Edict in truth was to be aſcribed to common Equity and Prudence no leſs
than Gratitude.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid I to my Friend, do you believe that the Grandſon of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth is bound to make good what his Grandfather did? I do not
doubt it at all (anſwered he) otherwiſe there would be nothing ſecure
or certain in Civil Society; and wo be to all Governments if there be no
Foundation of publick Truſt. 1. For if ever Law deſerv'd to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Succeſſors of a Prince, it is this. It was eſtabliſh'd by a Hero,
who had recovered the Crown for his poſterity, by his Sword: and this
Eſtabliſhment was not made but after mature and long deliberations, in
the calm of a profound Peace, obtained and cemented by many and ſignal
Victories. That Hero hath declar'd expreſly in the Preface of the Edict,
that he eſtabliſh'd it in the nature of an irrevocable and perpetual Law;
willing, that it ſhould be firm and inviolable; as he alſo ſaith himſelf in
the 90th. Article. Accordingly he made all the Formalities to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in its eſtabliſhment, which are neceſſary for the paſſing of a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Law in a State. For he made the obſervation of it under the quality
of an irrevocable Law, to be ſworn to by all the Governors and
Lieutenant-Generals of his Provinces, by the Bailiffs, Mayors, and other
ordinary Judges, and principal Inhabitants of the Cities, of each Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Majors, Sheriffs, Conſuls and Jurates, by the Parliaments,
Chambers of Accounts, Court of Aids, with order to have it publiſh'd
and regiſtred in all the ſaid Courts. This is expreſly ſet down in the
92d. and 93d. Articles. Was there ever any thing more authentick?
2. The ſame Reaſons which cauſed the Eſtabliſhment, remain ſtill,
and plead for its continuance. 1. The Family of <hi>Bourbon</hi> preſerved in
the Throne. 2. The Law of Nature and common Policy. 3. The two
Succeſſors of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth look'd not upon themſelves as unconcern'd
in this Edict. Their Word, and their Royal Authority are engaged for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46344:8"/>
its obſervation no leſs than the Word and Royal Authority of its Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Author. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth confirm'd it as ſoon as he came to the
Crown by his Declaration of the 22d. of <hi>May,</hi> 1610, ordering, that the
Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> ſhould be <hi>obſerved</hi> in every Point and Article. Theſe are
the very words.<note place="margin">P. 156, &amp; 157, of the <hi>Lions</hi> Edition.</note> Read them (ſaid he) ſhewing me a Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>The Great Conference of the Royal Ordinances and Edicts.</hi> I read there
in the firſt Book, Title 6, of the ſecond Part of the Volume, not only
the Article he mention'd, but alſo the citation of nine ſeveral Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
publiſh'd at ſeveral times by the ſame King, on the ſame ſubject.
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, who now Reigns, (ſays our Friend) hath
likewiſe aſſured all <hi>Europe</hi> by his authentick Edicts and Declarations,
that he would maintain the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> according to the deſire of his
Grandfather, who had made it an irrevocable Law. He himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
and confirms it himſelf anew; by his Edict of <hi>June,</hi> 1680,
where he forbids Papiſts to change their Religion. There it is; pray
take the pains to read it. Lewis <hi>by the Grace of God, King of</hi> France <hi>and</hi>
Navarre, <hi>to all perſons to whom theſe Preſents come, Greeting. The late</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>the Fourth, our Grandfather, of Glorious Memory, granted by his Edict
given at</hi> Nantes <hi>in the Month of</hi> April, 1598, <hi>to all his Subjects of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
pretended Reformed, who then lived in his Kingdom, or who afterwards
ſhould come and ſettle in it, Liberty of profeſſing their Religion, and at the ſame
time provided whatſoever he judged neceſſary for affording thoſe of the ſaid Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
pretended Reformed means of living in our Kingdom, in the Exerciſe of their
Religion, without being moleſted in it by our Catholick Subjects: which the late
King, our moſt Honored Lord and Father, and we ſince have authoriſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
on other Occaſions, by divers Declarations and Acts.</hi> But this Prince
is not content to tell what he hath formerly done, in confirmation of the
Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> read ſome Lines a little lower, and you will ſee that
he repeats again his former Ingagements. <hi>We declare, that confirming as
much as is, or may be needful, the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>and other Declarations and
Acts given in purſuit of it,</hi> &amp;c. That is to ſay: That by this new Edict
he ſigns once more the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and for a more authentick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that important Law, he ratifies together with it, and ſeals
with his Royal Seal all the Declarations which had already confirmed it.
If all this is not ſufficient to render <hi>His</hi> Word Sacred and Inviolable,
there is nothing in the World can do it: all things are lawful, and it is
to no purpoſe to talk of any Obligation, or of any Bond in humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
They cannot make void, or break the Clauſes of an Edict ſo well
deſerv'd by the Proteſtants, ſo juſt and ſo wiſe in it ſelf, ſo ſolemnly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
ſo religiouſly ſworn to, and ſo often, and ſo authentically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by three Kings, without ſhaking all the Foundations of publick Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
without violating, in that Act, the Law of Nations, and filling
the World with fatal Principles, which by ruining all mutual Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46344:8"/>
men, render Diviſions in States incurable; and conſequently immortal.</p>
               <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, I am much pleaſed with what you have inform'd me.
O how I ſhall daſh them out of countenance, who hereafter ſhall compare
the condition of our Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> with that of the Proteſtants in
<hi>France.</hi> There is no ſort of good uſage but what is due to theſe in their
own Country; of which they have deſerved ſo well by preſerving that
Family which now reigns there. What have they not a right to hope for
under the protection of an Edict ſo authentick? But our Papiſts in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
have they ever deſerved a like protection? Hath there ever been
paſs'd any Act of Parliament in favour of them, like to this Edict? On
the contrary, have not there been paſs'd 1000 againſt them? And not
one,<note place="margin">See Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes at large.</note> but upon the provocation of ſome Sedition, or open Rebellion. You
need but review the Fundamental Laws of the Land now in force againſt
the Pope,<note place="margin">1 Elizab. 1. 5 Eliz. 1. 13 Eliz. 1. 23 Eliz. 1. 27 Eliz. 2. 35 Eliz. 2. 1 Jacob. 4. 3 Jac. 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> againſt the Jeſuits, Seminary Prieſts, and in general againſt all
the Papiſts. There is decreed juſtly againſt them all the contrary that by
the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> is promiſed to the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>You are much in the right (ſaid our Friend) when you uſe the word
<hi>juſtly</hi> on this occaſion: Princes and Proteſtant Magiſtrates cannot look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor by conſequence, treat Papiſts otherwiſe than as declared and
mortal Enemies of their Perſons, and of their States. They may diſguiſe
themſelves as they pleaſe: But in truth, every Papiſt is a man who takes
the Pope to be the Soveraign Head of the Univerſal Church, and believes
that on that very account, there is no Prince, nor King, nor Emperor
who is not ſubject to his Cenſures, even to Excommunication. Now who
knows not that it is a general Maxim of that Religion, that they ought to
treat all excommunicated perſons, as common Peſts? Upon this all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are diſpenſed with from their Oaths of Allegiance to their
Princes, Kingdoms are laid under Interdicts; and they are no way obliged
to keep faith with Hereticks. This is the original and damnable Cauſe
of the many Conſpiracies that have been made againſt the Sacred Lives of
our Kings: And if you will ſearch our Hiſtories, you will find none of
the forementioned Acts ever paſſed but upon ſome previous provocation
given by the Papiſts Inſolence, or Rebellions: of the Maſſacres in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein they of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſo triumph'd, and of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conſternation into which ſo lately our Nation was caſt. They would
fain perſwade us, that theſe pernicious Maxims are peculiar to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
and ſome Monks:<note place="margin">Printed for <hi>Henry Brome,</hi> 1674.</note> But a little Treatiſe, called, <hi>The Difference between
the Church and Court of</hi> Rome, proves undeniably, that it is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all true Papiſts. I could produce other invincible authority, if
this point were here to be proved. There cannot then be too great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt ſuch perſons: whatever they pretend, they do not deſign
ſimply the exerciſe of that Belief which their Conſcience dictates to them,
they graſp at the Power, and aſpire at Dominion: they deſign, whatever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46344:9"/>
it coſt them, to have their Church reign once more here in <hi>England.</hi>
There is nothing they dare not attempt, nothing they are not ready <hi>to act,</hi>
that they may compaſs it. They are implacable Enemies who wait but
for an opportunity to cut our Throats: and we muſt needs be very ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and ſtupid, if after ſo many proofs as they have given us of their
deſperate malice, we ſhould repeal thoſe Laws which tie up their hands.
You are much in the right, I replyed, but let us leave them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and return to our Proteſtants of <hi>France.</hi> You have ſhewed me
their Rights, now let me underſtand their Grievances. I am willing to
do it, ſaid he; but it is a little late: and if you pleaſe, being ſomewhat
weary with my Journey, we will defer it till to morrow. I will expect
you here in my Chamber at the ſame hour you came to day. I told him
with all my heart. And as our Converſation ended there, I think it not
amiſs to end my Letter alſo, intending in another to let you know the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

               <p>The firſt is a Verbal Proceſs of the extraordinary Aſſembly of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
and Biſhops held in the Province of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in
the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> this 1681. It is a Piece which juſtifies a
Truth, that the World will hardly believe: Namely, That whereas the
Proteſtants by Virtue of the Edict had the Exerciſe of their Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every where, they have it now ſcarce any where. See the proof in
the tenth Page of that Verbal Proceſs, where one of the Agents, General
of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> alledgeth as ſo many publick Teſtimonies of
the Piety of their King, <hi>An almoſt Infinite Number of Churches demoliſh'd,
and the Exerciſe of the Religion pretended Reformed ſuppreſs'd.</hi> I leave you to
imagine what a conſternation ſuch a terrible Blow muſt have put thoſe poor
people into; not to mention their Grief to ſee thoſe Holy Places beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
down, <hi>whoſe very Stones they took pleaſure in;</hi> inſtead of having the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Mannah</hi> ſhower down <hi>at the Doors of their Tabernacles,</hi> at this preſent
they are forc'd to go 30 or 40 miles through the worſt of ways, in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46344:9"/>
Winter, to hear the Word of God, and to have their Children baptized.
But let us go on to a ſecond Piece.</p>
               <p>Here is a Declaration hath lain heavy upon them, in reference to an
infinite number of living Temples, who are far otherwiſe to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, by reaſon of the rigor they are us'd with, than the Temples of
Stone that are demoliſh'd. It is of the thirteenth of <hi>March,</hi> 1679. Pray
read it. It forbids all Popiſh Clergy-men, whatever deſire they have, to
turn Proteſtants; and even all thoſe Proteſtants, who have forſaken their
Religion out of Lightneſs, or Infirmity; to return to it again, upon better
knowledge of the truth, preſs'd to it by their Conſciences, and deſiring
to give glory to God. This dreadful Edict, will not ſuffer, that any of
them ſhall ſatisfie their Conſciences, in ſo important an Affair, under any
leſs penalty, than that of the <hi>Amende Honorable,</hi> perpetual baniſhment,
and confiſcation of their Goods. I beſeech you (ſaid I) what doth the
Declaration intend, by <hi>making Amende Honorable?</hi> You have reaſon to
ask, replyed he, it is that you ought not to be ignorant of. Know then,
that for them to make <hi>Amende Honorable</hi> is to go into ſome publick place,
in their Shirt, a Torch in their Hand, a Rope about their Neck, followed
by the Hangman, in this Equipage (which is that of the moſt infamous
Criminals) to ask pardon of God, the King, and Juſtice for what they
have done: that is to ſay, on this occaſion, for having dar'd to repent of
ſinning againſt God, for having forſaken a Religion which they believ'd
Heretical and Idolatrous, and conſequently, the infallible way to eternal
damnation; and for being willing thence forward to profeſs the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, in which only they are perſwaded they can be ſaved.
This is, dear Friend, what they inflict upon all Popiſh Eccleſiaſticks to
whom God vouchſafes Grace to diſcern the true Religion, and upon all
Proteſtants, who having been ſuch Wretches as to forſake it, are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſo happy as to be convinc'd of their <hi>Sin;</hi> and to repent. They
call the firſt Apoſtates, and the other Relaps. But Names do not change
the nature of things: the Miſery is, that all this is executed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
rigor. The Priſons of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and thoſe of other places are at
this preſent filled with this ſort of pretended Relapſed Perſons; and it
is not permitted to any one to relieve them. What <hi>poſſibility</hi> is there
then for ſuch as are in like Circumſtances, and whoſe number every day
increaſes, to continue in <hi>France?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the miſchief is much increas'd ſince this Declaration. What was
particular to Eccleſiaſticks and Relapſe Proteſtants, is now become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
to all Roman Catholicks. I ſhewed you the Piece yeſterday. It is
that very Edict of <hi>June,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Art. 1. par.</note> 1680, wherein they pretend to confirm the Edict
of <hi>Nantes.</hi> A Bleſſed Confirmation! The Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> as I have
ſhewed you, allows the Liberty of Conſcience to all them who were then
Proteſtants, and to all ſuch as would be afterwards, Inhabitants, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46344:10"/>
But what doth this new Edict declare! <hi>Our Will and Pleaſure is, that
our Subjects, of what quality, condition, age or ſex ſoever, now making profeſſion of
the Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Religion, may never forſake it, to go ever to the
pretended Reformed Religion, for what Cauſe, Reaſon, Pretence or Conſideration
ſoever. We will that they who ſhall act contrary to this our Pleaſure, ſhall be
condemned to make</hi> Amende Honorable, <hi>to perpetual baniſhment out of our
Kingdom, and all their Goods to be confiſcated. We forbid all Miniſters of the
ſaid pretended Reformed Religion, hereafter to receive any Catholick to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the pretended Reformed Religion, and we forbid them and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their Conſiſtories to ſuffer in their Churches or Aſſemblies any ſuch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
penalty to the Miniſters of being deprived for ever of exerciſing any Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Miniſtry in our Kingdom, and of ſuppreſſion for ever of the Exerciſe
of the ſaid Religion in that place where any one Catholick ſhall be received to make
profeſſion of the ſaid pretended Reformed Religion.</hi> Lord! what a horrible
proceeding is this! (cryed I, as ſoon as my Friend had read it) do they
call this confirming of Edicts in <hi>France?</hi> what a Violence is this to the
Conſciences of Miniſters and Elders, to command them to ſhut the doors
of the Church of Jeſus Chriſt to all their Neighbours who come thither for
admiſſion: (and to have this done) by them who are called by God to
open the Door to all the World? Is not this to force them to violate the
moſt Eſſential and Sacred Duty of Chriſtian Charity? In truth, if there
were nothing elſe but this; I do not ſee how they can ſtay there much
longer with a ſafe Conſcience. They muſt ſwallow worſe Potions than
theſe (ſaid my Friend) you ſhall ſee preſently quite other Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
What (replyed I) have they the heart to uſe thus cruelly thoſe
poor Churches within whoſe Walls any Roman Catholick changes his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
Don't doubt it (ſaid he) they make no conſcience at all to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi>
their Commiſſion, whenſoever they are enjoyn'd to execute any penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I will give you an Example, which will amaze you There is a great
Town in <hi>Poitou</hi> called <hi>La Motthe,</hi> where the Proteſtants have a Church
conſiſting of between three and four thouſand Communicants: a young
Maid of about ſeventeen years old, who from a Proteſtant had turned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
had ſtole her ſelf into the Congregation upon a Communion-day.
Now you muſt obſerve, that the Proteſtant Churches are full on thoſe
days. For they would believe themſelves very much to blame, if they
loſt any Opportunity of partaking at the Lord's Supper. Nevertheleſs,
without conſidering how eaſie it was for that young Maid not to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Conſiſtory in ſuch a Crowd, and tho thoſe poor people were
not at all within the Letter of that rigorous Edict, they have made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
all the penalty. The Exerciſe of their Religion is wholly ſuppreſs'd
there, and their Miniſter not allowed to preach in <hi>France.</hi> This is very
cruel (ſaid I to our Friend) and tho it were true that thoſe Miniſters and
thoſe Elders were guilty upon ſuch an account, why ſhould the whole flock
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46344:10"/>
be puniſhed? Thoſe poor Sheep what have they done? That is very
uſual for thoſe Gentlemen (anſwered he:) I have a hundred Stories to
inſtance in. I cannot forbear telling you one, which many of their own
Devotees were ſcandalized at. S. <hi>Hippolyte</hi> is a place in where
all the Inhabitants are Proteſtants, except the Curate, and it may be,
two or three poor wretches, who are not Natives of the place neither.
A fancy took the Curate to put a Trick upon the Proteſtants; for this
he choſe a Sunday; and the very moment that they came out of the
Church, he came and preſented himſelf before them with his Sacrament,
as they were almoſt all come out. You muſt know that the Church is on
the farther ſide of a Bridge, which muſt be paſs'd over, going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Several of them were upon the Bridge, others had paſs'd it, and
part were yet on the other ſide; when the Curate appear'd, all of them,
who could poſſibly, got away and hid themſelves: but neither the place,
nor the great haſte of the Curate would permit all of them to do ſo. He
went up directly to one of the Company, whom he had born an ill will to
for ſome time: he bids him kneel: and the other anſwering that his
Conſcience would not ſuffer him to do it; he gave him a Cuff on the
Ear. He that was ſtruck grumbled; and ſo did two or three who were
about him. The Curate went on his way, threatning hard. Next day
there were Informations made on both ſides: the Curate in his, not
complaining of any perſon but him he had ſtruck, and two or three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who had grumbled at it. The Friends of the Curate perceiving that
he had done the wrong, propos'd an Accommodation. It was by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
conſented to. Proſecution ceaſed on each ſide, and it was believed
that there was an end of that buſineſs: there was not a word ſpoken of it
in above a year. But the Intendant of <hi>Languedoc</hi> revived it laſt Winter,
when they thought of nothing leſs; and of a matter particular to two or
three, made it a general Concern of the whole Congregation. He cites
them before the Preſidial of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> to whom he joyn'd himſelf. He
condemns them to demoliſh their Church in a Months time. Thoſe
poor people go and caſt themſelves at the feet of the Court; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
The King's Council hears and confirms this ſtrange Order of the
Intendant, and the Church is rac'd to the ground. The Council which
gave this Sentence was the firſt in which the <hi>Dauphine</hi> was preſent. The
Report of ſuch an Order being ſpred among the Courtiers, and all being
amaz'd that heard it, a certain perſon took the liberty to tell the <hi>Dauphin,</hi>
that for the firſt time he had been at the Council, he had aſſiſted to a
great Injuſtice. What ſay you to that? ſaid a Duke and Peer, to the
<hi>Dauphin,</hi> who had made no reply to the former. I ſay, anſwered the
<hi>Dauphin,</hi> that he may be much in the right. I told our Friend, I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of this. You muſt not be weary, ſaid he, this is but the beginning
of ſorrows. Let's go on to the reſt. Here is, ſaid he, a Little Book
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46344:11"/>
which comes juſt now to my hand, in it are ſtitch'd up together, three
Acts concerning Schools. The firſt is of the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> 1670.
It forbids all Proteſtant Schoolmaſters to teach any thing in their Schools,
but to read and write, and Arithmetick. The ſecond, which is of the
4th. of <hi>December,</hi> 1671, ordains, that the Proteſtants ſhall have but one only
School in any place where they have the publick Exerciſe of their Religion;
and but one Maſter in that School. The third is of the ninth of <hi>July,</hi>
this preſent 1681. Look upon them (ſaid he) and give me your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
It ſeems (ſaid I) that the firſt contains nothing which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
may complain of, at leaſt, if that which I read there be true, namely,
that by the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> it is expreſly ordain'd, That in the Schools of
thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion, there ſhall not any thing be
taught, but to read, write, and caſt account. For according to this,
the Edict of 1670 is entirely conformable to that other Edict which is
the Law. You are in the right, ſaid I, but they who fram'd the Act,
have deceived you, and have made no ſcruple to ground it upon a matter
of fact entirely falſe. For the Article which ſpeaks of Schools, doth not
mention the leaſt word of that reſtriction, which the Act aſſures us to be
there <hi>expreſſed,</hi> namely, <hi>of teaching only to read, write, and caſt account.</hi>
See the Article at length: it is the 37th particular. <hi>Thoſe of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
may not keep publick Schools, unleſs in Cities and places where the publick
Exerciſe of their Religion is allowed, and the Proviſions which have heretofore
been granted them for the erection or maintenance of Colleges, ſhall be authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
where occaſion ſhall require, and have their full and entire effect.</hi> Where
is that <hi>expreſs</hi> Order? <hi>It is expreſly ordered to teach only to read, write, and
caſt account;</hi> upon which the Act is grounded. Is it poſſible (ſaid I)
that they ſhould have no ſenſe of the horrid ſhame which muſt ariſe
upon conviction of forgery in a matter of fact of this nature? They
never ſtick at ſo ſmall a matter as that (ſaid he) in the deſign they have
of rooting out the Proteſtants. Thoſe who are in <hi>France</hi> dare not open
their mouths to diſcover ſuch kind of Falſities; and Strangers, whom
they carry fair with, will not ſo far concern themſelves as ever to ſuſpect
there ſhould be falſhood in a matter of fact ſo eaſie to be made out; and
which they make to be ſo poſitively affirm'd by ſo great a King. So that
they do not fear at all the ſhame you ſpeak of. After all, they are but
pious Frauds, at which, they of the Popes Communion never bluſh.
And what ſay you (continued he) to that other Act which reduces all
Schools to one, in each City and Town where the Proteſtants have the
publick Exerciſe of their Religion, and that which requires that there
ſhould be only one Maſter in that School. I replyed that it was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way to reſtore Ignorance, the Mother of the Roman Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
In truth, ſays he, the care of one Maſter cannot go far. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
there is a Proteſtant Church which alone hath two thouſand Children
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46344:11"/>
of age to be taught. Thoſe poor people have done all they could to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Council, that at leaſt there might be two Schools in each
place, one for Boys, and the other for Girls. But it was to little purpoſe
that they pleaded good manners for it, which ſuch a mixture of both
Sexes viſibly was offenſive to. They were deaf to all their Prayers and
to all their Remonſtrances. But this is not all yet. In the Execution of
this rigorous Act, they have taken away from them that little which was
left them. For the Judges of the places will not ſuffer that any School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
teach, unleſs they have firſt of all approved of him, and receiv'd
him in all their Forms. As therefore their approbation is a matter full of
invincible Difficulties; above all, when they are to give it to a man of
merit, and who may do good, it is come to paſs by means of theſe two
Acts, that all the little Schools of the Proteſtants are ſhut up. From
the little Schools they have proceeded to Colleges. You ſee by the Act
of the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> which ſuppreſſes <hi>for ever</hi> that of <hi>Sedan.</hi> They have
taken away alſo the College of <hi>Châtillon ſur Loin.</hi> So that, hereafter the
Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> are to lie under worſe than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs. I
leave you now to judge whether they are to blame to ſeek for light in
ſome <hi>Goſhen.</hi> In truth, ſaid I, this is very hard. But if they who inſpire
into the King ſuch ſtrange Acts, have no reſpect for <hi>Henry</hi> the Great and
his Edicts, at leaſt they ought to be more tender of the Glory of their
own Illuſtrious Prince, and not to expoſe him, as they do, to be ranked
with that Emperor againſt whom the Holy Fathers have cryed ſo loudly.
Is it poſſible they can be ignorant that this method of extinguiſhing the
Proteſtant Religion is exactly the ſame that <hi>Julian</hi> took to extinguiſh the
Chriſtian Religion? I do not think (ſaid our Friend) that they can be
ignorant of a truth ſo well known; eſpecially ſince one of their eminent
Writers hath publiſh'd the Hiſtory of the Life of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great, and
of S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>God. Hermant,</hi> Doctor of the <hi>Sorbon. Tom. 1. Book 2 p.</hi> 204. and Notes of the ſame <hi>chapt. p.</hi> 625.</note> There they might have read in more than one
place, that it was likewiſe one of the Secrets of that Emperor, to ruine
the Chriſtians by keeping them from all Improvement in Learning, and
to prohibit their Colleges and Schools; and which the Fathers judg'd to
be moſt ſubtle policy. But their zeal tranſports them above the moſt
odious Compariſons. They ſtick not to give occaſion for them every
moment. I will ſhew you an Example which will aſtoniſh you, I have
here light upon the Paper.</p>
               <p>They are now come to take the meaſures of that barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
King who us'd Midwives of his own Religion to deſtroy the Race of
the people of God in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For by that Declaration of the 28th of
<hi>February,</hi> 1680, It is ordered, that the Wives of Proteſtants ſhall not be
brought to bed but by Midwives or Chyrurgeons who are Papiſts. This
they make to be obſerv'd with the utmoſt rigor, ſo far that they put a
poor woman in priſon for being preſent at the Labour of her Siſter,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46344:12"/>
whoſe delivery was ſo quick and fortunate, that there was neither time
nor need to call a Midwife.</p>
               <p>That you may in few words underſtand of what conſequence this is to
our poor Brethren, I need but acquaint you, that the King of <hi>France</hi> in
his Edict of the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1680, where he forbids Papiſts to change
their Religion, acknowledges himſelf, what experience doth but too
plainly juſtifie, namely, that the <hi>Roman Catholicks have always had an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
not only againſt the Proteſtant Religion, but <hi>againſt all thoſe that
profeſs it,</hi> and an averſion which hath <hi>been improv'd by the publication of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts,
Declarations and Acts.</hi> That is to ſay, that whatever pretence the
Roman Catholicks make to the contrary, they have always been, and ſtill
are Enemies of the Proteſtants; and that the Proteſtants ought to look to
be treated by the Catholicks as Enemies. After this what can they judge
of the Deſign, and Conſequences of a Declaration, which puts the Lives
of their Wives and Children into thoſe very hands which the King, who
makes the Declaration, acknowledges to be hands of Enemies? But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Declaration it ſelf diſcovers, that one of its intentions was, to
make the Children of Proteſtants to be baptized by Midwives, or by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Chyrurgions: And what miſchief do they not open a way for by that?
The Proteſtants will hold that Baptiſm void, which hath been admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
by ſuch hands, they will not fail to make it be adminiſtred anew, by
their Paſtors. This ſhall paſs for a capital Crime in the Paſtors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and they ſhall be puniſhed as ſacrilegious perſons who trample on
the Religion in Authority, the Religion of the King: for the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Repreſentations are ſtill made uſe of. Nay, ſaid I, by this they will
likewiſe claim a right, from the Baptiſm's being adminiſtred by Papiſts,
to make themſelves Maſters of the education of their Children. You
are in the right (ſaid he) and that Article ought not to be forgotten.
It is juſt, will they ſay, that they ſhould be brought up in the Church
which hath conſecrated them to God, by Baptiſm, at leaſt, that they
ſhould be bred up there, till they are of age to chuſe for themſelves: and
when they <hi>are of age,</hi> they will ſay then, that it is juſt they ſhould, as
well as others, be liable to the ſame Edict which forbids Catholicks to
change their Religion. Is not this enough already to make one forſake
ſuch a Kingdom? A Chriſtian for leſs than this would ſurely flie to the
utmoſt Parts of the World. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>Here is that terrible Decree which fills up the meaſure, as to what
concerns the poor Children. It comes to my hand very ſeaſonably. It is
the Declaration of the 17th. of <hi>June</hi> laſt. This ordains that all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Proteſtants ſhall be admitted to abjure the Religion of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and become Papiſts as ſoon as they ſhall be ſeven years old: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that after ſuch an Abjuration, it ſhall be at the choice of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
either to return home to their Fathers, and there to be maintain'd,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46344:12"/>
or to oblige their Fathers and Mothers to pay for their Board, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
where ever they pleaſe to live. It adds extreme Penalties to be
laid on them, who breed up their Children in foreign parts, before they
are ſixteen years old. But I pray read over the whole <hi>Edict.</hi> Upon that
I took the Declaration from our Friends hand, read it, and returning it to
him again, could not forbear declaring, that I did not now wonder any
more that the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> were in ſo great a Conſternation.
They are much in the right (ſaid I) Diſcretion and Conſcience oblige
them to depart out of a Country, in which there is no ſecurity for the
ſalvation of their dear Children. They are of too great a value to be ſo
hazarded. What is more eaſie, for them who have all the power, than
to induce ſuch young Children to change their Religion? There is no
need for this, to ſhew them all the Kingdoms of the World and their
Glory. A Baby, a Picture, a little Cake will do the buſineſs; or if there
want ſomewhat more, a Rod will not fail to complete this worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.
In the mean while, what a condition are their wretched Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in, beſides the moſt inexpreſſible grief of ſeeing what is moſt dear
to them in the world ſeduc'd out of the Service and Houſe of God; they
ſhall likewiſe have this addition of Anguiſh of having their own Children
for their Perſecutors. For, knowing, as I do, the Spirit of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
I doubt not but they will all prove rebellious and unnatural, and
renounce all that love and natural reſpect which is due to them, whom they
owe their Lives to.</p>
               <p>They'll give Law to their Parents, they will oblige them to make
them great Allowances, which they will diſpoſe of as they liſt; and if
their Fathers pay them not preciſely at the time appointed, I am ſure,
no rigors ſhall be forgotten in the proſecution. No certainly, ſaid
our Friend, and I could give you an hundred Inſtances, if there were
need. Even before this mercileſs Declaration was made, the Goods of
Parents were ſeis'd upon, expoſed to ſale, to pay for the maintenance of
their Children, who had been inveigled from them, and been made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.
If they dealt with them ſo then before the Declaration, what will
they not do when they ſee themſelves ſupported and armed with Royal
Authority? But there is no need I ſhould inſiſt farther on the dreadful
Conſequences of this Declaration. It hath been lately Printed in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and Notes made upon it, wherein nothing hath been forgotten.
The Book is written impartially: tho I can ſcarce believe what is expreſs'd
in the Title Page, that it was written in <hi>French;</hi> however, ſome Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms
are put in to make you believe it: but the Proteſtants of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are not us'd to ſuch <hi>bold</hi> Expreſſions upon ſuch kind of Subjects: and
I doubt much whether they could do it.</p>
               <p>If they have reaſon to fear for the birth, and for the tender years of
their Children, they have no leſs for themſelves. Here is a proof of it.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46344:13"/>
It is the Declaration of the 19th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1680: By which it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
That whenever they are ſick, they ſhall ſuffer themſelves to be
viſited by the Papiſt Magiſtrates. Thus, having made their lives <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome</hi>
to them, they take a thouſand ways to torment them in their Beds,
as ſoon as any Diſeaſe hath ſeiſed them. It is not henceforth permitted
to them either to be ſick, or die in peace. Under colour of this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
they are perſecuted, and all means are tryed to ſhake their Faith,
under the pretence of being ask'd what Religion they will die in. Firſt a
Judge preſents himſelf with the awe of his preſence, accompanied by one
of the King's Sollicitors and two Papiſt Witneſſes. They begin their
Work by driving all Proteſtants, who are with the ſick man, out of his
Chamber: Father, Mother, Wife, Husband, Children, none are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
After that, they do with the ſick perſon as they liſt: they draw
up a Verbal Proceſs, or ſuch as they like. Lies with them are but pious
Frauds. Whatſoever the ſick man anſwers, he hath ſtill abjur'd, if theſe
Gentlemen pleaſe to make a converſion of it; and there is no poſſibility
of diſproving it. The Verbal Proceſs is drawn up in good Form. If
the ſick man recovers, and refuſes to go to Maſs, immediately he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to all the penalties of a Relapſe. If he dies and chances to be the
Father of a Family, they take away all his Children, to breed them up in
the Popiſh Religion; and his Eſtate, to preſerve it, as they pretend, for
the Children of a Catholick Father. Can any one who hath any care of
his own ſalvation, or any affection for his Children, live expos'd to ſuch
dreadful Inconveniences, if God offers any means to avoid them?</p>
               <p>I am afraid I tire you with the Recital of ſo many Calamities. Fear
not that, anſwered I, I am reſolv'd to know all. You do not conſider
what you ſay, replyed he, I ſhould need whole weeks to tell you all.
Imagine all the Supriſes, all the indirect practices, all the baſe tricks
of Inſinuation, and little quirks of Law are put in ure: together with
all manner of violence, to accompliſh the Work. Neither do thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Proteſtants always neglect the Oracles of the Scripture. It
ſays, <hi>I will ſmite the Shepherd, and the Sheep of the Flock ſhall be ſcattered.</hi>
Theſe Gentlemen then, that they may the more eaſily ſcatter the Sheep,
ſmite, every where, the Shepherd, and conſtrain them to fly. They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon
one, for having by the Word of God confirm'd ſome of his Flock,
whom the Popiſh Doctors would pervert: another, for being converted
to the Proteſtant Religion in his youth, long before any Law was made
againſt pretended Apoſtates. They hire forlorn Wretches to go to the
Sermons of the Proteſtant Miniſters, and to depoſe before a Magiſtrate,
that the Miniſters ſaid, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was idolatrous, or that
the Faithful are perſecuted, that they ſpake ill of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or of
the King. Upon this, without being heard, (and tho it be offered to be
made out by the Depoſition of an infinity almoſt of perſons of credit,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46344:13"/>
that the teſtimonies of theſe two or three Wretches are abſolutely falſe)
Orders are iſſued out for the ſeiſing the Bodies of the Miniſters. They
are clap'd in Jayl as ſoon as taken: they are condemn'd to pay exceſſive
Fines: they force them to make the <hi>Amende Honorable,</hi> they baniſh them
the Kingdom. The Intendant of <hi>Rochefort</hi> ſuppreſs'd one there, upon
the moſt extravagant Depoſition that was ever taken. The Deponent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been at the Sermon of that Miniſter, ſaid, <hi>That there was nothing to be
found fault with in his words, but that he perceiv'd his thoughts were not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
If there are any amongſt them ſo happy as to confound ſo the falſe
Witneſſes, that the Judges are aſham'd to uſe all thoſe rigors; none of
the Charges of Impriſonment, or of the Suit are ever recovered againſt
any one. A Miniſter who may have ſixty or ſeventy pounds a year, and
ſeven or eight in Family to maintain, muſt be condemn'd with all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
to pay all theſe great coſts. I could, upon this Head, tell you a
hundred Stories, but that it would be too tedious. I have met both at
<hi>Paris</hi> and in other Provinces many of theſe perſecuted Miniſters, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me with their Adventures, <hi>Germany, Holland</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> are
full of them, and I am told, there are ſome of them here in <hi>England.</hi> Their
abſence from their Flocks is but too good a proof how hot the perſecution
is againſt them. And ſo let's go on.</p>
               <p>You may remember that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> judg'd it neceſſary for the
preſervation of the Eſtates, and Credit of the proteſtants, and for the
ſafety of their Lives, to erect Tribunals where ſupreme Juſtice might be
adminiſtred by Judges of the one, and of the other Religion. But all
theſe Tribunals are ſuppreſs'd: namely, the Chambers of the Edict of
<hi>Paris,</hi> and of <hi>Rouen.</hi> It is ſome years ſince the <hi>Chambres Miparties</hi> were
ſuppreſs'd by the Delaration of <hi>July,</hi> 1679: ſo that here is their Fortunes,
their Credit, their Lives, all at the mercy of their ſworn Enemies. For
you have not forgot that the King of <hi>France</hi> acknowledges, in one of his
Declarations, that the Papiſts have always hated the perſons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
Judge then if it be ſafe for them to ſtay longer in ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>But there is no method proper to ruine them, which is not made uſe of,
that if one fails, another may be ſure to take. Synods and Conferences
are abſolutely neceſſary, for the Admiſſion of their Miniſters, for the
Correction of Scandals, for the preſervation of Peace in their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for the ſubſiſtence of their Colleges, and for the ſupport and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of their Diſcipline. At firſt they kept them with all ſort of Liberty.
Under <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, they thought fit to forbid them to hold any
Synod, unleſs ſome Proteſtant Commiſſary, who was to be named by the
Court, were preſent. This was obſerved till the year 1679, when a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
was publiſh'd, requiring that there ſhould be a Papiſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in their Synods. That is to ſay, Sir, ſaid I, interrupting our Friend,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46344:14"/>
they will pry into their hearts, and perfectly know where their ſtrength
or their weakneſs lies. If there were nothing but that in it, replyed our
Friend, that Declaration would not allarm them ſo much as it doth. For
there is nothing done in their Aſſemblies, which they are not willing all
the world ſhould know. They defie their moſt mortal Enemies to prove
the contrary. Can there be a more undeniable proof of this, than the
practice of the Proteſtant Commiſſary, who ſends to the Court a Copy
well atteſted of all the Reſults of the Deliberations which are made,
while the Synod or Conference is held? What do they fear then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
I, from the preſence of a Papiſt Commiſſary? Becauſe they know
that the end of the Court cannot be to diſcover their Secrets, ſince they
have none; therefore it is that they juſtly fear, that this Papiſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
hath been ſet over them, to create them trouble in the moſt innocent
Affairs, to hinder thoſe Deliberations which are moſt neceſſary for the
due preſervation of their Flocks, to ſilence thoſe Miniſters among them
whom he ſhall perceive to be of greateſt Ability, and of Credit, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
one by threatnings, to corrupt another by promiſes, to ſow Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention
and Diviſion among them, and to employ all means poſſibly to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
them. Theſe are the juſt fears which have hindred them till this
preſent, from aſſembling any Synods with this ſo deſtructive a condition,
hoping continually that, it may be, God would touch the heart of their
King. But perceiving no favourable change, and not being able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
without holding their Synods, I learn'd, as I came out of <hi>France,</hi> that
theſe poor people are reſolv'd to run theſe hazards, and that their Synods
are upon aſſembling in ſeveral places. May God vouchſafe to preſide in
the midſt of them by his Grace, and remove far from them all the Evils
they have cauſe to fear. It may be, by their good Examples, and their
Religious Behaviour they may convert them, who are ſet over them for a
ſnare, as it happened to their Fathers in the laſt Age alſo. Then was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
the placing of Papiſt Commiſſaries, to ſpie out their liberty. But
theſe Commiſſaries were ſo taken with the Modeſty, the Piety, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the Decency of Order, and the devout Prayers of the firſt Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that they gave Glory to God, and embrac'd the Religion which they
had perſecuted.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuites nevertheleſs have thought all theſe Evils of which I have
ſpoken, too ſlack and gentle. That they may not be at any more trouble,
they will do the buſineſs once for all. They have contrived to ſtarve all
the Proteſtants: and to effect this, they have made all the means of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a livelyhood, to be taken from them, by the Acts of the Council of
State, of the ſixth of <hi>November,</hi> 1679, and the 28th. of <hi>June,</hi> 1681.
1. They have turn'd out of all Juriſdictions and Seignuries (which are
almoſt infinite in <hi>France</hi>) all Proteſtants who had been admitted Officers
in thoſe Juriſdictions. All Stewards, Bailiffs, Sollicitors, Officers of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46344:14"/>
Exchequer, Regiſters, Notaries, Clerks, Serjeants and Uſhers that were
Proteſtants, of all ſorts, throughout the whole Kingdom, are caſhiered
by virtue of theſe Acts; they have reduc'd to Beggary thouſands of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
which had no other ſubſiſtence, but by theſe Employments. 2.
Look upon thoſe two Pieces, which they procured alſo, for the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
The Title of the one is, <hi>The Order of the Council Royal of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
(or Treaſury) of the 11th. of</hi> June, 1680. The other is, <hi>An Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Council of State of the 17th. of</hi> Auguſt <hi>of the ſame year.</hi> By the
means of theſe two Pieces, the Jeſuites have made the Proteſtants to be
kept out of all the Affairs of the Finances, Cuſtoms, which they call
<hi>Traites Forains,</hi> of Aids, Gabelles, Taxes of all ſorts of Commiſſions,
to which the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> ordered, that they ſhould be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
with the Papiſts. This ſecond hath taken away the Bread of
a vaſt number of Families more. 3. They every day make the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Captains and Officers (who have ſerv'd ſo worthily by Land and Sea)
to be turn'd out of their Commands. Thoſe brave Men after they have ſpent
their Eſtates to advance their Maſters Honor, and ventured their Lives a
thouſand times for his Glory; ſee themſelves ſhamefully, as ſo many
Cowards, caſhiered, without any exception for them who having ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
and diſtinguiſh'd themſelves by particular Actions, had deſerv'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Penſions. Becauſe they will not be leſs faithful to God, than
they have been to their King: they are reſolved Diſgrace and Beggary
ſhall be the Reward of their Service. By this, they take away from all
the Proteſtant Nobility the means of maintaining themſelves in that Rank
in which God by their Birth hath placed them. 4. As to the Merchants,
look what the Jeſuits have thought upon to ruine them. They have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
an Order of Council of State, of the 19th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1680,
which <hi>grants</hi> to all Proteſtants who change their Religion, <hi>the term and
forbearance of three years for the payment of the principal of their Debts,
with prohibition to all their Creditors to bring any Action againſt them, during
that time, upon pain of Non-ſuit, Noli proſequi, and all Charges, Damages,
Coſts and Intereſts.</hi> I perceive very well, (ſaid I to our Friend) that this
puts thoſe who revolt in a way to ſecure and withdraw their Goods; and
to enjoy in peace the Fruits of their turning Bankrupts. But I do not
ſee how this tends to the ruine of thoſe Merchants in general, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
in the Proteſtant Religion. That is (ſaid he, ſmiling) becauſe
you have not ſo ſubtle a wit, nor are ſo quick-ſighted as the Jeſuits.
You know very well that Merchants ſubſiſt by their Credit: if their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
be low, they muſt fall; there is no more trading for them, their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is done. Now do you not perceive, that the credit of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Merchants is ruined by this Order, which puts them in a way of
turning Bankrupts as they pleaſe, with all indemnity; and of inriching
themſelves with thoſe Goods they have been truſted with? Who do you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46344:15"/>
think after this will be ſo ſilly as to take their word? Who can tell, with
any certainty, whether they with whom they deal, are perſons who will
continue in the Proteſtant Religion? Is there any thing more common
than ſuch Changes in Religion now adays? It's enough (ſaid I) I was
miſtaken, I perceive now very well that the ruine of the Proteſtant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
is unavoidable. Go on to the other Profeſſions. For I ſee they
are reſolved that no Proteſtant ſhall get Bread among them. You are in the
right (ſaid he) you have ſeen it in many of them, I'll ſhew it you now in
the reſt. 5. All Papiſts who drive any Trade, or exerciſe any Art, are
forbid to take any Proteſtant Apprentice. I have ſeen the Order, but
have it not now by me. By this you ſee that all young men of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion (who have not means of their own) are reduced to this
extremity, either of ſtarving in <hi>France,</hi> or turning Papiſts, or forſaking
that Kingdom. For the ſame Order forbids any Proteſtant who drives
or profeſſes any Trade, to have under them any Apprentice, either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
or Proteſtant, that ſo they may not be able to do work enough to
maintain their Families. 6. The Grand Maſter and Grand <hi>Prêvot</hi> have
given notice, by Virtue of Letters under the Signet, to all Proteſtants
who had Privileges, whereby they had right to keep Shops, as Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
Apothecaries, Watchmakers, and other Tradeſmen, to forbear
uſing their privileges any longer, and to ſhut up their Shops, which hath
been punctually executed. 7. They have eſtabliſh'd Societies of Phyſicians
at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and in other places, where, as I am aſſured from good hands,
there were none ever before. None but Papiſts will be received into
thoſe Societies. By this, the Jeſuits have found out the way, at one
ſtroke to hinder the Practice of all the Proteſtant Phyſicians; however
able and experienc'd they may be. In ſo much that the Lives of all ſick
Proteſtants are by this means put into the hands of their Enemies. 8. In
ſhort, there is ſcarce now any place in all <hi>France</hi> where they may get their
livelyhood. They are every where moleſted and hindered from exerciſing
in quiet any Trade or Art which they have learn'd. To diſpatch them
quite; they require of them not only that they ſhall continue to bear all
the Burdens of the Government, altho they take from them the means of
doing it: but alſo that they bear double to what they did; that is to ſay,
they uſe a rigor far greater, than what was practiſed upon the People of
God, when they were commanded to <hi>deliver the ſame tale of bricks, and
yet had not ſtraw given them as formerly.</hi> In effect, at the ſame time that
they will not allow them, of the Proteſtant Religion, to get a penny:
they exact of them to pay the King double, nay, treble, to what they
paid before. <hi>Monſieur de Marillac,</hi> Intendant of <hi>Poitou,</hi> hath an Order
of Council which gives him alone the Power of the Impoſition of the
Tax in that great Province. He diſcharges the Papiſts, who are at eaſe,
and overcharges the poor Proteſtants with their proportion, who before
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46344:15"/>
that fainted under their own proper burden; and could bear no more. I
will tell you farther on this occaſion, that the Jeſuits have obtain'd an
Order of the King, by which all Proteſtants who change Religion, are
exempted for two years, from all quartering of Soldiers, and all Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
of Moneys which are levied on that Account, which alſo tends to
the utter ruine of them who continue firm in the Proteſtant Religion. For
they throw all the burden upon them, of which the others are eas'd.
From thence in part it is, that all the Houſes of thoſe poor people are
filled with Soldiers, who live there as in an Enemy's Country.</p>
               <p>I do not know if the zeal of the Jeſuits will reſt here: For they want
yet the ſatisfaction of keeping S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Day, as they kept it in the
former Age. It is true, what is allowed them is not far from it. For
which is the better of the two, to ſtab with one blow, or to make men
die by little and little, of hunger and miſery? As to the Blow (ſaid I
to our Friend) I do not underſtand you. Pray, if you pleaſe, explain
your ſelf, what do you mean by keeping S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Day? <hi>Monſieur
de Perifix,</hi> that Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who hath writ the Life of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth (anſwered he) ſhall tell you for me. There's the Book, the
place may be eaſily found.<note place="margin">Surl' an. 1572 Edit. Amſterd. p. 30.</note> Here it is: <hi>Six days after, which was S.</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew<hi>'s
Day, all the Huguenots who came to the (Wedding) Feaſt, had
their Throats cut, amongſt others, the Admiral, twenty perſons of the beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
twelve hundred Gentlemen, about four thouſand Soldiers and Citizens:
afterwards through all the Cities of the Kingdom, after the Example of</hi> Paris,
<hi>near a hundred thouſand were maſſacred. An execrable Action! Such as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was, and I hope to God never will be the like.</hi> You know then well, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
our Friend, directing his Speech to me, you know well now what
it is to keep S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Day, and I believe that what I ſaid is no
Riddle to you. The Jeſuits and their Friends ſet a great value on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the world, becauſe they forbear cutting the Proteſtants Throats,
as they did then. But, <hi>Mercileſs</hi> as you are, do you ere the leſs take away
their lives! You ſay you do not kill them, but do you not make them
pine to death with hunger and vexation? He who gives ſlow poiſon is
he leſs a poiſoner, than he who gives what is violent and quick, ſince
both of them deſtroy the life at laſt? Pardon this ſhort Tranſport (ſaid
our Friend) in good earneſt I cannot reſtrain my indignation, when I ſee
them uſe the utmoſt of cruelty, and yet would be looked on as patterns
of all moderation and meekneſs. Let me impart to you three Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which two of our Friends who are yet in <hi>France</hi> have written to
me ſince I came from <hi>Paris.</hi> I received the two firſt at <hi>Calis,</hi> before I got
into the Pacquet Boat; the laſt was delivered me laſt night after you went
away from my Chamber. You will there ſee with what Gentleneſs they
proceed in thoſe Countries. He thereupon read to me his Letters, and I

                     <p>WE are just upon the point of ſeeing that Reformation which
hath coſt ſo much labour and pains, and ſo much blood, come
to nothing in <hi>France.</hi> To know the condition of the Proteſtants in
the ſeveral Provinces of this Kingdom, you need but read what the
firſt Chriſtians ſuffered under the Reigns of the Emperors <hi>Nero,
Domitian, Trajan, Maximin, Diocleſian</hi> and ſuch like. There
are four Troops of Horſe in <hi>Poitou</hi> who live at free Quarter, upon
all of the Proteſtant Religion without any exception. When they
have pillaged the Houſes of them who will not go to Maſs, they tie
them to their Horſe Tails, and drag them thither by force. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
whom they have ſent thither, who is their moſt bitter Enemy,
hath his Witneſſes ready ſuborned, who accuſe whom they pleaſe, of
what Crimes they pleaſe, and after that cast the poor men into dark
Dungeons, beat them with Cudgels, and then paſs ſentence of death
to terrifie them; and afterwards under-hand, ſend others to try them
by fair means, to promiſe them that their mourning ſhall be turn'd
into joy, if they will but go to Maſs. Thoſe whom God gives the
grace to reſiſt, die in the Dungeon, through unſpeakable anguiſh.
Three Gentlemen of Quality who went about to confirm ſome of the
poor people in their Village, that began to waver, were preſently clapt
up, Flax put about their Necks, then ſet on fire, and ſo they were
ſcorch'd, till they ſaid they would renounce their Religion. There
would be no end if I ſhould relate all that is done. This you may be

continuance of the perſecution which is rais'd againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
in <hi>France,</hi> I ſhall acquaint you that they of <hi>Poitiers</hi> are
threat'ned with being made a Garriſon this Winter. I ſay they, the
Proteſtants: For none but they muſt quarter any of them. <hi>Monſieur
de Marillac</hi> gives himſelf up wholly to the making of Proſelytes. The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46344:16"/>
Deputies of <hi>Poitiers</hi> are now here to make complaint of the violences
they ſtill labour under. They offer, by a Petition which they have
preſented, at the coſt of their lives, if they are found guilty of any
Falſhood, or if they do not make out what they ſay. They ſet forth,
that by the Orders of <hi>Monſieur Marillac,</hi> the Proteſtants are dealt
with as declared Enemies; that their Goods and their Houſes are
plundered; their perſons aſſaulted; that the Soldiers are employed
as Executioners of theſe Outrages. That they are quartered upon
the Proteſtants only, that beſides the exceſſive expence they put them
to, they exact money of them with dreadful Oaths and Execrations.
They knock them down, they drag Women by the hair of the Head,
and Ropes about their Necks, they have put them to the torture
with Screws, by clapping their Fingers into a Vice, and ſo ſqueezing
them by degrees, they have bound aged Men, eighty years old, and
beaten them, and have miſuſed, before thir Eyes, their Children,
who came to comfort them: They hinder Handicrafts men from
working; they take from Labourers what they uſe for their Livelyhood;
they ſet their Goods openly to ſale, and they clap their Swords and
Piſtols to their Breaſts, who are not frighted with their other Uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
they drag them in Sheets into their Churches, they throw Holy
Water in their Faces, and then ſay they are Catholicks, and ſhall
be proceeded againſt as Relapſed, if they live otherwiſe. It is not
permitted to theſe miſerable perſons to complain; thoſe who would
have attempted it have been ſeiſed on, and the Priſons are full of
them. They are detained there without any Proceſs being made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46344:17"/>
him to inform himſelf as well as he could how they treated the
poor people in thoſe places he was to paſs through, that he might give
me a full Account. This is the Letter, dated the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
Old Style. I am now going out of <hi>Aulnix,</hi> where I meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Objects of Compaſſion. The Intendant of <hi>Rochefort,</hi>
which is <hi>Monſieur Du Muins,</hi> lays all waſte there. It is the
ſame perſon concerning whom at the <hi>Marquis de Segnelay</hi>'s we were
told ſo many pleaſant Stories laſt Winter at <hi>S. Germain.</hi> Do not
you remember that they talked much of a certain <hi>Picard,</hi> who owed all
his Fortune to his Wife, and whom the <hi>Marquis de Segnelay</hi> treats
always as the worſt of men? That's the Man, he is born to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
as much as ever man was, and his Employment hath increas'd
bis inſolence beyond meaſure. To this he hath added, to the Proteſtants
grief, all the barbarous zeal of Ignorance. And if the King would
let him do it, he would ſoon act over again the Tragedy of S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew.</hi>
About ten days ſince he went to a great Town in <hi>Aunix,</hi>
called <hi>Surgeres,</hi> accompanied with his Provoſt, and about forty Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
He began his Feats with a Proclamation that all the Huguenots
ſhould change their Religion, and upon their refuſal he quartered his
Troop upon thoſe poor people: he made them to live there at diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in an Enemies Country; he made their Goods to be thrown
into the Streets, and their Beds under the Horſes Feet. By his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Veſſels of Wine and Brandy were ſtaved, and their Horſe
Heels waſh'd with it; their Corn was ſold, or rather given away, for
a fourth part of what it was worth, and the ſame was done to all the
Tradeſmens Goods: Men, Women and Children were put to the
Torture, were dragged by force to the Popiſh Churches; and ſo great
Cruelty was uſed towards them that the greateſt part not being able
longer to indure the extremity of the pain, renounced their Religion.
By the ſame means they forced them to give it under their hands,
That they had abjured without conſtraint, and of their own free choice.
The Goods of thoſe who found means to eſcape, are ſentenced to be
ſold, and to be pillaged. Proud of ſo noble an Expedition, our good
man returns to <hi>Rochefort,</hi> the place of his ordinary abode, forbids
all the Proteſtants, who are there pretty numerous, to remove any
of their Goods out of the Town, under penalty of confiſcation of
what ſhould be ſeiſed, and corporal puniſhment over and above; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46344:17"/>
he commands them all to change their Religion in five days. This
was done by ſound of Trumpet, that no one might pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
The Term expires to morrow. After this he marched to
<hi>Mozé</hi> (it is another great Town in <hi>Aunix</hi>) where there is a very
fair Church of the Proteſtants, and a very able Miniſter, there he
ſet out the ſame Prohibitions, and the ſame Commands that he had at
<hi>Rochefort.</hi> Upon this a very worthy perſon of the place, and Elder
of the Church, named Mr. <hi>Jarry,</hi> addreſſed to him with a moſt
humble Remonſtrance; and this cruel and barbarous man made him
preſently to be clapt up in Irons. After this he quartered his Men
upon thoſe of the Proteſtant Religion, where he exerciſeth the ſame
violence which he did at <hi>Surgeres.</hi> Nevertheleſs hitherto no one
hath made Shipwrack of his Conſcience in this place. They ſuffer all
this cruel perſecution with an admirable conſtancy. God of his Mercy
ſupport them to the end. All the reſt of <hi>Aunix</hi> is in extreme conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There are likewiſe Prohibitions made at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> againſt the
ſhipping of any Goods. In ſo much that all they who flie away run
a great hazard of carrying away their lives only for a prey. <hi>Adieu.</hi>

too much to juſtifie the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants who forſake their Country,
from any ſuſpicion of impatience or wantonneſs. You ſee now what are
the <hi>Reaſonable Means</hi> that are uſed to convert them. Thoſe goodly

people to utmoſt Beggary; to make them die of Hunger, in my opinion,
a more cruel death than that by Fire or Sword, which in a moment ends
life and miſeries together; to lay upon them all ſorts of afflictions, to
take away their Churches, their Miniſters, their Goods, their Children,
their liberty of being born, of living, or of dying in peace, to drive
them from their Employments, their Honors, their Houſes, their native
Country; to knock them on the head, to drag them to the Maſs with
Ropes about their Necks, to impriſon them, to caſt them into Dungeons,
to give them the queſtion, put them to the Rack, make them die in the
midſt of torments, and that too without ſo much as any Formality of

Methinks they ſhould bluſh to death, who call thoſe Cruelties, which
have been executed upon innocent Sheep, Meekneſs; and that Rigor,
and <hi>the fury</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> which we have inflicted upon Tigers, who thirſted
after our Blood, and had ſworn the deſtruction of Church and State.
They plague and torment to death more than a million of peaceable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who deſire only the freedom of ſerving God according to his Word,
and the Laws of the Land, who cannot be accuſed of the leaſt ſhadow of
Conſpiracy, and who by preſerving that Illuſtrious Blood which now
reigns there, have done to <hi>France</hi> Services which deſerv'd, together with
the Edict of Pacification, the love, and the hearty thanks of all true
<hi>French</hi> Men. And we have put to death in a legal manner, it may be
twenty wretched perſons (the moſt of which had forfeited their lives
to the Law, for being found here) convinced by divers Witneſſes, who
were the greateſt part Papiſts, of having attempted againſt the Sacred
Life of our King, and the lives of millions of his faithful Subjects.
Surely they would have had us let them done their Work, let them have
rooted out that Northern Hereſie, which they were, as they aſſure us by
their own Letters,<note place="margin">Omahon S. Th. Mag. Diſputatio Apologetica de Jure Regni Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae pro Catholicis, n. 20.</note> in ſo great, and ſo near hopes of accompliſhing. But
we had not forgot the Maſſacre of <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein, by the confeſſion of
one of their own Doctors, who knew it very well, more than a hundred
and fifty thouſand of our Brethren, in the midſt of a profound peace,
without any provocation, by a moſt ſudden and barbarous Rebellion,
had their Throats cut by that ſort of Catholicks, whoſe fate they ſo much
bewail.</p>
               <p>Altho your Tranſport be very juſt, and I am very well pleaſed with it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46344:18"/>
ſaid our Friend to me, I muſt needs interrupt you; to bring you back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to our poor Proteſtants. What ſay you to their Condition? I ſay
(anſwered I) that there can be nothing more worthy compaſſion; and
that we muſt entirely forget all that we owe to the Communion of Saints,
if we open not our hearts, and receive them as our true Brethren. I will
be ſure to publiſh in all places what you have informed me, and will ſtir up
all perſons to expreſs in their favour all the Duties of Hoſpitality and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Charity. To the end (ſaid he to me) you may do it with a better
heart, at our next meeting, I will fully juſtifie them againſt all thoſe malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reports which are given out againſt their Loyalty and their Obedience
to the Higher Powers. Let us take for that all to morrow ſeven-night.
As you pleaſe, ſaid I, ſo we took leave one of another: and thus you have
an end of a long Letter, aſſuring you, that I ever ſhall be, Sir, Yours.</p>
