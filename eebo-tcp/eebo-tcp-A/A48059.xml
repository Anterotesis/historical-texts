            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>YE Scribling Fops, (cry mercy if I wrong ye)</l>
            <l>But without doubt there must be some among ye.</l>
            <l>Know that Fam'd <hi>Lacy,</hi> Ornament o'th' Stage,</l>
            <l>That Standard of true Comedy in our Age,</l>
            <l>Wrote this new Play:</l>
            <l>And if it takes not, all that we can say on't,</l>
            <l>Is, We have his Fiddle, not his Hands to play on't:</l>
            <l>Against our Interest, he to do you right,</l>
            <l>Your Foes the Poets has abus'd to night,</l>
            <l>And made us like rude Birds our Nest Besh—te.</l>
            <l>We know,</l>
            <l>If you wou'd write us Plays, they'd lose their ends;</l>
            <l>Kind Parties still would make your pains amends;</l>
            <l>For there's no Fop but has a World of Friends:</l>
            <l>Who will like <hi>City-Whigs</hi> help one another,</l>
            <l>And every noisy Fool cry up his Brother.</l>
            <l>No more then rack for Prologue or for Song,</l>
            <l>Such Trifles to dull Quality belong:</l>
            <l>Nor Lampoon Ladies, that your Virtues trust,</l>
            <l>That bask in the hot Malls Pulvillio dust:</l>
            <l>Whose low hung Fringes, with attractive Arts,</l>
            <l>Sweep heaps of Straws' mongst crowds of Lovers Hearts.</l>
            <l>Subjects like these will never get you Fame,</l>
            <l>Nor can you write, if this be all your aim,</l>
            <l>More than a Rogue can sing that sets a Psalm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:99545:3"/>But if (like Wits) you would the Town oblige,</l>
            <l>Write a good Comedy on some famed Siege,</l>
            <l>But not in Rhyme; and if to please you mean,</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Luxemberg</hi> be taken the first Scene.</l>
            <l>Yet now I think on't, choose another Story,</l>
            <l>Some Sparks that late went o'er to hunt for Glory,</l>
            <l>Have spoil'd that Iest, and ta'en the Town before ye.</l>
            <l>No wonder too, for who could stand their rage,</l>
            <l>Since they with <hi>Conningsmark</hi> broad Swords engage?</l>
            <l>I fancy you'll turn Butchers the next Age.</l>
            <l>For these new Weapons look that guard your Lives,</l>
            <l>Like bloudy <hi>Cousin Germans</hi> to their Knives.</l>
            <l>I'll put a Question t'ye, Pray does the Writer</l>
            <l>(As times go) get most credit, or the Fighter?</l>
            <l>Wit is applauded when with Fancy drest;</l>
            <l>But to be knock'd o'th' head's a cursed Iest:</l>
            <l>A Fate in which your forward Fool miscarries;</l>
            <l>No 'tis much better to lie sick at <hi>Paris</hi>:</l>
            <l>Where we can write what the <hi>French King</hi> intends,</l>
            <l>And storm a Town in Letters to our Friends.</l>
            <l>Another Inconvenience we must own,</l>
            <l>There's many a Fool is by a Bullet known,</l>
            <l>That once pass'd for a Wit of high renown.</l>
            <l>The proof of Sense lies hid in Safety here,</l>
            <l>But when the Skull is broke the Brains appear.</l>
            <l>Ah Sirs, if you to the rough Wars should follow,</l>
            <l>How many Pates (like mine) would be found hollow!</l>
            <l>Faith then take my advice, Stick to <hi>Apollo.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Write, and be studious in Dramatick Rules;</l>
            <l>For should our Poets sound your shallow Sculls,</l>
            <l>You were undone for Wits, and we for Fools.</l>

                     <speaker>La.</speaker>
                     <p>An easie thing for any man to be witty, or a Wit at my rate: for we that make the greatest bustle, the loudest noise, and are rudest to the women, are called Wits.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bo.</speaker>
                     <p>Than you conclude rudeness and ill manners to be the ingredients of wit: I see thou understand'st some wit.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, the wit of this age I do; for to be witty now, is to be more troublesom in a Playhouse, than a Butcher at a Beargarden: that's wit to tear womens cloaths and linnen off in the house: that's wit to see Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC"/>  for nothing, one Act in the Pit, another in a Box, a third in the Gallery, that's wit. And lastly, to cheat your Hackney Coachman, Link Boy, and your Whore, and give 'em nothing: O that's mighty wit!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aim.</speaker>

                     <speaker>La.</speaker>
                     <p>They go for Wits I assure you, Sir. When a poor Coachman has driven me all day, and I not knowing how to pay him, I have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC"/>  him drive to such a place, and there I tell him he must wait till I have supp'd; under that pretence I slip out at a back door, and there your Coachman's paid.</p>

                     <p>Indeed it startles me, pray ye give it a milder name: the word Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is enough to daunt a young beginner.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fi.</speaker>
                     <p>Fy, thou hast no mettle in thee; think of Honour, that will fright all Bugbears that awe the simple Conscience.</p>

                     <speaker>Sel.</speaker>
                     <p>I'd give the world to have thee steel'd, and wrought to her hard temper.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>I wou'd not have 'em murder'd, but they may be desir'd to take a journey into the other world.</p>

                     <speaker>Sel.</speaker>
                     <p>There can be no offence in that; a tender Zelot may allow of Murder clad in such mild words.</p>

                     <speaker>Fi.</speaker>
                     <p>A pretty equivocation the Devil has helpt us to, to embolden us to Murder.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sel.</speaker>
                     <p>Throw by your fears, or I'll throw by your lives: bloudy words suit best with bloudy deeds, therefore I'll have no other phrase but Murder, startle that dares.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Murder be it then; now I consider, Sister, 'tis very foolish to scruple at the word, when we so freely consent to the deed.</p>

                     <speaker>Fi.</speaker>
                     <p>Father, I must laugh a little; to tell you true, this cunning Baggage has but dissembled virtue all this while, on purpose to discover your inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sel.</speaker>
                     <p>Mine is to murder 'em without the least fright or start of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but it that were feign'd Virtue thou managed'st with such Saint-like zele, by Heaven I shall honour thee as the Metropolitan Hypocrite of all thy Sex.</p>

                     <p>And Sir, to shew you how little I value Virtue, their deaths already are contrived, and my faithful Servant has undertaken it.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus, Sir; my good honest Maid has a Lover, to whom she is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and being a Seaman has already hired a Ship, to spirit them away into the North of <hi>Norway,</hi> where they shall never more be seen or heard of.</p>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Instantly, we have already prepar'd our Cousins for a journey too; we told them you wou'd send them into <hi>France</hi> for better education, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Suitors shou'd be admitted.</p>

                     <p>And all this ready done; let mankind after this never deal in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, when there is a work the Devil cannot manage, a zelous woman shall have the honour of it. I have prepared for thee, my Jewel, the brave Lord <hi>Arminger,</hi> a man that has no stain to blast his better parts, but has a chrystal fame that all the world may see through.</p>

                     <p>O'tis true, you told me of a ceremony to enter or initiate him into the Order of Asshood.</p>

                     <p>Sir, the ceremony is great: the rule was among the ancient Poets, when a man took his degree, to hath in the Liquor of the Gods; but we modern Wits steep our Brains altogether in <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Pontack,</hi> and we find it does the business every whit as well.</p>

                     <p>The ceremony to a stranger will seem to be a gross abuse, however I assure you it is no more than what all men undergo that are bound Prentice to Poets.</p>

            <byline>Wrote and spoke by <hi>J. H.</hi> Com.</byline>
            <l>MEthinks (Right Worthy Friends) you seem to sit,</l>
            <l>As if you had all ta'en Physick in the Pit.</l>
            <l>When the Play's done, your jaded Fancies pall:</l>
            <l>After Enjoyment thus 'tis with us all.</l>
            <l>You are</l>
            <l>Meer Epicures in Thinking; and, in fine,</l>
            <l>As difficult to please in Plays as Wine:</l>
            <l>You've no true taste of either, judge at random,</l>
            <l>And cry, <hi>De gustibus non disputandum.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>One's for <hi>Vin d'Hermitage,</hi> Love's lofty inditing;</l>
            <l>Another <hi>Old Hoc,</hi> he a Style that's biting;</l>
            <l>Both hate <hi>Champaign,</hi> and Damn soft natural Writing.</l>
            <l>And some forsooth</l>
            <l>Love <hi>Rhenish Wine and Sugar,</hi> Plays in Meeter;</l>
            <l>Like dead Wine, swallowing Nonsense Rhimes make sweeter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>There's one's for a <hi>Cup of Nants,</hi> and he 'tis odds,</l>
            <l>Like old <hi>Buffoon,</hi> loves Plays that swinge the Gods.</l>
            <l>True English Topers <hi>Racy Sack</hi> ne'er fail;</l>
            <l>With such <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi>'s humming Plays prevail.</l>
            <l>Whilest some at Tricks and Grimace onely fleer;</l>
            <l>To such must noisy frothy Farce appear;</l>
            <l>These new Wits relish Small Smart Bottle Beer.</l>
            <l>French Gouts, that mingle Water with their Wine,</l>
            <l>Cry, <hi>Ah de French Song, Gosoun dat is ver' fine</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Who never drink without a relishing Bit;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Scapin</hi> methinks such sickly Tastes might hit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:99545:31"/>Where w' entertain each squeamish nicer Palat</l>
            <l>With Sawce of Dances, and with Songs for Salad.</l>
            <l>Since then 'tis so hard to please (with choicest Dyet)</l>
            <l>Our Guests, wh'm Wit and Sense do dayly riot:</l>
            <l>Since Wit is damn'd by those whom Wits we call;</l>
            <l>As Love that stands by Love, by Love does fall;</l>
            <l>When Fools both good and bad (like Whores) swallow all</l>
            <l>"I wish for your sakes the Sham Wits o'th' Nation</l>
            <l>"Would take to some honest, some thriving Vocation.</l>
            <l>"The Wit of our Feet, you see every Night,</l>
            <l>"Says more to our purpose than all you can write:</l>
            <l>"Since things are thus carried, a Wit's such a Tool,</l>
            <l>"He that makes the best Plays, does but best play the Fool.</l>
            <l>A Dreaded Fool's your Bully,</l>
            <l>A Wealthy Fool's your Cit;</l>
            <l>A Contented Fool's your Cully,</l>
            <l>But your Fool of Fool's your Wit.</l>
            <l>They all Fool Cit of's Wife,</l>
            <l>He fools them of their Pelf;</l>
            <l>But your Wit's so damn'd a Fool,</l>
            <l>He onely Fools himself.</l>
            <l>O Wits, then face about to Sense! Alas,</l>
            <l>I know it by my self a Wit's an Ass.</l>
            <l>For (like you) in my time</l>
            <l>I've been Foolish in Rhime;</l>
            <l>But now so repent the Nonsensical Crime:</l>
            <l>I speak it in Tears, which from me may seem odly,</l>
            <l>Henceforth I'll grow wiser; Damn Wit, I'll be Godly:</l>
            <l>That when by new Grace I have wip'd off old Stains,</l>
            <l>In time I may pass, not for Count, but Sir <hi>Haynes.</hi>
