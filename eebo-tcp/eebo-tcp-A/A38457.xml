            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This afternoone came out a Declaration of ſeven ſheets of paper, printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> by his Majeſties command, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the late Obſervations upon his Majeſties former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, but nothing in it to any great purpoſe, but contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Kings prerogative with the power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament.</p>

This day alſo it was aſſured from <hi>Exceſter,</hi> that Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> being well beaten with his Cavaliers from that City, was retir'd againe with Sir <hi>Baevil Greenvill</hi> into <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Divers Gavaliers were this day brought up to <hi>Nawgate,</hi> and other priſons, that were taken roming in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> by ſome of his Excellence the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his forces. It was credibly reported, that the Earle of <hi>Cumbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had proffered to deliver up the City to Sir <hi>Edw. Rhudes</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hotham</hi> conditionally he and his Cavaliers might depart with drums beating and flying colours; but his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition would not be accepted, it proceeding out of meere neceſſity.</p>

It was reported that the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> have had a great victory over Sir <hi>Philim O-Neale</hi> the arch Rebell, and that <hi>Rori Mac-Guire</hi> is there priſoner. It was alſo reported, that the plate which the City of <hi>Excester</hi> proffered to lend the Parliament on the publique faith, is with a ſufficient guard comming up to <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and is credibly, believ'd, that the good Cities of <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> in an emulous imitation of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> will alſo lend on the ſame terms good ſtore of plate to the Common-welth. Certainly it was affirmed this day, that ſome ſhips laden with ammunition were taken in the narrow ſeas, and are at <hi>Margate</hi> to come up the River.</p>
