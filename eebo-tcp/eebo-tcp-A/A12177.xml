         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>he former part of it,
is to discover to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and in them, to us
all; how to carry our
selves to others in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of indifferency. As there is difference
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17798:4"/>
of things in the world, some good, some
ill, and some of a middle nature; so there
are different affections in men, about these
things of a middle nature, some are strong,
and they are prone to despise the weaker;
for they know their liberty. Some more
weak, and they are prone to censure, and
complain of them that be strong: as all
weaknesse is full of impatience. Thus it
was with the <hi>Romans,</hi> the strong despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the weaker, as ignorant; the weaker
censured, and in their hearts condemned
the strong, as too adventurous</p>
            <p>The Apostle sheweth here an excellent
peaceable spirit, hating contention, as an
evill thing in a Church. In a Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily, when
children fall together by the eares, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taketh up the quarrell, by beating
them both, So in a Church while people
fall a contending, and breaking the bonds
of love, God taketh them in hand. And
therefore the Apostle taketh them off from
this danger, of despising one another; and
presseth it by a reason in the fourth Verse
drawn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:17798:4"/>First, from their relations. Who art
thou that judgest another mans servant?</p>
            <p>Secondly, from their aimes. They doe
it both out of religious respects. Hee that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, he that eateth
not, eateth not to the Lord; hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
not a day, regardeth it not to the
Lord; he that doth it, doth it to the Lord.
And therfore if both have a Religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
censure may be forborn.</p>
            <p>There is that force in a good aime, that
in some actions of an indifferent nature,
they may be done, or not be done, &amp; God
may beare with both, though hee allow
not of eithers carelesness in searching out
the truth; Till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime of growth, God
beareth with them, so their aimes be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
their fault being simple ignorance,
not malicious pertinacy. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> saw
the hypocriticall aimes of the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
in things of indifferent natures, he would
not yield a whit to them. But the defect of
the <hi>Romans</hi> was in their knowledge, not
in their wils: they did it with respect to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17798:5"/>
the Lord. And therefore as in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 18.
God is said <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (an excellent word)
to beare with their manners in the VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
dispencing with many things, as
putting away of wives, &amp;c. not that hee
liked that course, but hee would set up a
meek kinde of government, not taking
advantage to cast them off. So he dealt
with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Now shall God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,
and indulgent, and man severe?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the text you have a generall reason,
why they that did it, or did it not, did, or
did it not, to the Lord. For none liveth to
himselfe, or dieth to himselfe, but whether
we live or die, we are the Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In this reason here is first a generall
negative None of us liveth to himselfe,
none of us dieth to himselfe, a figurative
speech, and Rhetoricall expression, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and ending alike.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a generall affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
when hee hath taken them off from
themselves, hee assigneth them to a true
Lord. <hi>Whether we live, we live to the Lord
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17798:5"/>
whether wee die, wee die to the Lord.</hi> And
this is set downe with a disjunction, wee
neither live to our selves, nor die to our
selves.</p>
            <p>And, thirdly, a generall ground that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
wrappeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p all, <hi>Whether we live or die, we
are the Lords.</hi> And therfore in reason wee
should live to him, and die to him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there is the ground of all, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
that, that followeth, <hi>For to this end Christ
died, and rose againe, that bee might be Lord
of life and death.</hi> So here is reason upon
reason, and ground upon ground.</p>
            <p>The summe of all is,<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> wee cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conclude of life or death: For wee
live but for a while, and when wee have
acted our part upon the Stage, we die, and
go to another world. Of life and death we
can make no reckoning. Assoone as wee
begin to live, we begin to die. For some
part of our life is taken away daily, as it is
with sum, the more you take away, the
lesse remayneth. But certaine it is, living
and dying, <hi>we are the Lords.</hi> VVee ought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17798:6"/>
therfore to have a conjunctive considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I now live, yet that is not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
but sure I am, <hi>Whether I live or die, I
am the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He riseth from a generall to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
which may teach us this point of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">The first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or doctrine.</note> that to have good generall truths
is an excellent point of wisdome, for they
have affluence into all particulars. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of principles is the ground of
prudence for direction in particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
There is no art, but hath some generall
maxims, as in Law, in Physick, and in the
Mathematicks. There be canons or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(call them what you will) that have
influence into all particulars. So Religion
hath general rules, which should be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
in memory at all times; that on all
occasions wee may see how particulars
spring from, and agree to the generals.
Therefore wee should labour to treasure up
in our memory good principles, for men
worke in all things according to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17798:6"/>
principles. If they have good principles,
or general truths, they work answerably.
And the reason of any errour in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
life, is from false principles.</p>
            <p>Men of a bad conscience, whose <hi>synte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resis</hi>
(being the part of the soul that preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
principles) is corrupt, they think they
do God good service in killing of men,
from an abominable principle. As in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
which is grounded upon false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
making mens traditions a rule of
faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is good to have generall
true grounds: Marke how the Scripture
is frequent this way. What an excellent
generall rule is that of Christ? <hi>Seeke the
kingdome of God and his righteousnesse, and
all other things shall be cast upon you.</hi> Carry
that along, and what a light doth it give
into all our actions. VVhat need wee by
indirect courses seeke to bee great in the
world, if we take Christs method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Again, our Saviour Christ in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
speech delivered it, a generall rule,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17798:7"/>
               <hi>It is better to give, then to receive.</hi> VVhich
containeth a direction to men to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and liberall, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ordinary
course was so, Knowing therfore the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the Lord, wee perswade men, &amp;c.
VVhat an influence hath this into our
conversations, That I must do, as I must
give account at the day of judgment. And
so what use made hee of the glorious state
to come in that house, <hi>and building of
God, not made with hands, not seen but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
onely by faith.</hi> It inabled him to do,
and suffer all things that became a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to do and suffer. If a man have that
principle, and mindeth it, <hi>that all things
worke together for the best, to them that love
God,</hi> what can discourage him? he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the issue all sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>l be for the best, and
God will not fail him, nor forsake him in
his way, <hi>but giveth his Angels<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> charge over
him</hi> So Christs direction. One thing is
necessary, how may it rectifie us? when
we trouble our selves about many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies.
If these generalists were always
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17798:7"/>
present, upon sollicitations to sin, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort.
It shall goe well with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and it shall not go well with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
if wee take good courses it shall be
well, if ill courses, sinne will be bitter: it
would be a marvailous helpe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in all particulars of our lives.</p>
            <p>The second general observation is this.<note place="margin">The second generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</note>
That as we must get good principles, laid
up in store upon all occasions; so we must
specially have gracious aimes. Men are as
their aimes are; Noble spirits have noble
aimes: Christians are of an higher ranke
then ordinary men, and therfore they have
higher aimes. Religion giveth command
to all other particulars, and prescribeth to
them a general end; it taketh a man off
from a false end, and pitcheth him upon a
true end. It taketh him from himselfe, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

above God; and above Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and above
Heaven and Happinesse, and telleth him
that the true end of all, is to live to Christ,
and that on good grounds, for we are his,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17798:8"/>
and his by good title, <hi>hee died for us, that
he might be Lord both of quick and dead.</hi> As
in state Policy, those that are Governours
in a state, they prescribe ends of Trades,
and reduce them to a serviceablenesse of
state. If they finde any thing hurtful, they
look to it, as it stands in reference to the
common good: So Religion considereth
of all particulars as they have reference
to Christ, and the mayn end, taking us off
from false ends, and prescribing the last,
and best end, and directing all particulars
to that end. But wee shall see this better in
the unfolding of the words.</p>
            <p>The first thing hee begins in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is, to take us off from false ends, <hi>None of
us liveth to himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, to live to our selves, is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be taken in a civil sense. A man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to himself, when he liveth privatly,
or retiredly, <hi>Benè vixit, qui bonè latuit.</hi> So
a man may do in some things, especially
in times of persecution, but this ordinarily
is not good. A man is a creature for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17798:8"/>
&amp; God hath fitted him for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
by speech &amp; other endowm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts,
that there may be preserved a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints. But because a retired life is
sometimes good, it is not here maynly ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at.</p>
            <p>Again, secondly, VVe live to our selves,
when we minde our selves altogether, and
not one another. VVhen we have more
respect to our selves, then to God, or to
our Christian brother. And this is even
contrary to nature, wee see in nature, that
a particular nature wil in some cases yield
to a general, and thwart it self. The fire is
a light body, and in the natural motion of
it, mounteth upward, yet this body wil go
downwards to preserve whole the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal
nature from a <hi>vacuum</hi> from empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that the fulnesse and solidity in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may not be disturbed. And we see hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
bodies goe upward for the same end.
As a man wil venture the hand to save
his head, and to save his body; so it should
be in society and government, particular
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17798:9"/>
men should venture themselves for the
Prince or State, for the head or for the
bodie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But in a more large and religious sense.
To live to a mans self is, to make himselfe
his last end; his <hi>Terminus reductivus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all to himself: and make <hi>Religion</hi> &amp;
every thing serviceable to himself. When
a man will serve himself of God for base
ends, because his service will advance
him. As the <hi>Sichemites</hi> were circumcised
for <hi>Dinah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to die to our selves is much like
it.</p>
            <p>A man dyeth to himselfe, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
himself in death, and is regarded
much of no body else. Persons that have
an absolute being of themselves, that have
no kindred, not much acquaintance, or
have been little fruitful in their lives, die
to themselves in a civil sense. That is, no
man mourneth for them, saying, <hi>Ah my
brother,</hi> They were of little use in their
lives, and so little mist in their deaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:17798:9"/>And usually they that live thus to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they die to themselves, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
little lamented. Onely this often
times, they do most good when they die,
as we say of Swine, <hi>They are never good till
dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is meant in a theological higher
sence, <hi>No Christian dieth to himselfe,</hi> that
is dieth unregarded of God, and of good
men. As hee liveth not to himselfe but to
Christ, so he dieth not to himselfe, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to the Lord is the death of all his
Saints.</hi> He is not <hi>Despotos,</hi> without Lord
and Master, but <hi>whether he liveth or dieth
he is the Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> So much for the negative

VVee doe not serve a dead Master, but
one that taketh notice of us, <hi>living and

            </p>
            <p>So <hi>to die to the Lord,</hi> is to acknowledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

so the words are a <hi>privilege,</hi> as well as a

<hi>Whether wee live or die, wee are the Lords.</hi>
Thus I have unfolded the text.</p>
            <p>Hee first promiseth the general nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.

thought to have a secured happines from

therfore would not depend upon God to

God. God hath highest place in our heart,
by order of Creation, and according to the
degrees of excellency in things, should our
esteeme of them be, every thing being
beautifull in his place. But where God is
put down, (as he is in all men, till they be
in Christ) something <hi>self-love</hi> sets up in
the heart above God. Hence commeth
the necessity of this method of taking us
off from our selves, before wee can live to
Christ, because <hi>self-love</hi> is an impediment,
and blocke in the way betweene us and

Christ begins the Gospel with self-denial.

self. Now we have not beings from our
selves, but from God; he giveth us beings,
and a being in that ranke of Creatures,
wherin we are. Therfore our <hi>naturall self</hi>
must be to a higher end. A man is not the
end of things, there is another end then
he; and that is God, who is of himselfe, &amp;
hath made all other things for himselfe.</p>
            <p>And therfore riches and honours, and

them, can fill up the understanding, no
good in them, can fill up the will. But the
understanding can pierce through them.
And the will in rellishing, and tasting the
good of them, can looke on them as cast
commodities. It can quickly suck out all
the sweet that is in them. Therfore they
cannot be a mans end: because hee hath
larger parts then they can fill.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That, that must be mans end, must be

is nothing in the VVorld that hath more

Honour can doe something, but not all

Knowledge is the best thing, but that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

            <p>And much lesse must we live to <hi>sinfull

Therefore when a proud vindictive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Absolute deniall is required here.</p>
            <p>Of other things,<note place="margin">Deniall for Christ.</note> a deniall is required
onely as they stand in competition with
Christ. In that case, a man must sacrifice <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi>

            <p>He having taken us off from our selves,
assigneth us to a true Lord. <hi>Wee live to the
Lord, and die to the Lord.</hi> It had not beene
enough to say, <hi>Wee ought not to live to our

whom we must live to, and die to. For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

something better. A man wil not part

Therefore he sheweth where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
our selves: namely, upon Christ,
who hath care of us both in life and

            <p>This is to be laid down for a ground;<note place="margin">Our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Christ is better then in our selves.</note>
had we not a better being in <hi>Christ,</hi> then in

Christ: though it be to the losse of <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall self,</hi>

yet it is our advantage. It is <hi>Mercatorium,</hi>
not a losse, but a trading. VVee have a

Though God should not make it up in
this world, in the same kinde: yet in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
there be all things better then in the
world. If we lose honour here, wee have

honour from God. If wee lose riches,<note place="margin">All our losse is made up in Cheist.</note> wee
have them made up in grace here, in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

it in the inlargment of a good conscience.
If wee lose friends, wee get a God for a

If we lose life, wee are put into possession
of eternal life, and therfore wee need not
stand at the bargain. Wee have a better

Sea; for there it is in its proper element. A
Christian is not lost, when he loseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

together of divine truths. They following
one another by a necessity of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence.
As from the body of the Sunne, there is a
naturall issue of beames. And as in
plants derivation from the root into the
branch, so there is from Christ into all
truths. Grant him to be the <hi>second Adam,</hi>
and grant him Lord of the Living, and of
the Dead, and it will follow, wee ought to
live to him. If we grant, we ought to live
to Christ, then wee must grant, wee ought
<hi>not</hi> to live to our selves. For wee ought to
live to <hi>Christ.</hi> Why to Christ? because hee
is Lord both of life and death. Why is
he Lord? because hee hath purchased
it by his bloud. How doe wee know
hee hath purchased it by his death sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily?
because hee is risen againe,
and sitteth at the right hand of God to
make all good for us. Things are best to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17798:17"/>
us, when they are digested and made
our own, by the presence of good princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
But here is the mischief. Sin is ready,
and good principles are not ingraffed into
us; but if divine truths were as neere as
corruption is, then wee could withstand,
and repell all temptations.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Travellers</hi> have the end of their
journy in their thoughts habitually,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though
not actually, for every step they take is in
vertue of their end. So wee should consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that we are all <hi>Travellers</hi> in the way to
Heaven, and every step of our life should
be to that end.</p>
            <p>The ignorance of this maketh the life
of most men, to be but a digression from
the mayne. As if they were brought into
the world, onely to satisfie base lusts, and
to seek themselves, to serve Satan and sin,
the professed enemies of God, which are
not onely digressions, but motives to hell,
and eternall destruction. VVhat a pitifull
thing is it, that Creatures should come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>Good reason it is wee should live to
Christ, acknowledge him in all our ways,
live answerable to our knowledge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe

and seek his glory in all things; that wee
may make Christ known in the VVorld.

Men will be turned upside down, rather

this provoke God? Shall a piece of earth
strive against him? and will not hee break
it to powder? Surely God will set us as a
mark to shoot at, and will triumph and
get himselfe victory and glory over those
creatures, that will have their wils. Hell is
fit for such, God will be sure to have his

be swallowed up in the love of Christ.
Certainly, there is never better finding of
our selves, then when wee are thus lost.
And therfore I beseech you, whatsoever
our corruptions have been heretofore; let
us now know it is heavenly wisdome to
seeke Christs glory in the use of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

            <p>Surely, we have all been baptized, and
what is our baptisme, but the renouncing
of the world, the flesh and the Devit. Our
life is for nothing, but to live unto God.
And having entred into covenant in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
<hi>in the name of the Father, Sonne, and
holy Ghost,</hi> that wee intend seriously to lead
a new life. Wee must not trifle with God,
he wil not be dallied with. It is not onely
sufficient that we have spent our precious

time amisse, but more then sufficient: For
time wil come, if we belong to Christ, in
which wee shal lament for spending our
time in the pursuite of our owne vanities.</p>
            <p>For if wee live according to our owne

Wee are but traitors fighting under his
Banner. And how can wee give account
at the day of judgment of our lives, that
have been nothing else but a constant ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for Christs enemies under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Religion.</hi> This would seriously be
thought upon.</p>
            <p>Therfore, as wee know a great deale,
and are beholding to God for living in
times, and places where there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the truth revealed, so wee ought
to make it our life and course to honour
him, to be vigorous in his service, and to
stirre up the grace of God in us, to awaken
our selves, and to live to Christ, and to
put this <hi>quaere</hi> to our soules; whom doe I

            <p>

His carriage to Christ is, to live to
him, and die to him. And for this end he
taketh this course, to search out himselfe,
what is unsound, and corrupt in him; and
when hee hath found himself, then he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth
himselfe, and judgeth himselfe.
And having found out corruption in his
heart, he not onely loatheth it, but cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
it, and this is the course that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
taketh with himself, in the searching

               </gap>iscovery of his sins.</p>
            <p>And this being done, hee setteth up
Christ in the place of selfe, (which ruleth
in all men, till they be Christians indeed,
eyther by way of admission, or covenant.)
But when Grace hath once taken place in
the heart, then the soule begins to live to
Christ; and that conscionably, intyrely,
and uniformly; consulting with all things
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17798:24"/>
how to helpe, and further that life. Other
men consult how they may keepe their
honours and reputations in the VVorld.
But a <hi>Christian</hi> having other aymes, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

how to be better, more and more, how to
get into <hi>Christ,</hi> and how to grow up in
him; knowing that by living to Christ
here, he shall live with him for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
This is the course of a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

               <q>None of us liveth to himself, and none of us

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have heard from the
<hi>Apostles</hi> generall nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that selfe must be
removed out of the way,
before we can live, or
die to Christ. <hi>Selfe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
will come in every thing till the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

               <hi>Esau</hi> that came first out of the wombe, it
will appeare first in all consultations. And
therfore it is the method of our blessed
Saviour. <hi>Whosoever will be my Disciple, let
him deny himselfe, and take up my crosse.</hi> And
it wil be easie so to doe, when we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
our selves.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Apostles</hi> general affirmative
wee have shewed that to live to the Lord,<note place="margin">To live to Christ is to seeke his ho. nour in all things.</note>
is to acknowledge our selves to be his, &amp;
him to be ours, and answerably to doe
him service; to resigne up our selves to
him, to seeke his glory and honour, and
credit in all things, and to be wel perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that hee wil stick to us. So that it is a
comfort, as wel as a duty.</p>
            <p>To die to the Lord, is to be willing
to give up our selves to him, when the
time commeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and to submit to him for
the manner of our death, whether hee will
call us home to himselfe by a quiet, or
troublesome death, by a bloudy or dry
death, with confidence that he wil receive
our soules.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:17798:26"/>That we may be directed to pitch upon
a right end. VVe may know by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of nature.<note place="margin">A man is neither for, or to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note>
A man is not for himself,
and from the order that God hath placed
him in: all things below are for him, but
he is for somthing above himself: he is not
of himselfe, and therfore not to himselfe.
God onely is of himself, by himself, and to
himselfe. Every thing under God is of
God, and by God, and therfore to God.
As Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,<note place="margin">The heart is not quiet till it resteth in God its Centre.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast made us
for thee, and our hearts rest not till wee come
to thee. As the Rivers never r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselves into the Ocean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being not his owne end, it is his
wisdome and understanding to look prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
to that which is his last and best,
and mayn end which is GOD and Vnion,
and Communion with God in Christ,
who is God in our nature; God-man, the
best of all, and therfore it is fit hee should
be the last. Hee communicateth all good
to them, that be his, and preserveth all the
good he communicateth. Hee is for ever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17798:26"/>
with them, and cannot faile to doe them
good, as long as hee fails not to be good.
Hee is the originall caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
cause, and the maynt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yning
cause of all good.</p>
            <p>Now it is the nature of the utmost, and
farthest end to stirre up to every action,
leading to that end; for every deliberate
rationall action that is done with adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
and observation and is not an
action of fancy, or common nature, must
fall under the consideration of an end; or
else we cannot give account for it, as wee
must for every word, desire, and thought.</p>
            <p>Now the end stirreth us up to all means
leading to that end, either immediatly as
they are the services of God properly, or
else remotely. As things that help reason,
and furtherances therunto, as the <hi>Apostle
willeth that whether wee eat or drink,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 31.</note> 
               <hi>or
whatsoever wee doe,</hi> all should be done to
the glory of God because these mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn
us in health, and strength, and that
health, and strength inable us to Gods
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17798:27"/>
service. And in this sence every action, a
Christian doth, is a service of God, for the
end doth advance it and rayse it above it
selfe: and make it spirituall, as recreation
to cheere him to diligence in his calling,<note place="margin">God looks not at parts but holinesse in duties.</note>
the serving of his brother, and the like.
Some actions are holy in the stuffe, and
matter of them, others are such for the end
to which they are directed, for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
action becomes holy, if an holy end
be put upon it.</p>
            <p>And therfore the actions of the second
Table, are the service of God, as well as
the first, as they doe all agree in the end.
No man violateth a Magistrate in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table, but he wrongeth God in the
first. No man stealeth or committeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
or disgraceth his neighbour by
false witnesse, which is prohibited in the
second, but it is for want of fear of God
commanded in the first.</p>
            <p>Duties of the second, rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
are in vertue of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the first. When they are done, not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17798:27"/>
onely from humane and lower grounds,
as things good in themselves, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God and <hi>Christ</hi> have commanded
them, and that is included in the generall
words <hi>of living to the Lord,</hi> for <hi>to live</hi> is
comprehensive, and includeth all our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
from the beginning to the end, and
closing up of our days. Whatsoever acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
fall within the term of life, ought to
be referr'd to God as the last end.</p>
            <p>The Reason is <hi>Christ</hi> hath redeemed,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note>
our persons, and our times, and all that
we are, or have, or can do, all our ability,
our whole <hi>posse, is Christ's,</hi> and not our
own. I must be fill'd up with actions sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>Christ,</hi> therefore if I could doe a
thousand times more then I do, it were all
due to him, my self, my time, my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
my <hi>calling,</hi> and all are his.</p>
            <p>Againe, as the end stirs up to actions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
all kinds, so it prescribeth a measure to
those actions to doethem, so farre as shall
be advantagious to that end. As hee that
hath a race to runne, will measure his dyet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17798:28"/>
suitable to that end. So hee that hath an
ayme <hi>to live to Christ,</hi> will use all things
here as may serve that turne. Hee will use
the world, as if he used it not, will buy as
if hee possessed not, will marry, as if hee
married not. Not that he will be slight, or
superficiall in these things. But he will do
them no further then may be advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the enjoying of <hi>Christ</hi> here, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
as he can, and for ever hereafter.</p>
            <p>Indeed no man can set measures to his
desire of happinesse, that being a vast O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean:
his mayn end cannot be desired too
much. For as it is his good and happines,
it is larger then himself, yea his thoughts,
and desires are too short to reach it. But
though a man desires not health too
much, yet hee may desire too much phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.<note place="margin">Christians aimes end in Christ.</note>
The measure must be in our pursuite
of inferiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things, because therin we are
apt to exceed. And that advantage a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
hath in setting a right end. Hee will
not be drowned in the world, nor live to
recreations, but to a farther ayme, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17798:28"/>
which prescribes a measure and duration
to all things else.</p>
            <p>The end likewise maketh every thing
that tendeth to the end <hi>lovely.</hi> It maketh
the Crosse lovely, for by it we grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and get more in large communion
with <hi>Christ.</hi> Welcome is poverty or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
or whatsoever that maketh a man
live more to <hi>Christ,</hi> and die to himselfe.
Men call for Physick,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though in it self di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastfull,
as it is in order to health, an end,
which we desire without end. So it is the
disposition of a gracious soule, it <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
himself on him, communicated his
gracious <hi>spirit,</hi> peace of conscience, joy in
the holy Ghost, increase of the Image of
God. Let God lay upon us what he will,
yet it will appeare lovely.</p>
            <p>It prescribeth likewise a right order to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
every duty, for as the end sets one thing
above another. So a wiseman that looketh
to his best end, will doe the mayne work
first, and otherthings in the second place,
according to our Saviours counsell. <hi>Seeke first
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17798:29"/>
seek the kingdome of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> 
               <hi>and all other things shall be cast upon
you.</hi> Some indeed love to be all in by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
and in the mean time neglect
and slight the mayn. But our care should
be so to use the world, that we may not lose
<hi>Christ,</hi> or communion with him in better
things. So to look to things temporall, as
that wee lose not things eternall. For as
things are in themselves, so they should
be to us. Now as some thing is better
then another, so wee should conceive of
them, and affect them as better, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and labour to do them before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as deserving the first place. And that is
the reason the <hi>Saints</hi> have so prized &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
communion with God &amp; <hi>Christ,
one thing I de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 4.</note> That is,

               <hi>saith Christ,</hi> other

have communion with God, is the mayn
thing necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vse.</note> Let us therefore often consider of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17798:29"/>
end of our life in this world. And take
shame to our selves, that wee have let so
much water run besides the Mill. That
wee have let so much precious time and
strength, and dear advantages be lost, too
much strength hath beene spent in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of sin and our base lusts which wee
can give no account of. How many scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
blasphemous words are many
guilty of, which help onely to advantage
their destruction, if God be not mercifull.</p>
            <p>Now a little to shew the guise of the
world, and the difference of it from the
actions of Gods children, for these words
imploy a restraint to Gods people, as well
as an extension.</p>
            <p>The Christians whole life is onely to
<hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note> but what is the life of a man out
of <hi>Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His first aimes being corrupt,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>God is not
in all his thoughts</hi> (as the <hi>Psalmist speakes</hi>)
neither to have communion with him
here in grace, nor in glory hereafter.
Therefore whatsoever good hee doth, a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17798:30"/>
false end poysoneth it. If a man misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of a thing be from a false princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he misunderstands it grosly. As if an
house be built upon a weake foundation,
such is all the fabrick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: though otherwise
never so costly, if the principles be naught,
the conclusions drawn from thence must
needs be naught also,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As in Physick if the
first concoction be naught, the second can
never be good. So if a mans ends are
nought, if hee seek himself, or doth things
onely from forreigne motives out of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of conscience, or for vain glory, or to
be seen of men, his corrupt ayme spoyleth
all his actions;<note place="margin">Selfe ends hindreth dutie.</note> yea, hee reduceth <hi>Religion</hi>
to himselfe, because he will enjoy his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
the better, hee wil act some part of
<hi>Religion,</hi> lest conscience should bark, and
clamour against him. This <hi>self will</hi> mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Religion,</hi> and restrain it to such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as may stand with his lusts and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
customes.</p>
            <p>If he loveth others it is in order to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
because he hath use of them, as they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17798:30"/>
comply with him in wicked courses, and
so help to bear him out the better.</p>
            <p>And if any man stands in the wayes of
his ends of honour, or riches, he removeth
them by disgrace, though it amounteth to
slandering, as undermyning, and rising by
others ruines, because <hi>selfe</hi> his Idoll, and
mayn end must not be crossed. He desireth
to be some body in the flesh, all things
must be measured by that; yea, <hi>Religion</hi>
and acquaintaince, and all, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stands in the way, it cryeth downe
with them, but however it killeth them
in the esteeme of others, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
might be thought something, and
thus all is turned cleane contrary, upside
down.</p>
            <p>But a gracious mans end and ayme is
to get out of himselfe, and his corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to order all his actions in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to that and all his acquaintance, and
communion with others, as may help his
communion with God. And whatsoever
is an impediment to that, he laboureth to
remove.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:17798:31"/>But to give you some directions, how
to live not to our selves, but to live and
die to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, we must have a spirituall life from
him, for <hi>life is but the issue of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must live by faith, from union with
<hi>Christ</hi> by faith, and then live to <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And againe, wee must do it constantly,
and uniformly, no part of our lives must
be alienated from <hi>Christ,</hi> all must be done
in order to him, even our recreations must
have some good aymes in them.</p>
            <p>Now do but consider wee are his,<note place="margin">Motives.</note> wee
are not our own but his, and therfore wee
ought to live to him, bringing in all our
strength, all our advantages, our callings,
that we may do service to him in our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
wee are redeemed even from our
selves. A world of people thinke they be
redeemed to live as they list. But because
God is mercifull, and <hi>Christ</hi> a Saviour,
may you therfore live like libertines? No,
you are redeemed from your selves, not to
your selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:17798:31"/>And to former rules delivered let me
adde, that <hi>this living to Christ,</hi> (though
naturally we count it bondage, because it
is the acknowledging of a superiour) is
the most perfect liberty, <hi>Deo servire, est
regnare.</hi> For he that serveth that which is
better and larger then himselfe, that hath
more goodnesse and ability then himselfe,
hee doth advance himselfe by his service,
and freeth himselfe from the service of all
inferiours. For the more dependant any
man is on CHRIST in his service,
and in expectation of reward from
him, the more independant is hee, upon
the VVorld. And indeed who is free
in his thoughts, and desires from base in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
to the creature, but hee that
sets up <hi>Christ</hi> highest in his soule. And suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
him to prescribe rules to him in his
life, which is freer in the world, then they
that have hearts freed from overmuch
love of earthly things, overmuch feare of
earthly things, overmuch delight in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. Hee useth them as helps to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17798:32"/>
mayne, but is not ingaged, or inthralled
to any, <hi>Quanto subjectior, tanto liberior.</hi>
The more subject, the more free, is Saint
<hi>Augustines</hi> rule. And it is undoubtedly so,
you shal finde by experience that the soul
is never at a more gracious liberty, then
when <hi>Christ</hi> is all in all. Wee see it in the
example of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when once he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in <hi>Christ,</hi> presently, <hi>Halfe my goods I
give to the poore.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that was
all for the world and vain glory, can say
now, <hi>My life is not deare to me, so I may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
my course with joy. In comparison of
Christ all is dounge.</hi> VVhen <hi>Moses</hi> had seen
God that was invisible, hee was freed
from all base dependance on the favour of
<hi>Pharaob:</hi> nay, he esteemed the reproches
of <hi>Christ,</hi> better then all the riches of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
And that makes mens stomacks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to rise against <hi>Christians,</hi> because
they be not men to serve times and turns,
they will not prostitute their <hi>consciences</hi>
and <hi>Religion</hi> for any mans pleasure, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
other men, though naturally never so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17798:32"/>
stout and strong in parts, yet having base
aymes, and hearts fastned to the world,
will debase their very natures. And when
their end commeth in competition with
honesty, they love it more then goodnes.
As <hi>Christ</hi> telleth the <hi>Pharisies,</hi> You <hi>cannot
believe,</hi> that seek honour one of another.</p>
            <p>This is it, that maketh a <hi>Christian</hi> better
then his neighbour, because he hath a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ayme. All other men have narrow
spirits, whose hearts are not filled, with
the inlarging spirit of grace, and of <hi>Christ.</hi>
But the course of the Children of God, is
a course contrary to the streame of the
VVorld. Let others take what course they
will, it matters not; they will looke to
themselves. It is good for them to draw
neer to God; and to be guided by his spirit.
A Christian seeks communion with him
that is all in all, with an infinite good with
God in <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> God Man, and
happinesse. Another man is straightned
in his affections to some particular good,
that is meaner then himselfe, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maketh
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17798:33"/>
him a base spirited man. Hee that
inlargeth his heart to seek out a condition,
that is larger and better then himselfe, is
both wise and happy. One would require
no more to Christianity, but to have san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
judgements, that God is God, and
<hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Word is the Word,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd rules, that cannot be denyed, are true,
unlesse hee will be an atheisticall beast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
himselfe. And therefore <hi>Lactantius</hi>
saith well, <hi>Religion is the true wisdome.</hi> Let
a man be judicious, and he must needs be
a Christian; the necessity and excellency
of it standing upon such undenyable
grounds.</p>

did, when hee left his fathers house, and
followed God, though to the giving up of
<hi>Isaak,</hi> whom he knew God could raise up
again, he being alsufficient? Perhaps I lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a friend, or pettypleasure, or contentment,
but that was but a particular good, serving
for a particular turne onely, but in stead
therof I have God that is alsufficient for
all turnes, that is neer to mee, and never
neerer then when I deny any thing for his
sake. A man hath never more of GOD
then when hee denyeth himself most for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17798:34"/>
God, for in what measure we empty our
selves of love to any creature, in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
God fils the soul with contentments
of an higher kinde. VVe have within that
particular good, which wee parted with,
and wee have peace and grace, which is
incomparably above it. Think of that, and
it wil be an infinite incouragement to live
to <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore take these rules. Seek the
end in the meanes? I can have Christ my
end, in riches, pleasures, friends, it is well.
But if I cannot have my end with these
things, away with them. When they be
gone, the end will remayne: Christ will
continue, though they leave us. VVe may

stript of all (for we shall be stript of
them by death) God hath enough, he hath
all things at command, and hath wisdome
enough a thousand ways to provide, that
we shall not be losers by him, no, not in
this life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:17798:34"/>Consider then what it is to give our
selves to the Lord. VVhen we give our
selves, wee give all things else with our

and then they would easily part with
their goods, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith.</p>
            <p>But wee will never give our selves to
the Lord, till we consider what he hath
done for us. He hath given himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for us, left heaven for us, denyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for us, made himself of no reputation
for us, became a worme and no man, a
curse for us. And in way of requitall wee
should answer him, with giving our selves
and all wee have to him, this is to be a
Christian to purpose. Christ hath given
himselfe to mee, and therfore I will give
my goods, my self, my life to Christ, that
is in affection and preparation of spirit,
though not in action. And in action too,
when he calleth for them, I am not mine

is his. And it is no more then he hath
done for mee. Hee went so low, that hee
could not be lower, and be God. He hath
advanced my nature as high as my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
could be advanced by union with
his person, and he will advance my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to heaven. And therfore the Martyrs
were willing to part with their lives. They
<hi>loved not their lives to death,</hi> as Christs
phrase is: <hi>Hee that loveth his life, shall lose
his life, My life is not deare to me,</hi> saith Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> so ready was hee to resigne all for
Christ.</p>
            <p>The reason is (which I desire may not

God then in our selves.<note place="margin">Reason.</note> If wee lose our

place in the heart, by our comming to
some degrees of selfe-deniall, <hi>selfe</hi> hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
us in all our whole course both of
<hi>believing</hi> and <hi>doing.</hi> For wee have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
contrary principles to all articles of
faith, and contrary motions to all the
commands of God. It hinders us in the
duties to God, to others, to our selves.
And therefore to what I formerly sayd, I
may adde this consideration,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> That it is
no easie thing to bee a Christian. If wee
were required to renounce any thing else,
we might obtaine it of our selves, sooner
than deny our selves: for what is nearer
to our selves, than our selves? <hi>Thousand
Rivers of Oyle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micha. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the first fruits of the body,
would be given for the sin of the soule.</hi> That
outward mortification so much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Popery, is nothing to the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of a lust. But if we would be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to purpose, wee must bee stript of
our selves, (as they say of the serpent, he
must part with the old <hi>Slough</hi>) we must
have an higher principle than our selves,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17798:38"/>
before we can doe it. A Christian is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
himselfe, and better than himselfe,
and stronger than himselfe, because hee
hath a better selfe than himselfe. And by
vertue of that better <hi>selfe,</hi> which is grace
in his heart, hee is able to bring under all
his other <hi>selfe,</hi> not onely his sinfull <hi>selfe,</hi>
but his naturall <hi>selfe;</hi> neither his life, nor
any thing is deare unto him, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ.</p>
            <p>Therefore we must not have conceits
of religion, as easie: indeed if wee had
sanctified judgements, and hearts set at
liberty, it were an easie thing: if we had
judgements to see, that we are never more
our selves, than when wee are not our
selves; that wee have a better being in
Christ than in our selves, that our selves
are our worst enemies: If the judgement
were thus posse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and the will, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
made answerable to this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it were easie to deny ourselves. But
<hi>selfe</hi> hinders the knowledge of it selfe all
it can. <hi>Peccatum impedit sui cognitionem:</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:17798:39"/>
sinne naturally hinders the knowledge of
its owne foulenesse.<note place="margin">Sin cloudeth the eye of the Soule.</note> That which should
discerne sinne is clouded, and that which
should hate sinne is ingaged to sinne. So
that under the use of meanes we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to know our condition, and the
foulenesse and danger of that condition.
And that is the excellency of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and divine truthes, that by them
we come to know our selves: But I will
not inlarge my selfe in that.</p>
            <p>What it is to live,<note place="margin">How to live to Christ.</note> and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the Lord
wee have declared. That it is to make
Christ his chiefe aime, and end, and doe
all in vertue of that end. Then is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in his right temper, when Gods
end, Christs end, and his end have the
same centre. A qualification very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>That, that makes God delight in his
children so much, is that they have the
same end, the same God, the same spirit
with Christ. It is so excellent to prefixe a
right end to ail our actions, that it spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allizeth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17798:39"/>
common actions. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
saith of servants.<note place="margin">Common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are made holy.</note> 
               <hi>They serve the Lord in
serving their masters.</hi> Whatsoever the
stuffe of our actions be, yet in that aime,
and spirit, in which they bee done, they
may be services of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now life implyeth the whole course
of our actions, all our actions should be
to the Lord immediately, and directly, or
mediately, and reductively, as they are
quickened by the Spirit of God. And that
is the excellency of a christian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of every thing, as it helpeth his last
end. As on the other side, a base world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
considers Religion, and all things
else, as they sute to his worldly aimes, but
to speake of the next point.</p>
            <q>Whether wee live or dye, wee
are the Lords.</q>
            <p>This is the inference drawne from
the former two generals,<note place="margin">Inference.</note> negative and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative.
<hi>None of us liveth to our selves,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17798:40"/>
or dyeth to our selves. And from thence it is
inferred: whether we live, or dye, wee are
the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is an inference raised from
the former; So wee may consider it, as a
cause, why we must live <hi>to the Lord, and
dye to the Lord: for whether we live, or dye,
we are the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words are a certaine bottome, and
foundation for a christians comfort in the
uncertainty of his condition here, being
between life, &amp; death. Sure he is of death,
as of life: but when to dye, and how long
to live, he is uncertaine. But be that as it
will be, this is certaine, living and dying,
he is the Lords.</p>
            <p>So that take the whole condition of a
christian, take him in all estates of
life or death, (which two divide the
whole condition of man, for all men may
be ranked into these two orders of quick
and dead.<note place="margin">A Christian is Christs in life &amp; death.</note>) I say consider a christian in
either of them, Christ is Lord of both;
take him in a condition of life, while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17798:40"/>
               <hi>he is the Lords.</hi> When hee giveth up
his breath, <hi>he is the Lords.</hi> So that come
of him what will, in this uncertaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
this is certaine, and sure, <hi>he is the
Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a Lord is he, that hath <hi>Dominium
in rem &amp; personam,</hi> right to persons and
things, and the disposing of them, <hi>pro ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio,</hi>
as it pleaseth himselfe, and so <hi>Christ
is Lord both of life and death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First in generall, as he is Lord of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

might be no looser.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, wee are his by <hi>Conquest:</hi> For

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, those that are true believers, are
his in regard of a <hi>peculiar interest</hi> between
him and them. They give themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to him by a contract of marriage,<note place="margin">Wee are Christs by Covenant.</note> and
covenant, and therefore hee is Lord of
them, by their yeelding of themselves to
him, as a Lord: they take him for a Lord,
as well as for a Saviour, and that is the
foundation of the spirituall marriage, and
the covenant of grace on both sides.
Christ giveth himselfe to us, and wee by
the spirit of Christ have grace to give
our selves back againe to him.</p>
            <p>By our owne voluntary <hi>Contract,</hi> wee

have given up our selves to him in our

subjection, as his <hi>disciples,</hi> to be taught by

            <p>Now the tearm of <hi>Lord,</hi> is usually given
to <hi>Christ,</hi> rather than to God the Father,
both in the new testament, &amp; the old too.</p>
            <p>And if there were no other reason for

because God in the second person hath

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:17798:45"/>In all the vicissitude and entercourse

<hi>Whom the Lord loveth, he loveth to the end.</hi>
The <hi>promises</hi> made in <hi>Christ,</hi> are as <hi>Christ,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A Christian</hi> cannot say of any thing

his now, and many wayes there are to
take it away: his friends are his now, but
their friendship may decline: any thing in

               <hi>wee are the Lords</hi> not
onely while we <hi>live,</hi> but when wee <hi>dye.</hi>
Why? because we have a being in <hi>Christ</hi>
when we dye. Christ is a <hi>living root;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>I</hi> live, you shall live also. This Lord
is the <hi>Lord of life:</hi> and therefore whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17798:46"/>
is one with the Lord of life, hee can
indeed never dye. Death is only a change
of a naturall graccious life here, to a
glorious life in another world: from
the Church warfaring here, to the Church
triumphant in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>It is not properly death;<note place="margin">A Christian dieth not.</note> for misery
dyeth, Death it selfe dyeth, wee doe not
dye; Death overthroweth it selfe, but a
Christians life is hid with Christ, and
when he dyeth, he dyeth to live, and is
found in Christ at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and shall bee for ever with Christ.
Therefore it is no great matter what
kinde of death a Christian dyeth, because
he dyeth in the Lord. <hi>Blessed are they that
dye in the Lord.</hi> Hee sayth not, them that
dye a faire death: A wretch, an opposer,
an hypocrite may doe so, and goe to hell.
But blessed are they that dye in the Lord,
because Christ is their Lord in death, and
so sayth the Apostle, <hi>Heb. 11. All these
dyed in faith.</hi> Hee sayth not, they all dyed
a faire death, for they did not, but many
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17798:47"/>
of them dyed a bloudy death; yet they
<hi>all dyed in faith,</hi> and so they dyed in the
Lord.</p>
            <p>And therefore when wee read in the
Histories of the Church, that some
were torne in pieces with wilde beasts,
that <hi>they gave the bodies of the Saints
to the Fowles of Heaven,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> hath
it (which may discourage some to bee
Christians) let us not thinke that any
matter, <hi>they died in faith.</hi> And as the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
sayth,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.</note> 
               <hi>Pretious to the Lord is the
death of all his Saints.</hi> For he taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them in their lives, not onely in
their lives, but the haires of their head,
they being all numbred. Hee taketh
notice of the teares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that fall from
their eyes,<note place="margin">God noteth every thing done to his children.</note> and will not hee take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of their bloud? Hee taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of their persons, their haires,
their teares, and will hee part with
their lives for nothing? No, hee
will be payd for the lives of his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17798:47"/>
children, when hee parts with
them, his enemies shall bee sure to
pay for it. Hee will bee avenged on
them for it, as the bloud of <hi>Naboth</hi>
was on <hi>Ahab:</hi> so hee will bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
on all the persecutours of his
Church, and take a strict account
of every droppe of bloud that hath
beene shed: for their persons are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
God taketh speciall notice of
them, they are his members, his Spouse,
and neare unto him.</p>
            <p>And then hee will not have them
dye,<note place="margin">They shall do their work for which they came.</note> till they have done their worke.
Hee taketh speciall notice of them
all their life: And when they have
done what they came for (as Christ
sayth of himselfe, <hi>I have done the
worke thou gavest mee to doe:</hi> Then hee
sendeth for them home. They dye not
at adventure, but under the care of one,
that knoweth them well both in life and
death.</p>
            <p>And therfore it is that God so revenged
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17798:48"/>
the <hi>Persecutors</hi> of his Church, for the
bloud of his <hi>Saints,</hi> from the bloud of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
unto this day.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>death of his Saints are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi>
so are all the things the Saints have,
<note place="margin">Whatsoever they have, is pretious to the Lord.</note>
their credit is pretious, their goods are
pretious: God taketh notice of everie
thing they part with for his sake. As he,
and all his, is ours, himselfe, his happines,
his spirit, his priviledges: so when wee
are his, all ours are his; hee taketh care of
our lives, of our deaths, of our credits, of
our riches, of our estates: wee part with
nothing for him, but he considers it, and
will reward it <hi>aboundantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that dyeth in the Lord, is a blessed
man,</hi> so sayth the spirit, the flesh will not
say so, but rather will inferre, who would
bee so religious? for such venture their

As they have lived in the flesh,
and will sell all to bee some body in

it may bee a foundation of living

that way, because he is Lord, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> He knew
God should be glorified, by his death, as
well as by his life. So wee may glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Christ by any death; bee content
to yeeld our selves any kind of way to
him.</p>
            <p>There bee two vertues wee ought spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to exercise in the houre of death,
<hi>Assurance of faith that wee are Christs.</hi>
And a <hi>resignation to his will;</hi> that in faith,
and in obedience, wee may commit our
selves to him, as to a faithfull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and Redeemer. This is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>And it is no easie a matter to do this. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

to the world <hi>They have given
their bodies to wine, to women,</hi> as the
Scripture phrase is. Or <hi>they have given
their spirits to the world.</hi> As wee use to
say in our common speech, of some
men, <hi>They are given to the world.</hi> But
when they have given their strength to
the flesh before, and doe at time of
death bequeath their spirits to the Lord,
will hee owne them? Alas, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated
before, and so put out of their

(unlesse the Lord worke a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle)
it is impossible to dye in the

Lord before; which may teach us to give
our selves really to him in our life time;
that our lives being a service to Christ,
wee may comfortably die to him, and
have our soules to dispose of.</p>
            <p>The like subjection must bee shewed
in all conditions whatsoever.<note place="margin">We must bee subject to God in all conditions.</note> If God
will have mee to honour him in a meane
calling, I am not mine owne, I am his,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17798:52"/>
my life, and all my condition of life, are
onely to him. My calling, my estate, it
may bee is low, that my pride may bee
humbled. But God hath set mee in my
calling, he will have mee to honour him
in it. In the meanest calling, a man shall
have enough to give an account of, and
therfore there is no reason to be ashamed
of our calling. I am the Lords, in my life,
in all the passages of it, in my calling, in
all the troubles of it, I am to looke for
support, and protection, and provision,
and direction from God. I am here by
his appointment. And therefore he that
hath set me in this place, will provide for
me, protect me, guide mee by his Spirit,
what to doe in my place. And so it is a
ground of contentation in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>You see then there is great reason <hi>why
wee should not live to our selves, but to the
Lord: that wee should not dye to our selves,

he hath all power in heaven and earth
for that purpose, and for ever. What a

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing more availeable
to the living of a Christians life,
then to have the eye of the soule
on his maine end, and scope. And then,
to be furnished with some maximes, and
principles, to direct our lives to that
scope. Where the parts are most noble,
and large, there the aime, and scope, is
most excellent. Now a true Christian
being raised above others, hath an end
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17798:54"/>
and scope above other men; And that
indeed maketh him a Christian in good
earnest. When God by his Spirit disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
an higher excellency, then the world
can affoord, and setteth our hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it.</p>
            <p>Now the Apostle setteth downe the
scope of out whole condition both of
life,<note place="margin">Negative.</note> and death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First <hi>Negatively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No man liveth to himselfe. No man dieth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi>

               <hi>Wee live to the

            </p>
            <p>And hee giveth the ground of both, <hi>Whether we live,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ground of both.</note> 
               <hi>or dye, we are the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we live to the Lord, we shall have a
being after life. A Christian is, when hee
is not; when he is not here, he hath a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in heaven; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uitably to his seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
conditions he hath a Lord to owne
him in all. Now hee liveth, yet cannot
build on life, nor any thing below, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
life is short and uncertaine. But this
he may build on. <hi>Whether he liveth, or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17798:54"/>
he is the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Christ is said in Scripture, to bee
<hi>Lord</hi> oftener then God,<note place="margin">Christ our Lord as the second person.</note> because God in
the second person hath appeared in our
<hi>Nature,</hi> overcome all our enemies, hath
triumphed, and is now in heaven in our
Nature. and because Lord is a word of
authority and soveraignty. And God
hath made him governour of quicke and
dead.</p>
            <p>He is a Lord in regard of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by <hi>Donation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lord by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> God hath given the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

               <hi>by
conquest</hi> over the enemies of our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And then by <hi>Ransome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lord by ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</note> He hath paid a
price to divine justice for us. For though God gave Christ to us from all eternity,
and us to Christ, yet on these tearmes, that
he should ransome us. God will not have
his justice a looser, therefore Christ must
pay a price to divine justice, such was his
mercy, and the glory of his mercy to find
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17798:55"/>
out such a way to satisfie justice, that God
should dye.</p>
            <p>No attribute of God must be a looser,<note place="margin">Lord by satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice.</note>
he must have the honour of all his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
and therefore of his justice, and
here is the glory of his wisedome, in
contriving a way that mercy may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and justice may be satisfied.</p>
            <p>And then he is Lord,<note place="margin">Lord by our submission to him.</note> by our voluntary
submission to him; for we set a crowne
upon his head, when wee subject our

               </gap>lves to him.</p>
            <p>He is our Lord in all estates,<note place="margin">Lord in all conditions.</note> 
               <hi>living, or
dying.</hi> At all times, without limitation. In
all conditions, whether it bee a life of
prosperity, or adversity, let us dy by what
manner of death soever.</p>
            <p>And so I shewed, wee are the Lords
in a double sence, <hi>In regard of our carriage
to him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lord by his care over us.</note> 
               <hi>and in regard of his care over us,</hi>
both must be included. Wee are not the
Lords onely for that hee taketh care of us,
and without our service, nor that wee
doe him service without his care of us;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17798:55"/>
but hee is so our Lord, that wee have
grace to acknowledge him, and he hath
grace, and love, and mercie to protect,
and acknowledge us both in life and
death.</p>
            <p>It is no prejudice to a Christians estate,
that hee is anothers, it is the happinesse
of the weake, to be under a stronger; of
those that bee deficient, to bee under ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Now there is all-sufficiencie in
Christ, therefore to bee under him is our
happinesse.</p>
            <p>Give mee leave to illustrate this;<note place="margin">Illustration.</note>
Every thing is beautifull in its owne
place: things that are highest, it is fit
they should bee highest; things that are
lowest, it is fit they should bee lowest. If
the head were not in its owne place,
there would bee deformitie in the body.
And so it is fit Christ should be our Lord,
being God-man, and the glory of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And it is our happines, our beauty &amp;
comelines, our safety &amp; perfection, to bee
under Christ, and to be onely under him.</p>

none else:</hi> the Lords, and none but the
Lords: if we are any bodies else, it is in
the Lord, and for the Lord.</p>
            <p>Here is likewise a <hi>resignation, wee are
the Lords,</hi> and therefore wee will give up
our selves to him, with a resting in him,
and high estimation of him, and glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our condition through him.</p>
            <p>And then heere is an <hi>improvement</hi> of
this implyed, <hi>wee are the Lords,</hi> therefore
we ought to improve it on our parts, by

            <p>We are the Lords first by particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
which is wrought by degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, God by his Spirit revealeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be ours,<note place="margin">We are the Lords by particular application.</note>
not fully, but by letting in
so much light into the soule, as may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the soule to him, and makes us yeeld to
him, trust in him, and cast our selves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and by doing so, wee grow into
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17798:58"/>
farther acquaintance with him; and hee
honours our faith with a farther sence &amp;

            <p>There is a great deale of distance and

which we cast our selves on Christ, and a

and wee are his, that is a fruit of faith, and
there needeth a great deale of growth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>And therefore if you aske, what doth
the soule first to make Christ his owne?<note place="margin">How the soule maketh Christ his, &amp; the course it is to take.</note>
It is this, <hi>In the use of meanes</hi> (wherewith
God pleaseth to be effectuall) <hi>a light is by
the Spirit let into the soule, wherby the heart
is perswaded, that hee hath a good meaning
towards it:</hi> that he is a gracious Lord,
and wil forgive the sinnes of all that relye
upon him. And with the acknowledging
of these truths, together with the
offer of mercie in Christ, there is so
much sweetnesse let into the soule, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
the soule backe againe to Christ, to
rest upon him. For unlesse Christ begin
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17798:59"/>
in some degree to make love to the soule,
and giveth a taste of his sweetnesse, wee
cannot relye upon him, nor love him, not
onely because we are creatures, and hee is
<hi>first,</hi> and must begin to us; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the nature of a <hi>guilty</hi> soul, when
it is under terrour, and awakened, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
such doubts, that till Christ letteth in
some glimpse of his love, the soule dare
not looke Christ in the face.</p>
            <p>Now in the unfolding of these divine
truths of the Gospell, some intimations
are given, <hi>That Christ is mine, and I am
Christs,</hi> which afterward becommeth the
claime of an experienced Christian. This
therefore directeth what course they shall
take, to get Christ, that want him. They
must attend upon the blessed meanes of
salvation, and then consider how farre
forth they may lay claime to Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For first, all that live in the Church,
are <hi>Christs</hi> in some degree. God hath
prevented men with his love, in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to the visible Church: and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17798:59"/>
there is an ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igation on them to thinke
well of Christ for that, because hee had
care of them, before they had care of
themselves, by vouchsafing them the seale
of Baptisme, and making them members
of the visible Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, unlesse they labour, being
come to yeares of discretion, to feele a
farther assurance, that Christ is theirs,
they disanull and deny their baptisme:
and therefore it is good for such soules as
are touched with sight of sinne, to gather
upon Christ, and to winde about all helps
they can, to worke on Christ; as the vine
gathereth on the tree, it windeth about. I
am born in the Church, I have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised,
lived in times of the Gospell, have
opportunities to heare the blessed truths,
and therefore I wil have good conceits o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ, that he meaneth well to my soule.</p>
            <p>Indeed a company of wretches,<note place="margin">Vngodly men deny their baptisme.</note> that
rest in their baptisme, being <hi>prophane swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17798:60"/>
and doe not wee come to Church? but
they forget that this is an obligation on
them to be good, &amp; no excuse for them to
be evil. It tieth thee to renounce that thou
livest in, else thou deniest thy baptisme.</p>
            <p>We must know, beloved, that <hi>Christ</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, not as we love a goodly <hi>Pillar,</hi> or
other curious piece of <hi>Art,</hi> that cannot
love us againe: but the intercourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and man, is <hi>mutuall.</hi> If he say,
<hi>he is ours,</hi> wee say againe, <hi>I am thine Lord,</hi>
and give my selfe to thee, and the claime
is mutuall. He claimeth us for his, and we
claime him for ours: for he deales with
reasonable creatures, that can enter into
covenant with him as friends. Wee must
therefore give up all to God. If God bee
God,<note place="margin">All assigned to God.</note> let us owne him. And as wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve <hi>Christ</hi> and sinne, Wee cannot
serve Christ and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> we cannot
comply with <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his enemies. Those
that have the mark of the <hi>beast,</hi> absolutely
cannot bee <hi>Christs,</hi> nor have communion
with him, but are enemies to <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:17798:60"/>
though under pretence of religion. But
where a man is truly <hi>Christs,</hi> hee is none
but <hi>Christs;</hi> Satan is content with any
part, but Christ must have the whol heart.</p>
            <p>Gods children have something in them,<note place="margin">Sinne in the children of God is as a rebell; in the wicked as a Lord.</note>
that usurpeth, some corruption in them,
which is not absolutely removed; but it
is but a <hi>rebell,</hi> and they have an enemies
minde to it, all that is contrary to Christ,
is renounced, whereas in them that bee
carnall, sin is as a Lord; but in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
it is as a <hi>thiefe,</hi> hee is there, yet they
owne him not, but get strength against
him: he ruleth not there, but as a <hi>Tyrant;</hi>
there is a renunciation of Lordship, and
dominion of sin: though they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to this and that sin; yet they
have no liking to that liking, no inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as spiritual, to that inclination, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:
but make it an object of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They renounce all other Lords,
when all other men (that have not the

of some reigning lusts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:17798:61"/>And as it implyeth a <hi>possession,</hi> so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

And as <hi>Thomas, My Lord &amp; my God.</hi> This

            </p>
            <p>It implieth likewise <hi>a duty of resignation</hi>

things to bee at his disposing, to bee led

death, <hi>if by any meanes wee may attain to the

            <p>It is a speciall <hi>after-part</hi> to bee able to

            <p>Carnall men, though they submit to

            <p>To stirre us up in a word to labour to

            <p>And what kinde of subjection is it, to

bee subject to our owne lusts? to a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Our lusts are baser than the divel himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.
For the Divel is a substance, and ruleth by

fruits wee have by their service, is shame,
and griefe, at the best, and shall wee serve
those that will pay no better wages? yet
this is the condition of all that have not
Christ for their Lord: they serve some
base lust, and Satan, a tyrannicall Lord,
that in stead of better rewards, punisheth
them with eternall destruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that
