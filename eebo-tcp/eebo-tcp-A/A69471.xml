            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He good Reception a Volume of the like Conferences appears to have found laſt year by the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſtribution of the Copies, hath given encouragement to the Verſion and Publication of this; wherein I aſſure my ſelf the Readers will not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worſe entertain'd at the ſecond Courſe then they were at the firſt; the Queſtions here being proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably more Philoſophical, and choſen from ſuch Subjects as are moſt inquir'd into at this day by the Curious of our own Nation, who undoubtedly will find ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment (if not ſatisfaction) in reading what the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of our Neighbour-Nation have diſcours'd touching thoſe Matters. I have often heard it ſpoken to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of an Eminent Peer in the laſt Reign, That for an hour or two together he made the moſt agreeable Converſation in the World; but if, upon parting, any one of the Company happened to reflect upon what he had heard, he could not remember the leaſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paſſage, ſaving that he had ſpent ſuch a portion of Time very deliciouſly. 'Twas a happy Faculty for the Man; for he did his buſineſs by it, and partly ow'd his Promotion to this Talent. I ſhall pronounce no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon him but thus, That perhaps (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid in almoſt a like caſe) he was a better Gallant than a Wiſe Man ſhould be: At leaſt, this way of conſuming Time, argued a great Diſeaſe in Mens Minds, when they could be contented to feed upon Air, and were ſo ſqueamiſh as not to be able to bear the wholſom Diet of ſolid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. 'Tis too apparent that the ſame Humor is ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:66371:3"/>
predominant in theſe our days, wherein Gaming makes the whole Converſe amongſt the Gentry, who, like rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Animals, meet together but to prey upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whilſt old Stories, or News, and (for want of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo innocent) Detractions, Deriſions, and Abuſes are the only things that furniſh talk to the Plebeians. Thus we live, and yet pretend to be Reaſonable Creatures; whilſt true and ſolid Reaſon is almoſt as obſcurely diſcernable in our Commerce, as Senſe and Motion are in Sponges and Oiſters. But 'tis hop'd the better practice of ſome Excellent Perſons amongſt our ſelves, may contribute much to the Reformation of this; and to help it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it cannot but do ſome good (by exciting us to emulation) to ſee what been already done by ſome Gentlemen of <hi>France,</hi> to whoſe excellent Wits the World is beholden for theſe Conferences.</p>

                  <hi>Of Sleep, and how long it ought to be.</hi>
               </note> which is the ceſſation of the actions of an <hi>Animal,</hi> to whom alone it hath been aſſigned, in regard no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beſides becomes weary in its Operations: For all Animals, even the loweſt degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, ſleep; although ſuch who have hard eyes and ſcales, ſleep more obſcurely then the reſt; and Birds more lightly then four-footed Beaſts which ſuck, becauſe they have a leſs and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brain, and conſequently leſs need ſleep, whoſe uſe is to moiſten and refreſh that part. Hence Man, having of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals the largeſt Brain, hath alſo need of the longeſt ſleep, which ought to be about ſeven hours. Wherefore I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Plato,</hi> in his firſt Book of Laws, would have his Citizens riſe in the night to fall to their ordinary employments; for this diſturbing of their reſt were the way to make a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Fools; the Brain, by watchings acquiring a hot and dry intemperature, which begets igneous ſpirits, whoſe mobility not permitting the Mind to conſider the ſpecies impreſs'd upon them, is the cauſe of unſteady and impetuous ſallies of the Mind; as, on the contrary, ſleep too exceſſive fills the ventricles of the Brain (wherein the Soul exerciſes her Faculties) with abundance of vapours and humidities, which offuſcating and troubling the ſpecies, the Mind thereby becomes ſlothful and dull.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That Privations are underſtood by their Habits; and therefore Sleep, which is a privation of Senſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66371:10"/>
be better known than by the functions of the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſo long as an Animal exerciſes it is ſaid to be awake, and to ſleep when it ceaſes to employ the ſame. And being Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is perform'd by means of the animal Spirits, refin'd out of the natural and vital, and ſent from the Brain into the Senſories, which Spirits receive the ſpecies of the ſenſible object, and carry it to the Inward Senſe, the common Arbiter and Judg of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects; hence, when thoſe Spirits happen to fail, or the Common Senſe is bound up, the other external Senſes cannot diſcharge their offices: Upon which account the Philoſophers have defin'd Sleep, <hi>The ligation of the Firſt Senſe</hi>; or, <hi>The reſt of the Spirits and Blood:</hi> And the Phyſitians, <hi>The ceſſation of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes for the health and repoſe of an Animal</hi>; hereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing it from the ceſſation of the outward Senſes in Swoonings, Falling-ſickneſs, Apoplexie, Lethargy, Carus, Coma, and ſuch ſorts of morbifick and praeternatural ſleep, produc'd by cauſes acting rather by an occult and ſomniferous property, then by exceſs of cold or moiſture; otherwiſe Winter, Ice, and the coldeſt things, ſhould cauſe ſleep; Wine, Annis, Opium, Henbane, and abundance of hot Medicaments, ſhould not be Narcotick, as experience evinces them to be. But natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſleep is produc'd by vapours elevated from the aliments into the brain; which moreover performing in us the office of a Ventoſe or Cupping-glaſs, draws to it ſelf thoſe humid vapours, condenſes them by its coldneſs, and reſolves them into a gentle dew, which falling upon the riſe or beginning of the Nerves, obſtructs the paſſage to the animal Spirits, the inſtruments of Senſation and voluntary Motion, which it hinders; though not Motion, ſo much as Senſation; becauſe the Nerves of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Brain, deſtinated to Motion, being harder, do not ſo eaſily imbibe thoſe vapours, as thoſe of the fore-part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to Senſation: But when the Heat and Spirits, whereof there had been an abſumption, are again ſufficiently repair'd, they move anew toward the Brain, where they reſolve thoſe dews which ſtopp'd the paſſage, and hindred the commerce of the vital Spirits with the animal; whereupon we naturally and without violence awake: So likewiſe, the violence of an extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal object importunately ſtriking the external Senſes, obliges the Soul to ſend other Spirits to the aſſiſtance of the few remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, and which before this ſupply apprehend objects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuſedly.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Sleep is not the Quieſcence of the animal Spirits, for theſe are active, and form Dreams whilſt we ſleep; nor of the vital, which have no relaxation or reſt ſo long as the Animal hath life; much leſs of the natural, Nutrition being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd beſt during ſleep, which is the cauſe why ſleeping fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens. Neither is the Brain's humidity the cauſe of ſleep, as 'tis commonly held; but the defect of vital heat in the Heart, in a ſufficient degree for performing the functions of the outward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66371:10"/>
Senſes. Moreover the ſudden ſeizing and abruption of ſleep, which we obſerve, cannot be produc'd but by a very movable cauſe, ſuch as the groſs vapour of aliments is not; but the vital heat is, being carried into all parts of the body in an inſtant: Whence it is that we obſerve the ſame to be more pale during ſleep, (as having leſs of the ſaid heat) than during Evigilation.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That indeed the adequate cauſe of ſleep is not a vapour ariſing from the aliments, ſince it is procur'd by abundance of other cauſes, which produce no evaporation; as Wearineſs, Muſique, Silence, and Darkneſs: Neither is it the above-mentioned deficience of Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l Heat, which indeed is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Organs, inaſmuch as they are endu'd with life, but not to make them capable of ſenſe; there being ſufficient in them even during ſleep, when the parts are found hot enough for Senſation, if heat were the cauſe thereof, as it is not: But the right cauſe conſiſts in the Animal Spirits, for which, as being the nobleſt inſtruments of the Body, I conceive there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faculty in the Brain, which adminiſters and governs them, ſending them to the Organs, when there is need of them; and cauſing them to return back, in order to be reſtor'd and ſuppli'd: As there is a particular faculty in the Heart, over-ruling and moving the Vital Spirits as it pleaſes; ſometimes diffuſing them outwards in Joy, Anger, and Shame; ſometimes cauſing them to retreat, in order to ſuccour the Heart in Sadneſs, Grief, and Fear.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, The Empire of Sleep, whom <hi>Orpheus</hi> calls King of Gods and Men, is ſo ſweet, that Not to be of its party is to be an enemy to Nature: 'Tis the charm of all griefs both of body and mind; and was given to man, not only for the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both, but chiefly for the liberty of the Soul; becauſe it makes both the Maſter and the Slave, the poor and the rich equal: 'Tis a ſign of health in young people, and cauſes a good conſtitution of Brain, ſtrengthning the ſame, and rendring all the functions of the mind more vigorous; whence came the ſaying, <hi>That the Night gives counſels</hi>; becauſe then the Mind is freed from the tyranny of the Senſes, it reaſons more ſolidly, and its operations are ſo much the more perfect as they are more inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on matter; and 'twas during the repoſe of ſleep that moſt of the Extaſies and prophetical Viſions happened to the Saints. Moreover frequent ſleep is a ſign of a very good nature: For being conciliated only by the benignity of a temper mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot and moiſt, the Sanguine and Phlegmatick, whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is moſt agreeable, are more inclined thereunto than the Bilious and Melancholly, in regard of their heat and drineſs, which reſolve and diſſipate the animal Spirits, as a vapourous humidity hinders their effuſion, by the obſtruction which it cauſeth in the original of the Nerves; or, which is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe the clouds of thoſe vapours occupying the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Brain, by their humidity moiſten and relax the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66371:11"/>
Spirits, which remain immovable till they be deliver'd from the importunity of thoſe vapours; which moreover more eaſily aſcending, when the Body is at reſt, it happens that Sleep is frequently caus'd, not only by watchings, cares, labour, bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heat, and other things which diſſipate the Spirits; but alſo by ſounds, gentle murmurs of water, frictions, and motions, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and darkneſs; unleſs we had rather ſay, That the animal Spirits, being moſt ſubtle and luminous bodies, retire inwards during the darkneſs, which is contrary to them.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That Sleep being not only a depravation but a total privation of actions, ſince a thing exiſts but ſo far as it acts; at the ſame proportion that we love our own Being, we ought to hate Sleep, and love Watching. The great <hi>George Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriot,</hi> the ſcourge of the Turks, never ſlept more then two hours; and the Poets had reaſon to term Sleep, <hi>The Image of Death,</hi> which the Scripture alſo expreſſes by Sleeping. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death is to be avoided as much as poſſible, ſo alſo ought Sleep; were it not that both of them, being inevitable evils, all we can do is to keep as far off them, and ſuffer our ſelves to be led as little to them, as may be. The Poets themſelves ſeem willing to imprint in us a horror of Sleep, when they feign it the Son of Hell or <hi>Erebus,</hi> and Night, the brother of Death, the father of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> and that his Palace was amidſt the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Cimmerians.</hi> Moreover, the moſt imperfect Animals ſleep more then others, which is the reaſon <hi>Zoophytes,</hi> or Plant-animals, as the Sponge, Coral, and Oiſters, ſleep continually; Snails, and ſome Flys, three or four months; Bears, longer then other Animals; and amongſt theſe, Birds, as partaking more of the nature of Heaven, ſleep leſs then four-footed Beaſts: A Child, ſo long as it approaches a beſtial life in its Mothers belly, and for the firſt years, ſleeps more than when 'tis grown to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and being again become by Age a Child, ſleeps more than formerly, till he comes to the laſt ſleep of death, which reduces him to nothing. Women, phlegmatick perſons, drunkards, and block-heads, ſleep more then Men, ſober, and witty perſons. For we are no more to refer to the abuſe of theſe Times in ſleeping very much, then to other Vices of the Age; amongſt the reſt, Idleneſs, Eating and Drinking, wherein there is none ſober at this day but exceed their juſt meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Upon the Second point it was ſaid, That Strength, as well as moſt other things in the World,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Which is the ſtrongeſt thing in the World.</hi>
               </note> hath not an abſolute but only a relative Being, a thing being called ſtrong, in compariſon of others which are leſs ſo. Thus <hi>Antaeus</hi> was ſtrong in reſpect of all other men; but weak, compared to <hi>Hercules</hi>: And as <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was invulnerable in every other part ſaving the heel; ſo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to have left in us a certain weakneſs and defect in ſome parts, wherein ſome are more tender then others: So that 'tis hard to find one thing alike powerful towards all men, ſince
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66371:11"/>
by reaſon of our ſeveral inclinations every one is differently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: The Ambitious will hold for Honours; the Amorous, for Women, the Drinker, for Wine; and Truth, which in the Scripture was judg'd ſtrongeſt by King <hi>Darius,</hi> who propos'd the preſent Problem to his four Courtiers, would poſſibly be deemed the weakeſt in the Judgment of the moſt; for to them that ſhould take her part, the ſame queſtion might be put which <hi>Pilate</hi> ask'd our Lord, <hi>What is Truth</hi>? It is ſo frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd by lying, in moral matters; ſo invelop'd in darkneſs, and ſubject to the deceit of our Senſes in natural things, that as it is the leaſt underſtood, ſo we may ſay 'tis the leaſt follow'd; our inclinations never tending towards an unknown object. The ſtrongeſt thing therefore is that which hath moſt power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our Will towards it ſelf; which Will following the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Underſtanding, as again this acts not but by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies wherewith the Imagination ſupplies it, 'tis to the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I aſcribe the greateſt ſtrength in the world; ſince all other things borrow all their power from the Imagination, by the opinion of Honour, Profit, and Pleaſure, which that Faculty makes us conceive therein; and, on the contrary, the ſame Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination ruines and deſtroys the force of all things accounted the moſt powerful, whilſt it conſiders them with a different biaſs: 'Tis by it that one abhors nothing more then Women, whom ſo many others idolatrize: Pleaſures, Honours, Riches, and all the Goods of Fortune, are but ſo many croſſes and puniſhments to thoſe who have conceiv'd an averſion againſt them: Death it ſelf, as terrible as it is, oftentimes is deſpis'd and ſought after out of a powerful conſideration of Honour; this too being nothing elſe but a Fancy, magnifi'd by the opinion rais'd of it in the world: Even Virtue draws all her power from Imagination alone; for many a one thinks he embraces her quite naked, whilſt, like <hi>Ixion,</hi> he embraces nothing but a cloud and a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm, and yet is as well ſatisfi'd with this as if he had a perfect fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of her.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the ſolution of this Problem depends upon the underſtanding of the term [<hi>Strength</hi>]: If it be taken for a certain quality and power which renders things active, that muſt be the ſtrongeſt thing in the world which acts with moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy and power upon the moſt excellent things: But foraſmuch as there are as many ſorts of agents, as there are degrees of Being in Nature, in Morals, and in Tranſcendants, and we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare things together which are of a different genus; yet there being no congruity and proportion but between thoſe which are of the ſame ſpecies, 'tis hard to know abſolutely which is the ſtrongeſt thing, ſince every one hath a vertue wholly peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, becauſe it hath a proper nature, which is the principle and cauſe of the diverſity of motions and actions. According to which diſtinction I am of opinion, That of agents purely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fire is the ſtrongeſt, ſince it alters and deſtroys all natural
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66371:12"/>
Bodies; and its quality, Heat, is the moſt active of all. Amongſt living things Man is the ſtrongeſt, inaſmuch as he renders himſelf maſter of all the fierceſt Animals, which he knows how either to ſubdue or tame. Amongſt men Kings are the ſtrongeſt, ſince they diſpoſe of our Goods, Lives, and Wills. Moral agents are different in force and activity, according to the divers conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſubjects upon which they act, and make a different im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Honeſty alone acts upon very few ſpirits; Pleaſures, upon moſt; Intereſt, upon all: Nevertheleſs ſince they act only by the opinion which they produce either of an honeſt, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or delightful Good, this Opinion and Imagination muſt be the ſtrongeſt of all moral agents. Amongſt the actions of the Imagination, which are the Paſſions, that of Love is the ſtrongeſt, becauſe it ſerves for a foundation to all the reſt; it being true, that we fear, deſire, and hate nothing, but ſo far as we love ſome other thing; ſo that he who can be free from this Paſſion, would be exempt from all others. Amongſt Tranſcendents Truth is ſtrongeſt; not that which is ill defin'd, <hi>The conformity of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding with the thing known</hi>; ſince there are things above us which ſurpaſs the reach of our capacity, and yet ceaſe not to be true: But this Truth is a property and affection of Entity, wherewith it is convertible; and, conſequently, cannot be truly defin'd, no more then the other Tranſcendents; ſince a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires a Genus, which being ſuperiour, and more common, cannot be aſſign'd to Entity, or Truth, which is the ſame with Entity; otherwiſe there ſhould be ſomething more general then Entity; which is abſurd. And although the nature of this Truth is not diſtinctly known, nevertheleſs the virtue of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects is very ſenſible; for it acts every where, and in all; yea, above the ſtrongeſt things in the world, whoſe actions depend upon the verity of their Eſſence, which they ſuppoſe. And as this Verity is the Principle of the actions of all Agents, ſo it is the End and Firſt Mover, which gives riſe to all their inclinations, whereby they all tend towards one Good, which is nothing elſe but Truth, which gives weight and value to Goodneſs: But the force of Verity appears principally in that it acts upon the moſt excellent thing in the World, to wit, the Underſtanding, which it convinces by its light, wherewith it extorts conſent; and this ſo much the more as the Underſtanding is perfect; as we ſee in the Underſtandings of the Wiſe and Learned, who more eaſily ſuffer themſelves to be overcome by Truth, than the Vulgar; and in thoſe of Angels and Intelligences, who likewiſe yield to Truth. And becauſe Verity and Entity are the ſame thing, therefore God, who poſſeſſes Entity Originally, is alſo the Prime Verity, which our Lord attributes to himſelf in the Goſpel, when he ſaith, <hi>That he is the Truth and the Life.</hi> For whereas Truth is oft-times altered and clouded in the world, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produces Hatred, the moſt infamous of all Paſſions; 'tis a defect not found but in diſſolute Spirits, who cannot ſupport
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66371:12"/>
the brightneſs of it, and hate its light becauſe it diſcovers their faults: Yea, even when men contradict the Truth, and follow the deprav'd motions of their moſt diſorderly Paſſions, 'tis allways under an appearance of Goodneſs and Truth. But if the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and appearance alone of Truth, hath ſo great an Empire over our minds, as is ſeen in the moſt erroneous Opinions, which never want followers; with more juſt reaſon muſt it ſelf, when known, be invincible, and the ſtrongeſt thing in the World.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, were propos'd amongſt the ſtrongeſt things, Time, which conſumes all; Death, which overthrows all the Powers of the Earth; Place, which embraces all in it ſelf; and Neceſſity, ſo potent that it is not ſubject to any Law, but gives the ſame to all other things, which cannot avoid its Empire; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Ancients eſteem'd the Gods themſelves not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from it, but ſubject to the neceſſity of a Deſtiny.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Gowt.</hi>
               </note> which gave it the name of Gowt; and is different, according to the divers connexions of the Bones, and the Parts which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, being term'd <hi>Podagra</hi> in the Feet, <hi>Chiragra</hi> in the Hand, and the Iſchiatick ach (by the vulgar, <hi>Schiatica</hi>) in the Hip. Nevertheleſs every Articular Pain is not the Gowt, as appears by Contuſions, Luxations, Wounds, and the Pains of Women after Child-birth; in Virgins after their Evacuation; and in Bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the French Diſeaſe: But 'tis a Grief of the Parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with ſenſe which are about the Joynts, accompanied ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with ſwelling, and caus'd by the fluxion of a ſharp and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humour, tranſmitted out of the Veins and Arteries, into thoſe Parts whoſe motion it hinders; and becauſe the Feet are moſt remote from the ſource of heat, therefore Nature common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drives thither the matter of this Malady, whereunto they are more diſpos'd then other Parts, as well by reaſon of their compoſition of Nerves, Tendons, Veins, Arteries, Membranes, and Ligaments, ſpermatick and cold parts; as of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al motion, which gives occaſion to the fluxion: Hence the Gowt begins uſually at the Feet, eſpecially at the great Toe, whoſe motion is greateſt; which hinders not but that it begins too in the Hand, Knee, and Hip, and ſometimes in the Sides; and if the matter abound, ſometimes it ſeizes upon the Joynts with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66371:13"/>
ſuch violence as would make Nature ſuccumbe, were the fits continual, and not periodical, as they are; giving to ſome an interval of a year; to others, of ſix months, or leſs, according as there needs time for collecting the humour in thoſe parts. The cauſe of this vehement pain is the acrimony of the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and mordicant humour, which makes a ſolution of the parts, whoſe coldneſs renders this evil almoſt incurable, and makes it laſt fourty days; the pain not being appeaſable, ſaving when the cauſe which produces it is reſolv'd, whereunto the coldneſs of its ſubject is not proper.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That in the Gowt, as in all ſorts of Fluxions, four things are to be conſider'd; the Matter which flows, the Place whence it comes, the Way by which it paſſes, and the Parts upon which it falls. As for the firſt, the Gowt hath ſome Matter; not being, as ſome hold, a ſimple <hi>Intemperies,</hi> which could not ſubſiſt ſo long, nor cauſe ſuch pungent pains, much leſs a tumour, as it happens ſometimes in the part afflicted, which cannot proceed but from the affluence of Matter: This Matter ſome affirm to be Wind, or Flatuoſity, with as little reaſon; for then it might eaſily be reſolv'd, and would cauſe only a pain of diſtenſion. Moſt hold that 'tis the four Humours, arguing from the diverſity of Symptomes of this Diſeaſe, and the various manner of curing; ſome being eas'd by hot Aliments and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, others by cold: And laſtly, from the different colour of the tumours, appearing ſometimes red, white, or of ſome other colour, by reaſon of the blood, phlegm, or other humours which produc'd them: But though a very acute pain may in this malady, as it doth in all others, attract the humours which abound in the body, and ſo cauſe a tumour; yet this humour which makes the inflation, cannot be the cauſe of the Gowt; ſince at the beginning, and before the parts are inflated, the pains are very great; but ceaſe and diminiſh upon the appearing of the Tumour. Some have held it to be Blood alone; others, Melancholy; ſome, Bile, in regard of its mobility and activity; many, following the authority of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> that 'tis a cold, phlegmatick, and ſerous humour, and that every Gowt is cold. <hi>Mercurialis</hi> obſerving that Blood could not cauſe ſuch great pains, that Melancholy was too heavy and thick to be active, Bile too ſubtile to deſcend, and Phlegm too cold to excite ſuch pungent pains and ſudden motions, which cannot proceed from a cold cauſe; conceiv'd it was Phlegm mingled with Bile, the latter ſerving as a Vehicle to the former, and that former to precipitate and make this latter deſcend. Some others, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ignorance, acknowledg, <hi>Qu' on n' y void goutte,</hi> that they ſee not a jot in this Matter; referring this Diſeaſe to occult and malignant cauſes, acting by an unknown property, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious and venemous diſeaſes do. I conceive it to be a ſalt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſubtile, and picquant, partaking of the nature of Salts, which are all corroſive; which acrimony and mordacity of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66371:13"/>
humour is caus'd by the Salt or Tartar contain'd in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or deriv'd to the Aliments (whereof the humours are produc'd) from the Earth, which is full of ſuch Salt, Nitrous, or Tartareous Spirits, without which it would be unfruitful and barren, as is ſeen in Earth whence Saltpeter is extracted, which can never produce any thing. This Nitrous Spirit being all drawn out of the Earth by the Plants which ſerve us for food, and not being tameable by our heat, much leſs convertible into our ſubſtance (for an Animal is nouriſh'd with what is ſweet, and hath had life, wherewith theſe Mineral Spirits were never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided) if the natural Faculty be ſtrong, it expells them with the other unprofitable Excrements of the firſt concoction, and Urine and Sweat; and ſometimes forms the Stone in the Kidneys, Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or other Parts: But if it happens, either through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the expulſive Faculty, or the quality of the Matter, or ſome other defect, that this Tartareous Spirit is not expell'd, then it is carry'd with the Blood into the Parts, and being unfit for nutrition, tranſpires by the Pores, if it be ſubtil enough; or elſe, in caſe it be thick, and cannot be reſolv'd, flows back into the great Veſſels, and thence into the Joynts, where ſometimes it is coagulated into knots and grits, and turn'd into a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like chalk or plaiſter, (which ſhews, that the four Humours are not the matter thereof, ſince the ſame do not ſuppurate) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering then the Gowt incurable, and the Reproach of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe they find no Cure for it; no more than for that of old Men, thoſe who have a dry Belly, and who live diſorderly: But 'tis curable, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in young people, in ſuch as have no gritts or hardneſſes form'd in the Joints, thoſe who are laborious, obedient, and to whom ſome great Evacuations ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, many having been cur'd of it by a Dyſenterie. As for the Place where it is form'd, and the Way whereby the Matter which cauſes this Evil, deſcends; moſt, with <hi>Fernelius,</hi> conceive 'tis the Head, not the internal part of the Brain, whoſe Excrements are eaſily voided outwardly by the Noſtrils; or inwardly, by the <hi>Infundibulum</hi> or Tunnel, and other Cavities; but the outward part between the skull and the skin; which being too thick and compact to give iſſue to the phlegmatick and ſerous humours there collected, being begotten of the Excrements of the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Veins, which are expanded over all theſe Parts, thoſe ſerous and thin humours glide down between the Skin, and other Fegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, into the Joints: But the Place of this Nitrous Matter above-mentioned, are the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the Liver and Spleen, which generate this Matter two ways. 1. By the vitioſity of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments impregnated with this Nitrous Spirit, which they plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attracted from the Earth; whence it is that Wine, which hath more of this Spirit and Tartar then any other Aliment, is, by conſent of all, very hurtful to the Gowt. 2. By their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vitioſity; namely, a hot and dry <hi>Intemperies</hi>; whereby, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of concocting, they adure the Blood, and ſo fix that ſalt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66371:14"/>
ſeroſity, which is the Salt or Tartar extracted out of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Unleſs you had rather ſay, That as in the Kidneys of Perſons ſubject to the Stone, there is a certain arenaceous or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidifick conſtitution, proper for producing the Stone; ſo in the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of thoſe who are ſubject to the Gowt, there is a particular arthritical diſpoſition, apt to beget that tartareous matter which produces it. The Way whereby this Matter is expell'd is the Veins and Arteries; theſe Veſſels manifeſtly ſwelling when the fits of the Gowt begin. Moreover, as this Diſeaſe unexpectedly invades, by a ſudden afflux of the Matter; ſo it ſuddenly changes place, eſpecially by means of Refrigerants and Repercuſſives, which drive the Gowt from one Foot to the other, or into the Hand, and other Parts; which cannot be done but by the Veins and Arteries. Laſtly, The Parts upon which this Matter falls, and which are about the articulations, are membranous and ſenſible, becauſe the Membranes being the firſt ſubject of Touch, ought to be alſo of Pain, a Symptom thereof.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the greateſt difficulty was, Why this matter rather falls upon the Joints than other Parts, which are not incommoded therewith, neither the Nerves nor the Veins through which it paſſes, no more than the Membranes and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parts; beſides thoſe which are about the Joints: The cauſe whereof may be, That as in health the Parts by a ſtrange proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty attract ſuch humours as are fit for their nutrition; the Lungs, bilious Blood; the Spleen, melancholy Blood; the Kidneys, ſerous; the other carnous Parts, temperate Blood: ſo in ſickneſs, and ill conſtitution of the Body, ſome of theſe Parts attract from all the reſt certain humours wherewith they have moſt affinity: So in the new Diſeaſe call'd <hi>Plica Polonica,</hi> the viſcous and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous humour which produceth it, is chiefly carri'd to the hair, which it knotteth and inta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gleth together; and to the nails of the Hands and Feet, which it makes hard and black: And in the cure of Fracture of Bones, the Stone call'd <hi>Oſteocolla</hi> taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly is carried towards the broken Bones, and cauſes them to re-unite. In like manner, the Humour producing the Gowt hath ſome affinity with the Bones of the Joints, eſpecially with their Epiphyſes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Gowty have wherewith to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves; not ſo much for that they foretel the changes of the Air and Seaſons, as for that this Diſeaſe is a token of health, and an evidence of the ſtrength and vigour of Nature, which from the noble Parts drives the vicious humours upon the Joints. But amongſt its antecedent cauſes, the Air is not to be forgotten; eſpecially the hot and moiſt Air of the Spring, thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Humours lately congeal'd by the Winter; to the vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of which Air, is that popular Gowt to be referr'd of which <hi>Athenaeus</hi> ſpeaks in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Deipnoſophiſts</hi>; which laſted twenty years, and afflicted two thirds of Men, Women, and Beaſts; although ſome attributed it to the want of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66371:14"/>
which fail'd during thoſe twenty years, and which, they ſay, are good againſt the Gowt, becauſe they looſen the Belly, and correct the heat of the Stomach. Women, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, are exempt from the Gowt, ſaving in the ſuppreſſion of their Evacuations; Children, before the uſe of Venery; and Eunuchs, always; although the intemperance and luxury of all of them hath produc'd contrary experiences, as well in this Age as in that of <hi>Seneca</hi>; which made the Poets ſay, That the Gowt was the Daughter of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>; the firſt, engendring plenty of crude humours; the ſecond, debilitating the heat, and cooling the Body; which being render'd laxe, the humours fall more eaſily upon the Joints. And to ſhew the oddneſs of this Diſeaſe; Anger, Fear, and Joy have oftentimes both given and cured it, the Humours being extreamly agitated by thoſe Paſſions.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, That Wiſedom being a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Habit mix'd of Science and Virtue,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is moſt expedient for the acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Riches or Honour?</hi>
               </note> Poverty gives much more diſpoſition to either than Riches; the Mind of a Poor Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more capable of Knowledg than that of a Rich; either for that Nature compenſates the want of the Goods of Fortune with thoſe of Nature; or becauſe Neceſſity and Hunger ſharpens and renders them more ſubtile; or elſe becauſe being free from the cares and pains caus'd by the conſervation or acquiſition of Riches, they have a more calm Spirit, and more capable of the Sciences, which require quiet and tranquillity of Mind. And as for Virtue, whoſe paths are ſo thorny, Poverty hath alſo many more acceſſes thereunto than Riches, not only in the Law of Grace, in which our Lord ſaith, That <hi>'tis eaſier for a Cammel, or a Cable, to paſs through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; whereof nevertheleſs the gate is the practice of Virtues: but likewiſe in the moral ſenſe of this preſent life, in which Poverty and affliction, according to the Scripture, gives Underſtanding and Prudence, teaches Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Sobriety, and Chaſtity (its inſeparable companion) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines us to Patience, and to ſuffer couragiouſly the miſeries of Life, the frequency whereof renders the Mind invincible. On the contrary, Riches are amoſt always accompanied with Vices moſt repugnant to Wiſedom; as, amongſt others, with Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Vanity, Voluptuouſneſs, and Delicacy; the firſt of which is oppoſite to Science; for Pride proceeds only from Ignorance; the ſecond to Virtue, which the Poet calls maſculine and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Moreover, Nature ſhews us of what quality Riches are; for the ſand that produces Gold is always extreamly barren and naked of all ſorts of Fruits; and ſo are the Minds of thoſe that poſſeſs it; and 'tis obſerv'd. That rich Nations, and ſuch as live in a good ſoil, are the moſt vicious, lazy, and dull; whereas thoſe who are in an unkind Land, are ordinarily more virtuous addicted to Induſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:66371:15"/>The Second ſaid, That as the Goods of Fortune, no leſs than thoſe of the Body, are referr'd to thoſe of the Mind, as the Means to their End; in like ſort, the inconveniences both of Fortune and Body are hinderances in acquiring thoſe Goods of the Soul, which are the perfection of its two principal Faculties, the Underſtanding and the Will; namely, Knowledg and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: For Knowledg, and the Arts call'd Liberal, require a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and liberal, not a ſordid and low Soul, like that of a Poor Man (whom <hi>Alciat</hi>'s Embleme very well repreſents, by a Lad with one hand ſtretch'd up into the Air, with Wings faſtened to it, intimating a deſire to fly higher; but the other hand faſtened to a heavy Stone, hinders him:) For their Spirit being loaden with miſery, thinks of nothing but of the means how to live, and to be deliver'd from the heavy yoak of Neceſſity, which deprives them of the means of having either living or dumb Teachers; yea, makes them deſpiſe all the rigours of Laws, and oft-times abandons them to Rage and Deſpair, which makes them hate their miſerable life, and renders them maſters of thoſe of others: Hence not only Mutinies, Seditions and Revolts are commonly made by the Poor and Miſerable, lovers of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein they are ſure to loſe nothing, and may poſſibly gain; but alſo are almoſt the ſole Authors of Thefts, Murders, and Sacriledges. Whereas Rich Perſons, having from their birth receiv'd ſuch good Inſtruction as the poor want, are more ſtay'd in their Actions, and better inclin'd to Honeſty and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which without Fortunes or Eſtates can never produce any thing great and conſiderable; whence, in our Language, Riches are juſtly ſtiled Means; without aſſiſtance whereof, Juſtice can neither render to every one what belongs to him, nor repel the Enemies of the State by a juſt War, whereof Money is the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and principal Strength. Upon this account they are ſought after by all the World, and are not only the end of the nobleſt part of Morality and Oeconomy, (Families, which are the Pillars of a State, not being preſerv'd but by the lawful acquiſition of Wealth; in which, for this reaſon, ſome Politicians place Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but all agree, that they ſerve for an Ornament thereunto and heighten its luſtre); but thoſe who have parted with them cannot live without them, but are conſtrained to beg of others. And in Policy, whether Riches be acquired or come by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they are always in eſteem; as on the contrary, Poverty is diſparag'd with reproach, and is a ſign either of baſeneſs of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or of Negligence and profuſion. Hence a Poor Man is as unfit to be truſted with a Publick Charge, as with a ſum of Money; and 'tis not without reaſon, that he who is diſtreſs'd with Poverty is extreamly aſham'd of it, this defect hindring and being a <hi>remora</hi> to all his deſigns: Whereas Riches raiſe the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, incite to great Attempts, and ſerve for a ſpur to Virtue, which thrives by Praiſe and Glory, but freezes and languiſhes by the Contempt and Deriſion inſeparable from Poverty; which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66371:15"/>
indeed hath been commended by the ſame Sacred Mouth which requires us to turn the other cheek to him that ſtrikes us upon the one; yet this hinders not, but that (ſpeaking naturally, as we do here) 'tis better to defend ones ſelf, than to be beaten patiently.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That in matter of Wiſedom we ought to refer our ſelves to the wiſeſt of all Men, <hi>Solomon</hi>; who prays God to give him <hi>neither Riches,</hi> for fear of Pride; <hi>nor Poverty,</hi> for fear of becoming a Thief; but a middle Eſtate: For, as too great Plenitude and an Atrophy are equally contrary to Health, which conſiſts in a moderation and temper of qualities; ſo the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Perſons extreamly Rich, and that of Begger (the degree here under conſideration) is equally an enemy to Wiſedom: And if in any caſe we ought to deſire the Golden Mediocrity, 'tis in the acquiſition of Wiſedom, eſpecially of Virtue, which conſiſts in Mediocrity; either extreme whereof, is the Territory of Vice.</p>

            <p>AS there is in all ſublunary Bodies a vital and celeſtial Spirit, without which neither Food nor Phyſick hath any virtue,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and which is the principle of all actions and motions of mix'd Bodies;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Glaſs.</hi>
               </note> ſo all thoſe Bodies have in them an incorruptible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, partaking of a celeſtial Nature, which the Chymiſts call Virgin-Earth, and is the Matter whereof Glaſs is form'd, being found in all ſorts of Bodies capable of calcination and vitrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but chiefly in Nitre, Saltpetre, Sand, Shels, certain Stones, Wood, and Plants, from which they draw Glaſs, different in beauty, according to the Matter whence it is extracted by means of a moſt violent fire, which reſolving the compound, conſumes all its parts except that vitreous matter, which is proof againſt its violence. We owe its Invention, by <hi>Pliny</hi>'s teſtimony, to certain Merchants of Nitre, who having landed in <hi>Phoenicia</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Judaea,</hi> near a Lake call'd <hi>Cendevia,</hi> which is at the foot of Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> whence flows the River <hi>Belus</hi> or <hi>Pagida,</hi> of ſmall extent; and making their Kitchin upon the Sand of this River, us'd ſome clods of their Nitre, as a Trevet for their Kettle; and the heat of the fire melting the Sand and Nitre into Glaſs, they took notice of it, and publiſh'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Afterward Moulds were found out, wherein to caſt it into all ſorts of figures; Pipes or Tubes to run it in; others to blow it, and give it all ſorts of Colours, which almoſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ariſe from the very ſubſtance of the Glaſs, without other mixture, only by the wind and blaſt manag'd according to the

rules of Art; as alſo Mills, to calcine and pulveriſe Gravel, Stones, or Sand; amongſt which, that of <hi>Vilturne</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Eſtampes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is moſt excellent for this uſe; for which likewiſe they imploy the Aſhes of a Plant call'd <hi>Salicot, (Salt-wort,</hi> or <hi>Glaſs-wort</hi>) which grows in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> nam'd likewiſe <hi>Soude,</hi> becauſe heretofore it ſerv'd only to glaſe earthen Pots.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, As there are but two things that can open Bodies in order to their ſeparation, namely, Water and Fire; which is verifi'd by the proofs made by Refiners of Gold and Silver; ſo there are but two things to ſeparate, to wit, the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil, and the Fix'd. Fire commonly ſeparates the Volatil, ſuch as ſulphureous and aqueous things are; and Water ſeparates the Fix'd, as the Salt from the earthy parts. Of Fix'd things, ſome are ſo in part, as the ſame Salt; others intirely, or altogether, as Earth; which is either ſlimy, clayie, or ſandie, which laſt ſpecies is made of the two former, as is ſeen in Rivers, where the Water having waſh'd away the fat part, nothing remains but the Sand: By which means Nature renders Valleys and low Places more fruitful; and men, by her example, have oftentimes rais'd, meliorated, and render'd low and marſhy places, formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, fit for culture, by ſtirring the Earth during the Rain and Floods, which by this means carries away all the fat and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous parts from the higher places into the lower, rendring the Mountains and Hills ſandy, and conſequently unfruitful and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. For, as Sand is incorruptible, being neither putrifi'd by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor conſum'd by Fire; ſo neither can it generate any thing, nor be turn'd into any other nature, like other ſpecies of the Earth, which ſerve for nutriment of Plants and ſome Inſects, and for the production of Animals. On the contrary, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves things buried in it, as appears by Mummies kept in it for two or three thouſand years; and Fruits, which are kept no way better than in Sand. Now, as Sand is the Matter of Glaſs (for any Sand melted in the Fire vitrifies) ſo Glaſs ſuits with the nature of its Principle, being, like it, incorruptible and eternal; yea, being it ſelf one of the Principles of Nature, according to modern Chymiſts, who reckon four; namely, Mercury, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Water; Sulphur, or Oyl, correſponding to Air; Salt, to Fire; and Glaſs, to Earth; which Glaſs is found clean and pure in the centre of all mix'd Bodies, there being nothing but may be reduc'd into aſhes, and no aſhes but of which Glaſs may be made, which they call a ſhining and not burning Fire, having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with that of Heaven, as the Fire kindled in Sulphur, and any oylie Matter, is both burning and ſhining; and that which is in Lime and Salts is burning, and not ſhining, ſuch as is ſeen in Potential Cauteries, but not (as others have ſaid) in Coals, which have ſome although a weak light. Glaſs wants but one thing, and that is the removing its brittleneſs or fragility; were it not for which, it would be the moſt precious thing in the World.

Of the poſſibility hereof a certain Artiſt having ſhewn a tryal to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> hath rais'd a deſire in others to make like attempts, which have hitherto been unſucceſsful. Moreover, the Tranſparence of Glaſs, caus'd by the ſimplicity and tenuity of its parts, is incompetible with the conſiſtence which renders things ductile and malleable, which is a tenacious viſcoſity, and oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous humidity, from whence opacity proceeds; as appears by Horns and colour'd Glaſs, which is leſs tranſparent then other, by reaſon of the unctuoſity of the Sulphur employ'd to give it that extraneous colour.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That <hi>Archimedes,</hi> in his Fabrick of a Glaſs-Sphere, was as judicious, in reference to the matter he choſe, as the form; ſince the Matter of the Heavens being incorruptible and diaphanous, they cannot be repreſented better than by Glaſs, which hath both thoſe qualities. Moreover, all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt Bodies of Nature are of a vitreous ſubſtance; as, amongſt others, the firſt of all the Heavens, call'd the Cryſtalline. 'Tis held, That the glorified Bodies are luminous and tranſparent, and (according to ſome) of a vitreous Nature; which is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perfection of every Body, and ſhall be alſo communicated to the Earth at the laſt Judgment, to be executed by Fire, which brings Mettals to their higheſt degree of excellence; for by the help of Lead, Gold it ſelf is turn'd into Glaſs, ſo pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> Paradiſe is pav'd with ſuch Glaſs of Gold; and in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> God's Throne is made of it; the word <hi>Hamal</hi> being a fit Etymologie for our <hi>Eſmah</hi> (or, <hi>Enamel</hi>) which is nothing but Glaſs. And the affinity or correſpondence of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals with Glaſs is ſo great, that, like them, it is extracted out of Sand, elaborated in a Furnace, receiving the alliances of Nitre, Copper, and the Load-ſtone, which they mingle in its Mine, to get an attractive quality of Glaſs as well as of Iron. With puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd Glaſs, call'd <hi>Sal Alcali,</hi> they counterfeit the Diamond, Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, Turcoiſe, Ruby, and other precious Stones. The Eye it ſelf, the nobleſt part of Man, ſymboliſes with Glaſs, by that cryſtalline humour wherein the point of the viſual ray terminates. But as all things in the World, like Fortune which governs them (whom the Poet deſcribes of Glaſs) are no ſooner arriv'd to the point of their perfection, but they are moſt ſubject to be corrupted; ſo Fragility is inſeparable from Glaſs, arriv'd to that high degree; which proceeds from the connexion of the Fix'd and the Volatil, which cannot but be brittle between two bodies extreamly arid, as the aſhes of Glaſs-wort and Fern are with Sand.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That as Gold is the Maſter-piece of Nature, ſo is Glaſs of Art, which cannot produce any thing more noble. Hence in <hi>France</hi> the making of it is permitted only to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſs or Gentry, as a mark of the nobleneſs of Glaſs, the faireſt and cleaneſt of all Bodies, as partaking the moſt of Light, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and divineſt of all ſublunary Bodies, to which alone its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords paſſage through its imperceptible pores, being by that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66371:17"/>
means the moſt uſeful and delightful piece of Architecture; the beauties and proportions whereof cannot be ſeen but by Light, half of which Lattices intercept, but Glaſs communicates intire; ſerving, moreover, to correct the defects of ſight in old men, by Spectacles; and of the Countenance, in Looking-glaſſes; by means of which, Man perfectly knows himſelf. But to judg how Glaſs may be malleable, we muſt know that it is compos'd of two Subſtances; the one, Earthy; the other, Gummous, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for cement to unite thoſe dry parts, whoſe connexion in any Body whatſoever is impoſſible, but by aerious humidity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Earthy parts would fall to duſt. Now to remedy the brittleneſs of Glaſs, 'twere expedient to find out two Matters whoſe union might be cloſer, or to link them together bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by ſome more humid and oleaginous Matter than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, which would no more hinder the tranſparence of Glaſs than it doth that of <hi>Talk,</hi> which is wholly oleaginous in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and nevertheleſs diaphanous and flexible. The Fire likewiſe, being very ſharp and violent, conſumes almoſt all the moiſture of Glaſs, and makes it more brittle, for which reaſon it ought to be moderated.</p>

               </note> and the moſt apparent token of the Beauty and Goodneſs of the Soul; ſo is it the moſt deſired: Love, the tranſcendent of all concupiſcible Powers, being it ſelf nothing elſe but a deſire of Beauty; and Good, the object of the Will, being nothing elſe but the ſame with Fair. But this Paſſion is moſt conſpicuous in Women, who have receiv'd Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as all their portion from Nature, and that wherein all their power and authority over Men conſiſts. Now Beauty being ſubject to the deſtiny of all other things, 'tis reaſon that Art ſupply the defects of Nature, for preſerving that rich treaſure from the injuries of Time and Years, by variety of Paints; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from the perſons of Women, as the deſire of being fair is natural to them.

Theſe Coſmeticks, beſides Contentment and good Nouriſhment, the natural and internal Principles of Beauty, (amongſt the ſpecies of which Nouriſhment, Aſſes milk was us'd by <hi>Poppaea, Nero</hi>'s Miſtreſs) may be divided into ſuch as only cleanſe the ſpots and obſcurities of the ſkin, ſuch as poliſh it, give it luſtre, take away wrincles, ſoften and ſmooth it; and ſuch as colour it. The firſt are the moſt innocent, being nothing but ſimple Waters diſtill'd of Flowers, as Lillies, Nenufar, Bean-flowers, Primroſe, ſeeds of Cucumber and Melon, roots of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66371:17"/>
Dock, Serpentine, Cuckow-pint, <hi>Solomon's</hi>-Seal, Gladon, Kidney-beans, Lupines, the Liquor diſtilling from the branch of a Vine wounded, Juice of Limons diſtill'd in <hi>Balneo-Mariae,</hi> and May-dew. Of the ſecond ſort, the gentleſt are Whites of Eggs, Conſummates of Veal, Sheeps-marrow, Snail-water, the Oyls of Almonds, Seeds of Gourd, Myrrh and Camphire, and above all, the no leſs famous than rare Oyl of <hi>Talk,</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Stone of all Coſmeticks. As for colouring materials, there are but two ſorts in <hi>Europe,</hi> where Beauty conſiſts in a lively Whiteneſs; namely, Whites and Reds: Reds are made of Sanders temper'd in Vinegar, the ſhavings of Braſil or Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, in Allum-water; or, of Vermillion. Whites are made commonly of Sublimate, Ceruſe, or Spaniſh-white, waſh'd in the water of wild Tanſey, or of Pearls calcin'd and apply'd as Vermillion, by thoſe who account nothing in Nature more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Beauty. The Teeth, Hair, and Hands, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to Handſomneſs, ſo they have their peculiar Coſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. The Teeth are poliſh'd by Powders and Opiates; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Acidum of Sulphur, and the Spirit of Vitriol mingled with common Water. The Hair receives ſuch colour as is moſt agreeable in each Country: In <hi>Italy</hi> moſt Women guild theirs with an ounce of Honey, a drachm of Saffron, and the yolk of an Egg mingl'd in Barbers-ſuds; or elſe they rub the Comb well with Oyl of Maſtick and Tartar. On the contrary, at <hi>Raguſa</hi> they black the Hair with Litharge, Black-lead, or with leaden Combs. In <hi>France</hi> they powder them, to make them white. At <hi>Tunis,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Barbary,</hi> the Women black the ends of their Fingers, Nails, and Lips with green Walnut-ſhells, as our Ladies and Courtiers lay black patches upon their Faces, to heighten or ſet off its whiteneſs the more. In fine, there is no part of the Body but receives its Fucus and Colour; only the Eye, like the Soul, whoſe Mirror it is, is ſubject to no alteration of colour; from which Nature hath with good reaſon left it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, that being unprepoſſeſs'd of any, it might be the judg of true Beauty.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, 'Tis injurious to blame the Artificial Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of Ladies, ſince nothing can pleaſe us in any other things without it; Natural Beauty being like a rough Diamond, unleſs Art poliſh it, and give it a foil. That we differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we owe to Artifice; being all equal by Nature. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Palaces appear ſo only by reaſon of their incruſtations of Marble, Guildings, and Pictures; and Painting it ſelf, whoſe excellence is nothing but the cunning mixture of Colours, is heighten'd and preſerv'd by the ſuperinduction of Varniſh. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is flat without Quavers and Sharps, which are diſguiſings of the Voice. All the Arts ſerve for nothing but the ornament and embeliſhment of Man. What is Eloquence, with all its flowers and colours of Rhetorick, but a Fucus of natural Diſcourſe? or Pleading, but the Art of ſetting off a Fact well, and rendring
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66371:18"/>
it plauſible? The Complements and Civilities of Courts, what are they elſe but a cloaking and diſguiſing of the thoughts? The truth is, Life being nothing but a Comedy, wherein the habits, actions, and diſcourſes are only diſguiſes; are we to think it ſtrange that Women, who allways play one of the principal parts in it, ſometimes borrow Masks to diſguiſe their Countenances? And if the inſinuations and praiſes, made uſe of by Men to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs them, are nothing but flatteries, why ſhould not they too reciprocally endeavour to deceive Men, whilſt they repreſent for the object of their Lies only the Image of Artificial Beauty?</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Countenance being the Tablet and Mirror of the Soul; as Hypocriſie and Lying in the Soul, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Candour and Sincerity, without which there would be no confidence nor true Friendſhip in the World, but perpetual diſſimulations and diffidences; ſo a Fucus upon the Face is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and the more pernicious in that it is a ſpeaking Lye: For as a Liar ſpeaks otherwiſe than he thinks, and hath another thing in his Mind than upon his Tongue; ſo a painted Face ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears outwardly wholly other then what it really is; unjuſtly covering, under the plaiſter and tincture of a Fucus, its natural imperfections and defects; which to go about to mend, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Wiſedom of God, the Author thereof, who diſpoſing all things wiſely, hath perhaps deny'd the advantage of Beauty to certain Perſons, out of fore-ſight that they would abuſe it; and who otherwiſe having imprinted the Character of his Divinity upon our Countenances, the Perſon that paints and diſguiſes the ſame, ſeems to be ingrateful, and unworthy of ſuch a favour; yea, to deprive himſelf of all credit among honeſt men: For, who will give belief to the Words of one that wears a Lye upon his Fore-head? Beſides that in time thoſe Mixtures alter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the health of the whole Body; Sublimate (amongſt the reſt) the commoneſt of all Coſmeticks: Not to mention the danger of letting it get into the eyes, and more of ſwallowing it down, it wrinkles the skin, renders the eyes hollow, blacks the teeth, and corrupts the breath.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, ſince Beauty is one of the four gifts of the Body, it ought not to be of worſe condition than the other three, Health, Strength, and Goodneſs of the Senſes; but 'tis lawful to preſerve and encreaſe the ſame ſo far as we can, eſpecially that of the Viſage, which being the Mirror of the Deity, ſhould be carefully adorn'd and embelliſh'd; conſidering too, that our Lord commands us in the Goſpel to waſh our Faces, and ſuffer'd his own Feet to be annointed with precious Unguents; the uſe whereof was common among the Ancients, who annointed the Head, and all the reſt of the Body, with Aromatick Oyls and Compoſitions, more for Beauty than for Health. And Phyſick, in one of its parts call'd <hi>Coſmetica,</hi> treats of Fucuſſes, and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body and Face; which the Law approves in <hi>L.</hi> 21. <hi>ff. De Auro Mundo,</hi> making four ſorts of Fucus, namely, for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66371:18"/>
Pleaſure, Health, Ornament, and Cleanneſs. Moreover, 'twould ſeem a contempt of that Divine Gift of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beauty, not to preſerve it. And as no man, being to chuſe a dwelling-houſe, but prefers a handſom and agreeable one before another; ſo, if Souls had the choice of their Bodies when they come into the World, they would undoubtedly take the faireſt and beſt ſhap'd, becauſe they might exerciſe their operations beſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And indeed the Soul is ſo curious of this Beauty, that as ſoon as any ſtroke, or other external injury deforms the Body, it ceaſes not to repair the ruines thereof; and without the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual induſtry which ſhe imploys, not only to re-eſtabliſh the perpetual deperdition of our triple ſubſtance, but alſo to cauſe re-generation of the conſumed fleſh, the re-union of parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by ſolution of continuity, and to reduce to a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation the depravations thereof, there would be more Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters than Men. Why then ſhould it be a crime for Art, which perfects Nature, to aſſiſt her in this work, by taking away what is ſuperfluous, or adding what is deficient; which are alſo the two parts of Phyſick.</p>

               </note> wherein it grows in abundance, is nam'd by the Indians <hi>Petun</hi>; by others, for its great virtues, <hi>Herba Sancta</hi>; and <hi>Jean Nicot,</hi> Embaſſador of <hi>Francis</hi> II. having firſt brought out of <hi>Portugal</hi> into <hi>France</hi> ſome of the ſeed of it to Queen <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> with the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of its virtues, it became denominated from him in French <hi>Nicotiane,</hi> or <hi>Herbe a la Reine,</hi> (the Queens Herb;) as in <hi>Italy</hi> it was term'd <hi>Herbe de Santa Croce,</hi> (of Holy Croſs) becauſe a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of that name was the firſt that brought it to <hi>Rome.</hi> Some others ſtill call it <hi>Antarctical Bugloſſe, Henbane</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Wound-wort.</hi> It grows, many times, to the height of three Cubits, with a ſtraight and thick ſtalk, ſo fat that it ſeems an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Honey; it ſends forth ſundry large branches, with many leaves long and broad, rounder than thoſe of great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, ſomewhat like thoſe of great <hi>Perſonata,</hi> or Bur-dock; fleſhy, fat, and little rough, of a pale green, unpleaſing ſmell, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting taſte: On the top of the ſtalk it hath many flowers, oblong, hollow, and large, in form of a Trumpet, of a white inclining to purple; to which ſucceed little ſlender cods or huſks, full of a browniſh ſeed, ſmaller than that of Poppey. Its root is thick,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66371:19"/>
hath ſeveral lobes, is woody, yellow within, bitter, eaſily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from its bark, and, like all Herbs hot and dry, (for this is ſo in the ſecond degree) it requires moiſt places and ſhadow, and delights to be cultivated. Moreover, 'tis kept in Gardens, as well for its beauty, as for its faculties of curing abundance of Maladies; to which 'tis the more proper, in that it hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuoſity familiar to our Body, whoſe excrementitious humours (the ſeed of moſt Diſeaſes) it potently reſolves. For as Plants are of a middle nature between Minerals and Animals; ſo they are more proper and ſafe for the preſervation and reſtoring of Man's health than Animals themſelves, which by reaſon of their ſimilitude act leſs on us; or than Minerals and inanimate Bodies, which through the too great diverſity of their nature act with too much violence.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That this Herb heats, reſolv's, deterges, and is ſomewhat aſtringent; whence it is, that its leafs apply'd hot to the head cure the Meagrim and old headach, proceeded from cold or wind; and if the pain be contumacious, you muſt rub the place firſt with oyl of Orange-flowers. Moreover, 'tis us'd for the Cramp, and all other pains ariſing from the ſame cold humour; particularly, for that of the Teeth, by filling them with the leaf bruis'd. Its decoction in common Water is good for maladies of the Breaſt of the ſame kind, as the Aſthma, and old Coughs, cauſing expectoration of the phlegm which produces it. Alſo, Its ſmoak taken by the noſe, and ſwallow'd down by reſpiration, frequently cures the Aſthmatick, and ſuch as have ulcers in the Lungs; by the ſame reaſon that <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, he ſaw a Baker's Wife cur'd of one, by frequent reſpiration of a hot and dry Air, which ſhe attracted as ſhe put her bread into the Oven, and took it out again. The leaves roaſted under the aſhes, and apply'd hot with their aſhes to the Navil, are good for the Wind-collick, and other obſtructions of the Bowels proceeding from the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid cauſes; eſpecially, for crudities of the Stomach. The Indian women make uſe of it to kill worms, making their children take a very little quantity of it with Sugar; but more ſafely by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leafs to the Navil, and adding a very little of the juice in lotions. The ſame, apply'd, helps the Stone-Collick, and is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantageous in ſtrangulations of the womb, being laid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the Navil; and if Women have their uſual ſwoonings, the ſmoak puff'd into their noſtrils fetches them again. They alſo eaſe the pains of ſwoln limbs, and cold Gowts. Scurf, Itch, Child-blanes, and clefts of the heels, proceeding from cold, are cur'd by being rub'd therewith, as alſo venomous wounds and bitings: Whereof the Spaniards bear witneſs, who ſeizing upon a part of the Indies, the Cannibals aſſaulted them with enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd Arrows, the wounds whereof they cur'd by ſprinkling them with prepar'd Sublimate; all their ſtock whereof being ſpent, the wounded dy'd, till it was found that the juice of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, apply'd, wrought the ſame effect. Moreover, the leaves
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66371:19"/>
ſtop the blood of freſh wounds, and agglutinate them. The juice heals old Ulcers, and prevents Gangreens. The Indian Prieſts, obſerving all theſe virtues, transferr'd them to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of their Religion: For being interrogated concerning the events of War, they ſuck the ſmoak of this Herb with long Canes, then ſuffer themſelves to fall down, and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards awakened, relate wonders to their hearers, giving them to underſtand that they have had divine Dreams. They make uſe of it likewiſe, to recover wearineſs, and ſupport hunger, burning certain ſhells, and powdering them with equal quantity of theſe leaves, of which they make pills, which they lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lower lip and the teeth, continually ſucking their liquor, which, if it nouriſh not, at leaſt it takes away the ſenſe of the inconveniences of hunger and thirſt; which is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſecret, whereby they travel two or three days together. Poſſibly by their example our Sailers, and Souldiers who have been at Sea, take Tobacco with ſo much pleaſure, that ſince they have once gotten a habit of it, they cannot be broken from it by the ſevereſt Laws: For to alledg the prejudice of exceſſive taking Tobacco, is of no more moment than what ſhould be ſaid againſt Wine for its abuſe; it having been ſaid by many, That thoſe things muſt be excellent which are capable of being abus'd; and this may always be inferr'd from that immutable practice of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, That there is a great familiarity between it and our Nature; ſince the Grand Signior cannot hinder his Turks from the uſe of it, who nevertheleſs abſtain from Wine.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That if ever <hi>Pliny</hi>'s condemning and decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Drugs and forreign Roots was reaſonable, it was chiefly at the time when the Trade of the Indies tranſmitted them to us in <hi>Europe,</hi> and, with their uſe, new and unknown Diſeaſes: Amongſt which Medicaments, Tobacco, as 'tis the moſt common, ſo 'tis the more dangerous, in that a falſe opinion of health and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation gives it credit, although its temperament, hot and dry in a high degree, renders it not only contrary to young and chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick people, and to the ſtomach, which it provokes to vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but by a peculiar malignity 'tis an enemy to the Brain, cauſing Stupefaction, Vertigo, Lethargy, and a dulneſs of all its Powers, and by a violent deſiccation ſpoling its natural conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: For 'tis ſo far from diſ-inebriating, that, on the contrary, by its ſharp and biting vapours it fills the head, and intoxicates much more; like <hi>Opium,</hi> the herb of which it reſembles; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſerving for any thing but to trouble the Reaſon; upon which account Tobacco is a ſworn enemy to Hellebore, which every one knows is the remedy for Folly, and promotes the good conſtitution of the Brain. As for the evacuation of phlegm, for which it is eſteem'd; beſides that 'tis a dangerous thing to purge ſuch as are in perfect health, as moſt takers of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco are; 'tis certain, that all ſort of ſmoak is bad for the Brain, which it clouds and dulls, by ſtirring the animal Spirits,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66371:20"/>
and filling the cavities of its Ventricles, which it alſo infects by its ſmell, and pricks its Membranes by its Acrimony, inſeparable from every kind of fume; it being found, that men have had black ſcirrhous ſpots in the Meninges, produc'd by the vapours of Tobacco they were accuſtom'd to take; which Cuſtom alſo enuring Nature in that manner to evacuate the pituitous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof the Brain is never deſtitute, if the uſe thereof be at any time interrupted, great accidents happen by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, which had gotten a long courſe that way, and turn'd the Cuſtom of it into Neceſſity; which uſe. (beſides) being ſhameful, and proper only to Rogues and Robbers, whom our Arreſts compriſe under the name of <hi>Takers of Tobacco</hi>; it ſeems that the name and effects of this Herb are of as bad an odour as its ſmoak.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Brain being the ſource not only of all cold maladies, but alſo of moſt affections of the Lungs, whoſe ſcituation and ſpongy ſubſtance makes them the Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of all the ſuperiour Parts; whence the Aſthma, Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, Empyema, Phtiſick, Cough, Orthopnaea, and other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Breaſt, caus'd by defluxion of humidity falling from the Brain upon the Lungs; Phyſick hath invented three ſorts of Remedies to divert the courſe of thoſe Excrements, namely, <hi>Errhines, Ptarmicks,</hi> and <hi>Apophlegmatiſms. Errhines</hi> compos'd of Rue, Gentian, Celandine, Origanum, and other deterſive Simples, attract the phlegm adhering to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Brain, and evacuate it by the Noſe. <hi>Ptarmicks,</hi> or <hi>Sternutatories,</hi> which are made of the above-mention'd things powder'd, or of Pepper and white Hellebore, Euphorbium, Caſtoreum, and Pyrethrum, by their acrimony ſtimulating the expulſive faculty of the Brain, to excretion of the pituitous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which are in its Ventricles. <hi>Apophlegmatiſms,</hi> us'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Maſticatories or Gargariſms, or by rubbing the palate of the Mouth, are made of Maſtick, roaſted Raiſins, Hyſſop, Origanum, bark of Caper-roots, Muſtard, Turbith, and ſuch other things as melt and attenuate phlegm, and make it diſtil down the Palate of the Mouth. Now Tobacco may ſerve for theſe three Uſes, being taken either by the Noſe, or in the Mouth, as a Maſticatory; but not in ſmoak, which is an enemy to the Brain and Spirits.</p>

it into Swords, Axes, Spears, and Javelins; till encreaſing in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to offend at greater diſtance, he invented Slings and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, then ambulatory Machins to enter Places, and beat down the Walls of Cities: Yea, Fire was likewiſe brought into uſe; by ſome, that of Burning-glaſſes, with which <hi>Archimedes</hi> burnt the Ships of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who beſieg'd the City of <hi>Syracuſe</hi>; by others, Granado's, and Pitch-barrels ſet on fire, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did at the Siege of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But all this was nothing, in compariſon to the Gun; which although, according to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Relations, invented in the 85. year of our Lord, in the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> where moſt other Inventions began, by one of their Kings, nam'd <hi>Vitey,</hi> a great Magician; yet appear'd not in <hi>Europe</hi> till about the year 1350. when it was found out by one named <hi>Bertoldus,</hi> a German, occaſionally, by the experience which he ſaw happen in a mixture of Sulphur and Nitre, inclos'd in a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel over the Fire, in order to an operation of Chymiſtry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he made profeſſion. This miſchievous and diabolical Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having been hatch'd in the Country of the North, (whence the Scripture aſſures us that all evil is to come) was afterwards carried from thence into <hi>Italy,</hi> and then into <hi>France, Anno</hi> 1366. by ſome Germans, who alſo gave two pieces of Artillery to the Venetians who beſieg'd <hi>Claudia Foſſa,</hi> a Town belonging to the Genoeſes, from whom it was preſently taken by theſe new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines; which, although ſmall, and ill made, being only of Iron bow'd, and hoop'd together with Iron bands, yet fail'd not to produce their effect.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Since Kings are call'd Gods in Scripture, 'twas reaſonable they ſhould be arm'd with Thunder, which might make them reverenc'd by others; there being no better expedient to preſerve Majeſty, than Terrour. And as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of men renders War in theſe laſt Ages as neceſſary as juſt; ſo, without doubt, the moſt powerful way of overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt alſo be the moſt advantageous and conſiderable. This is it which hath made Artillery ſo eſteem'd by Sovereigns, that they have lodg'd it in Arſenals and Magazens with their Treaſuries, and given it in charge to great Maſters, principal Officers of their Crown; making a ſhew of it to Strangers, as the abridgment of their Power, and a mark of their Soveraignty. Moreover, 'tis by this Cannon-Law that all their Quarrels are decided: Theſe are the laſt Embaſſadors which carry their Commands with exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and thoſe whoſe ears are ſtopp'd to their other Reaſons, always find peremptory ones in the mouth of their Cannons. For as the Moſaical Law was given amongſt Thunders and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; and that of Chriſtianity confirm'd by a Tempeſt of Wind and Fire: In like manner, Princes at this day eſtabliſh not their Laws more powerfully than by help of the Thunder-claps of their Artillery; as the Conqueſt of the new World makes manifeſt, the eaſineſs whereof is due only to this Invention, which made thoſe Nations receive Laws of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66371:21"/>
and State from ſuch as ſhot the firſt Cannons amongſt them, at the report of which they preſently yielded; conceiving that there was ſomething divine in thoſe Machins, which have likewiſe been the Keys of Gold, wherewith they have enriched <hi>Europe</hi> by another way of Alchimy than that to which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of this Science employ it. Moreover, by this Invention, which ſecures Commerce, the boldneſs has been taken to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the World, and deſpoil it of all its Riches; the Conqueſt whereof hath been more or leſs eaſie, according as its uſe was known or unknown to the invaded Nations. The truth is, he that ſhall make compariſon of the ancient Machins, Rams, Slings, Baliſts, or Bows, with any Fire-Arms whatever, will find that theirs were but Childrens-play, in reſpect of our true Combates. And ſo far is this Invention from doing wrong to Valour, that (on the contrary) it advances the ſame to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point: For if Valour appears only proportionally to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers it incurs, then there is moſt room for the exerciſing of it where the greateſt are preſent. Now the ruine of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, is not conſiderable, in reſpect of the publick advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to which the good of every one, conſider'd by himſelf, is ſubordinate; ſeeing that theſe Arms ſerve as well for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as the Offenſive, the one and the other being only reſpective, regard being had no thoſe that employ them; that which ſerves for defence to one, being offence to the other. And beſides, the Sword, which for ſo many Ages hath kill'd many more, would be more ſubject to this blame. But, on the contrary, the excellence of a Weapon conſiſts in killing and terrifying, ſince 'tis an Inſtrument of War, whereof the principal end is to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Enemies; for the fewer are left, the ſooner it is ended; and in the ſpeedy razing of their Fortreſſes, conſiſts the beating down of their Pride and Confidence. Wherefore, ſeing no Invention in the World can be without its inconveniences, one or two cannot counter-balance the good which Artillery hath brought, by the Conqueſt of ſo many Kingdoms and Riches; ſo that if Arms are moſt uſefull for the preſervation and amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a State, the Invention of the Gun muſt be the more ſo, inaſmuch as it is the moſt powerful Inſtrument of War, ſurpaſſing all other Arms in execution; and making a Prince not only obey'd during War, but alſo reſpected and redoubted in Peace, during which 'tis employ'd to teſtify the publick rejoycings and gladneſſes.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, As Philoſophy is the nobleſt exerciſe of Man, ſo Morality is the faireſt part of Philoſophy; whence <hi>Socrates</hi> acquir'd the honour of having brought it down from Heaven. The moſt excellent part of Morality is the Politicks, of which the nobleſt piece is the Art Military, as Mechaniques are the nobleſt part of this Art. Hence <hi>Caeſar</hi> is more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in deſcribing the conſtruction of his Bridges, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, than his war-like exploits. Since then the Gun is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66371:21"/>
diſpute the goodlieſt part of the Mechanicks, it follows that the Gun and its Invention is the goodlieſt thing of the World. For the excellence of an Engine conſiſts in moving a great weight ſpeedily, and to the greateſt diſtance that may be, as the Cannon alone doth, whoſe power would be judg'd impoſſible, did not Experience atteſt it: Nor doth its violence depend upon the ordinary rules of Nature, the Principle of the regular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Body; but 'tis caus'd by the ſame Nature conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in a violent ſtate, in danger of admitting either a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or penetration of Dimenſions; to avoid which, ſhe ſometimes breaks the Cannon; or, if the ſame be too ſtrong, ſhe violently drives out the iron bullet, which hinders the free eruption of the inflamed matter, which, by reaſon of the rarefaction of its parts, requiring 10000 times more place than before, and not finding the ſame in the Cannon, iſſues forth to ſeek it; by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that an Exhalation inflam'd in the middle Region of the Air, diſengages it ſelf from its priſon, by breaking the Cloud which holds it inclos'd in its belly, thereby forming the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Thunders, whereof the ſhots of the Cannon are true Images upon Earth, where nothing comes nearer Thunder; and conſequently the Power of God, who oftentimes imploys thoſe Arms to puniſh the crimes of men: Whence Pagan Antiquity aſſign'd indeed ſeverally a Trident, a Sythe, a Bow a Helmet, a Lance, a Club, a Sword, and ſuch other Inſtruments, to their falſe Deities; but all attributed Thunder to the mightieſt of the Gods.</p>

And as there are two general and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66371:22"/>
cauſes of Diſeaſes; namely, <hi>Plethora,</hi> or Repletion; and <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> or depravation of the Humours: Blood-letting is the remedy of the former, and Purgation of the latter: But Blood-letting is the beſt and ſafeſt, cauſing leſs agitation and diſturbance in the Oeconomy of the Body than Purgatives, which are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily violent, and enemies of Nature; yea, it ſerves not only to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the juices which abound in exceſs, but ſometimes reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies their depravation, by correcting the hot and dry <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the Bowels, which is the cauſe of <hi>Cacochymie</hi>; becauſe Bleeding of its own Nature evacuates and makes revulſion, but, by accident refrigerates, and takes away obſtructions: Therefore <hi>Avicenna,</hi> and all his followers, enemies of Blood-letting, are ridiculous; alledging, That the Blood being (<hi>Fraenum Bitis</hi>) the bridle of choler, this becomes exaſperated and enflam'd, the leſs Blood there is to reſtrain it. For if there be any Humour that keeps Choler in order, it muſt be Phlegm, which is contrary thereto; and not Blood, which ſymboliſes with it by heat: But Blood-letting checks the impetuous motions of Choler, which it evacuates with the Blood, if it be in the greater Veſſels; and if out of them, as about the cavities of the Liver, it tempers them, correcting the ardent conſtitution of the Liver which produces it.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That by reaſon of Contraries, affections againſt Nature, as well as Health, have their ſeat in the Parts, Spirits, and Humours. The Parts are the ſeat of Maladies; the Spirits, of Symptoms and laeſion of Functions; and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, of the Morbifick cauſes, either antecedent or conjunct. And as theſe humours, which are the ſource and leven of moſt Diſeaſes, being in a natural ſtate, are in their proper place, in the quantity and quality requiſite to their Nature; ſo in a ſtate againſt Nature, they are out of their due place, and offend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in quantity or quality. To theſe three defects Phyſick op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Revulſion, Alteration, and Evacuation; this latter is done either by evacuating only the bad, by convenient ways in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; or the good with the bad, Blood-letting, which is defin'd an Evacuation of all the humours of the Body, by ſection of the Veſſels. For though the Blood be the Treaſure of Life, the Source of all Paſſion, and (if we believe <hi>Galen</hi>) the Seat of the Soul; nevertheleſs, its corruption, as that of the beſt things of the World, being ſo much the more dangerous as it is the moſt perfect and temperate of all the Humours, it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently evacuated out of the Body; not only in <hi>plenitude,</hi> where Nature requires nothing but to be diſcharg'd; but alſo in depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Blood, by mixture of the other Humours cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; of which the leſs there is, the more eaſily they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd by Nature, which wants not ſtrength to re-produce more laudable Blood than that from which ſhe was unburden'd: But regard muſt chiefly be had to the diſtinction of Veins, according to the diverſity of Diſeaſes. So the moſt apparent Veins of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66371:22"/>
arms are open'd when the Body is plethorick, without affection of any Part: If it be ſo by ſuppreſſion of the Moneths or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, the Vein of the Foot muſt be open'd: If it be by Choler, then that of the right arm: If by Melancholy, then that of the left arm, in regard of the ſituation of the Liver and Spleen; as for the various communication of the Veſſels the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick, Baſilick, or Median are choſen. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> opens the Vein of the Forehead call'd <hi>Praeparata,</hi> in pains of the Hinder part of the head; that of the <hi>Occiput,</hi> in fluxions of the Eyes; the <hi>Hypoglottides,</hi> or Veins under the Tongue, in the Squinancy, for derivation; that of the tip of the Noſe, or great Canthus of the Eye, in its Inflammations; the Jugulares and Salvatella, thoſe of the Temples; and, in brief, all others are open'd accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to the ſundry intentions of the Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Blood-letting is the greateſt of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; there being none ſooner communicated to all the Parts, which having need of nouriſhment, which is carried to them by the Veins, you cannot evacuate any one ſenſibly, but that motion will be communicated with all the Blood in the other Veins; that is to ſay, over all the Body. Its uſe was anciently ſo rare, that <hi>Galen</hi> and the Greeks made conſcience of letting Children blood before fourteen years of Age; and <hi>Avenzoar</hi> was accounted too ventrous in Phlebotomiſing his own Son at ſeven. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> appoints it in four caſes; in <hi>Inflammation, Metaſtaſis, Repletion,</hi> and <hi>Obſtruction.</hi> 'Tis above all neceſſary, when the Body is too replete, evidenced oft-times by ſpontaneous evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations at the Noſe, and Hemorroids; whether this Repletion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Veſſels,</hi> which are too full, and in danger of breaking; or the natural ſtrength, oppreſs'd under the weight of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: But it ſeems to me impertinent and unprofitable in caſe of Cacochymie without Repletion, which requires Purgatives to purifie the ſanguinary maſs, and not this bleeding Remedy: For, there being three principal ſeats of Cacochymie, to wit, the <hi>Firſt Region,</hi> the <hi>Veins,</hi> and the <hi>Habit of the Body</hi>; Blood-letting is alike unprofitable to them all. As for the Firſt Region, which is the ſink and channel of the humours, Blood-letting cannot reach thither, without emptying all the Blood of the Body; and ſhould it penetrate thither, it would draw thoſe excrementitious humours into the Veins, where they would corrupt the laudable Blood. But Cacochymie reſiding in the Region of the Veins, Purgation (which only eliminates the corrupted humours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the good and laudable) is more proper thereunto than Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomie; which, on the contrary, ſometimes evacuates the good juice, and not the vicious, when the ſame is impacted and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to ſome part remote from the open'd Vein. In fine, Blood-letting is as little profitable when the impurity is in the habit of the Body: Whence 'tis too hard to draw the humours into the Veins; but it is more expedient to reſolve and make them tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire by ſweats, exerciſe, abſtinence, and other labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66371:23"/>The Fourth ſaid, That Blood-letting is profitable in every vitioſity of the Blood, which either is corrupted in ſubſtance and quality, or offends in quantity, or cauſeth a fluxion upon ſome Part, or preſſes and loads it, or elſe is too much inflam'd: Nevertheleſs with this precaution, that regard is to be had to the Diſeaſe; the ſtrength, temper, age, ſex, habitation, cuſtom, and particular nature of the Patient. But generally, every great, hot, and acute Diſeaſe requires Phlebotomie; which, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is an enemy to cold Diſeaſes, and all crudities; becauſe it refrigerates, by the loſs of heat and ſpirits flowing out with the Blood. Alſo, diminution of ſtrength, caus'd by any evacuation or reſolution, prohibits bleeding; but not that where the ſtrength is oppreſs'd by abundance of humours, which muſt be preſently eliminated. Children, who need Blood for their growth, as breeding Women do for the nouriſhment of their Child; old men, who want heat and Spirits; thoſe who have ſmall Veins, or rare and ſoftiſh fleſh; ought not to be let blood but with great precautions. Nor is Phlebotomie to be adminiſtred in great cold or great heat, nor after great watchings and labours. And although the quantity of Blood depends upon the ſtrength, and the Diſeaſe, yet 'tis ſafeſt to take rather leſs; but by no means to imitate the Ancients, who let Blood till the ſwooning of the Patient, in Inflammations, violent Pains, and very burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; which they ſometimes cur'd by this courſe, but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caus'd a cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> to the whole Body, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of life.</p>

               </note> to the end to make himſelf known to men, hath alſo contracted the ſame in each part thereof, wherein we obſerve ſome ſhadow of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the Divine Eſſence into Three Perſons: And 'tis with this Ternary Number that he hath as 'twere ſtamp'd for his own Coin the nobleſt parts of the World, which the Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans have alſo for that reaſon divided into three; namely, The <hi>Intellectual,</hi> which are the Heavens, (the place of Intelligences); the <hi>Elementary,</hi> and the <hi>Animal</hi>; each of which is again divided into three parts; The Intellectual or Celeſtial, into the <hi>Heaven of Planets,</hi> the <hi>Firmament,</hi> and the <hi>Empyreal</hi>; The Elementary, into the <hi>Air, Water,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>; And the Animal, into <hi>Vegetable, Senſitive,</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> which is Man, who comprehends in himſelf <hi>eminently</hi> all thoſe parts of the World; the Elementary being in the <hi>Liver,</hi> the Animal in the <hi>Heart,</hi> the Intellectual in the <hi>Brain,</hi> wherein, as in its principal Sphere, the Rational Soul eſtabliſhes a particular World; every ones Head being a Globe, which is divided again into three parts, which are the <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi>: Amongſt which, the <hi>Imagination,</hi> the principle of the others motion and action, repreſents the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal World; <hi>Memory,</hi> ſerving for a ſubject matter to receive the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66371:23"/>
impreſſions of the ſpecies conſign'd to it, is the Elementary; and <hi>Judgment,</hi> the Intellectual. The three parts of each of which Worlds are again correſpondent to the ſame Faculties. The <hi>Imagination,</hi> upon account of the continual circumvolution of the Species, is the Heaven of Planets: The <hi>Memory,</hi> in reference to the fixation of the ſame Species, is their Firmament: And the <hi>Judgment,</hi> the higheſt of theſe Powers, is the <hi>Empyraeal.</hi> To the three parts of the Elementary, The <hi>Imagination,</hi> for its mobility and ſubtilty, is like the Air; <hi>Memory,</hi> for its ſoft humidity, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to receive all ſorts of Figures, may be compar'd to the Water; and <hi>Judgment,</hi> the baſe and foundation of the reſt, for the ſolidity of its conſiſtence and ſiccity, ſymbolizeth with the Earth. Laſtly, to the three parts of the Animal World; the <hi>Memory,</hi> receiving increaſe or diminution by humidity, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of vegetation, reſembles the Vegetable; the <hi>Imagination,</hi> by its heat and activity, the Animal; and the <hi>Judgment,</hi> the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. And though theſe three Faculties be united in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Soul, nevertheleſs they are different, not only in their temperaments, actions, and ages, but alſo in their ſeats; as that of <hi>Memory</hi> is the hinder part of the Brain, which people ſcratch to call any thing to mind; that of <hi>Imagination</hi> is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, whence they lift up their heads when they would vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently imagine any thing; and that of <hi>Judgment</hi> is the middle part, which is the cauſe why in a deep ſtudy people hold down the head. But to make choice of each in particular, their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations muſt be conſider'd: Some make very much noiſe, and little action; as Advocates and Proctors of a Court, who make much a do to put a buſineſs in order, to lay it open, and digeſt it, although without deciding any thing; and ſuch is the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> which unites and compounds the Species, repreſents them to the Judgment, carries them to the regiſter of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or extracts them out by Reminiſcence. Others make little buſtle, and much action; as Judges; and ſo doth the <hi>Judgment.</hi> The laſt have neither ſtir nor action; as the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who only tranſcribe what is dictated to them; and ſo doth the <hi>Memory,</hi> a paſſive Power. The Sciences themſelves, which fall under the Juriſdiction of the Mind, are alſo ſubject to each of theſe Faculties. <hi>Memory</hi> hath under it the <hi>Tongues, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Poſitive Theologie, Hiſtory, Humanity, Law, Geography, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, Herbary, and almoſt all the Theory of Phyſick.</hi> The <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> hath <hi>Eloquence, Poetry, Muſick, Architecture, Geodaeſie, Fortifications, moſt part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the Mathematiques, and all the Arts whoſe works depend only on the force of the Imagination.</hi> The <hi>Judgment</hi> hath <hi>Philoſophy, Scholaſtical Divinity, the Practice of Phyſick and Law, and all the Sciences which depend on ſoundneſs of reaſoning.</hi> Nevertheleſs, becauſe it ſeems that the <hi>Judgment</hi> cannot judg to its own advantage without injuſtice, being both Judg and Party; 'tis beſt to arbitrate in this ſort, and ſay, That the excellence and neceſſity of things being conſidered, or ſo far
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66371:24"/>
as they are for our profit, or that of others; for our own profit 'tis beſt to have a good Judgment, and leſs of Memory or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: For the Imagination ſerves more for Invention, and this to ruine its Author when it is deſtitute of Judgment; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to make a man admir'd; and Judgment, for conduct and government.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Since the Imagination gives the riſe to all the motions of the Soul, by the <hi>Species</hi> which it ſupplies to it, wherewith it forms the Paſſions in the Inferior Appetites, Deſires in the Reaſonable Appetite, namely, the Will; and Notions in the Underſtanding, which cannot know any thing but by the phantaſms or <hi>ſpecies</hi> forg'd in the Imagination; it muſt be the moſt excellent of all the Faculties of the Soul. Moreover, the Temper which conſtitutes it being the moſt laudable, and the Age wherein it prevails being the moſt perfect, its Actions muſt alſo be the moſt ſublime; ſince being not performable but by help of corporeal Organs, the more perfect theſe are, the more will the Minds actions be ſo too. Now the Qualities of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination have much more conformity to the Soul, according to the Opinion of ſome Ancients, of an igneous nature; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, an Entelechie and continual motion, which either cauſes or depends on heat, the moſt active quality of all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Brain being impregnate, renders the Spirit more lively, quick in retorts, and in all that they call <hi>Pointe d' Eſprit,</hi> or <hi>acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>; and inſpiring Enthuſiaſms to Poets. On the contrary, the Judicious, who want this Imaginative Virtue, are cold, heavy, and as tedious in converſation, as the other are agreeable and welcome: Yea, the Judgment it ſelf ows all its advantage to it: For if it were equitable, it would regulate it ſelf only by the <hi>ſpecies</hi> which the Imagination repreſents to it; and if it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and without having regard to the pieces offer'd to its view, will follow its own ſentiments, it runs the hazard of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a thouſand extravagances and impertinences. Yea, all the Judicious Sciences are ambiguous, and their followers divided; a ſure note of their weakneſs, as well as of that of Judgment which guids them; ſince Abſtracted Truth, its Object being unknown, it muſt leave the ſame in perpetual darkneſs, unleſs it borrow light from the Imagination. Moreover, the Sciences, Arts, and Diſciplines of this Faculty are all pleaſant, and as delightful and certain, as thoſe of Memory are labile, the Faculty only of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Liars. Yea, the maladies of the Imagination are in ſuch veneration, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls them Divine, as having mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous effects.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That there is no intire and perfect Good in this World, is verifi'd alſo in the Goods of the Mind, which are not often poſſeſs'd by one ſingle man, but every one hath his ſhare therein: For goodneſs of Wit, conſiſting in the excellence of his three Faculties, Imagination, Memory, and Judgment, the firſt of which forms the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> the ſecond preſerves, and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66371:24"/>
laſt judges of, and frames its Notions from them; 'tis a very rare thing to find a man poſſeſſing theſe three advantages in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree; beſides that, they are incompatible in one and the ſame ſubject, inaſmuch as they depend upon the contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments. The Memory on a hot and moiſt, ſuch as that of Children; which nevertheleſs muſt not be like water, which eaſily receives, but retains not, all ſorts of Figures; but it muſt be aerial, and have ſome conſiſtence and viſcoſity to retain the imprinted <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The Imagination requires a hot and dry temper, for fabricating and compoſing abundance of <hi>ſpecies</hi>; like that of cholerick and young men, who are inventive and induſtrious. The Judgment demands a conſtitution of Brain cold and dry, like that of melancholy and old men, to hinder the ſudden eruptions, or ſallies of the Mind; which therefore reaſons better when the Body is at reſt, than when it is in motion, which produces heat, as much an enemy to the operation of the Reaſonable Soul, as profitable to thoſe of the Senſitive or Vegetative, whoſe actions are perform'd by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Heat. But the Imagination cannot know any thing without Memory, which furniſhes it with <hi>ſpecies</hi>; nor this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, without help of the Imagination; nor the Judgment conceive and judg without the help of both. Nevertheleſs, as amongſt Qualities there is always one predominant; ſo amongſt theſe three Faculties, one commonly excels the reſt; and the Judgment is the more excellent, inaſmuch as 'tis pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Man; whereas the Imagination and Memory are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with Beaſts. So that the Judgment is our proper good, and is better worth cultivating than the Memory, to which they who wholly addict themſelves, are like bad Farmers, who improve others Commodities, and let their own periſh. On the contrary, they who only form their Judgment, acquire the true Treaſures of Wiſedom, and may be ſaid rich of their own Stock: But great Memories are commonly like <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Crow, adorn'd with borrow'd Plumes; and indeed raiſe admiration in the weak minds of the Vulgar, but not in thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſolid Truths, the Principle whereof is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Heaven, whence it comes, is elevated above the Earth. For Heaven is the ſource of Dew, whence it diſtills hither below, impregnated with all aethereal qualities and properties, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any other thing; whether it come by a tranſcola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuper-celeſtial Waters, which the Hebrews call <hi>Maim</hi> in the Dual Number, to ſignifie the Waters on high and thoſe below; or whether there be a Quinteſſence and Reſolution of the Heavens whence it proceeds, like thoſe Waters which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts diſtil from Bodies put into their Alembicks, indu'd with their odour and other qualities, and ſometimes augmented in virtues: Whence ſome Divines endeavour to derive the reaſon why <hi>Manna,</hi> which is nothing elſe but Dew condens'd, for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years together wanting one Moneth, and allotted by God for ſuſtenance of his people, had all ſorts of Taſtes; for (ſay they) Heaven, whence it fell, contains <hi>eminently,</hi> as the efficient equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal cauſe, all the forms of things to whoſe generation it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs here below; and therefore God employ'd this Dew to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſeveral kinds of each Aliment, And Honey, whoſe ſweetneſs is ſo familiar to our Nature, (yea, ſo priz'd by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that God promiſes his people nothing ſo frequently, to raiſe their longing after the Land which he had promis'd them) what elſe is it but this ſame Dew condens'd and gather'd by the Bees, who rubbing their thighs upon the flowers and leaves of Plants on which this Liquor falls, load themſelves therewith, and lodg it in their hives? Wherefore Naturaliſts ſeem too groſs, in teaching, Dew to be only a Vapour rais'd from the Earth, by the heat which the Sun leaves in the Air at his ſetting, and; for want of other ſufficient heat, unable to advance it ſelf higher than the tops of herbs: for its tenuity and effects mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the contrary; its tenuity much exceeding that of Water; witneſs their experiment, who make an egg-ſhell fill'd with Dew aſcend alone to the top of a Pike plac'd a little bowing in the Sun; which it will not do, if fill'd with common Water, how rarefi'd ſoever. Its effects alſo are, to penetrate much more powerfully than ordinary Water; which is the reaſon why it very ſpeedily whitens whatever is expos'd to it, as Linnen and Wax; for the effecting of which, Rain requires thrice as long time: But its penetrativeneſs appears yet further, in that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves even Gold it ſelf; for which reaſon ſome have thought fit to waſh ſeveral times in it ſuch Medicaments as they would have penetrate, as well as others are wont to do in Vinegar.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid. If it ſuffic'd to ſpeak of Dew in a Poetical way, I ſhould call it the ſweat of Heaven, ther ſpittle of the Stars, the dropping of the celeſtial Waters, or the cryſtalline humour which flows from the eyes or the fair <hi>Aurora</hi>; or elſe that 'tis a Pearl-Garland, wherewith the Earth decks her ſelf in the morning, to appear more beautiful in the eyes of the Sun, and the whole Univerſe; to which if the Vapours ſerve for food, the Dew is its Nectar and Ambroſia. But to ſpeak more ſoberly,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66371:25"/>
I conceive it a thin and ſubtle Vapour, rais'd by a moderate Heat; till either meeting ſome Body, it adheres thereunto; or being attracted neer the Middle Region of the Air, 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd by cold, and falls down again upon the Earth. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, this Vapour proceeds not only from a humour purely Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ſomewhat partaking of the Spirits of Nitre, Sugar, or a ſweet Salt; ſince the thinneſt part of it being evaporated, the reſt remains condens'd upon leafs and ſtones, or becomes Honey and Manna; and whoſo ſhall lightly paſs his tongue over the leafs of Nut-tree, and other compact and cloſe Plants, ſhall taſte a ſweetneſs upon them in temperate Climates or Seaſons, which is nothing elſe but an extract of this ſame Dew. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the fertility which it cauſes in the Earth, its purgative and deterſive virtue, ſufficiently manifeſt this Truth. For Dew could not fertiliſe the Earth, if it were bare Water, deſtitute of all ſort of Spirits; and particularly thoſe of Nitre, which is the moſt excellent Manure that can be uſed to improve Land; for the Earth from which it is extracted remains barren, till it have been anew impregnated with thoſe Spirits by the influx of Dew, to which they expoſe it for ſome time, that it may again become capable of producing ſomething. This purgative virtue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not only Manna partakes (being a gentle purger, of ſeroſities) but alſo pure Dew, which ſometimes cauſes a mortal Diarrhoea or Lax in Cattle, purging them exceſſively when it is not well concocted and digeſted by the heat of the Sun, which conſumes its ſuperfluous phlegm; and that deterſive Faculty whereby Dew cleanſes all impurities of the Body, which it whitens perfectly, cannot proceed but from that nitrous Salt, which, as all other Salts, is penetrative and deterſive. Nor can that aſcending of the Egg-ſhell proceed from any other cauſe but the virtue of certain leight and volatil Spirits; which being actuated and fortifi'd by the heat of the Sun-beams, are ſet on motion; and flying upwards, carry the incloſing ſhell with them; which an aqueous humour cannot do; becauſe though the heat of the Sun could ſo ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe, attenuate, and rarefie it, as to render it an aery Nature, which is the higheſt point of rarity it can attain; yet it would not ſooner attract the ſame than the reſt of the air; much leſs would it raiſe up the Egg-ſhell; but it would tranſpire by little and little through the pores of the ſhell, or be expanded in it ſo far as it had ſpace, and at laſt either break it, or be reſolv'd into fume; Heat imprinting no motion in Water, but only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying and heating it by degrees; which is not ſufficient to raiſe up the Veſſel which contains it, ſince the ſame being full of heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed air, would remain upon the ground.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That all natural things being in a perpetual flux and reflux, to which this Elementary Globe ſupplies Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make them return to their Principle; Dew may be term'd the beginning and end of all things, the Pearl or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond which terminates the circular revolution of all Nature;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66371:26"/>
ſince being drawn upwards by the Sun from the maſs of Water and Earth, ſubtilis'd into vapour, and arriv'd to the utmoſt point of its rarefaction, it becomes condens'd again, and returns to the Earth, to which it ſerves as <hi>ſperm,</hi> to render it fruitful, and to be transform'd upon it into all things, whoſe qualities it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes; becauſe being nothing but a Quiteſſence extracted from all this Body, it muſt have all the virtues thereof eminently in it ſelf. Moreover, anciently the ordinary Benedicton of Fathers to their Children was, that of the Dew of Heaven; as being the <hi>ſperm</hi> of Nature, the Firſt Matter of all its Goods, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all its ſubſtance, recocted and digeſted in the ſecond Region of the Air: For the ſame vapour which forms Dew in the Morning, being that which cauſes the Serein in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet the difference of them is ſo great, that the latter is as noxious as the former is profitable; becauſe the firſt vapours which iſſue out of the boſome of the Earth, being not yet depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their crude and malignant qualities, cauſe Rheums and Catarrhs; but thoſe of the Morning being reſolv'd of Air condens'd by the coldneſs of the Night, have nothing but the ſweetneſs and benignity of that Element; or elſe the pores of the Body being open'd by the diurnal heat, more eaſily receive the malignant impreſſions of extraneous humidity, than after having been clos'd by the coldneſs of the night.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Although Vapour be an imperfect Mixt, yet 'tis as well as other perfect Bodies compos'd of different parts; ſome whereof are groſs others tenuious. The groſs parts of Vapour being render'd volatile by the extraneous heat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are impregnated, are elevated a far as the Middle Region of the Air, whoſe coldneſs condenſes them into a cloud, which is ordinarily diſſolv'd into Rain, ſometimes into ſnow or hail; into the former, when the cloud before reſolution is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd friable by the violence of the cold, which expreſſing the humidity, cloſes the parts of the cloud, and ſo it falls in flocks: and into the latter, when the ſame cloud being already melted into rain, the drops are congeal'd, either by the external cold, or elſe by the extream heat of the Air, which by Antiperiſtaſis augmenting the coldneſs of the rain, makes it cloſe and harden; which his the reaſon why it hails as well during the ſultry heats of Summer, as the rigours of Winter. And amongſt the groſs parts of the Vapour, ſuch as could not be alter'd or chang'd into a cloud, deſcend towards our Region, and there form black clouds, and miſts or foggs: But the more tenuious parts of this Vapour produce Dew; in which, two things are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. I. The Matter. II. The Efficient Cauſe. The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is that tenuious Vapour, ſo ſubtil as not to be capable of heat, and too weak to abate it. The Remote Efficient Cauſe, is a moderate Heat; for were it exceſſive, it would either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or carry away the Vapour; whence if comes to paſs, that there is no Dew made but during the Spring and Autumn, which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66371:26"/>
are temperate, Seaſons; but never in Winter or Summer, the former congealing thoſe Vapours, and the latter diſſolving and conſuming them. The Proximate Efficient Cauſe is the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Night, which muſt alſo be moderate; otherwiſe it congeals them, not into Dew, but white-Froſt, as it turns the Waters into Ice by the extream cold of the Air; which more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over muſt be calm and ſerene, becauſe if beaten and agitated by Winds, the Vapour cannot be condens'd, for the ſame reaſon which hinders running Waters from freezing, as ſtanding do; whence alſo Dew is more frequent in low places than high. Now as Dew is form'd of Vapour alone; ſo if together with that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious Vapour, ſome terrene but very fine parts be carried up, eſpecially towards the morning, there is produc'd a very ſweet juice, of which Honey is made; and when thoſe terrene parts prevail above the humid parts of the Dew, there is made a leſs liquid juice call'd Manna, whereof the beſt is found in <hi>Calabria</hi>; that of <hi>Brianſon,</hi> and ſome other places, being through want of heat leſs digeſted than is requiſite; or mingled with too many impurities, by the exceſs of that which attracted them too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently from the Earth: But the ſweetneſs of this Honey and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na proceeds from a moſt perfect mixture of ſiccity with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, in a degree which is unknown to us.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, That God having ſubjected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> the Woman to the Dominion of the Man (endu'd with ſtrength to keep himſelf in poſſeſſion of that Empire;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whether it is expedient for Women to be Learned?</hi>
               </note>) as Abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſometimes accompani'd with Tyranny, ſo he hath not only reſerv'd to himſelf alone the Authority of making Laws (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Women not being call'd, have always had the worſt) but hath alſo appropriated the beſt things to himſelf, without, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to partake therein: For Men, not content to have reduc'd them by thoſe Laws into perpetual Wardſhip, which is a real Servitude; to have ſo ill provided for them in Succeſſions; and to have made themſelves Maſters of their Eſtates, under the Title of Huſbands; further, unjuſtly deprive them of the greateſt of all Goods, to wit, that of the Mind, whoſe faireſt Ornament is Knowledge, the chief Good both of this World and the next, and the nobleſt Action of the Souls moſt excellent Faculty, the Underſtanding, which is common to Women as well as to Men, over whom too they ſeem to have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Wit; not only for the ſoftneſs of their Fleſh, which is an evidence of goodneſs of Wit; but becauſe of the Curioſity, which is the Parent of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> defin'd, for this reaſon, <hi>The Love and Deſire of Wiſedom</hi>: And this vivacity is conſpicuous in their loquacity and their artifices, intrigues, and diſſimulations; their Wits being like thoſe good Soils, which for want of better cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture run out into weeds and briars. Their Memory, caus'd by the moiſt conſtitution of their Brain, and their ſedentary and ſolitary life, is further favourable to Study. Moreover, not to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66371:27"/>
ſpeak of thoſe of the preſent Times, we have the examples of S. <hi>Bridgid,</hi> who excell'd in Myſtical Theologie; <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Arſinous,</hi> in Phyſick; <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> in Politicks; <hi>Hupetia</hi> and <hi>Athenais,</hi> wife to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> in Philoſophy; <hi>Sappho,</hi> and two <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynnae,</hi> in Poetry; <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> and <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> doubly <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Daughter, in Eloquence. Now if it be true, that Politicks and Oeconomicks are founded upon the ſame Principles, and there needs as much Knowledg to preſerve as to acquire; then ſince Women are in a Family what Men are in a State, and are deſtinated to keep what Men get, why ſhould not they have the knowledg of the ſame Maxims as Men have by Study and Theory; inaſmuch as the reſervedneſs and modeſty of their Sex allows them not to have the experience thereof, by frequentation of the World? Hence, our ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> left to them the Adminiſtration of the Laws, and other exerciſes of Peace; reſerving to themſelves only thoſe of War. And as for other Sciences, ſince their <hi>Encyclopaedy</hi> is a World which hath yet many unknown or leſs frequented Parts, if Women joyn'd together with Men in the diſcovery of them, who doubts but a feminine Curioſity would ſerve to exacuate the point of Mens Wits, diſtracted by extraneous Affairs, and make marveilous progreſſes, and find out ſundry rare Secrets, hitherto unknown.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Women are of themſelves prone enough to take the aſcendant over Men, without need of giving them that of Learning, which, puffing up the mind, would render them more proud and inſupportable than before; the good opinion they would have of themſelves, being inconſiſtent with the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to which they are bound. We read, That our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> was indu'd with Knowledg, but not <hi>Eve</hi>; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, her ſole deſire to become knowing, by eating the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, ruin'd the whole World. The active life of Huſwifry, to which they are born; the tenderneſs of their Bodies, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the labours and ſweat wherewith Science is acquir'd; the humidity of their Brain, which is an enemy to Science; and the weakneſs of their capricious Spirit; are ſufficiently ſtrong Reaſons to prohibit that Sex the Sciences, which require ſolidity of Judgment, always found wanting in the Writings of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men accounted the moſt Learned: Becauſe Judgment is an act of the Intellect, reflecting upon its Notions; which reflection depends upon a dry Temper, contrary to that of a Womans Brain, whoſe Animal Spirits being obſcur'd by the clouds of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, ſhe hits well ſometimes at the firſt aſſay, but not in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, which are always weaker than the firſt; a moſt ſure mark of their weakneſs: (On the contrary, the ſecond thoughts of Men prevail over the firſt.) Whence it is that they are heady in their deſires, and violent in their firſt Paſſions, wherein ordinarily they have neither meaſure nor mediocrity: Therefore a Woman always either hates or loves; ſhe never knows a mean.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:66371:27"/>The Third ſaid, Since the more imperfect a thing is, the more need it hath of being perfectionated; were the Minds of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men weak and imperfect, as is pretended, it would follow, that they have more need of the Sciences to cover their defects. Had our firſt Mother been indu'd with Knowledg, ſhe would not ſo eaſily have ſuffer'd her ſelf to be deluded by the fair promiſes of the Devil, who rightly judging, that <hi>Adam</hi> with all his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg would have diſcover'd his ſubtilties, was aware of medling with him, but ſet upon the poor, ideot, and ignorant Woman. 'Tis therefore an injuſtice to require Women to be more perfect and wiſe than Men, and withal to interdict them the means of becoming ſo: For how ſhall they be virtuous, if they know not what Virtue is? which being a Habit of the Will (a Faculty of it ſelf blind, till illuminated by the adviſoes of the Intellect, which are acquir'd by the Sciences) 'tis impoſſible for them to attain it. Thoſe who doubt leſt the knowledg of natural things might prejudice the honeſty and modeſty of that Sex, know not that the cognition of bad things, as well as of falſe, is always ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and laudable; and that the Underſtanding is no more ſoil'd therewith, than the Sun by ſhining upon dunghils. For though the Will receive tincture of goodneſs and evil from the objects to which it tends, yet the Underſtanding is not corrupted by the moſt impure and abominable things which fall under its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Yea, ſince Knowledg depends upon purity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; which makes Divines ſay, That Angels and ſeparated Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences are more perfect in their cognitions than Men; it ſeems, the ſafeſt courſe Women can take for ſecuring their purity and Chaſtity (their only Treaſure) is, to make proviſion of Learning and Knowledg. Moreover, 'tis a thing unheard of to this day, that a Woman was Learned, and not Chaſte and Continent; which the Ancients meant to repreſent by <hi>Minerva</hi> the Goddeſs of Sciences, and the Nine Muſes, all Virgins.</p>

Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments are between both; neither being converted into our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66371:28"/>
ſubſtance, as Aliments; nor corrupting it, as Poyſons: but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evacuating the peccant humours, or altering Nature, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to its natural temper, when they are rightly adminiſtred, and not otherwiſe; the former are call'd Purgative, the latter Alterative Remedies. All theſe Remedies were firſt found out by Experience, which gave place to the moſt ancient Sect of Phyſitians, call'd <hi>Emperica,</hi> invented by <hi>Acron,</hi> and afterwards ſupported by the two general Maxims of the Methodiſts, of whom <hi>Theſſalus</hi> was Authour; which were, <hi>To looſen conſtipated Bodies</hi>; and, <hi>To ſtop the fluxions of others.</hi> Laſtly, They have been authoriz'd by Reaſon, joyn'd to Experience; which hath given place to the moſt authentique Sect call'd the Dogmatiſts, or Rationaliſts, and Galeniſts, from their Author; proceeding upon <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Principle, who cur'd Contraries by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries; whereas the Chymiſts (call'd alſo <hi>Hermeticks</hi> from <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> and <hi>Spagyricks</hi> from the buſineſs of their Art, which is to ſeparate and conjoyn Bodies) cure like Maladies by like Medicaments; which they ſay act by a propriety of their whole ſubſtance againſt Diſeaſes; not by their temperament or various mixture of contrary qualities, which nevertheleſs are alone active; for no action can be between things perfectly alike, in regard one thing acts upon another only in order to aſſimilate the ſame; ſo that if it be already like, there will not be any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreover by the reaſon of Contraries, ſince Health is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by things of reſembling Nature, it follows, That Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt be cur'd by their Contraries. And as Health conſiſts in Mediocrity; ſo Sickneſs, either in Exceſs or Defect: On which account, Phyſick is defin'd <hi>Detraction</hi> and <hi>Addition,</hi> becauſe it retrenches what is ſuperfluous, and ſupplies what is deficient. Now both Exceſs and Defect are increas'd by uſe of things alike. Wherefore the Chymical Principle being overthrown, all the Remedies founded thereupon ought to be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That thoſe two Principles which ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, are not ſo, if rightly underſtood: For, when the Chymiſts ſay, That <hi>Similia curantur ſimilibus,</hi> they ſpeak not of Diſeaſes, as the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> do, with whom they agree, That the ſame are augmented by uſe of reſembling things; but of the part diſeas'd, which (being the Seat of Affections againſt Nature) can alone be ſaid to be cur'd, and not the Diſeaſes; which being only a privation, errour, or diſorder of the Body, cannot be capable of ſanation, but only the parts of the Body; which the Dogmatiſts, as well as the Chymiſts, cure by Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies like in ſubſtance to the Nature of thoſe Parts which they ſtrengthen: For whatever is a Friend to Nature, call'd by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Morborum Medicatrix,</hi> is alſo an Enemy to that which is againſt Nature.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Since Remedies are the more excellent, by how much the neerer they come to our Nature; it follows, That Minerals, Metals, and all Foſſiles, preſcrib'd us by Chymiſtry,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66371:28"/>
having malignant and venomous qualities, are much more dangerous than the ordinary Remedies taken from Animals and Plants, which have life as well as we. However prepar'd, they always leave an evil tincture in the noble Parts, and whole Body, againſt which they act with violence; which they have not only of their own Nature, altogether remote from ours; but alſo from the Fire, which gives them an extraneous heat, contrary and deſtructive to ours; any dry heat being an enemy to the natural, which is humid and benign; and although they make uſe of Medicines extracted from Vegetables, yet 'tis with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſucceſs; ſince their purgative virtue depends on their tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, which is wholly deſtroy'd by their Diſtillations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions: Beſides that, being all hot, they are unprofitable to all acute Diſeaſes (ordinarily hot, and always the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) and noxious in Fevers, which are generally complicated with moſt Diſeaſes. Moreover, all Remedies acting by the firſt, ſecond, and third Qualities, which depend on a Matter temper'd after a particular Matter; therefore Mixts ſeparated from rheir Matter, which ſerves for a baſe and foundation to the actions of the Form, loſe their former force and virtue, which is more efficacious and ſenſible in a material and groſs ſubject, as that of ordinary Remedies is, prepar'd by decoction or infuſion, in <hi>Bolus,</hi> Powder, Opiate, Conſerve, Lozenges, or ſuch other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Body; than in an Eſſence, Spirit, or the like ſubtil and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious Body; which freed from its groſſer parts, which ſerv'd to check it, flies like lightning into the Parts of the Body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Morbifick cauſe reſides, which it can never ſubdue or eradicate, though its virtue ſhould not preſently vaniſh, but be preſerv'd in the Body; which, beſides being accuſtom'd to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things, becauſe they conſerve and compoſe it, it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receives great dammage from too ſubtil things; on which account, the Air of the Supreme Region cannot be attracted by the Lungs.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Characteriſtical of a Good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament being to Cure <hi>Speedily, Certainly,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſantly</hi>; the Chymical, being ſuch, ought to be not only employ'd, but alſo preferr'd above others. The ſpeedineſs of their Effect is from their Forms, which alone are active, eſpecially when depurated and looſned from Matter, a Principle purely paſſive, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of action. They are alſo agreeable and ſure, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of their impurities, malignant qualities, bad ſmells and taſtes, by means of the various degrees of Fire; whieh if it communicate an <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or Burntneſs to theſe Medicines, ſo it doth, not only to vulgar Remedies prepar'd by Fire, but alſo to all our Meats and Aliments. Beſides, many of theſe Chymical Remedies are prepar'd with a moderate heat, as that of a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, Aſhes, <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> which cannot give them ſuch <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreuma:</hi> And ſhould they all have it, yet being but an extraneous and adventitious heat, 'tis eaſily ſeparated from them, either of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66371:29"/>
it ſelf in time, or ſpeedily by ablutions, wherewith even Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate <hi>Mercury</hi> is render'd very gentle, and <hi>Antimony</hi> void of all malignity. What is objected of the violence wherewith Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Metallick Medicines act, by reaſon of their diſproportion to our Nature, is as little conſiderable; ſince <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the ancient Phyſitians, us'd <hi>Euphorbium, Hellebore, Scammony, Turbith, Colocynthis,</hi> and ſuch other moſt violent Remedies, which are ſtill in uſe; and <hi>Galen</hi> employ'd <hi>Steel, Sandarach,</hi> burnt <hi>Braſs,</hi> and the like Medicines, taken from Minerals wholly crude, and without preparation, which was unknown in his time. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> uſes crude <hi>Mercury</hi> in his Pills againſt the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous Diſeaſe, whereof this Mineral is the true <hi>Panacaea: Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> crude <hi>Antimony; Geſner, Vitriol; Fallopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Crocus Martis</hi> againſt the Jaundies; almoſt all Phyſitians, <hi>Sulphur,</hi> againſt the Diſeaſes of the Lungs; and ſuch Patients as cannot be cur'd by ordinary Remedies, they ſend to Mineral Waters. And ſince not only Garlick, Onyons, and Muſtard, which we uſe in our Diet; but alſo the Juices of Lemmons, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Berberries, and Cantharides, although corroſive, are ſtill in uſe; why ſhould we not uſe Chymical Medicines in ſmall quantity, purg'd from their corroſion, and taken with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Waters and Vehicles?</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, There is in all natural things a certain fix'd Spirit, the ſole principle of their Virtues and Operations; which being ſeparated from them, they remain only Carcaſſes without Souls: As is ſeen in Earth, render'd barren by extraction of its ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Salt; in Wine dead or ſowre; and in the inſipid phlegm of the ſame Wine, ſeparated from its Spirit by Chymical diſtillation, which ſeparates the good from the bad, the pure from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, the ſubtil from the groſs, the form from its more craſs matter; in a word, the Spirit from its Body; which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the virtue of the whole Mixt, reduc'd into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrow Volume, is very active and proper, not only to ſerve for Aliment to an Animal, which is nouriſh'd with this Spirit, the reſt being unprofitable, and as ſuch converted into Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but alſo principally for the curing of Diſeaſes, by repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthning the fix'd Spirits, which are the true feats of Diſeaſes, as well as of Health; a Diſeaſe being nothing but the laeſion of the Functions, whereof the Spirits are the Principles; whereas ordinary Phyſitians, inſtead of ſeparating the virtues of each Mixt, to oppoſe the ſame, as Specifical Remedies to all Diſeaſes, as the Chymiſts do, ſtifle and deſtroy them by the confus'd mixture of abundance of Simples and Drugs, whereof their Medicaments are compounded, which by this means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a new temperament and particular virtue, reſulting from the ingredients, whoſe qualities and properties are abated, or rather extinguiſh'd; in like manner as of the Elements uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together is made a Compound wholly different from its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Wherefore we may juſtly retort againſt ſuch Remedies,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66371:29"/>
what they charge upon thoſe of Chymiſtry; namely, That they are taken from dead Ingredients, corrupted and depriv'd, by the Fire, of their Radical Humidity, wherein, conſiſted their prime purgative virtue, which is not ſo eaſily diſſipated; ſince when a Nurſe takes a Purge, the ſtrength of the Phyſick is convey'd by her Milk to the Child; and we feed ſhe-Goats and Pullen with Purgatives, to render the Milk of the one, and the Fleſh of the other ſuch. However, ſince there, are ſo many incurable Diſeaſes, whoſe cauſes are ſufficiently known, but to which no Specifical Remedies are found; Chymiſtry, which opens the means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the ſolution of all Bodies, ought to be cheriſh'd, and not condemn'd, as it is by the ignorant or malicious, who muſt at leaſt acknowledg it one of the members of Phyſick, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Pharmacy, which conſiſts in the choice and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Medicaments, and is part of the Therapeutical Diviſion. But we ſay rather, That the three parts of Medicine, or its three ancient Sects, are the three parts of the World, <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi>; and Chymiſtry is that new World, lately diſcover'd, not leſs rare and admirable than the others, provided it be as carefully cultivated, and reſcu'd out of the hands of Barbarians.</p>

                  <hi>Whether the reading of Romances be profitable.</hi>
               </note> ſince oftentimes Fables and Romances have more attractives, and no fewer followers than Hiſtories; as the Poets meant to ſignifie by the Fable of <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> who fell in Love with a Statue. For Romances, which are nothing elſe but the Images of a phantaſtick Beauty, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs lov'd and idolatris'd by abundance of Perſons; not only for the Eloquence, whoſe faireſt lines are ſeen in thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Books; but for the Gracefulneſs and Gallantry of the actions of their Perſonages, which may ſerve for a perfect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Virtue; which having never been found compleat in all points in any Illuſtrious Man, whoſe Life is always blemiſh'd with ſome ſpot, Hiſtory cannot give us a perfect example to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, unleſs it be aſſiſted by Romances; without which, Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions purely Hiſtorical, deſcribing a naked fact, are but excar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Sceletons, and like the firſt lines of a Picture groſly trac'd with a Crayon, and conſequently diſagreeable, if artifice give them not colour and ſhadows. Thus <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and in our times Don <hi>Guevara,</hi> aiming to draw the Model of a perfect Prince, one in the Perſon of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the other of <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> have heap'd together ſo many contrarieties to Truth, that they have made rather Romances of them than Hiſtories. Thus <hi>Achilles</hi>'s exploits appear far otherwiſe in <hi>Homer</hi> than in <hi>Dictys Cretenſis</hi>; thoſe of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> in <hi>Eginard</hi> and <hi>Arioſto,</hi> than in the Annals: 'Tis to Romances that they owe half their Glory; and if their Example hath given any excitation to the Readers Spirits, 'tis what the Romances aim'd at, not the Hiſtories. The Romancer is the Maſter and Contriver of his Subject; the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66371:30"/>
is the Slave of it. And as by refraction of the viſual rays, variouſly reflected in a triangular Glaſs, is form'd an <hi>Iris</hi> of colours, which although not real yet ceaſe not to pleaſe; ſo by the variety of thoſe accidents, variouſly interwoven with the mixtures of Truth and Fiction, is form'd ſo agreeable a Medley, that it delights more in its Inventions than the Body of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Hiſtory; from which Romances borrowing the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable accidents, may be term'd the Eſſence and Abridgment of the ſame, re-uniting all the Beauty, Pleaſure, and Profit which they afford: For theſe Books ſerve not only for delight, but profit; the one never being without the other; ſince Fair, which is the object of Delight; and Good, of Profit; are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal and inſeparable: And the pleaſure we take in any thing is an infallible mark of its goodneſs and utility; which is ſo much the greater in Romances, as they inſtruct with pleaſure, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially marrying Benefit and Delectation. Under ſuppoſed Names they freely tax, without incurring the envy or hatred of thoſe whom they reprehend. Thus the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable drew from <hi>David</hi> the condemnation of his Crime; which otherwiſe poſſibly he would never have own'd, or at leaſt would have excus'd in his own Perſon. As for the abuſe and danger of reading theſe Books, for the moſt part fill'd with diſhoneſt Loves 'tis common to them with the beſt things of the World, that they may be turn'd to a bad uſe: But if the Love be honeſt and lawful (as it proves always in concluſion) the Romances deſerve no blame for it; if unlawful, the Lovers have always an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end; and Vices are never unpuniſh'd. 'Tis here that Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Juſtice is exactly kept; not by the blind Judgment of Fortune, but by the judicious choice of the Author; that the Good are always rewarded, and the Wicked puniſh'd. For the object of Romances, as well as of Hiſtories, is the deſcription of humane actions; which being moſt often bad, by reaſon of the depravation of Nature, they appear more ſcandalouſly in Hiſtory than in Romances. Why therefore do not their Cenſors likewiſe proſcribe Hiſtories, ſo much more dangerous, as they afford us many true examples of Sacriledges, Parricides, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Inceſts, the Authors whereof have eſcaped puniſhment. And not to ſpeak of the dangerous Maxims of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>; Who would take the Fables of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and the Prodigies of <hi>Livie,</hi> for more probable things then thoſe of Romances? To omit the contrariety of Hiſtorians of the ſame time; ſo that we may ſay, That the trueſt amongſt them is the moſt likely.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, If the Platoniſts ſaying be true, <hi>That there is nothing real in this World; but we perceive only ſhadows and phantaſms in this life,</hi> which the Scripture compares to a Dream; there will be little difference, as to realty, between a Hiſtory and a Romance. And though the one be a meer fiction, yet this will no more infer the deſpiſing of it, than it doth of a Comedy, becauſe the Actors are not the very Perſonages; or of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66371:30"/>
a Landskip or Perſpective well drawn, only becauſe 'tis the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Painter, and not of Nature; whoſe Works, as excellent as they are, yet yield to thoſe of Art, which we eſteem above the true and natural, from which the ſame are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; our minds extreamly delighting in Imitations; whence it is that we ſo much eſteem in their Copies and Repreſentations ſuch things whoſe Originals are diſagreeable to us. But that which augments the glory of Romances is, that their declared enemies have not been able to encounter them but by Romances too; as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Iſocrates</hi> could not reprehend the Sophiſters, but by making uſe of their Eloquence.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Romances are commonly either of the valorous Exploits of Knights, or of Amorous paſſ-times. The firſt are for the moſt part ridiculous, and full of Knights Errant, who force Enchanted Caſtles, kill Monſters, Giants, and Men like Flies. The latter are infamous, contrary to Good Manners, and dangerous to young Perſons, entertaining them in a looſe Idleneſs, the Mother of all Vices; beſides the dangerous impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thoſe Lies leave in tender Minds, and which remain therein all their life after. But this belongs to all fabulous Diſcourſes, that they denote weakneſs of Judgment in thoſe addicted to them, and a diſorderly Wit in their Authors. And ſince, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Phyſitians, the firſt degree of Folly is to imagine phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Opinions; and the ſecond, to tell them to others; the third (in my conceit) will be, to write them.</p>

For thoſe <hi>Taliſmans</hi> (of which <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> is made the firſt Author) are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Images in relief, or engrav'd upon Medals or Rings, ordinarily of Mettal or precious Stones, in ſhape of Men or Animals, fabricated under certain Conſtellations and Aſpects of Stars, whoſe influence they thereby receive and keep, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards inſtead of the ſame Stars; yea, with the greater virtue, in that the re-union of influences being made in one point, their activity is redoubl'd: As Burning-glaſſes take more heat from the Sun, than perhaps he hath himſelf. Theſe Figures act, as they ſay, either upon mens minds, as to cauſe one to be lov'd,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66371:31"/>
honour'd, enrich'd, or fear'd; or upon their Bodies, as to cure them: Of which ſome ſhadow is ſeen in the magnetical cure of Wounds, by applying the Medicine to the Weapon that did the hurt, or to the bloody ſhirt. Or elſe theſe Figures act upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, as to keep away from a place rain, hail, and wild or venomous Beaſts; only by natural means: For we ſpeak not here of magical or diabolical Characters, whoſe virtues for the moſt part depend upon either a tacite or expreſs compact with the evil Spirit, who ſometimes really produces thoſe effects, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deludes our Senſes; and not the Character, Word, Sound, Number, or ſuch other means, commonly inept, and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch action. But we ſpeak only of natural Agents, which acting almoſt all by a propriety of their whole ſubſtance, and by occult and ſympathetical virtues, cauſe many ſtrange effects, which the ignorant Vulgar incongruouſly aſcribe to Magick or Sortilege. There might be doubt of the effect of theſe <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> if divers Hiſtories did not give aſſurance thereof: For thoſe <hi>Teraphins,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Laban's</hi> Puppets were, might be call'd <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> as the Brazen-Serpent and the Golden-Calf are by <hi>Marſelius Ficinus</hi>; the one to preſerve from the morſures of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, by its ſight; the other to turn away the heats and droughts of the Scorpion, and of <hi>Mars.</hi> The Idols of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans may alſo be put in this rank, as <hi>Memnon</hi>'s Statue in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which mov'd and ſpoke when ſhone upon by the Sun; that of <hi>Paphian Venus</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> upon which it never rain'd; the <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi>; the <hi>Ancilia</hi> or Bucklers of <hi>Rome,</hi> whick kept the Fortune of the Empire; the <hi>Dii Penates,</hi> figur'd by two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; thoſe call'd <hi>Averrunci,</hi> who kept away domeſtick misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; <hi>Sejanus</hi>'s Statue of Fortune, which the Emperours left to their Succeſſors; <hi>Virgil</hi>'s brazen Fly and golden Horſeleech, with which he hinder'd Flies from entring <hi>Naples,</hi> and kill'd all the Horſeleeches in a Ditch; the Figure of a Stork, plac'd by <hi>Apollonius</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to drive them away thence in the year 1160; and that wherewith he drove away Gnats from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>; thoſe of <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Hampts</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which were preſerv'd from venomous Beaſts by the <hi>Taliſman</hi> of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion engraven upon one of their Towers; that at <hi>Florence,</hi> made againſt the Gowt, by a Carmelite nam'd <hi>Julianus Riſtonius à Prato</hi>; thoſe of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> againſt the Peſtilence; and infinite others; render their effects as common, as their exiſtence cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Which is prov'd alſo by the example of <hi>Gamahés</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maien's,</hi> which are Stones naturally figur'd by the impreſſions of the Stars, which conſequently may have influence upon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Figures. For as the Sun may lighten or heat a mans Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as well as a Man; ſo may the Stars give their influences to the Figure of a Thing, as well as to the Thing it ſelf; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the ſubject is fitted thereunto, as the <hi>Taliſman</hi> is; not only by its metallick matter, ſymbolizing with that of the Star, both in colour and ſolidity; but eſpecially by the Figure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66371:31"/>
on it, which is like the Sign whoſe influences it receives. For though the Conſtellation be not very like that Figure, yet in regard the Qualities of the Animal which the Figure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, are like thoſe of the Sign, (whence the Conſtellations of the Zodiack are call'd, The <hi>Ram,</hi> the <hi>Bull, &amp;c.</hi> not for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of ſuch Animals parts with thoſe of thoſe Signs) the Figure of the Animals attracts them of the ſame Sign much more powerfully by ſympathy. And indeed we ſee many things have qualities conſentaneous to the Figure they bear; as the Stone call'd <hi>Ophites,</hi> for the ſmall veins which cut it in form of little Serpents, cures their poyſon; as alſo the Stones of <hi>Maltha</hi> do, which bear the Figure of a Serpents-tongue; and the Herb call'd by that name: The Squill and the Poppy, which reſemble the head, aſſwage the pains thereof: Wild Tanſey and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright cure the Eye, whereto they are like. But if it be ſaid, That 'tis not the Figure that acts in them, but a particular vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue depending on the temper of their Qualities; ſince loſing their Figure either by diſtillation or infuſion, (they ceaſe not to act, yea more effectually than before. I anſwer, That in the ſpirits of thoſe ſame active qualities remains always the Form and Figure; as ſome Chymiſts have reſuſcitated Roſes and other Flowers, by holding their aſhes in a glaſs Phial, over a Candle.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That <hi>Taliſmans</hi> cannot produce the effects attributed to them; whether you conſider them in their Matter and Subſtance, or in their Figure. Not in the former; for any ſort of Matter, as Wood, Wax, Stone, Metal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made uſe of for cutting of theſe <hi>Taliſmans</hi>; which, beſides, loſe their Name when they produce an effect by the virtue of their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as a Scorpion engraven on a Bezoar-ſtone would not cure the bitings of that venomous Animal by its <hi>Taliſmanical</hi> Figure, no more than any other; but 'tis an effect depending on the Stone it ſelf. Nor do Simples cure by the reſemblance between the Parts of our Body and their external Figure (of which we ſpeak here), but by the virtue and property of their Subſtance, which remains when they are powder'd and deſpoil'd of their Figure; which, moreover, is a Quality indeed, but no active one; being only a certain ſituation and diſpoſition of Parts, and a mode of quantity; which depending on Matter, a purely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive thing, is as uncapable of any action by it ſelf, as the Figure which terminates it. But though the artificial Figure of a <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> could act, it could produce no natural effect, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its power; much leſs upon the Will, to incite Love or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, as is pretended. For 'tis a ridiculous and groundleſs vanity to imagine a ſympathetical Commerce between a Conſtellation and a Figure of an Animal, graven upon Copper, or ſuch other Matter, which is much leſs fit to receive the influences of the Stars to which ſuch Animal is ſubject, than the Animal it ſelf, whoſe skin ſtuff'd with ſtraw were more proper to drive away
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66371:32"/>
other Beaſts of the ſame kind; there being nothing Living-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dread ſo much as the dead Bodies of their own kind.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, It needs not to ſeek Reaſons and Authorities to prove <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> either in Art or Nature; ſince Man himſelf may be ſaid to be the <hi>Taliſman</hi> and Perfection of God's Works, plac'd by him at the Centre of the Univerſe; as of old <hi>Taliſmans</hi> were plac'd at the Foundations of Cities: His countenance being a Medal imprinted with all the Characters of the Stars, the two brighteſt of which are at the Eyes; <hi>Saturn</hi> at the Eye-brows, the Seat of Severity; <hi>Jupiter</hi> at the Fore-head, the place of Honour; <hi>Mars</hi> at the Noſe, where Anger reſides; <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Mouth, where Eloquence lies; <hi>Venus</hi> at the Chin, and rounding of the Cheeks, the pourfit of the grace of this Medal, which ſerves him for an Univerſal <hi>Taliſman,</hi> in its Beauty to procure Love; in its Majeſty, to cauſe Reſpect; not only to drive away Flies or Frogs, but to reign over all Animals, by the prerogative of this Face, before which they tremble. Are not his Hands (the Artificers of his Felicity) <hi>Taliſmans</hi> noted with the Characters of the Signs and Planets, which the Rules of Chiromancy uncypher? In the Right Hand are his Days and Years, (ſaith the Wiſeman) the <hi>Taliſman</hi> of his long life; in the Left are Riches and Honours, the <hi>Taliſman</hi> of his good Fortune. In ſhort, Is not his Soul the <hi>Taliſman</hi> of his Immortality; which at the inſtant of its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion receiving all the influences of the Deity, and retaining the Image thereof, hath been inſerted into this Work, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from Thunder and Tempeſts, which can touch only the leaſt part of it; but from Corruption and Extinction, to which all other Creatures are ſubject.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, He's too ſenſual that impugns the truth of things, under pretext that they fall not under our Reaſon; which though very weak and uncertain, abuſing the principality which it uſurps over all the Faculties, hath turn'd its denomination into Tyrannie: Whence if Experiences be alledg'd ſhe denies them, becauſe not able to accord them with the weakneſs of her Judgment. Witneſs what is ſeen in all the admirable works of Nature and Art, in the Magnetical cure of Wounds, and that of Diſeaſes, by Amulets or Periapts; and what <hi>Cicero</hi> and all Antiquity affirms of <hi>Gyges</hi>'s Ring, upon turning of the Stone whereof inwards, he became inviſible; and returning it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was perceiv'd. Such alſo was <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Shield, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Perſeus</hi> combated the <hi>Gorgons,</hi> which was of Glaſs, through which one might ſee, without being ſeen; as alſo the Rings of thoſe Miſtreſſes of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Charlemain.</hi> For if it be ſaid of the firſt, That <hi>Olympias</hi> ſhewing her ſelf ſtark naked to him, made him confeſs, That the great Beauty of all the parts of her Body was the only <hi>Taliſman</hi> wherewith ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted <hi>Alexander</hi>: The ſame cannot be ſaid of the latter; ſince after his death the <hi>Taliſmanical</hi> Ring found under her Tongue caus'd <hi>Charlemain</hi> to love not only her, but alſo the Lake of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66371:32"/>
               <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi> whereinto it was caſt; and that which was found in the Foundations of the Walls of this City of <hi>Paris,</hi> under <hi>Chilperic,</hi> where there was a Fire engraven upon a Braſs-plate, a Serpent, and a Rat; which having been remov'd from the place, the very next day a great Fire happened in the ſame City. For if every thing below is as that which is above, and the effects of inferiour things proceed from the various configuration of the Celeſtial Bodies, as of the different combinations of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Alphabet are compos'd infinite Books, there may be ſome proportion and correſpondence between thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Figures, and ſuch as are made upon fit and ſuitable mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; the knowledg of which ſympathetical Correſpondences, is the true Magick; which is, by the teſtimony of <hi>J.

            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That every thing acts in the World by the firſt or ſecond Qualities, or by its Subſtance; whence proceed occult Properties and Sympathies: But Taliſmanical Figures cannot act by any of theſe ways; for 'tis certain, that they act neither by heat, cold, hardneſs, ſoftneſs, or ſuch other firſt or ſecond Quality, no more than by their Subſtance, which is different in <hi>Taliſmans</hi> of Copper, Iron, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Although the Authors of this Art aſcribe the ſame virtue to all, provided they be graven with the ſame Figures, and under the ſame Conſtellations and Aſpects of the Starrs, from whom alone they make them derive their, ſtrange virtues; alledging, as a Principle, That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World but hath both its Contrary and its Like, as well in Heaven as on Earth; where we ſee not only the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold and the Sun-flower follow the motion of the Sun; the Sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notrope, that of the Moon; the Cock proclaims the approach of the Sun: As alſo, on the contrary, Dogs commonly run mad in the Dog-days, and Lions under the Sign <hi>Leo</hi>: But alſo ſome Perſons beheld with an evil eye by ſome Planets, others being propitious. So to cure hot and dry Diſeaſes they engrave their <hi>Taliſmans</hi> under a Conſtellation contrary to the Evil, as cold and moiſt; having regard to the Signs whereunto every Malady and diſeas'd Part is referr'd; which is an Invention of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who fancies Poles, a Zenith, a Nadir, an Equator, a Zodiack, and other phantaſtical Figures in our Bodies, anſwering to thoſe of Heaven, without the leaſt proof of his ſayings.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, Since Man is compos'd of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Body and Soul,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whether a Country-life or a City-life is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd?</hi>
               </note> the beſt Life he can lead is that which is moſt proper for the perfection and good of both. Such is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-life, being accompanied with the Goods of the Body, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the Mind. Thoſe of the Body, as Health and Strength, are poſſeſs'd with advantage by Ruſticks, who know not ſo much as the Names of Diſeaſes; the cauſe whereof is their Exerciſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66371:33"/>
and Labour, which diſſipates and reſolves the humours that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce moſt Diſeaſes; as alſo the purity of the Air they breathe, which is the more healthful in that it hath free motion, and is leſs confin'd; for which reaſon Phyſitians ſend their recovering Patients to confirm their Health in the Air of the Country: Which alſo ſupplies the Goods of Fortune, the true and natural Riches, to wit, the Fruits of the Earth, and the Spoils of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; Gold, Silver, and other artificial Goods, being but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and uſeleſs without thoſe firſt, whereunto they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient. But above all, the Goods of the Mind, which conſiſt in Knowledg and Virtue (the two Ornaments of its two chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the Underſtanding and the Will) may be acquir'd much more eaſily in a Country-life, in regard of the purer Air, which begets like Spirits, as theſe frame purer <hi>Species</hi> and Phantaſms, on which depend the actions of the Underſtanding; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, cannot meditate nor improve without reſt and ſilence, ſcarce found in a civil and tumultuary Life, as that in Cities is, which hold our Minds as well as Bodies in captivity, depriving us of the free aſpect of Heaven, the riſing and ſetting of the Sun and Stars, and of the means of conſidering the Wonders of God in the production of Flowers, Fruits, and Plants. Hence the Poets feign'd the Muſes, the Goddeſſes of the Sciences, living in the Mountains of <hi>Helicon,</hi> and in Woods; not in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of Cities, where Virtues are alſo more difficultly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd than the Sciences, nothing of them being left there but ſhadows and phantaſms, which under veils of Diſſimulation, Hypocriſie, Complements, and other teſtimonies of Virtue, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Injuſtices, Sacriledges, Impieties, and other Crimes unknown in the Country, where Simplicity and Innocence are ſure tokens of true Virtue; which is alſo better retain'd amongſt the Thorns and Sweats of the Country, than in the Luxury and Idleneſs of Cities. And if things may be judg'd of by their beginnings, the Sacred Hiſtory tells, That <hi>Cain,</hi> the firſt Murtherer, was the firſt that built a City, named <hi>Henoch,</hi> after the Name of his Son; as a little after did the firſt Tyrant of the World, <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who built <hi>Niniveh.</hi> On the contrary, all holy Perſonages have lead a Country-life: <hi>Adam</hi> was a Huſband-man, and ſo was <hi>Cain,</hi> as long as he continu'd in the ſtate of Innocence, which as ſoon as he loſt he deſir'd to become a Burgeſs. <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the twelve Patriarchs his Sons, were Shepherds; as alſo the Kings, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi>; and the Prophets <hi>Amos, Eliſha,</hi> and many others; in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating whoſe example we cannot erre.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Man being a ſociable and political Animal, the habitation of Cities is as conſentaneous to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Country-life is repugnant to the ſame. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men had no ſooner diſcover'd the inconveniences of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick-life, but they unanimouſly conſpir'd to build Cities, to the end to ſupply one anothers Neceſſities, and defend themſelves from wild Beaſts and their Enemies, to whoſe fury they were

expos'd before they liv'd in ſome Town, which is a Sacred Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety or Unity of Citizens, all aſpiring to the conſervation of the State, to the maintaining of the Laws and Juſtice, and to the publick Ornament and Glory; making Arts and Diſciplines flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and procuring Safety to all People, by the diſtribution of Rewards to Virtue, and Puniſhment to Vices, which have not their effect but in publick: For our Lives would not differ from thoſe of Brutes, if we were oblig'd to dwell in Dens, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down Woods, as the Barbarians of the new World do; whoſe Brutality, Irreligion, Cruelty, Ignorance, and Miſery, compar'd with the Politeneſs, Devotion, Humanity, Knowledg, and Happineſs of others, ſufficiently manifeſt what difference there is between a City and a Country-life.</p>

The Artifice of Man hath indeed excavated the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the Earth, and deſcended into the Abyſſes of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to get out their moſt hidden treaſures; yea, he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded with his ſight the vaſt expanſes of Heaven, there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Stars: But he hath not yet been able to familiariſe the Fire to himſelf, which like a Salvage-beaſt devours every thing it meets. Now although it be found almoſt in all places, yet <hi>Sicily</hi> nouriſhes it more than any; having amongſt others the <hi>Mont Gibel,</hi> or <hi>Aetna,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Hiera, Lipara,</hi> and many others in the Volcanian Iſlands, which are adjacent to it; and of <hi>Strom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli,</hi> twenty Leagues diſtant from theſe. Such alſo are thoſe of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Veſuvius</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which ſmoak to this day; the three burning Mountains of <hi>Hecla, Sainte Croix,</hi> and <hi>Helga</hi> in <hi>Iſe-land,</hi> which caſt forth Flames only at their feet, (their tops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all cover'd with Snow) and whoſe Fire is augmented by caſting Water in, which ſerves it for Fewel. Such were alſo that which, by the report of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the fifteenth of his Annals, burnt the Territory of the <hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66371:34"/>
of <hi>Calena,</hi> at this day <hi>Carignola</hi> in <hi>Campania</hi>; that which burnt for ſixteen years together a great part of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and not long ſince the Iſland of St. <hi>George,</hi> which is one of the <hi>Aſores</hi>; and divers other fat Lands near the Sea, which continually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies unctuous matter to theſe Conflagrations; whence the moſt remarkable of them are ſeen in Iſlands, and other maritim pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> who place Fire in the entrails of the Earth, as its Centre, would not be ſo much at a loſs here, as thoſe who with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hold, That it is there in a violent ſtate, and contrary to its Nature, which requires the higheſt part of the World. For ſince nothing violent can be of long duration, How is it that Fire, the moſt active of all the Elements, hath not hitherto been able to free it ſelf out of its Priſon, and get out of this ſtate of confinement? 'Tis better therefore to ſay, That Fire being the principal Agent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neceſſary to all ſorts of Generations which are made in all places, is likewiſe found every where, eſpecially in the Earth, where it is moſt ſenſible, and is preſerv'd longeſt, in regard of the ſolidity of its Matter: For Fire cannot ſubſiſt without Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſerves it for Food and Aliment: Whence the Poets deſcrib'd <hi>Vulcan,</hi> the God of Fire, lame; intimating its need of fewel and ſuſtenance to ſupport it; none of which being found under the Orb of the Moon, above the higher Region of the Air, 'tis reaſonable to judg, that there is no other Elementary Fire on high but that of the Sun; who by his heat, light, and other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, concurs more perfectly to the generation of all Mixts, than that inviſible and imaginary Fire. 'Tis therefore neceſſary that Fire have Matter to feed upon; otherwiſe it dies and vaniſhes, not only in an Enemy-country, and among its Contraries, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deſtroy it; but alſo in its own ſphere or centre, wherever it be, ſince it muſt needs act there; otherwiſe it would be weaker in its Centre than out of it: But it cannot act upon it ſelf; for then it ſhould deſtroy it ſelf: But nothing acts upon it ſelf; and therefore it muſt act upon ſome ſubject beſides it ſelf. Wherefore the Matter of all Fire is any oylie, fat, and aerious Body; whence Aſhes, wholly deſpoil'd of that unctuous humidity, are incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible. That of Subterranean Fires is of two ſort, Sulphur and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen; both which are obſerv'd plentiful in burning places. The Live or Foſſile Sulphur, which ſerves for Matter to theſe Fires, is a terreſtrial fat or oyl, mingled with the ſlime of the Earth: For, the other ſort of Sulphur, found on the ſurface of Stones, is nothing but the purer part of the former, which being ſublim'd by heat, is ſtop'd and condens'd by thoſe ſolid Bodies into a Matter call'd Flowers of Sulphur; by which example Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry makes the like Flowers. The Bitumen is alſo a fat juice; which is either liquid, like Oyl, call'd by ſome <hi>Petroleum,</hi> and the <hi>Naphtha</hi> of the <hi>Babylonians</hi>; ſo inflammable that it attracts Fire at a diſtance, and retains it in the Water, which ſerves it for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66371:34"/>
nouriſhment; as is ſeen in that Bituminous Fountain which burns four Leagues from <hi>Grenoble</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and many other, which caſt forth both Flames add Waters at the ſame Out-let. There is ſome too, of the conſiſtence of ſoft Wax; as that ſlimy Bitumen floating upon the Lake of <hi>Sodome</hi>: Some other hard, like the Pit-coal, call'd <hi>Tourbe,</hi> whereof our Marſhes are full; which is the moſt general Matter of Subterranean Fires; to whoſe violence the Nitre found there, may alſo contribute: for as Bituminous Earth makes theſe Fires durable, which otherwiſe could not ſubſiſt ſo long with Sulphur alone, which preſently is evaporated and ſpent: So the Nitre and Saltpeter (wherewith the Earth is every where impregnated, and which hath been before ſhewn to be the cauſe of its fertility) is the cauſe of their impetuoſity and violence, which the ſituation of places may alſo promote.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Earth, as well as the Air, hath three Regions in its profundity; the firſt temper'd and alter'd either apparently or really, according to the various diſpoſition of the ambient Air: The ſecond or middle, extreamly cold: The third always hot and burning. And as the Matter of Thunder is a Sulphureous, Nitrous, and Bituminous Exhalation of the Earth, drawn up by the Sun to the middle Region of the Air, where 'tis inflam'd by Antiperiſtaſis of the ambient cold (becauſe being in the next diſpoſition to Inflammation, the leaſt concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent circumſtance preſently reduces that Power into Act:) So the incloſed and difficultly evaporable heat of the Earth, finding the ſame eaſily-inflammable Matter there, namely, the Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which iſſue from that third Subterranean Region upon the opening of Mines, which teſtifie by their ſmell, thickneſs, and other qualities, how much they partake of Minerals; theſe hot and dry Exhalations aſcending to the ſecond Region of the Earth, there meet with cold Spaces, which being for the moſt part hollow or cavernous, and ſtor'd with Sulphur, Bitumen, and other fat Earths, become inflam'd by the Antiperiſtaſis of cold and the proximity of thoſe Materials. And becauſe the Earth which feeds theſe Fires conſiſts of two parts; the one arid, and the other unctuous; this unctuoſity approaching nearer the Fire, coming to be conſum'd, the Fire muſt needs be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd; till the heat, excited by the conflagration of many years, having attracted all the unctuoſity of the neighbouring Earth, and this having by degrees impregnated that dry. Earth which the Chymiſts call <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> it becomes again inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, and continues fir'd till the ſame be deſiccated again; and ſo forward in a circle; nothing hindring but that, as Plume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Stone-allume is an eternally incombuſtible Wiek, provided it be ſupply'd with new Oyl when the former is ſpent, this Earth may do the like: Unleſs we had rather, that wiſe Nature diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes combuſtible matter in the bellies of Mountains, after the manner of <hi>Vitruvius</hi>'s his Lamps, which need filling but once a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66371:35"/>
year; and thoſe Water-Receptacles for Birds, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with freſh as faſt as the former Water is ſpent. Or elſe, that Nature (excepting the extraordinary eruptions which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome happen to theſe flammivomous Mountains, and then only when the Fire cannot get iſſue but by violence) makes what the curious often aſpire to, an inextinguiſhable Fire, or perpetual Light, by reſolving again into oyly and combuſtible matter that which was evaporated by Inflammation; as Water elevated in vapour by heat, falls down again in the ſame form. The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, Nature, finding Cavities great enough in thoſe vaſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to facilitate what Art finds impoſſible, by reaſon of the ſmalneſs of Veſſels, which extinguiſh Fire when it hath not Air, or ſuffer its Matter to exhale when it hath; although S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> make mention, the former of a Lamp in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> which could not be extinguiſh'd or conſum'd, though neither Oyl nor Wiek were put to it; and the latter, of another burning Lamp found in a Sepulchre, where it had been fifteen hundred years, but upon admiſſion of Air forthwith went out. Although without recurring to this ſubtilty, that of Fire, and its activity, is ſufficient to attract or fetch in its ſulphureous food; which being only an excrement of the Earth, and like the ſoot of our Chimneys, is found every where, but eſpecially in Mines, which are repair'd in leſs time than is believ'd, and whoſe various qualities make the variety of theſe Subterraneous Fires, of their duration, continuity, and interval; which ſome have compar'd to Intermitting Fevers, excited in our Bodies by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous heat, which holds the ſame place in us as Fire doth in the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, That Age is the meaſure of the Natural Mutations to which Man is ſubject by the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Being,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Which Age is moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?</hi>
               </note> and which differ according to every ones Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſome being <hi>Puberes,</hi> having a Beard and gray Hairs, and ſuch other tokens, ſooner than others, according to the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their firſt conformation; whence ariſes that of their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> following <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> divides them into Youth, Middle-age, and Old-age; that is to ſay, the Beginning, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and end: Or, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> into Infancy, Man-hood, and Old-age: According to moſt, into Adoleſcence, Youth, Age of Conſiſtence, and Old-age. Adoleſcence comprehends Infancy, which reaches to the ſeventh year; the Age of Pueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to the fourteenth; Puberty, to the eighteenth; and that call'd by the general name, Adoleſcence, to the twenty fifth. Youth, which is the flower of Age, reaches from twenty five to thirty five. Man-hood and Conſiſtence, from thirty five to fourty eight; when Old-age begins, which is either green, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or decrepit. Theſe four Ages are the four Wheels of our Life, whoſe Mutations they mark out: The firſt, next the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordia's</hi> of generation, is hot and moiſt, ſymboliſing with Blood;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66371:35"/>
the ſecond, hot and dry, with Choler; the third, cold and dry, with Melancholy; the fourth, cold and moiſt; with Phlegm; which being contrary to the primogenial humidity, leads to death. Now if it be true, as 'tis ſaid, That Life is a Puniſhment, and a Summary of Miſeries, Old-age, as neereſt the haven and end of Infelicities, is the moſt deſirable. Moreover, being more perfect by experience, and alone fit to judg of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ages, which it hath run through, we muſt refer our ſelves to the goodneſs of its judgment, as well in this as in all other Points.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Since to live is to act, the moſt perfect and agreeable of all Ages of Life is that in which we beſt exerciſe the functions of Body and Mind; namely, Youth (which alone ſeems fit to diſpute the Prize with Old-age) not only in regard of the health and vigour of the Body, wherein it ſurpaſſes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining feeble Age; but alſo of the actions of the Mind, which is much more lively in young, inventive, and induſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, than in the aged, whoſe Spirit wears and grows worſe with the Body; which hath given place to that moſt true Proverb, <hi>That Old-men are twice Children.</hi> For 'tis to give Wiſedom a ſhameful Extraction, and to make it the iſſue of Infirmity, to call that ripe which is rotten, and to believe that good counſels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only from defect of natural heat; ſince, according to his judgment who hath beſt decypher'd Wiſdom, this Old-age traces more wrincles in our Minds than Faces; and there are few Souls which by growing old become not ſowr and rancid, and acquire not many vices and ill habits; of which Covetouſneſs alone, inſeparable from Old-age, (and an Argument of weakneſs of Mind, in heaping up with ſo much ſolicitude what muſt ſoon be parted with) is not much leſs prejudicial to the State than all the diſorders of Youth. But if the Chief Good conſiſts in the Sciences, the Cauſe of Young-men is infallible; for acuteneſs of Wit, ſtrength of Phancy, and goodneſs of Memory (which wholly abandons Old-men), and ability to undergo pains and watchings, muſt contribute to their acquiſition. And if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the ſecret delight we take in exerciſing virtuous Actions, Young-men, who, according to Chancellour <hi>Bacon,</hi> excel in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, will carry it above Old; it being certain, That the beſt actions of our Lives are perform'd between twenty and thirty, or thereabouts, which was the Age at which <hi>Adam</hi> was created in Paradiſe; as our Saviour accompliſh'd the Myſtery of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at the Age of thirty three years, which ſhall be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Age at which the Bleſſed ſhall riſe to Glory, in which every one ſhall enjoy ſuch a perfect Youth as we aſcribe to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and put off Old-age, which, not much differing from Death, may, like it, be term'd the Wages of Sin; ſince, had our firſt Parent perſiſted in Innocence, we ſhould have poſſeſs'd a perpetual Youth. Moreover, 'tis at this Age that the greateſt Men have appear'd: Few Old Conquerours have been ſeen; if
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66371:36"/>
any, he hath this of <hi>Alexander,</hi> That he aſpires to the Conqueſt of another World, not having long to live in this. Wherefore inſtead of pretending any advantage over other Ages, Old-men ought to be contented that we uſe them not as thoſe of <hi>Cea</hi> and the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> did, who drown'd them; or the <hi>Romans,</hi> who caſt them from a Bridg into <hi>Tyber,</hi> thinking it a pious act to free them from life, whoſe length diſpleas'd the Patriarchs, the Scripture ſaying, <hi>That they died full of</hi> (or, ſatiated with) <hi>days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Innocence of Children ſhould make us deſire their Age; conſidering that our Lord requires us to be like them, that we may enter into his Kingdom. Moreover, Nature, unable to perpetuate Infancy, hath found no ſweeter Anodyne for the miſeries and melancholy of Old-people than the ſight of Children, and the memory of things done or learnt in their minority; which partakes the more of its ſource, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, the leſs 'tis remov'd from it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Youth hath too many extravagances to be accounted happy; and 'twould be againſt the order of Nature if (the Extreams) Infancy and Old-age contain'd more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than that which holds the Middle, wherein ſhe hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd the Virtue of all things. The weakneſs of the firſt ſhews that it hath not wherewith to content it ſelf, but needs ſupport from others, and is therefore an object of Compaſſion, which never ariſes but from Miſery. Its Innocence, proceeding only from impotence and imperfection of the Soul's operations, hath nothing commendable; and 'tis as much unable to will as do good: But true Innocence conſiſts in the acting of difficult good. If Child-hood fear not the Future, it receives a preſent Evil with more pain, and is as ſenſible of the leaſt diſcontents, as incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conſolation, or prudence to avoid them; nor can it by hope anticipate or prolong the enjoyment of a future good. In ſhort, He cannot be happy who is not conſcious of his happineſs, as Children cannot be. Then for Old-age, 'tis a ſecond Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and more to be pitied, in that it always grows worſe, partakes all the defects of Nonage, and hath this worſe, that its deſires, awaken'd by the memory of paſt contentments, upbraid its impotence; and the thirſt of getting is at perpetual jar with the fear of leaving: Aches, the forerunners of Death, dayly attaque its patience; and there remains no cure of its Evils, but the extremity of all Evils, <hi>To be no more.</hi> Infancy is therefore like the Spring, which hath only Flowers, and expects Fruits hereafter; ſo that 'tis an Age of Hope without Enjoyment. Youth hath only Summer-fruits, of little laſting. Old-age is a Winter, without either Flowers or Fruits, poſſeſſing only Evils preſent, and oblig'd to fear all and loſe all. But Man-hood, betwixt theſe two, reſembles <hi>Autumn,</hi> denoted by the Horn of Plenty, poſſeſſes the felicity of Life, enjoys the Goods acquired, and by hope anticipates thoſe to come; it hath a Soul commonly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with the Body, the Faculties of that making a ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66371:36"/>
with the Actions of this. On the contrary, the Soul in Child-hood ſeems not to be well in tune with the Body; in Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcence 'tis always at diſcord with the Appetites of Senſe; and in Old-age it jars with it ſelf, and by a ſpeedy ſeparation endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours wholly to break the Conſort, and have its part by it ſelf.</p>

Theſe Waters are either cold or hot; the former are drunk, and the latter ſerve for Bathing; as that of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>; of <hi>Plom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieres,</hi> in <hi>Lorrain</hi>; of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> in <hi>Bourbonnois</hi>; of <hi>Bagnieres</hi> and <hi>Barege,</hi> in <hi>Gaſcony</hi>; of <hi>Balleruc</hi> and <hi>Barbotan,</hi> in <hi>Languedoc</hi>; of <hi>Acqs</hi> and <hi>Terſis,</hi> neer <hi>Bayonne</hi>; and abundance of other hot Baths caus'd by Subterraneous Fires. Of cold Waters, ſome are acid and pungent to the taſte, as the Vitriolate, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Spa</hi> in the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> and of <hi>Ponges</hi> in <hi>Nivernois:</hi> Others are ſharp and rough; as thoſe Springs of <hi>Forges</hi> and <hi>Montdor</hi> neer <hi>Rheimes,</hi> not long ſince found by Sieur <hi>de la Framboiſiere</hi>; thoſe of <hi>Chaſteau Thierri,</hi> of <hi>la Herſe</hi> neer <hi>Béleſme,</hi> whoſe acidity likewiſe argues ſomething of <hi>Vitriol</hi>; and divers others, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd daily by experience. Some are found heavy, ſtinking, fat, and impure; other leight, pure, clear, and ſweet. Some are ſalt or brackiſh; of colour reddiſh, green, black, and otherwiſe different, according as theſe Waters are variouſly mix'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Minerals are contain'd either in ſubſtance and their groſſer parts, or elſe only their Spirits and ſubtiler parts, ſo well blended as that there appears no extraneous Body at all; which mixtion depends on the Nature of Minerals, ſome whereof are never perfectly mix'd with Water, by reaſon of their hardneſs; others, though ſoft and liquid, mix only confuſedly, as oyly Bodies: Others mix eaſily; as Spirits, in regard of their tenuity; and Salts, which melt in the Water.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That in this matter Experience is rather to be conſulted than Reaſon, which falls ſhort in the examen of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66371:37"/>
many Waters, of which Hiſtories are full; as of thoſe of <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which make Women fruitful; of a Fountain in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> which prevents Abortion; of the River <hi>Styx</hi> in the ſame place, and of <hi>Leontini</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> which preſently kill ſuch as drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; of <hi>Cydnus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which cures the Gowt. Such alſo is Fountain of <hi>de Jouvence</hi> in the Iſle <hi>Bonica,</hi> which makes old men young again; that of <hi>Iſe-land,</hi> which hinders gray hairs; the two of <hi>Baeotia,</hi> whereof one ſtrengthens, the others aboliſhes the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; two others of the Fortunate Iſlands, one of which cauſes <hi>Sardonian</hi> and mortal Laughter, unleſs the other be preſently drunk of; and thoſe of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> one whereof makes the Sheep that drink of it to have black Wooll, which the other makes white, and both mix'd together make it of ſeveral colours; that of the Iſle of <hi>Andros</hi>; and another a league diſtant from <hi>Coblentz,</hi> which inebriate, having the taſte of Wine, which the firſt retained but for ſeven days, and quitted when carried out of ſight of a Temple of that Iſland dedicated to <hi>Bacchus</hi>; the oylie Fountains of <hi>Zant</hi>; the red Spring of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which cauſes loſs of Judgment; as the Mad Lake in <hi>Preſter John</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try alſo doth, which thrice a day, and as often in the night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes blackiſh and ſharp, and returns as often to its own ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the Sabbatical River mention'd by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which dries up every Sabbath-day (render'd credible by that of <hi>Varins</hi> neer <hi>Saumur,</hi> which hath its flux and reflux, as the Sea); the Water of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Lake, which continues red eleven days in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the Fountain of <hi>Dodona,</hi> ſo famous among the Poets, at which they lighted extinct Torches; like to another neer <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi> which at the ſame ſtream ſends forth Waters and Flames; and many others, which convert Wood and immers'd Bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Stone; the true cauſes whereof are altogether unknown.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Mineral Waters, though humid to the touch, are deſiccative; as appears partly from their compoſition of Mineral, deterſive, and deſiccative Spirits; and partly from their effects, which are to heal Ulcers, dry up Scabs and Puſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and correct the moiſt <hi>intemperies</hi> of the Stomach, and other lower Parts. Some argue them all hot, from their acrimony, virtues of penetrating, inciding, opening, attenuating, provoking Urine and Sweat, cleanſing the Reins and Bladder; all ffects of heat. Others account them cold, becauſe being drunk they cauſe ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering at Midſummer, correct the heat of the Liver and Reins, cure hot Diſeaſes, prejudice cold, and generally hurt the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Parts, to which, according to the Aphoriſm, Heat is friendly, and Cold hurtful: But though actually cold, yet they have ſome have ſome heat in power; and being compos'd of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral unlike parts, produce different and ſometimes contrary effects: So Aloes and Rhubarb both looſen and bind: All which effects may nevertheleſs be referr'd to three principal; namely, Refrigerating, Deoppilating or opening, and Strengthning. They refrigerate by their actual coldneſs and the acidity of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66371:37"/>
which alſo by vellicating the ſtomach, cauſes the great appetite we have during the the uſe of theſe Waters. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppilate, not ſo much by their quantity (which hath made ſome erroneouſly ſay, that the ſame proportion of common Water would work the ſame effect as theſe Medicinal Waters) as by their tenuity, which they have from the metalline Spirits, which make them penetrate and paſs ſpeedily over the whole Body. Laſtly, they ſtrengthen by their aſtringency, (for all Aſtringents corroborate) which the Chymiſts attribute to their volatil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which, as they ſay, joyn themſelves to the fix'd Spirits of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the three conditions of a good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament are, To Cure <hi>Speedily, Safely,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſantly</hi>; as Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters do. They are familiar to us, by their nature of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Medicaments, by their compoſition, which is diſcover'd either by letting them ſettle, or by evaporating, or by diſtilling them; as alſo by the ſmell, taſte, and colour, which becoming black by the infuſion of Galls; ſhews that there is Vitriol in them. And whereas the longeſt and moſt difficult Maladies proceed from obſtruction and cold, the hot or acute being ſpeedily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, theſe Waters are the moſt effectual Remedy of both; for they penetrate, and, like a torrent, open not the great paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only, but alſo the ſmall veins of the Meſentery; and heat by their Spirits and Sulphur, which hath a heat very benign and friendly to the principal parts, eſpecially to the Lungs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is a Balſom and Specifical. Above all, they are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in curing Gravel, not only vacuating the groſs and viſcous humours, which are the matter of the Stone, but ſometimes breaking and diſſolving the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder; which, amongſt others, thoſe of <hi>Spà</hi> perform, by reaſon of their abounding in Vitriol, whoſe acidity and acrimony produces the ſame effect upon Stones in the Body, as that of Vinegar doth upon Egg-ſhells, Pearls, and Corals.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the uſe of Natural Baths, whether hot or cold, may be eaſily practiſed in ſundry Diſeaſes; but 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to diſcern the occaſions of taking them by the mouth, and their differences. For, beſides that their great quantity (the <hi>Italians</hi> preſcribing above 200 ounces a day, others 25 pound) ſometimes overcomes the ſtrength, and extinguiſhes the natural heat; ſome have malignant Qualities, and Enemies to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Life, not ſo much by reaſon of their Metalline Spirits, diſproportionate to our Bodies, as of the mixture of Mercury, Plaſter, and other Earths entring into their Compoſition; whence many die by taking the Waters, or come back from them more infirm, by accidents following upon them, as Gowts, weakneſs of Stomach, Imbecillity, Laſſitude, Livid Complexion, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and other more dangerous Evils than that for which they were recurr'd to.</p>
            <p>The ſixth ſaid, To the end the uſe of theſe waters may prove
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66371:38"/>
healthful, regard is to be had to the Perſons, the Diſeaſes, and the Nature of the waters. As for the firſt; Children, old Men, breeding Women, and fat People, muſt not take them without great neceſſity: For the ſecond; Moſt waters are unprofitable, and ſometimes contrary to the diſeaſe; as, to the infirmities of the Breaſt, Fluxions, Ulcers of the Lungs, Epilepſie, Apoplexie, Convulſions, cold Maladies, and all others of the Brain and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Parts. If there happen a complication of Diſeaſes, ſome of which require, others reject the uſe of the Waters, regard muſt be had to the moſt urgent and dangerous. They have not always the ſame effect; either becauſe they are corrupted by Rain, or vehement Heat conſumes their ſubtileſt Spirits, in which their chief virtue reſides; which likewiſe depend on the Quality, Quantity, Time, Place, and Manner wherein they are to be us'd: For they muſt be taken in the Morning, faſting, in a hot and dry Seaſon, as well becauſe they are then pureſt and leighteſt, as becauſe the Body better ſupports that quantity of cold Water, which relieves its natural Faculties languiſhing in great heat; and, if it may be, they muſt be taken at the Spring, the Spirits being eaſily diſſipated by tranſportation. The Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and Time of taking them, are not to be meaſur'd by the number of Glaſſes or Days, but proportionated to the Diſeaſe and its Cauſes, the diſeas'd Parts, the Age, Temper, Cuſtom, and other Signs, from which Phyſitians take their Indications: Which Conditions being well obſerv'd, it may be ſaid, God hath not given Men any thing more profitable than theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Waters, temper'd by Nature her ſelf, who makes us a free preſent of them; their diſproportion with our Bodies being the cauſe of their action upon them, (otherwiſe we ſhould turn them into our ſubſtance, as we do Plants and Animals); the bad ſucceſſes which happen by them being much more rare than thoſe of any other Medicaments, although the moſt rebellious Diſeaſes are commonly remitted to them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, That the ſtraight conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion between all the parts of the Univerſe makes this Queſtion hard to be judg'd;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whether it be better to Give than to Receive?</hi>
               </note> ſince they give nothing but what they receiv'd before. For our common Mother, the Earth, receives her fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs from the impreſſions of the Air; the Air, from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars; theſe their light and power from the Sun; and he his from his Maker: Which the <hi>Platonists</hi> repreſent to us by the mutual embraces of <hi>Porus</hi> and <hi>Penia</hi>; the one the God of Plenty, which is the original of Gifts; the other the Goddeſs of Neceſſity, which is the cauſe of Receiving; to ſhew, that they neceſſarily follow one the other. And as in Nature the attenuated and rarifi'd Parts ſtrongly attract the next for hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vacuity, and the full reject what is ſuperfluous; ſo in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality we may ſay, That Giving and Receiving are equally good and natural, not differing but in certain terms and reſpects;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66371:38"/>
otherwiſe a Man might be ſaid more or leſs excellent or happy than himſelf; there being no Perſon but hath need to Receive and power to Give at the ſame time, out of the Plenty or Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which he hath of ſomething; For ſhould he be ſtor'd with whatever he could wiſh, Might not we ask him, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not receiv'd?</hi> So then, 'tis Reception that hath put him into this happy ſtate; and if there be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in Giving, it proceeds only from having Receiv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Moreover, the three points which make a thing eſteem'd in the World, Profit, Pleaſure, and Honour, are all on the Receiver's ſide: For he muſt have renounc'd all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Self-love that can believe there is more Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Giving than in Receiving. And as for Honour, although it ſeem more openly to favour the party of thoſe that Give, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſince Giving and Receiving are Correlatives, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of either muſt be alike; and there cannot be Honour and Virtue in the one, but there muſt be ſo in the other; nor, on the contrary, Blame and Ignominy in the Receiver, but it reflects back upon the Giver. And as he who loves, is leſs excellent than he who is lov'd, becauſe he hath ſome perfection in himſelf which renders him lovely, which is ordinarily wanting in him who loves; ſo, between the Giver and the Receiver, the latter being as 'twere the Perſon lov'd, may be ſaid more noble than he who Gives, who is the Lover; for there is no leſs Liberality in the one Perſon to be willingly oblig'd, then in the other to oblige him; and beſides, Virtue being a habit of the Will, he who Receives with Gratitude, and deſires to Repay with Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may be ſaid as virtuous and as liberal in the act of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, as if he gave effectively. But this Virtue, commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Giver, is oftentimes rather Oſtentation and Vanity, than true Virtue. For either the Man gives ſuch things as himſelf needs, and then 'tis rather Folly than Virtue; or ſuch as are ſuperfluous, in which caſe 'tis no Virtue for a Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himſelf of a uſeleſs thing. Yea, ſometimes tis more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and diſhoneſt to Give than to Receive; for every thing reſtrain'd by the Laws is not only unjuſt, but vicious and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: Now the moſt part of Donations is reſtrain'd, not only by that rule of Givers, who ſay, That the Title <hi>De Donationibus</hi> is the Title of Fools, becauſe to Give is to Loſe; but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had an expreſs Officer call'd <hi>Comes Sacrarum Largitionum,</hi> who was to retrench the ſuperfluity of their Gifts, and put in execution that <hi>Formula</hi> of our Chambers of Accompts, <hi>Trop donné ſoit repeté; Too large a Grant is to be recall'd.</hi> Yea, the Donations of private Perſons were retrench'd by the ſame Laws; even thoſe between Husband and Wife; Legacies, by the Law <hi>Falcidia</hi>; Feoffments, by the <hi>Trebellian</hi>; Liberties, by the <hi>Caninian</hi> Law. But there can be no ſhame in receiving; ſince not only Kings, but God himſelf Receives from Men; and the Grandeur of the Meſſiah is not deſcrib'd by the Prophet, ſaving
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66371:39"/>
by the Preſents he was to receive of the Kings of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Saba</hi>; Gifts being a teſtimony of their excellence to whom they are conferr'd: Whence the Lawyers hold, That a Teſtamentary Legacy is a mark of Honour to the Legatee; as alſo they call the Fee which Advocates receive, <hi>Honorarium</hi>: And the Wiſe-man commands us to Reward the Phyſitian by the word of Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. In fine, The praeeminence of Receiving above Giving ſufficiently appears, in that our Lord invites us to Give, only by the promiſe and hope of Receiving an hundred fold.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Although to Give and to Receive be ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, that <hi>Seneca</hi> juſtly complains, That we know not how to do either; yet the former is far more excellent, according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s teſtimony, who in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> exhorts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to remember the Word of our Lord, <hi>That it is more bleſſed to Give than to Receive.</hi> For ſince, according to the Maxim, A man cannot give what he hath not, nor receive what he hath already; Giving is a ſign of Plenty and Perfection, as Receiving is of Want and Imperfection: Whence 'tis nobler to be lov'd than to love, becauſe Love is the deſire of a Good which we want, and is found in the Perſon lov'd. Moreover, ſince an Action is the more excellent, by how much 'tis more virtuous and honeſt; Giving, which is more virtuous becauſe more difficult than recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as being contrary to our natural inclination of Getting) is alſo more excellent. Wherefore Philophers reckon not amongſt Virtues the habit of Receiving, as being wholly mercenary; but account Liberality and Magnificence a Royal and Divine Virtue: For, if to Receive were an act of virtue, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> holds, who places Liberality as well in Receiving as in Giving, it had not been a Virtue in <hi>Curius</hi> to refuſe the Treaſures of the <hi>Samnites.</hi> But the action of Giving hath been honour'd, not only with the Name, but the Tokens and Ornaments of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Praiſe, and Honour; as Ignominy oftentimes adheres to thoſe that Receive. Now an Action is the more virtuous, the more 'tis honour'd and commended; and ſince many who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are aſham'd of it, and unwilling to have witneſſes of this action, whereas all that Give derive glory for ſo doing; there can be no virtue in Receiving, becauſe we are not aſham'd of Virtue, but only of Vice.</p>

            <p>AS every thing hath its Contrary, ſo to Poiſons there are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Counter-poyſons, call'd Antidotes, <hi>Alexipharmaca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</hi>
               </note> or <hi>Alexiteria,</hi> of a middle nature between Medicaments and Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with which they muſt have ſome ſimilitude, that they may joyn with and encounter them in the Body. Such is Vipers Fleſh, which enters into the compoſition of Treacle, againſt that Animal's bitings; in which Antidote divers other Poiſons are blended, which nevertheleſs being corrected one by another, they remain not only innocent, but ſerve to elude Poiſons which attaque men by trechery, ſeeeming Friends to them, that they may deſtroy them, more certainly than the good Wife mention'd by <hi>Auſonius</hi> did, who having given her Husband Sublimate enough to kill him, and fearing 'twould fail of its effect, caus'd him to ſwallow down Quick-ſilver, which comming to be joyn'd to the Sublimate, quell'd the ſtrength of it, and by this means ſav'd the Man. Diſeaſes ariſing from manifeſt qualities require contrary Remedies; as Plenitude, evacuation; a hot Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, cold Correctives: But when the imperceptible puncture or biting of a Scorpion makes the whole Body ſwell, or excites ſuch other ſymptoms, then Remedies acting by firſt and ſecond qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities being found unprofitable, we muſt have recourſe to Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, which act by an inexplicable Property of Subſtance, of which rank are our Antidotes.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Poiſons and Antidotes, Medicaments and Aliments, are not call'd ſo abſolutely, but as compar'd to the Natural Heat: For when ſubdu'd and turn'd into the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals Subſtance, they are call'd Aliments; when Nature is alter'd by them, Medicaments; when deſtroy'd, Poiſons; when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd from their malignity, Antidotes. Hence, according to the diverſity of this heat, one ſame thing is food to one and poiſon to others: As Hemlock is eaten by Goats and Quails, Henbane and Mandrakes by Swine, Cantharides by Swallows, Flies and Spiders by Poultry and Birds, although the ſame be poiſon to Men; ſome of whom do receive no hurt by poiſons, as 'tis reported of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> whoſe body was ſo prepar'd by his Antidote compos'd of Rue, Nuts, and Figs, that he could not kill himſelf by poiſon; of the Wench preſented to <hi>Alexander</hi> who was fed with <hi>Napellus</hi> or Monks-hood; of the old Woman in <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> who ſwallow'd 30 drachms of Hemlock without harm; of <hi>Athenagoras</hi> the Argian who was not hurt by Scorpions, wherewith the Aethiopians dwelling neer the River
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66371:40"/>
               <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> are fed as well as with Snakes, which <hi>Avicenna</hi> ſaith, another man kill'd by being bitten with them, poſſibly having his body full of a humour like faſting ſpittle, which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith kills Serpents and other Inſects. Theſe Poiſons and Antidotes are either Natural or Artificial; thoſe more frequent in Southern then in Northern Countries, are communicated by Potions, Powders, Juices, Vapours, Touches, and other deteſtable means. The Natural differ either in Matter, or in Quantity, or in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or in Operation. The Matter of Poyſons, which is found almoſt every where, is either within us, as the Seed and the Blood, which by corruption oftentimes acquire a venomous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſuch as alſo is that of the matter of the Epilepſie and Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Womb: Or elſe without us, in the Air, Water, and Earth; Fire alone being contrary to Poyſon and putrefaction, which eaſily happens to the Air and Water through their great humidity: But the Earth by its excrements and impurities ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies moſt Matter to Poyſons, which are drawn either from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, from Plants, or from Animals. Arſenic, Orpiment, Vitriol, Plaſtre, Lime, Sublimate, Borax, Verdegreaſe, Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Cinabar, Ceruſe, and Red-lead, are of the firſt order. To the ſecond belong Aconite or Woolf-bane, Chamalea or Widow-wayle, Yew, Spurge-lawrel, Thapſia or ſcorching Fennel, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymals, Hellebores, Vomiting Nut, Opium, Nightſhade, and many other Plants; ſome of which have only venomous Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as certain white Violets; others only their Fruits, as the Apples of Mandrake; or only the juice, as Lettice and Poppies; or the Seeds, as Henbane and Spurge; or the Roots, as Aconite and Hellebore. To the third belong <hi>Lepus Marinus,</hi> the Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, the Flie call'd <hi>Bupreſtis,</hi> the Scorpion, Viper, Aſp, Adder, Toad, Tarantula, Shrew-mouſe, and divers others; which are venomous either in all their parts, as Cantharides and Spiders; or only in ſome, as Vipers in the Tail and Head, the Hart and Fork-fiſh in the extremities of their Tails, the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in one of its Claws: Or in their Excrements; as the Gall of the Leopard, the Urine of a Mouſe, the Foam of a Mad-dog, the Sweat of an enraged Horſe, and the Blood of a Bull. As for the Quantity; although all Poyſons act in a little volume, yet ſome require leſs Matter; as Opium acts in leſs quantity than Hemlock; this, than the juice of Leeks; and this, than the juice of Lettice. According to Quality; ſome are hot, and either inflame, as <hi>Euphorbium</hi>; or corrode, as the <hi>Lepus Marinus,</hi> which particularly invades the Lungs; the Aſp, the Liver; Nightſhade and Henbane, the Brain; Cantharides, the Bladder. Others are cold, fixing the Spirits and natural heat, or hindring their free motion; as Opium, and the Salt of Lead. Others are dry; as Lime, Vitriol, and Arſenic, which conſume the Radical Humidity: For Humidity being a quality purely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and of it ſelf incapable of cauſing pain, there are no Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſimply humid. They differ alſo in their manner of acting;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66371:40"/>
the cold kill by conſopiting or ſtifling the Heat; Hellebore by vehement attraction of the Humours: Some corrode the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; others alter, reſolve, or putrifie it. And becauſe all Poiſons chiefly attaque the natural Heat, and the Heart; as the Swoonings, Palpitations, and Weakneſſes accompanying them witneſs: The Antidotes muſt be Cardiacal or friends to the Heart, ſtrengthening it, and joyning forces with it to expel or ſubdue the malignity of the Poyſon.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Phyſick oppoſes Poyſon, either by Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives before 'tis taken, or Remedies afterwards. Preſervation depends on the adminiſtration of the ſix Not-natural things; as the avoiding of Air and Places infected, perfuming them by burning of Wild-Thyme, Mountain-Majoran, Southernwood, Kings Spear, or Cedar; annointing the Body with Roſe-oyl, which is an Enemy to Serpents and venomous Creatures; and eating in Veſſels of Porcellane, and the like, which diſcover Poiſons. Simple Preſervatives are either appli'd outwardly, as the Topaz, Emerald, and other Amulets, worn next the skin; or inwardly, as Bezoar-ſtone, Bole-Armenick, Lemnian or Seal'd Earth, Vincetoxicum, Turnep, Dittany, Garlick, Rue, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, Pomegranate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of Compounds the moſt famous is <hi>Theriaca,</hi> or Treacle, made of above a hundred Ingredients. When Poyſon is already introduc'd into the Body, whether by biting, ſtinging, breathing, foam; or by the ſight, as that of the Baſilisk; or by the touch, as that of the Torpedo; or by the mouth; regard muſt be had to three things. 1. To ſtrengthen the Natural Heat, that it yield not, but may reſiſt the Poyſon; and to corroborate the Entrails, for fear they receive any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant impreſſion. 2. To deſtroy the force of the Poyſon. 3.

            <p>The Fourth ſaid, There are two ſorts of Miſtions in Nature; one, of Qualities; the other, of Subſtantial Forms. In the firſt, the Qualities being rebated by their mutual encounter, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able harmony or temper reſults, in which the prevailing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity bears ſway, and makes a Temperament hot, cold, dry, or moiſt. In the ſecond, theſe Qualities being alter'd, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Forms, which were contrary only by their adverſary Qualities, unite and conſpire into one particular Form, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Occult Properties, Sympathies, and Antipathies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Forms are found Friends or Enemies. Thus in all Medicaments there is a temperament of Qualities, which is the cauſe that Pepper is hot, Lettuce cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a temperament of Forms, which makes Agaric purge Phlegm; Sena, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; Rhubarb, Choler: ſome Drugs, Cardiacal; others Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalical, or Splenical. From the mixture of theſe Forms ariſes the action of Antidotes and Poyſon; and not from that of the Elementary Qualities, although they accompany their Forms, being their Servants and Vicegerents: Otherwiſe, did Poyſons kill by exceſs of heat or cold, Pepper and Cucumber would be Poyſon, as well as Opium and Arſenick; and a Glaſs of Cold Water would be the counter-poyſon of Sublimate: And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there are many <hi>Alexipharmaca</hi> which agree in firſt qualities with the Poyſons they encounter.</p>

               </gap>nd conſequently of Evil, is as well rank'd amongſt Natural Principles as Matter and Form, which are the Foundations of Entity and Good. And we ſee, Corruptions are as common as Generations, and Darkneſs as Light. But if we conſider Evil in the vitioſity of Entity, then, according to the Platoniſts, who call what is material and corruptible, Evil; what is ſpiritual
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66371:41"/>
and incorruptible, Good: Man, conſiſting both of a material and ſpiritual Subſtance, will be the Center where all Goods and Evils will terminate: In which reſpect he will be like the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil, plac'd by himſelf in Paradiſe; or like that, to which <hi>David</hi> compares him, <hi>planted by the brink of Waters,</hi> which are Afflictions. For his Branches and upper Parts being deck'd with Flowers, Leaves, and Fruits, which are the three ſorts of Goods which attend him; his Flowers (whoſe whiteneſs denotes the Innocence of his firſt Age) are the Goods of the Body, which paſs away with his Spring: His Leaves (whoſe Verdure is the Symbol of Hope, which never leaves him till death, being fading, and ſubject to be diſpers'd by ſtorms) are the Goods of Fortune: And his Fruits are the Goods of the Mind, Knowledg and Virtue, which are more ſavory and nutritive than the reſt. But if we behold the Roots of this Tree, wherewith 'tis faſten'd to the Earth, and which are the original of his Evils; ſome ſticking to that Stock of <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſource of his Original Sin, which ſends forth a thouſand Suckers of all ſorts of Vices and Paſſions; others, to that Clay from whence he was extracted, and which is the Principle of all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Infirmities; we ſhall find that his good things are external, and communicated from elſewhere; but his evil things are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and natural, and conſequently more communicative: For as to Vices, the Evils of the Soul, bad Examples corrupt more than virtuous edifie: And for thoſe of the Body, Diſeaſes are more eaſily gotten than cur'd; and Health is not communicable to others; but Epidemical Diſeaſes are: A bad Eye, a tainted Grape, and a rotten Apple infects its neighbour, but by parity of Reaſon might as well be preſerv'd by it. The Evils of others not on'y do us ill by Compaſſion, which is a ſort of Grief; but alſo their happineſs cauſes in us Jealouſie and Envy, the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Evils. Beſides, Good is rare, and conſequently not communicative; and Poſſeſſion fills, but ſatisfies not. Nor is Metaphyſical Good communicable, being an abſtracted not a real Quality: And if Evil ariſe from the leaſt defect of a thing, and Good only from its abſolute perfection; then ſince nothing is abſolutely perfect, Good is not communicated to any one thing here below; but, on the contrary, Evil is found in all.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That which hath no Being cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated: But Evil is not any thing real, and hath not any Efficient Cauſe, as was held by the Manichees and Priſcillianiſts, condemn'd for eſtabliſhing two Principles, one of Good, the other of Evil, independent one on the other. For ſince Good conſiſts in the integrity and perfection of Parts, and of whatever is requiſite to the Nature of a Thing, Evil is nothing but a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a defect and want of what is requiſite to its perfection. And, being a thing is communicated according as it hath more or leſs of eſſence, Good, which is convertible with Being, muſt be more communicative than Evil, which is only a Being imperfect.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66371:42"/>
God, who poſſeſſes Beeing and Goodneſs primarily, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf infinitely; as doth alſo Light, the moſt perfect of all created Subſtances. Moreover, the Nature of Good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in Suitableneſs and Appetibility, by reaſon of Contraries; that of Evil conſiſts in Unfitneſs and Averſion; and if Evil be communicated, 'tis always under the maſk and appearance of ſome Good, which alone is communicative by nature.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Good is more difficult than Evil, which is commonly attended with Profit and Delight, and conſequently more communicative. For Nature having implanted in us a love of our ſelves, doth alſo inſtigate us to ſeek after all means that may tend as well to the preſervation of our Nature, as to our Contentment; namely, Riches, Honour, Beauty, and all other Goods, either real or imaginary; which not being in our power, but almoſt all in others hands, cannot be much deſir'd without ſin, nor poſſeſs'd without injuſtice, much leſs acquir'd by lawful ways, much rarer and longer than the unlawful and bad, which are many, and eaſie, and conſequently more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>

Hence it comes that there is great variety of Languages and Dialects among Men; but one ſole faſhion of forming the ſame Voice amongſt Animals; who being more ſenſible of Pain than of Pleaſure (the former deſtroying Nature, the latter giving only a ſurpluſage of Goodneſs) when the Evil is ſo great and preſſing that they cannot avoid it, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and weakneſs makes them ſend forth Cries, to implore the help and aſſiſtance of their Fellows. For Nature having imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all Creatures a Knowledg of Good and Evil, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an inclination to the one, and an averſion to the other; ſhe hath alſo given them means of attaining thereunto, to wit, Local Motion, to go thither of themſelves; and a Voice to ſeek of others that Good they want, and deliverance from the Evil which preſſes them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:66371:42"/>The Second ſaid, That only ſuch perfect Animals as have Lungs have the gift of Voice; others, deſtitute either of Lungs, as Fiſhes; or of Blood, as moſt Inſects, (having little heat, of which Blood is the foundation) have no need of Air, which is inſpir'd only to cool and temper the exceſs of Natural Heat; and ſo for want of Air, which is the matter of Voice, are almoſt all mute, except the Dolphin, whoſe Voice is like that of Man. Graſs-hoppers, Flies, Bees, and other Inſects, make a noiſe and ſound indeed, by the colliſion of the Air and their Wings, but have no Voice, which is defin'd, A ſignificative ſound made by the mouth of an Animal; and by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> The ſtroak of the Air (attracted by reſpiration, and emitted by the Lungs) againſt the Larynx, to expreſs ſomething. So that the Efficient Cauſe of Voice is the Soul; the Matter, Air; the Form, Sound, or the colliſion of two ſolid Bodies; the End, to ſignifie ſomething: And ſo Animals cry, to ſignifie the grief they reſent: But why they teſtifie this grief by ſo different tones and accents, is as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to underſtand, as the laſt differences in which Philoſophers have plac'd that diverſity; as Howling, Barking, Bellowing. Braving, Roaring, Neighing, and ſuch other accents of Beaſts; the cauſe whereof is hitherto unknown.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Such Animals cry ſooneſt and longeſt who have the ſtrongeſt Imagination, the moſt exquiſite touch, the leaſt ability to ſuffer, and the leaſt conſcience, becauſe moſt ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of apprehenſion and pain; and their Spirits being diffus'd in a leſs bulk, are apteſt to be mov'd and gather'd together about the Heart; which by this means being unuſually oppreſs'd, communicate the ſenſe thereof to the Lungs, which ſuffering by ſympathy, and being inſtruments for the hearts eventilation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their functions then with more ſpeed and violence, by an irregular motion, forc'd by the preſent Neceſſity, and the pain which preſſes them; and ſo the Air which was contain'd in their ſpongy ſubſtance, iſſues forth impetuouſly, and by colliſion with the Epiglottis and other oppoſing parts, forms loud and reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clamours: Whence we may judg, That the ſecret intention of Nature, who diſpoſes theſe Organs in ſuch ſort that the Cry is a kind of interpreter of the Grief, was to give ſome refreſhment or ventilation to the Spirits thronged about the Heart, and alſo intelligible tokens of the Evil ſuffer'd by the Animal, either to move the injurer to compaſſion, or elſe to invoke the help of its own <hi>Species,</hi> or (by unknown inſtinct) that of the Author of Nature: For we ſee that Animals, by the motives of natural inſtinct, run to the cries of thoſe of their own kind. And ſince the Holy Scripture tells us, That not only Birds, and all other Animals, but alſo inſenſible things praiſe God; 'tis credible that in their anguiſhes they are lead by the ſame Principle to cry to him to help and preſerve the Work of his own Hand: Which is ſo true, that the wicked'ſt Perſons are forc'd by the interior mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a hidden power to lift up their hands to Heaven in their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66371:43"/>
Afflictions, and implore Succour and Aſſiſtance from on High.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Senſe of Touch is both more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and natural to Animals than any other; being the firſt they have, and the laſt they loſe: The dolour thereof is expreſs'd with Cries; to which Man, having the moſt exquiſite Touch, and conſequently being moſt ſenſible of pain, is alſo more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than other Creatures. And if that Ancient ſaid true, That Tears are mute execrations of the Sorrows of Life, which we begin and end with them, Cries may be ſaid the more manifeſt and earneſt, ſince they pierce the clouds, and ſee into aſcend to the the Throne of God, to demand ſuccour of him, when none is found upon Earth. 'Tis an impetuous ſound utter'd by an Animal, unable to reſiſt preſent or imminent Grief: For 'tis proportional to the violence of the Paſſion. Love, which is the gentleſt, renders it ſmooth and ſoft: Choler, the violenteſt, makes it more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And Grief, the moſt preſſing of all, and tending to the deſtruction of Being (which is equally abhor'd by all Creatures) ariſeth it to the higheſt tone of which 'tis capable: Whence even Speech, which being artificially divided into ſyllables and caden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is peculiar to man; yet in the precipitateneſs of Grief, keeps not its meaſures, but breaks into an inarticulate ſound, like that of Animals. For explication whereof it muſt be known, that the Cuticle, the chief ſeat of the Touch, and conſequently of Pain, is the expanſion of the Nerves, the conduits of the Animal Spirits, which in Pain either ſhrink inwards, and ſo cauſe ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; or being irritated and ſent by Nature to the aid of the hurt part, by Sympathy move the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and other ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and membranous Parts: For, as of two Lute-ſtrings ſet at the ſame pitch, the one ſounds upon the touching of the other; ſo in the Harmony of the whole Body, there may be the ſame ſympathy between the Spirits and the Parts; an evidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſeen in Tickling and Laughter, which is caus'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi>; which is the reaſon that the aſpect of ſuch as Laugh and Weep is much alike. And becauſe in Grief the coarcted Spirits hinder reſpiration, and free motion of the Heart; ttherefore Nature, to eaſe her ſelf, drives them outwards with violence, and with them moiſt vapours which partly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire by the pores, and are partly condens'd in the Brain, whence they flow through the eyes in ſtreams of Tears, which by this means greatly alleviate Grief, as the want of Them and Cries argues its vehemence: Beſides that, they may ſerve Animals to terrifie their Enemies, or elſe to implore the aſſiſtance of their Fellows; as we read of Elephants, that falling into a Ditch they call other Elephants to their aid.</p>

               </note> by God's Example, to draw Good out of Evil, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from the moſt pernicious things. So Phyſitians turn the ſtrongeſt Poyſons into wholeſom Remedies: Men uſe the ſpoils
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66371:43"/>
of the fierceſt Beaſts for nouriſhment, cloathing, and other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Life: And many great Perſonages have taken occaſion from bodily Diſeaſes, Shipwracks, Loſſes, Baniſhments, and other ſuch unkindneſſes of Fortune, to give up themſelves wholly to Virtue, and the Knowledg of Things. Since then En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is the greateſt of all Evils, as Unity is the moſt excellent of all Goods, and the nobleſt of all Virtues, as having no Vicious Extremity, but being perfect by being boundleſs; 'tis a Point of great Wiſedom to be able to draw ſome benefit from ones Enemies; whereof the principal is, that they oblige us to ſtand upon our guard, to order our demeanour well, and ſo to frame our Lives, that they may have no hold againſt us: For, as Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the Parent of Confidence and Liberty; this, of Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: So Enmity begets Diffidence, and this Circumſpection, with a great deſire of Virtue, and ſhame of Vice, whoſe turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude makes us bluſh more in the preſence of an Enemy than of a Friend, who being our other Self, complies with our humours and inclinations. And as Natural Agents are more vigorous in preſence of their Contraries (whence Fire ſcorches more in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in Summer) ſo the preſence of Enemies redoubles our ſtrength and courage; their neighbour-hood obliges us to have always our Arms in our hands, and keep good Guard; which made <hi>Cato</hi> declaim againſt thoſe who raz'd the Cities of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Numantia,</hi> both Enemies to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That if a Man be vicious, 'tis more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that he have Enemies than Friends; theſe too eaſily adhering to his debauches; but thoſe withdrawing him from them, either by reproaches, or by the example of a contrary life. If he be virtuous, his Enemies make his Virtue ſhine forth, whilſt it ſerves him for a defence and apology againſt all their accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and calumnies; and he finds it his intereſt to continue his virtuous Practiſes, that he may ſtill refute them; whereas the flatteries and compliances of his Friends inſenſibly corrupt him. Beſides, ſeeing a virtuous Man cannot be ſaid abſolutely perfect, but only to have fewer defects than another, his diſſembling or flattering Friends ſometimes know them not; but an Enemy takes notice of them, and blazing them abroad, gives him warning to correct them. Yea, it ſeems a ſign of a virtuous Man to have Enemies: For, beſides that Virtue hath been always envy'd and hated, and the higher a Man is in merit and dignity above others, he hath the more Enemies; reſemblance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners begets Friendſhip, and diſparity Enmity; and more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon are vicious than virtuous: But the vicious being unable to love any but thoſe like themſelves, hate all who follow not their example, as the virtuous do not, and ſo have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the World againſt them.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Enmities can produce no good, ſince either Vice, or Malice, or Ignorance is the cauſe; it not being poſſible but either he that is hated muſt be vicious, or elſe they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66371:44"/>
that hate him malicious or ignorant. For, as Friendſhip is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and cannot ſubſiſt without Virtue; ſo neither can En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, without the Vice and Malice of him that hates, or his that is hated, or both together. And as the Effects of Amity are Union, Concord, Security, and Peace; ſo thoſe of Enmity are Diviſion, Diſcord, Diffidence, Suſpicion, Treachery, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and other ſuch Effects, noxious not only to a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who cannot draw any benefit from what tends only to his ruine (as all Hatred doth); but alſo prejudicial to the Publick, which is totally deſtroy'd by Enmity, which breaks the bonds of Civil Society. On the other ſide, If all were Friends, one man would be a God to another (as that Ancient ſaid); and all men concurring together by mutual help, to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one anothers deſigns, there would be no more difficulty in Affairs, becauſe no oppoſition; and the World would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a harmony of favourable Succeſſes. Contrarily, 'tis Enmity makes one man a Woolf to another, a Stone of offence, and the Daemon of his bad fortune: For, the benefit of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our own Vices by our Enemies reproaches, is not to be compar'd to that which we receive from the good counſels of Friends, who are better qualifi'd for redreſſing our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe converſe affords the means to know them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the rude cenſures and affronts of an Enemy, being never taken in good part, cannot any wiſe contribute to the correction of our Manners. A wiſe and virtuous Man, who voluntarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to practiſe Virtue in all occurrences, finds ways enough to do it, without waiting to be conſtrain'd thereunto by the injuries and cenſures of Enemies: But the vitious will draw nothing from them but fewel to his rancour and revenge, without being inſtructed concerning his faults by the mouth of thoſe whom he utterly disbelieves. However, we muſt draw as much profit as we can from our Enemies; and 'tis the only comfort can be had againſt Hatred, to make uſe of it as an Antidote againſt its own Poyſon. But then, as 'twould be more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have no Griefs or Poyſons, than to be at the trouble of finding Anodynes and Counter-poyſons; ſo we may be allow'd to derive ſome remedy from Enmities againſt their Miſchiefs, and make as much profit of Vice as 'tis poſſible; but 'twould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to have neither Enemies nor Vices.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Nature ſubſiſts only by Contrariety. That, of the Firſt Qualities is the cauſe of all the Generations of Mixts in the great World. Man's Life laſts only ſo long as the Natural Heat acts upon the Radical Moiſture; when their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is ended, he muſt neceſſarily die. His Underſtanding hath no better means to obtain Truth, than by contrariety of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; whereof Identity is as diſagreeable to the Mind as 'tis to Nature: But his Will hath no more powerful Means to attain to Virtue than Reſiſtance, which ſharpens the Courage, and enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles Reſoltion. Therefore God has given Man a domeſtick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66371:44"/>
the Senſitive Appetite; that it being continually at war with the Will, might ſerve to exerciſe it, and render its Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more glorious; the Will, as well as the Underſtanding, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruſty when they want exerciſing, which whets and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them both. Hence S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not heard when he pray'd thrice to be delivered from the importunity of his Enemy; God judging it not expedient for his good; and having alſo permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hereſies in the Church, which the ſame Apoſtle ſaith are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the end to prove the Faith of its Members.</p>

               </note> of <hi>Admiration</hi>: thereby intimating our not knowing its cauſe: For Wonder is the Off-ſpring of Ignorance. Amongſt many other things, Three we find to admire in it; its Matter, Form, and Colours. Its Matter is not a moiſt Cloud, as moſt imagine; for (beſides that then we ſhould ſee Rain-bows more frequently than we do) a Cloud cannot reflect the Sun-beams with that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety or medley which we obſerve therein: For there would be but one colour, if the Cloud were diaphanous; and otherwiſe, it will be black and dark. 'Tis not therefore in a Cloud that the Rain-bow is form'd, but in the falling drops of Rain; as we ſee ſome Fountains form one in the Air, by the ejaculation of the Water ſtruck with the Sun-beams; as alſo by the ſpurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water out of the mouth, oppoſite to the Sun: For an <hi>Iris</hi> is not viſible, unleſs we be plac'd between the dropping Cloud and the Sun. If the Cloud be between our eye and the Sun, it will receive the Rays only on that ſide which is next the Sun, and not on that ſide which is towards us. Nor will any <hi>Iris</hi> appear, in caſe the Sun be between the Eye and the Cloud: For, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common opinion, it cannot be ſeen higher than three miles; but in this oppoſition of the Sun, the <hi>Iris</hi> will be remote from us above 18 degrees, which make above 1100 miles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing 60 miles to a degree, according to <hi>Ptolomie.</hi> Hence the Rain-bow which appears before Noon, is always towards the Weſt; as that which appears about or after Noon, is always to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, or the Eaſt; at which times we are between the Rain-bow, and the Sun.

drops of Water (which fall confuſedly and diſorderly) being irregular, and ſtruck obliquely by the Sun-beams, they make a refraction of his Light, like that which is made by Diamonds cut into Faucets, but more permanent; becauſe the drops of Water fall ſo ſwiftly and ſucceſſively that they ſeem continuous. A Rain-bow then is nothing elſe but the Light of the Sun, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in this falling Rain, and remitted to our eye by an Angle of refraction, different from that of its incidence; for if it were equal, the Image of the Sun would appear therein too, as we ſee it doth in <hi>Parhelia's.</hi> Indeed we may ſay, That the Rain-bow is an imperfect and begun <hi>Parhelion</hi>; the Light of the one being reflected regularly, and that of the other in confuſion, and diſorderly: And, That its Arch and circular Figure proceeds from the obliquity of the Sun-beams: Or elſe, That he being a Spherical Body, caſts his Rays circularly: Or, laſtly, from the Spherical or Parabolical form of the Cloud: Which is alſo true in the <hi>Iris</hi> which is form'd in the night by the Moon-beams, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in a Cloud diſſolving into Rain; ſaving that her Rays, being not ſo ſtrong and luminous as thoſe of the Sun, illuminate only the ſurface of the Water, and therein paint a faint whitiſh colour, and not ſuch an enamel of colours as is ſeen by day in the Solar <hi>Iris</hi>; which colours are nothing elſe but an imperfect Light, which cannot be directly reflected to the eye, by reaſon of the inequality of the Angles, and therefore at leaſt forms theſe Colours; of which the three principal are, Yellow, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinous, which is the higheſt; Blue, or Green, which is the middlemoſt; and Red, which is the loweſt: Amongſt which there are found divers others which partake of their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the diverſity whereof proceeds from the divers reception of the Rays in the Parts of the Cloud, differing in opacity; which not being great in the outmoſt part, the Sun-beams paint there a Yellowiſh colour; but greater in the middle, a Blew or Watchet; and greateſt in the inmoſt or loweſt part, a Red: as Experience ſhews us in the like ſubjects, wherein Light diverſly modifi'd, repreſents very neer the ſame variety of Colours; which although not real (as thoſe which ariſe from the various mixture of the four Elementary Qualities) yet are not abſolutely imaginary (as thoſe are which are ſeen by weak eyes about the flame of a Candle), but are true Colours, inaſmuch as they ſtrike the Sight, which a ſenſitive and corporeal Power, and are alike perceiv'd by all; nevertheleſs, they are leſs material than Elementary Colours, and are neerer akin to Light, not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſame, ſaving inaſmuch as it is here received diverſly in the eye, according to the rarity or denſity, ſituation, figure, and other qualities of the Object and <hi>Medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, The Rain-bow (the faireſt not only of all Meteors, but of all Nature's Works; being, according to the Cabbaliſts, the Throne of God, who, in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Crown'd therewith) doth not leſs dazle the Mind than
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66371:45"/>
raviſh the Eye; it being obſerv'd, That the clearer things are to the Senſe the obſcurer they are to the Underſtanding; and ſo on the contrary: For it cannot proceed from the different rarity and denſity of the Cloud, which being never alike, but infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly various, ſhould rather repreſent a thouſand different Figures and Colours; whereas the Rain-bow hath always a circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and the ſame Colours. And as there may be found more Clouds in ſeveral places, equally rare or denſe, and equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Sun (who enlightens Bodies equally diſtant after the ſame manner) ſo there ſhould be more Rain-bows at the ſame time in ſeveral places; which is contrary to experience: For we never ſee two uniform Rain-bows at once; the other Bow, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times included in the firſt, being not directly form'd by the Sun-beams, but by reflection of the Rays of the firſt Bow upon a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cloud; whence the Colours of ſuch ſecondary-Bow are not ſo lively as thoſe of the firſt, but are revers'd, the yellow being loweſt, the Green always middlemoſt, and the Red uppermoſt: For ſo by the reaſon of Catoptricks, we ſee that the <hi>Species</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected have a different ſituation from the Body which produces them (things on the right hand appearing on the left, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily); and the ſhadows of Bodies which paſs along the ſtreet entring by a ſmall hole into a dark Chamber, revers'd.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Experience teaches us, That when Light paſſes out of a thinner <hi>Medium</hi> into a thicker (as out of Air into Water) if it fall obliquely upon that thicker <hi>Medium,</hi> it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or refracted: But if it paſs quite through ſuch denſer <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> ſo that 'tis broken as well at its going out as at its entrance (eſpecially if the refraction in theſe two places be great enough) then this Light is turn'd into Colours. This Natural Effect is a Principle of the Opticks, and is obſerv'd not only in the Rain-bow, but alſo in triangular Cryſtals, and Glaſſes fill'd with clear Water, and expos'd to the Sun; provided the Glaſs be of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Figure revers'd; that is, narrower at the bottome, and wider towards the top. This being premis'd, the Production of the Rain-bow ſeems to be thus: When a Cloud, already wholly turn'd into Water, and actually falling down in drops of Rain (which reach from the top of the Cloud to the Earth) is ſhin'd upon by the oppoſite Sun, and the Spectator is plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sun and the Rain, then the Sun-beams paſſing through thoſe drops, are reflected, as by a Mirror, back again, by thoſe which are more remote; and paſſing by the ſides of thoſe which are neareſt (becauſe from one and the ſame part but one perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular Ray can fall upon a round Figure, as that of drops of Water is, all the other Rays being oblique) they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be twice broken: Firſt, as they are reflected by the remoter drops, and paſs out of the Air comprehended between thoſe remoter, into the other drops nearer us: And ſecondly, as they iſſue out of theſe nearer drops, into the Air which is between them and us. And thus from this different fraction caus'd by the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66371:46"/>
various rarity and denſity of the Air and Water, the diverſity of Colours in the Rain-bow ariſeth. For, Water being not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diaphanous, but ſomewhat of a middle nature, between perfectly Tranſparent and Opake, reflects part of the Rays which fall upon its ſurface, and lets the other part paſs through; as 'tis obſerv'd in Rivers and Ponds, upon which we ſee the Suns Image by reflection, but Divers and Fiſh behold it by refraction. So 'tis with drops of Water; thoſe neereſt us reflect part of the Sun-beams towards the Sun himſelf, without forming an <hi>Iris,</hi> becauſe theſe reflected Rays meet not other drops to refract them; but when part of thoſe Rays, which paſs'd through the ſmall intervals of the firſt drops, are reflected by the other remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from us, then theſe reflected Rays lighting by the way upon the firſt drops between which they had paſs'd, they are broken thereby both at their going in and coming out, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the <hi>Iris,</hi> which conſequently is form'd by Reflection and Refraction; reflection, by all the drops which receive Light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſame towards the Sun; and refraction of the ſame Light ſo reflected, when by the way as it returns it meets thoſe other drops of Water, which refract it twice, and give it the diverſity of Colours, which ariſeth from the divers reception of the Light into thoſe parts of Water, more or leſs denſe and rare. But now to give account of the circular Figure of this Meteor, which is not only in appearance circular (as ſquare Towers ſeem round at a diſtance) but is ſo really; 'tis requiſite to take a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poſition of the Sun; and by one example 'twill be eaſie to judg of others. Let us ſuppoſe then that the Sun is at the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and conſequently that all the Rays he ſends directly upon the drops of Rain, as well the higheſt as the loweſt, are parallel between themſelves, and to the Horizon, (for the elevation of a Cloud, how great ſoever, being inconſiderable in reſpect of the Sun's diſtance from the Earth, hinders not but that all his Rays are always parallel between themſelves) which being reflected, as hath been ſaid, the reflection of them will be alſo parallel to the Horizon, or very neer ſo; for here we conſider only that which is made by the middle of the drop, which is the ſtrongeſt by reaſon of its round figure; and this reflection being receiv'd by the ſuperior part of ſome other drop which it finds in its way, and there twice broken, to wit, at its going in and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth; the two Refractions joyn'd together diſtort the Ray about 45 degrees; that is to ſay, the Ray thus twice broken will make with the lines parallel to the Horizon an Angle of 45. degrees, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> from on high downwards, and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth. And becauſe all the drops make ſuch a Refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we have mention'd, therefore all ſuch Perſons as ſhall be between the Sun and the drops of Rain, ſhall ſee the <hi>Iris</hi> of the ſame heighth, namely, of 45 degrees (although from ſeveral ſtations); ſome in the lower drops, namely, ſuch Perſons as are neereſt the Cloud; others, to wit, ſuch as are more remote,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66371:46"/>
in the higher drops; becauſe they all ſee it by Rays parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves, and conſequently by equal Angles. Now the drops make refraction not only by their ſuperior parts, but alſo by their ſides and lower parts; whence thoſe on either ſide of the Spectator, diſtant by an Angle of 45 degrees, will make him ſee their refraction, and conſequently the <hi>Iris</hi> on either ſide under equal Angles; which being made on all ſides about a right line drawn from the Sun to the Spectators eye, which may be call'd the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Iris,</hi> it neceſſarily follows, That the <hi>Iris</hi> muſt appear perfectly round about this <hi>Axis</hi>: So that the drops elevated above this <hi>Axis</hi> 45 degrees, will make the upper part of the <hi>Iris</hi> by the refraction of their ſuperior parts. Thoſe on either ſide, diſtant likewiſe 45 degrees, will make the ſides of the <hi>Iris</hi> by refraction of their parts which are at the remoter ſides; and ſo of all the drops which ſhall be about the <hi>Axis,</hi> under equal Angles of 45 degrees. As for other drops neerer or further from the <hi>Axis</hi> and the Spectator, they will repreſent an <hi>Iris</hi> to others who are not in the ſame <hi>Axis,</hi> but neerer or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter from the Cloud, and ſituate in ſuch place that thoſe drops appear diſtant from the <hi>Axis</hi> by Angles of 45 degrees. So that as many Spectators as there are between the Sun and the Cloud, and not in the ſame <hi>Axis</hi>; ſo many <hi>Axes</hi> muſt be imagin'd, about which there are different Arches and Rainbows. Now in this Horizontal Poſition the Bow appears a perfect Semi-circle, whoſe Center is in the Horizon, at the Point where the <hi>Axis</hi> termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates. But when the Sun is in another Poſition, as elevated ſome degrees yet fewer than 45, then the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Iris</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Sun through the Spectator's eye, penetrates the Earth; and ſo the Center (which is always at the end of the <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>) is below the Horizon; and the portion of the <hi>Iris</hi> which we behold is leſs than a Semi-circle, greater than which it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath well obſerv'd. For ſince the Bow is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways leſs than a Semi-circle whilſt the Sun is elevated above the Horizon, it muſt be a Semi-circle when he is in the Horizon, and none at all when he is below the Horizon, becauſe he doth not then illuminate the Cloud: Hence 'tis ſeldome produc'd in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe when it rains in that Seaſon the whole Heaven is cloudy, and covers the Sun-beams; as neither in the Summer and Spring at noon, when the Sun is higher than 45 degrees, but only at Morning and Evening.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s definition of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow be true, who defines it, An Arch conſiſting of divers colours, which the reflection of the Sun-beams repreſents upon a hollow Cloud ready to diſſolve into Rain, we need not ſeek much for Material, Formal, and Efficient Cauſes (for he aſſigns no Final of it; but the Scripture doth, namely, to be a moral ſign of the Covenant between God and Men.) Of the firſt there is no doubt, unleſs amongſt blind men, to whom only God can make a demonſtration of it; but the reſt are very obſcure: To judg
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66371:47"/>
of which we muſt obſerve, That the Angle of Reflection is equal to that of Incidence; ſo that a right perpendicular Line, erected at the common point of Incidence and Reflection, will equally biſect the Angle comprehended by the Ray of Incidence and that of Reflection; which is not true, unleſs when the Ray of Incidence is terminated by a very ſmooth and opake Body, as that of a Mirror: Whence 'tis infer'd, That a Cloud not having ſuch evenneſs or ſmoothneſs will not reflect the Light or Ray at an equal Angle, but will diſſipate and remit it elſewhere: So that if one part of a Cloud, which is directly oppoſite to the Sun and ſmooth, reflect the Ray directly; and another obliquely oppoſite to him, diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort and reflect it elſewhere (as 'tis much more probable, than always to imagine Clouds exactly ſmooth, poliſh'd, and even) it appears, That there will not be form'd a Figure of an Arch uniformly colour'd, but rather a confus'd medley of colours. Beſides, if Reflection repreſent any thing, 'tis the ſame thing that is oppoſite, not another: But 'tis not the Sun that we behold in the Cloud, but a mixture of Colours, no wiſe like, nor ſo much as an imperfect repreſentation of him, as ſome have pleaſed to affirm: For Reflection would ſhew us either the Sun, or an imperfect repreſentation of him; not in the Cloud, but as far beyond it as the Object (the Sun) is from it. So that we ſhall explicate <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> better if we ſay, That thoſe Colours appear by irradiation; and, that the Light diverſly receiv'd, and not reflected, makes the variety of this goodly Spectacle: For they who ſay 'tis Refraction, are miſtaken; for Refraction only alters the place of the Object repreſented by the <hi>Species,</hi> which is broken by the occurſe of a <hi>Medium</hi> of unequal opacity; but doth not produce divers colours, ſuch as thoſe of the <hi>Iris,</hi> which I conceive we may more ſafely admire, with many other of God's Works (indiſputable teſtimonies of his Power and our Weakneſs) than vainly ſeek their Cauſes.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, He conceiv'd no demonſtration more manifeſt to prove the manner of the Rain-bows production than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of a Phial of Water, which, expos'd to the Sun upon ſome ſolid Body, repreſents the ſame Colours with thoſe of the Rain-bow: So that the ſame thing is done in the Sky when the Sun-beams paſs croſs an aqueous and diaphanous Cloud, and are reflected to the other ſide by another Cloud, whoſe thickneſs hath ſome reſemblance of ſolidity; and ſo 'tis not ſufficient that ſuch aqueous Cloud be interpos'd between the Sun and the Eye, but there muſt be alſo another oppoſite Cloud, denſe enough to reflect thoſe Rays of the Sun, who being hollow according to the figure of the Sky, imprints that lucid circular Figure, and gives it the name of a Bow.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That a Rain-bow may be foretold ſome time before it happens, when the Wind comes from that Quarter where the Sun is, and a Cloud coming from the ſame Quarter paſs over our heads, and ſhed Rain as it paſſes: For if the Sun
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66371:47"/>
appears at the ſame time, you will ſee an <hi>Iris</hi> as ſoon as the Cloud becomes oppoſite to him; which <hi>Iris</hi> will be the more lively and colour'd, according as the falling Rain was greater, and the Sun happens to be clear; as alſo ſo much more elevated as the Sun is depreſs'd. But if the Sun be 45 degrees high, you will ſee no <hi>Iris,</hi> the Refraction not being then proper to produce it. If it happens after Rain, it ſignifies fair weather, and the Sky clears up, in that Quarter whence the Wind blows. But if the Wind blow from the Quarter oppoſite to the Sun, and drive a Cloud and Rain before it; and if the Sun alſo appear at the ſame time, then you will ſee the <hi>Iris</hi> before the Rain, which we may foretel will fall upon the place whence the <hi>Iris</hi> is beheld, provided the Cloud can ſubſiſt any while, and be not too ſpeedily reſolv'd all into Rain at the place where it is ſeen; for where ever an <hi>Iris</hi> is ſeen, there it rains.</p>
            <p>Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, That the Eye and the Ear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> being the Senſes whereby the Mind receives the <hi>Species</hi> of things which it knows; the former is proper for Invention;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whether the Reading of Books is a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way for Learning than Vocal Inſtruction?</hi>
               </note> and the latter, call'd the Senſe of Diſcipline, chiefly for Learning. For the Voice, as the Proverb ſaith, is more powerful than dumb Maſters; becauſe being animated with the geſture and motion of the Eyes, Mouth, Hands, and whole Body, it makes more impreſſion upon the Mind than the dead ſtyle of Books; which beſides, being Inſtructors whom we cannot interrogate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our doubts, as we may the living, they leave more ſcruples in the Readers mind than they reſolve: For our cognition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the <hi>Species</hi> and Animal Spirits, theſe follow the drift and motion of the Voice, whoſe accents conſequently being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſad, amorous, warlike, or furious, according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the ſubject, imprint like affections in the Soul; and this through the near communication there is between the Air and thoſe Spirits of the Body, which are alſo aerious, and of great mobility. And ſince Writing is only the ſign of Speech, as this is of the Minds conception, it leſs perfectly expreſſes its Author's thought than the Voice, the perfect Image of his Conception, which is call'd the Internal Speech, as the voice is the External; and being the Original from which Writing is drawn, repreſents our Conceptions better than the Copy; as all Exemplars dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat proportionably to their remoteneſs from their Prototype.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That written Diſcourſes are better digeſted, and ſuſtain themſelves better by their own weight, than words diſguis'd by the maner of expreſſion, or cadence, geſtures, and other ſleights, which corrupt the ſimplicity of things; whence the Comedian that comforted <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and reviv'd his loſt deſire of haranguing, made him confeſs, That one and the ſame verſe of <hi>Homer</hi> was another thing when well and when ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd: And bad Poets fear nothing ſo much as that others ſhould read their Works; the Name which themſelves give them
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66371:48"/>
cauſing others to judg them different from what they are; and the ſuddenneſs of pronuntiation not allowing the mind ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to reflect upon them. Moreover, Books flatter much leſs, and have more univerſal Precepts than Speech, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly affects complaiſance, and the gaining of the hearers good will: Particularly in morality, Great Perſons are better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and more plainly reprehended for their faults by Books than by Diſcourſes, which ſeldom tell them the truth freely, every one fearing the effects of hatred enſuing it, which Books care not for. Beſides, No diſcipline is harder than Politicks; which being the Miſtreſs of all others, may juſtly give Law to them. And were the way of learning the Sciences by Books longer than that by the Voice, yet 'tis the ſafer, yea, almoſt that alone by which we reap benefit; all thoſe that are Learned, having learn'd more by the Reading and Meditation of Books, than by having heard the Voice of their Maſters in Schools, where often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the noiſe is greater than the fruit. For, our Memories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treacherous, we never repeat things ſo well as we write them; and in caſe of miſtakes or omiſſions, we are aſham'd to acknowledg our faults, but defend them with obſtinacy; whereas we ſcruple not to correct a Writing, to view and review it, and, according to <hi>Horace</hi>'s counſel, keep it nine years before publiſhing. But Words are utter'd as ſoon as thought; and hence when we ſee thoſe fine Diſcourſes in Writing, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd all the World in the Chair and at the Bar, we are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſham'd of having admir'd them: Which perhaps as much or more kept <hi>Cicero</hi> from letting his Orations be read in his youth, as his pretended excuſe of reſerving to himſelf the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of contradicting himſelf. Wherefore there being more to be learn'd in a well-digeſted and exact Piece, Writing (which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſuch) muſt alſo be more proper for Inſtruction: Which is ſo true in the Mathematicks, to which alone the name of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline belongs, that none ever preſum'd either to teach or learn them by Speech alone.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That a good Compariſon muſt be of things alike; and ſo if we compare Speech and Writing, it muſt be in reſpect of two things equally perfect in their kind; as an exact Diſcourſe, and an exact Writing. You muſt alſo bring two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the ſame pitch, and they muſt have equal time to learn the ſame thing; in which caſe, the circumſtances being the ſame, there's no doubt but Speech is more advantageous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto than Writing, which is not abſolutely neceſſary, as the Voice is, without which the latter is unſerviceable; he who reads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to underſtand any thing, unleſs he hath already heard it ſpoken of. Hence one naturally deaf is uncapable not only of the Sciences, but alſo of the uſe of Reaſon, yea, of Speech too: Whereas, on the contrary, ſome born blind, and who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never read, have nevertheleſs prov'd very learned. And this prae-eminence of Speech above Writing, appears eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66371:48"/>
in that the latter cannot be expreſſed without the former. Whence ſome juſtly doubt whether dead Languages, even ſuch as are moſt familiar to us, as Greek and Latine, are not loſt as to their beſt part, their pronunciation: So that the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time, would poſſibly no more underſtand us ſpeaking Greek and Latine, than thoſe of the preſent Age: Whence 'twould not be knowing of things, to know them only by Books, by which alſo none ever learn'd Languages, but only by Speech.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That this Queſtion admits not of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute determination, in regard of the different capacities of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Learners, as alſo of the Arts or Diſciplines which are learn'd: For nimble Heads, and impatient of Labour, ſuch as the Cholerick and Sanguine commonly are, ſuit better with Vocal Inſtructions than with Reading; which, on the contrary is more pleaſing and profitable to the Melancholy and Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, who take more time for reflection and meditation upon what they read. Again, Such Diſciplines as conſiſt chiefly in Contemplation, as Divinity, Natural Philoſophy; the pure Mathematicks; together with thoſe which require great Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as Hiſtory and Law, have more need of Reading. But thoſe that conſiſt in Action are better learn'd by Speech, which hath more affinity with action, and ſets it out better; Such is Oratory, the practical part of Phyſick and Law, Mechanick Arts, and Handicrafts, which 'tis impoſſible to learn by Books, although one may be render'd more perfect therein by them.</p>

Thoſe who ſay, 'Tis the place where the Element of Fire tranſpires and purges its fuliginoſities; or elſe, a ſort of Fire denſer than the Elementary; are as little credible as thoſe others who think the Sun ſometimes made his courſe in this Milky-way, as he doth now in the Zodiack, in which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he leaves no print of combuſtion or light: Much leſs <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophraſtus,</hi> who ſaid, 'Twas the conglutination and ſoader of the two Hemiſpheres; and that at the place where they are united and ſoader'd together, this brightneſs appears different from the reſt of Heaven. But I conceive it to be nothing elſe but a part of Heaven, more denſe, and conſequently more luminous than the others. For Heaven having a radical Light, the denſer and cloſer its parts are, they are the more luminous; as appears by the Stars, which are the denſer parts of their Orb, not viſible in regard of its rarity; and by Water, part of which condens'd by cold, reflects the Light, and appears white, the remainder of liquid Water abiding tranſparent.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, He judg'd no Opinion more ridiculous than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s, who held this Milky-way to be a Meteor ſhining not in Heaven, but in the Air, where 'tis fed by Exhalations plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupply'd from the Earth, whence they are attracted, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66371:49"/>
fired by the Stars in this place. For if this Milky-way were of the nature of Comets or other lucid Meteors, it could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſubſiſt, but only while its matter laſted; which, beſides, would be more copious in ſome ſeaſons then in others, (as in Spring and Autumn, then in the droughts of Summer or froſts of Winter, which cloſes the pores of the earth); and ſo it would not have the ſame permanent poſition and figure, no more then denſity, rarity, latitude and equality of its parts, ſo conſtant that on the ſide of <hi>Caſſiopaea</hi> it always appears alike winding, and likewiſe in other places: though we ſhould grant the earth ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſupply fumes enough for feeding this ſo ſpacious circle; which yet the diſproportion of this point of the World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the vaſt extent of that circumference, palpably prov'd to be in the Firmament, allows not. For (beſides that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Parallaxes would repreſent it under ſeveral Stars to the Inhabitants of ſeveral places, if it were in the air; as it happens to Comets and other aerious impreſſions; and yet 'tis always ſeen in the ſame place and equally diſtant from the fix'd Stars) its proper motion from Weſt to Eaſt, whereby it moves one degree in a hundred years demonſtrats that 'tis in the eighth Sphere, whoſe particular motion is the ſame. And <hi>Galileo</hi>'s Glaſſes, which have diſcover'd abundance of Stars in this part, convincingly manifeſt that 'tis nothing but an aſſembly of almoſt innumerable ſmall Stars, which not being great enough to tranſmit their light to us diſtinctly, the ſame is confounded and united together (as 'tis proper to all qualities, and ſo of Light, to aſſociate it ſelf to other light) and thus produces that whiteneſs which is a weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect light. For 'tis not enough that an object be luminous; it muſt be great and large, or elſe near the eye, to be viſible: the Stars, as well as all other natural agents, having a ſphere of activity, beyond which their action is not ſenſible: hence the Planets, and of them the Moon, as neareſt us, ſeem greater than the fix'd Stars; whoſe rayes being weakned by their diſtance, cannot come directly to us, as thoſe of the Planets do, but twinkle and ſparkle.</p>
            <p>Now though Aſtrologers make but ſix ſorts of fix'd Stars, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſix different magnitudes; (thoſe of the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 170 times greater then the Earth, and thoſe of the laſt and ſixt, 18 times) yet <hi>Tycho Brahe, Americus Veſputius,</hi> and divers others, have diſcover'd ſome much leſs, and leſs luminous, then theſe laſt. Nor are they to be credited who have limited their number to 1022, which the Scripture ſaith is infinite and known to God alone, to whom the Prophet attributes it as a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to number them and call them by their names.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, There are two ſorts of Milky-ways; one in the Air, and the other in the Heaven. The firſt, of which alone <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſpoke, is a light produc'd by exhalations either fired or irradiated, as in Comets: from which this milky way differs only upon account of its great extent caus'd by the plenty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66371:50"/>
of Exhalations attracted by a great number of Stars which are neer <hi>Caſſiopaea</hi> and the Poles, where alſo this Way is brighter then in other places. The other Milky Way is part of the Heaven or Firmament, equally dividing the ſame in two, as other Circles do; although 'tis rather a Zone or Space then a Circle, as well as the Zodiack, with whom it agrees in that it hath breadth as that hath, and is oblique to the Aequinoctial, having other Poles than thoſe of the World: but differs in that 'tis not ſo broad, the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack having ſixteen degrees, and this commonly between eight and ten; for 'tis neither equally broad, nor luminous in all its parts; and its obliquity is much greater than that of the Zodiack, the middle of which recedes not from the Aequinoctial above 23 degrees and a half; but this about 56 degrees and a half towards the North, and neer 63 degrees towards the South. It differs alſo from all the great Circles, in that it changes poſition according to the motion of the Firmament; ſo that 'tis mov'd with two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, namely, that of the Firſt Mover, from Eaſt to Weſt, upon the Poles of the World, making an intire revolution in one day; and another proper to it ſelf, from Weſt to Eaſt, upon the Poles of the Ecliptick, in the ſame time with the Firmament; which motion the other Circles have not, being either not mov'd at all, as the Horizon and Meridian; or only by the motion of the Firſt Mover, as the Aequinoctial, Ecliptick, Tropicks, and Colures.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Which is moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Gold or Iron?</hi>
               </note>Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, That the Earth produces Metals to be imployed for ſeveral uſes, in order to humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Society; which being founded upon Hope and Fear, Reward and Puniſhment, Gold and Iron, the two moſt powerful Metals, are highly inſtrumental to the eſtabliſhing of the ſame. Gold, which an Ancient call'd the Sun of the Earth, being the Star which gives light to our hope, and the ſweet influences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And Iron, by its obſcure and livid colour being the dark Star of our fear and of death, whereof 'tis the moſt uſual Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But as Fear is without compariſon ſtronger than Hope (for the one tends to the preſervation of Being, the other only to Well-being) ſo Iron, the Inſtrument of Terror, muſt likewiſe have more powerful effects than Gold, which is only the object of Hope. Moreover, the Law relieves ſuch as the Juſt Fear of Iron may have conſtrain'd to any thing, as being the greateſt violence in the World; but not thoſe whom the deſire of Gold or hope of Gain hath engaged to any Affair. And indeed, all Earthly Powers are meaſured only by the point of the Sword: Arms and Iron ſeem to be the ſhare of Kings and all the Nobility, as Gold that of Merchants and the Vulgar, from whom all Sovereigns know how to get it when they think fit. Beſides, ſince Gold hath need of Iron, not only for the digging of it out of the entrails of the Earth, but alſo for defending and preſerving it (an evidence of its weakneſs) it may be ſaid the prey of him who knows how to manage Iron beſt. And <hi>Solon</hi> had reaſon to contemn the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66371:50"/>
of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> who made a ſhew of his riches as of his greateſt power; foretelling him that it would become the booty of him that ſhould have a ſharper ſword. And <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> never conquer'd ſo many places by trucket with Mules laden with Gold, as his Son did whole Kingdoms by the Sword. But what power can we give to Gold, which weakens and enervates its poſſeſſors; as appears by the Lacedemonians, who were maſters of <hi>Greece</hi> whilſt Iron alone was in uſe with them, and were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Gold which <hi>Lyſander</hi> brought thither. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Tacitus</hi> had reaſon to believe the Gauls of his time weak in war becauſe they were rich. For what is commonly ſaid, That Gold is the ſinew of War, is true as to the power of levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maintaining of men, but not as to the performing of great exploits and enterpriſes. Mercenary Souldiers and Venal Souls being ordinarily baſe and of ill qualities; if they do any thing, 'tis forc'd and of little duration, nor do they continue longer then the Gold laſts. Iron, on the contrary, is maintain'd by it ſelf and its own power. Every one fears to offend ſuch as have only Iron by their ſide, as thoſe by whom nothing is to be gotten, but much may be loſt. For to uſe Gold for repelling enemies and diverting them elſewhere, conſtant experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts it a very dangerous remedy; ſince beſides the ignominy of becoming, as it were, tributaries, they are never driven ſo far but they ſoon return, more irritated with the thirſt of this Gold then they were before with the honour of Victory. In fine, ſince men yield ſooner to violence then to gentleneſs, Iron which conſtrains and forces is much more powerful then Gold which perſwades, but chiefly in War, where the braveſt and moſt generous exploits are perform'd by open force and not by ſurpriſes and treacheries; he not being properly overcome who was willing to be ſo, and ſuffer'd him ſelf to be corrupted: but a Victory gotten by pure Valour, ordinarily takes from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the deſire of returning.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Victory being the end of War, it matters not by what means that end is obtain'd, the eaſieſt and leaſt bloody of which are ſtratagems and ſurprizes; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides being the effects of Wit and Prudence, ſeem more proper to man then down-right force, wherein beaſts ſurpaſs us, and which is oftimes accompani'd with injuſtice. Wherefore Gold, whereby all ſecret intelligences are contriv'd, ſeems to have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Iron; as ſlights in War are more efficacious then open force. As alſo it makes leſs noiſe and hath more fruit; whereas Iron oftentimes equally ſubdues and weakens both parties. And Victory, the thing aimed at by War, cannot be call'd ſuch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be intire. Iron indeed ſubdues bodies, not hearts; but Gold wins both together.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Gold and Iron may be conſider'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimply as Metals, or elſe as Inſtruments of civil life. In the former conſideration Gold being of a more perfect nature, hath
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66371:51"/>
alſo more power then Iron the moſt imperfect and terrene of all; beſides, its ductility makes it more capable of extenſion then any other; which is an evidence of its perfection. If they be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as means and inſtruments deſtinated to the uſe of life, which is the nobleſt end whereunto they can be imploy'd; Gold will ſtill have the advantage over Iron; ſince, if we credit the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, potable Gold is profitably employ'd for health and the prorogation of life; and the ſame Metal is alſo the bond of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, which cannot ſubſiſt without commerce, nor this without money, for which Gold is the moſt proper, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſmall bulk the value of all other Metals of lower alloy. Hence we ſee the people commonly raiſe the price of it beyond what the Prince ſets upon it; and 'tis as much deſir'd by all the world, as Iron is abhorr'd; all Profeſſions and Trades aiming at the enjoyment of gold, which ſeems to be the ultimate end of all humane actions in this life, whatever diſguiſes men aſſume under the pretexts of honour and vertue, whoſe luſtre is alſo ſet off by that of Gold, employ'd for this purpoſe to crown the heads of Monarchs, and to render divine worſhip more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That as Iron makes Hammers and Anvils which ſerve to give Gold what form we pleaſe; ſo 'tis every where the maſter of gold, and conſequently more powerful in Peace and War, affording Grates, Locks and Keys for ſecuring Gold in the former, and Swords for defending it in the latter. For Gold ſerves only to make the poſſeſſor envi'd, and inflame the deſires of ſuch as want it. 'Twas with Iron that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans became maſters of the Gold of other Nations, and the Portugals conquer'd that of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the Swiſſes overcame the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; the Hiſtory obſerving that all their wealth was not worth the Gold wherewith the Burgundians had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd their horſes bridles.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the end being not only more noble but alſo more powerful then the means, Iron, which is commonly employ'd for the getting of Gold muſt be alſo inferior to it. And 'tis univerſally acknowledg'd that Gold is the ſinew of War; it levies and keeps men together, it makes the Cannon move and all its train. 'Tis with Gold that we corrupt Spies, without whoſe informations all Iron and ſtrength would be oftentimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Wherefore ſince Iron borrows its power from Gold; by the Philoſophical Maxim, it hath leſs power then it.</p>

            <p>THe Firſt ſaid, The material cauſe of Vapours is aqueous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> humidity; the efficient, external heat; the formal,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the cauſe of Vapours.</hi>
               </note> rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; the final, is various, according to nature's different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: but commonly, the elevation of an aqueous body, which remaining in its firſt conſiſtence would weigh more then air, and conſequently could not be carried to thoſe higher places where 'tis needful for the generation of Mixts, which cannot be done without tranſmutation of the Elements into the places, yea, and natures alſo, one of another. So Roſes in an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick would evaporate nothing, if they were depriv'd of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, as appears in their dry'd Cakes; nor what humidity may be in them, without heat; which humidity is rarifi'd and carri'd upwards before it deſcends, being again condens'd into the water which reſided in the Cake before its ſeparation by heat; which conſequently is the moſt evident cauſe of Vapours.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, There are ſome vapours that are hot and dry, as appears not only by the ſmoak exhaling from boiling Pitch and other unctuous bodies; but alſo by the vapours that iſſue out of the earth, which would never be inflam'd ſome in the ſurface of the earth, others in the middle of the air, and others beyond the higheſt region, and even in the heavens, if they were only of the nature of water which quencheth inſtead of conceiving fire: as, on the other ſide, Rain, Hail, Snow, Dew, and other aqueous and incombuſtible Meteors argue that all Vapours (of which they muſt be produc'd) are not hot and dry. Whence I conclude that as the matter of vapours is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo their other cauſes are all different, eſpecially the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For the degree of heat that evaporates water will not make Oyl exhale; as we ſee a great glaſs will be ſooner evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated then a ſpoonful of the latter; and the Chymiſts make uſe of a ſmall fire or even of the Sun to diſtill their waters, but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their fire, to extract Oyls. Moreover (as to the material cauſes) the vapours of hot and dry bodies are more groſs and earthy; thoſe of pure water more ſubtle; and (as to the final) aqueons vapours ſerve to irrigate, unctuous to impinguate the earth.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, 'Tis not credible that heat is the efficient cauſe of vapours, ſince they abound more in Winter then Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in leſs hot Climats then in ſuch where heat predominates, which have none at all; as <hi>Egypt</hi> and other places, where it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66371:52"/>
rains. If you ſay that there are no vapours there, becauſe the Suns heat dſſipates as faſt as it raiſes them, you imply heat contrary to vapours ſince it diſſolves them and ſuffers them not to gather into one body.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Copiouſneſs of vapours in cold Seaſons and Regions makes not againſt their production by heat; ſince the heat which mounts them upwards is not that of the Suns rays, but from within the earth, which every one acknowledges ſo much hotter during Winter in its centre as its ſurface is colder; where the matter of vapours coming to be repercuſs'd by the coldneſs of the air, is thereby condens'd and receives its form. On the contrary, in Summer the earth being cold within exhales nothing; and if ought iſſue forth, it is not compacted but diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by the heat of the outward air.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the thorough inquiſition of the cauſe of vapours raiſes no fewer clouds and obſcurities in the wits of men, then their true cauſe produces in the air: For if we attribute them to the Sun, whoſe heat penetrating the earth or outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calefying it, attracts the thinner parts of the earth and water; this is contradicted by experience which ſhews us more Rain, Storms and violent Winds in the Winter when the Suns heat is weakeſt, then in the Shmmer when his rays are more perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and as ſuch ought to penetrate deeper into the earth, and from its centre or ſurface attract greater plenty of vapours: the contrary whereof falls out. It follows therefore that the Sun hath no ſuch attractive faculty. Nor is the coldneſs and dryneſs of the earth any way proper for the production of ſuch humid ſubſtances as Vapours and Exhalations; the latter whereof being more ſubtle, and conſequently more moveable (as appears by Earth-quakes, Winds and Tempeſts, which are made with greater violence then Rain, Showers, or Dew) cannot be engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of earth, much groſſer then water, which is held the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cauſe of vapour; otherwiſe, an exhalation being earthy ſhould be more groſs then a vapour extracted out of water; which it is not. It remains then that the cauſe of vapours is the internal heat of the earth which being encreas'd from without by the cold of the ambient air, or exhaling all its pores open'd by the heat of the Sun, produces the diverſity of Meteors. And this internal heat of the earth appears in Winter by the reak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Springs, and the warmth of Caves and ſubterraneous places; yea the Sea it ſelf, ſaid to ſupply the principle matter to theſe vapours, is affirm'd hotter at the bottom, whither therefore the Fiſhes retire; and indeed it is ſo in its ſubſtance, as appears by its ſalt, bitterneſs and motion, whence 'tis call'd by the Latines <hi>Aeſtus.</hi> And as in the bodies of Animals, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours iſſuing by the pores open'd by heat cauſe ſweat, and when thoſe paſſages are ſtopt by the coldneſs of the outward air, their ſubtler parts are reſolv'd into flatuoſities, and the more groſs and humid are carried up to the Brain, by whoſe coldneſs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66371:52"/>
being condens'd they fall down upon other parts, and produce defluxions: ſo in the world, which, like us, conſiſts of ſolid parts (earth and ſtones) of fluid (the waters) and of rapid (which are the moſt ſubtle and tenuious parts of the Maſs) when theſe laſt happen to be aſſociated with others more groſs they carry them up on high with themſelves, where they meet with other natural cauſes of Cold and Heat which rarefies or condenſes, and redouble their impetuoſity by the occurrence of ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle in their way: theſe Spirits being incapable of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe 'tis proper to them to wander freely through the World. Elementary qualities are indeed found joyn'd with theſe vapours and exhalations; but are no more the cauſes of them then of our animal vital or natural ſpirits, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe imbu'd with the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That the general cauſe of vapours is Heaven; which by its motion, light, and influences, heating and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Elements, ſubtiliſes them and extracts their pureſt parts: as appears by the Sea whoſe ſaltneſs proceeds from the Suns having drawn away the lighter and freſher parts, and left the groſſer and bitter in the ſurface, cold and heat condenſe and rarefie other, and by this Reciprocation the harmonious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the four Elements is continu'd; ſometimes temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earths exceſſive dryneſs by gentle Dews or fruitful Rains, and ſometimes correcting the too great humidity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of the air by winds and igneous impreſſions, ſome of which ſerve alſo to adorn the World and inſtruct Men. And as theſe vapours are for the common good of the Univerſe, in which they maintain Generations, and for preſervation of the Elements, who by this means purge their impurities; ſo they all contribute to the matter of them. Fire forms moſt igneous and luminous impreſſions; Air rarefi'd ſupplies matter for winds, as is ſeen in the <hi>Aeolipila</hi>; and condens'd is turn'd into rain. But eſpecially water and earth (the groſſeſt Elements, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, moſt ſubject to the impreſſions of outward agents) continually emit fumes or ſteams out of their boſom, which are always obſerv'd in the ſurface of the Terraqueous Globe, even in the cleareſt days of the year, and form the diverſity of paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes. Theſe fumes are either dry or moiſt; the dry ariſe out of the earth, and are call'd Exhalations; the moiſt are Vapours and iſſue from the water: yet both are endu'd with an adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious heat either from ſubterranean fires or the heat of Heaven, or the mixture of fire. A Vapour is leſs hot then an Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe its aqueous humidity abates its heat; whereas that of the latter is promoted by its dryneſs; which yet muſt be a little ſeaſon'd with humidity, the ſole aliment and manſion of heat, which hath no operation upon bodies totally dry; whence aſhes remain incorruptible in the midſt of flames and evaporate nothing. But whatever be the cauſe of theſe vapours, they are not only more tenuious under that form, but alſo after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumption
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66371:53"/>
of their own. So Dew is a more potent diſſolver and penetrates more then common water; which ſome attribute to the Nitre wherewith the earth abounds.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Upon the Second Point it was ſaid, Valour is a Virtue ſo high above the pitch of others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Which is leſs culpable, Raſhneſs or Cowardice?</hi>
               </note> and ſo admir'd by all men, that 'twas it alone that deifi'd the Heroes of Antiquity: For Nature having given Man a deſire of Self-preſervation, the Virtue which makes him deſpiſe the apprehenſion of ſuch dangers as may deſtroy him, is undoubtedly the moſt eminent of all other moral vertues, which ſerve only as ornaments to his Being. But as every virtue conſiſts in a mediocrity, and ſo hath two vicious extremities, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Defect; ſo this is plac'd between two vices which may be ſaid equally blamable, ſince between the two extremities and the middle the diſtance is equal (otherwiſe it were not the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that is, not a vertue) and a point in which this vertue conſiſts hath no latitude. And, though raſhneſs, which oftimes bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows the maſk of generoſity and valour, ſeems to approach neerer it then Cowardice; ſince being only an exceſs of Valour, it may be more eaſily reduc'd to mediocrity then the other which partakes not thereof at all; as diſeaſes ariſing from reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are eaſier to be cur'd then thoſe which proceed from inaniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nevertheleſs to ſpeak abſolutely, Cowardice is not ſo vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as Temerity; for if the one hath a falſe appearance of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the other hath a ſemblance of prudence and wiſdom which is the rule and meaſure of all virtues. And indeed, we ſee moſt wiſe men are a little cowardly; either their knowledg of things rendring them circumſpect:, or experience of Fortune's blindneſs and inconſtancy making them more diſtruſtful of her dealing, which they know is commonly unkindeſt to perſons of merit; or elſe the value they put upon Being encreaſing their fear of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation; although this fear is common to all Animals, and hath its foundation in Nature, and ſo is more excuſable then the madneſs of Temerity, the uſual vice of fools and lunaticks, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly repugnant to our natural ſentiments. In a political conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration though both are puniſhable, yet Cowardice leaſt of the two, and is moſt commonly excus'd, as in <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>; yea ſometimes recompenſed, as in that Roman Conſul to whom the Senate gave publick thanks for having fled at the defeat of <hi>Cannae</hi>: Where the temerity of young <hi>Manlius,</hi> though ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, coſt him his head by the ſentence of his own Father.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Cowardice and Temerity muſt not be compar'd together if we would judge which is worſe; for on the one ſide the raſh perſon compar'd to the poltron ſeems cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous, and on the other the poltron appears prudent and well advis'd. But they muſt be compar'd with Valour, of which that of the two which partakes leaſt is the moſt vicious. Now, Valour conſiſts in two points, to attempt and endure. The raſh perſon is bold in the onſet, but gives ground at the brunt. The
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66371:53"/>
poltron do's neither. He dares neither attempt nor bear up, and ſo is further from true fortitude then the Raſh; and though they ſeem totally oppoſite, yet the raſh is oftentimes timerous, and Neceſſity or Deſpair ſometimes renders the veryeſt coward bold.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If the Stoicks ſay true, that Nature is the ſureſt guide we can follow in all our actions, and that to live well and vertuouſly is to live conformably to Nature; then Temerity which ſubverts the ſentiments of Nature, by whom nothing is ſought ſo much as ſelf-preſervation, ſeems much more vicious then Cowardice, whoſe fault is only too much indulgence and inclining to natural ſentiments, in preference of ſelf-preſervation above all honours invented by men as incitements to contempt of death, and the means leading thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid. As right Reaſon is the ſquare of Prudence, Equity of Juſtice, and Moderation of Temperance; ſo firmneſs and conſtancy of mind in attempting and enduring, is the ſign of Fortitude and Courage, which is a vertue reſiding in the Iraſcible appetite, moderating fear and raſhneſs, and conſiſting chiefly in not fearing dangers more then is fit, eſpecially thoſe of War or which happen unexpectedly. For two kinds of things cauſe fear: ſome are above us and inevitable; as Tempeſts, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Earth-quakes which a man may and ought to fear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, unleſs we be inſenſible or ſenſeleſs; others are ordinary, vincible, and not to be fear'd by the courageous. To whom three ſorts of people are contrary; namely, the furious, who fear nothing at all; the raſh who venture at all, caſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inconſiderately into all dangers; and the poltrons who never venture upon any. Theſe tremble before and in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; thoſe ſeem at firſt to have a good heart, but when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appears begin to tremble and bleed at the noſe: whereas he who is truly courageous attempts no danger inconſiderately, but avoids it as much as he can handſomely; but once engag'd, loſes his life therein if he cannot come out of it with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And though this vertue be generally eſteem'd by all men, becauſe moſt ſerviceable for defence of States, and hath more ſplendor and ſhew then any other; yet 'tis leſs known and the rareſt of all; not many poſſeſſing it free from the intereſt of gain or vanity, anger, fear of infamy, conſtraint and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations beſides that of honeſty, which alone gives name and value to all vertuous actions. Raſhneſs paſſes among the vulgar for true Valour, though 'tis further from it then Cowardice; which being the daughter of knowledg and prudence, (as raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is of ignorance and brutality, and oftentimes of vanity) ſeems to come neerer that virtue then Temerity, which otherwiſe is incompatible with all other virtues, as being deſtitute of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which alone makes them what they are.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, 'Tis impoſſible to determine of theſe two Vices; which are equally oppoſite to their middle vertue,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66371:54"/>
whatever falſe appearance Temerity may have of the contrary. But the praiſe and blame of men proceeding commonly, though unjuſtly, from Succeſs; 'tis that alſo which makes our actions approv'd and diſcommended. So that the ſame action will be accounted courageous, and as ſuch applauded in a young ſtout Captain who gets the better of his enemies, (proſperous Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being rarely puniſh'd); and again term'd temerarious in the ſame perſon, if he happens to be worſted. Yea men eſteem and admire that moſt which they leaſt expected, as moſt remote from reaſon without which the Vertuous acts nothing. Which teaches him to be contented with himſelf, and not to make much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of blame and praiſe, which are not integral parts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but only ſerve to its ornament, as our Hair and Nails do to our perſons.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXVI. Which Climate is moſt proper for Long-life? (The ſecond Queſtion is remitted to the next Conference; and 'tis Reſolved for divers Reaſons, that hereafter but one be handled at a time.)</head>
            <p>BEcauſe amongſt all <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or Apparences caus'd by the Celeſtial Bodies, the diverſity of artificial Days is moſt ſenſible and known to the moſt ignorant; therefore Aſtronomers make uſe thereof to diſtinguiſh the ſeveral habitations of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This diverſity of Days depends upon two Cauſes; the obliquity of the Ecliptick to the Equator, and the inclination of the Horizon or the Sphere to the ſame Equator. For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity of the Ecliptick makes the diurnal Parallels, which are Circles parallel to the Equinoctial, deſcrib'd by the Sun as he is carri'd about the Earth by the motion of the Firſt Mover; the number of which is equal to that of the Days comprehended in half a year. And the obliquity of the Horizon is the cauſe that theſe parallels are cut by it unequally. Otherwiſe if theſe parallels were not different from the Equator, or (although different) if they were cut equally by the Horizon (as it happens in a Right Sphere) the Horizon which is a great Circle paſſing by the Poles of theſe parallels, (which are the ſame with thoſe of the World) both the Days and Nights would be equal: ſo that where the Sphere is not inclin'd, as in the Right and Parallel Spheres, there is no inequality of Days, nor conſequently of Climate (ſo call'd from its Inclination) but only in the oblique Sphere. 'Tis defin'd, a Region of Earth comprehended between two circles parallel to the Equator; in which there is the difference of half
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66371:54"/>
an hour in the longeſt days of the year. It encompaſſes the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe from Eaſt to Weſt, as a Zone doth, which differs from it only as the Zone is broader; whence there are many Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats in the ſame Zone. The Ancients having regard only to ſo much of the Earth as they believ'd inhabited, made but ſeven Climats, which they extended not beyond the places where the longeſt days are 16 hours, and denominated from the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable places by which they made them paſs; as, the firſt Northern Climat was call'd <hi>Dia Meroes,</hi> hy <hi>Meroe,</hi> which they began at 12 deg. 43 min. from the Aequinoctial, where the longeſt day hath 12 hours three quarters, and which at preſent is the end of our firſt Climat and beginning of the ſecond. This firſt Climat paſſes by <hi>Malaca</hi> a City of the Eaſt-Indies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at 4 deg. 18 min. Its middle, from which all Climats are reckon'd, hath 8 deg. 34 min. and its end, 12 deg. 43 min. The other ſix Climats of the Ancients paſs'd by <hi>Siene, Alexandria, Rhodes, Rome, Pontus Euxinus,</hi> and the River <hi>Boriſthenes. Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> reckons twenty one, as far as the Iſland <hi>Thule</hi> which lies in 63 deg. of Northern Latitude. Our modern Aſtronomers make twenty four, from the Aequinoctial to the Polar Circles; in each of which Climats the longeſt day of Summer encreaſes half an hour above twelve, according as they approach nearer thoſe Circles: beyond which to the Poles of the World they place ſix more, not diſtinguiſh'd by the variation of half an hour but of 30 days. So that there is in all, ſixty Climats, 30 Northern and as many Southern, each comprehended by two Parallels: which Climats are eaſily found by doubling the exceſs whereby the longeſt day ſurpaſſes twelve hours; the Product being the Climat of the place. As if you know the longeſt Summer day at <hi>Paris</hi> to be 16 hours, double 4, the exceſs above 12, and you will have 8, which is the Climat of <hi>Paris</hi>; and ſo of others. And though there be the ſame reaſon of Seaſons and other vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in the Southern and Northern Climats, yet ſince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews us that thoſe of the South are not inhabited beyond the 8th, which is about the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> at the fartheſt point of <hi>Africa,</hi> (beyond which no Inhabitants are as yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, it may ſeem that the diverſity of Climats is not alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for long or ſhort life, but there are other cauſes concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That ſince a thing is preſerv'd by that which produces it, the Sun and Stars, which concur to the generation of all living Creatures, muſt alſo contribute to their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and continuance in life; which being maintain'd by uſe of the ſame things (variety and change, though delightful, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt manifeſt cauſe of brevity of life) that Climat which is moſt conſtant and leaſt variable will be the propereſt for <hi>longaevity,</hi> and ſo much the more if it ſuits with our nature; ſuch is the firſt Climat next the Aequinoctial, where things being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always alike, bodies accuſtom'd thereunto receive leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66371:55"/>
thereby then under others, whoſe inequalities and irregularities produce moſt diſeaſes. The natural purity of the Air, promoted by the breath of a gentle Eaſt Wind there reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually; and the want of vapours and humidities, which commonly infect our Air, conduce greatly to the health of the Inhabitants; alſo when the dryneſs and coldneſs of their temper makes longer-liv'd, as appears by Ravens and Elephants, the moſt melancholy of all Animals, which are common in theſe parts where they live above 300 years. Moreover, <hi>Homer</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that <hi>Memnon</hi> King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> liv'd 500 years; which (by the report of <hi>Xenophon</hi>) was the common age of moſt men of the ſame Country, where <hi>Francis Alvarez</hi> affirms in our time that he ſaw luſty men at 150 years of age; and that in <hi>Aegypt</hi> which lies near it, there are more old men then in any place of the World; and that women are ſo fruitful there that they bring forth three or four children at a time, rather through the goodneſs of the Climat then any nitrous vertue that is in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Nilus.</hi> Hence poſſibly moſt Doctors place the Terreſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Paradiſe under the Aequinoctial, and the cauſe of our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>longaevity,</hi> who having been created under this Climat ſeem to have loſt of its duration proportionably as they remov'd from the ſame Northwards (whence all evil comes) and towards the Zones wrongfully call'd Temperate, ſince more ſubject to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then that call'd Torrid by the Ancients, who thought it unhabitable by reaſon of extream heat; although the continual Flowers and Fruits wherewith the always verdant Trees are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den teſtifie the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Since Heaven is immutable and always like to it ſelf, the Earth and Elements alone ſubject to change; the length and ſhortneſs of Life ſeems not to depend on Heaven but on Earth and the ſeveral diſpoſitions of our Bodies: and the whole World being Man's Country, there is no place in it but is equally proper for his habitation, provided he be born there; becauſe the Air he breathes and the Food he eats from his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, altering his Body, at length make his temper ſuitable to that of the place of his Education; which therefore he loves above any other.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Heaven remaining it ſelf immutable, is nevertheleſs the cauſe of motions and mutations here below; its light producing different effects in the Earth according as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, the moſt ſenſible whereof are heat, dryneſs, and other qualities which diverſifie the Seaſons and Zones; of which the two temperate, eſpecially the Northern ſeems moſt habitable and proper for <hi>longaevity.</hi> 'Tis alſo the moſt populous, and its Natives are not only the moſt healthy and luſty, but alſo the moſt refin'd and civiliz'd of all others. Now of the Climats of this Zone, the eighth, wherein <hi>Paris</hi> lyes, ſeems to me the healthieſt of all, as well for pureneſs of Air as all other Cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:66371:55"/>The Fifth ſaid, That the goodneſs of Climats depends not ſo much upon Heaven as the ſituation of each place in reference to the Winds, of which the Southern being the moſt unhealthy, therefore Towns defended by Mountains on the South are very healthy, eſpecially if they lye towards the Eaſt, the Winds whereof are moſt healthy. And this is the cauſe of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity obſerv'd in Countries lying in the ſame Climat, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience not the ſame changes: as the Iſle of <hi>France</hi> is very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and yet lyes in the ſame Climat with <hi>Podolia</hi> (a part of <hi>Poland</hi>) where the cold is extreamly rigorous: and in the Iſlands <hi>Bornaio</hi> and <hi>Sumatra</hi> men live commonly 130 years and are not black, as the Africans, whoſe life is very ſhort, and yet they lye in the ſame Climat, namely, under the Aequinoctial Line.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That Life being the continuance of the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal heat in Humidity, that Climat muſt be propereſt for <hi>Longaevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which will longeſt preſerve that conjunction. The violent heat of the Climats near the Equator conſumes the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and makes the natural heat languiſh; although under the Line the coolneſs of the nights twelve hours long, renders it more ſupportable: whereas in our longeſt Summer-days when the Sun is in <hi>Cancer,</hi> he is no more then 18 degrees from the Horizon and ſo diffuſes his rays upon the vapours hovering about the Earth, which reflecting the ſame after a refraction make the nights almoſt always light, and conſequently hot; there being no light without heat. On the contrary, the Northern parts towards the Pole, receiving the Suns rays only obliquely are very cold and unfit for long-life, combating the heat and deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the radical moiſture. But the temperately hot are the moſt healthy, eſpecially if the air (of greateſt neceſſity to Life) be pure and not corrupted by vapours.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXVII. Which is moſt neceſſary to a State, and moſt noble, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick or Law?</head>
            <p>THeſe two Profeſſions are not abſolutely neceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of a State, but only ſuppoſe ſome evil which they undertake to amend; Phyſick the diſorder of the humours in Mans body; and Law, that of Manners in the body of the State. So that if all people were healthy and good, both would be uſeleſs, But the miſery of our Nature having made us ſlaves to our Appetite, and tributaries to Death and Diſeaſes which lead thereto; this adventitious neceſſity hath given riſe to two powerful remedies againſt thoſe two evils; Phyſick to oppoſe the diſeaſes of the Body, and Law to repreſs the diſorders of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66371:56"/>
our Paſſions: which being the ſources of all miſchiefs, Law which reſtrains their courſe, ſeems to have as much pre-eminence above Phyſick, as the Body, which the latter governs, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Mind, which the former regulates. Moreover Health, the end of Phyſick, is common both to Men and Beaſts, who have a better ſhare thereof, and have taught us the beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Phyſick: but to live according to right reaſon, (which is the aim of Law) is peculiar to man; although oftentimes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other obtain its end.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Theſe Diſciplines are to be conſider'd either according to their right uſe, or as they are practis'd. Phyſick, conſider'd in its right adminiſtration, is the art of curing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and preſerving Health, without which there is no pleaſure in the World. Law, taken alſo according to its inſtitution is that Tree of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which bears the knowledg of Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, as Phyſick is the Tree of Life. Now if we compare them together, the latter which maintains the precious treaſure of Health, is as the foundation upon which Law builds its excellent. Ordinances; for without Health, not only the adminiſtrations of Juſtice but all employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Arts and Exerciſes ceaſe. And though Laws and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſerve for the ornament of a State, yet they are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to its conſervation, there being ſociety among Robbers; and many States having begun and ſubſiſted by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, Violences and other injuſtices, but none without Health, which is the foundation of all goods, preſerving the abſolute Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every thing, and by that means maintaining all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Body and Mind. Wherefore Phyſick is profitable not only to the Body but alſo to the Soul, whoſe nature, faculties, and actions it contemplates. But if theſe Arts be conſider'd as they are practis'd now a days, 'tis certain that if there are Mountebanks, Ignorants, and Cheats who practiſe Phyſick amongſt a good number of good Phyſitians; there are alſo, Champertors, Forgers, and other ſuch black ſouls, who live by fraud, which they exerciſe under the maſk of juſtice. We muſt likewiſe diſtinguiſh the bad judgments of certain Nations from the truth. For if the Romans ſometimes baniſh'd their Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chirurgians; this might be done out of ignorance, as when they ſaw the Gangren'd Leg of one of their Citizens cut off. And though they were for ſome time without Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, yet they were never without Phyſick, at leaſt natural.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Law hath the pre-eminence above Phyſick upon account of the great benefits it brings to a State, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the ſame from greater, more troubleſome, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable evils. And good (according to the Moral axiom) being the more divine by how much 'tis more common and diffus'd, it follows that Law is more divine then Phyſick. For by checking our paſſions and obſtructing the career of illegal Ambitions and Uſurpations, it does good not only to private perſons, as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66371:56"/>
doth, but alſo to the whole Publick, which is engag'd by particular paſſions, whence Law-ſutes, Seditions, Wars, and other evils ariſe; which being publick are of more importance then thoſe to which Phyſick is deſign'd, whoſe whole buſineſs is about the four humours, either to keep them in a juſt temper, or reduce them to their natural ſtate, from which Diſeaſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch them. Beſides, Phyſick only cures the Body, whereas Law repreſſes the mind's diſorders, and even the intentions. Laſtly, the evils Phyſick defends us from, are of eaſie cure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all ſenſible indications; but Law remedies ſuch as depend upon the thoughts and counſels of men, impenetrable by ſenſe. Moreover, Phyſick regards only particular perſons; but Law maintains a moral union and good intelligence between all the parts of a Commonwealth, namely, men of ſeveral conditions, and keeps every one within the bounds of his own quality and ſtation; and ſo is like a Univerſal Spirit or Intelligence preſiding over all our motions, hindring ruptures and diſſenſions (the bane of a State) as that doth vacuity, which tends to the deſtruction of the World.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That as the multitude of Phyſitians in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a ſign of a multitude of diſeaſes reigning therein; ſo the multitude of Laws and Judges argues corruption of manners. Wherefore both theſe Profeſſions may ſeem equally uſeleſs to a State free from wicked and miſerable perſons. And indeed we ſee many Nations have wanted both: at <hi>Rome</hi> Phyſitians were unknown for divers ages, and are ſo ſtill in ſome Countries: and moſt States of the World diſpenſe very well with the want of Lawyers, whoſe contrary opinions are as deſtructive to the State, and particular perſons, as the number of Phyſitians is to the Sick. And as they are moſt healthful who uſe theſe leaſt; ſo the moſt flouriſhing States have feweſt Lawyers; Wrangling, which is the daughter of Law, being the moſt apparent cauſe of the diminution of the ſtrength of Chriſtendom, where for ſome Ages it hath reign'd; either by diverting the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its Miniſters from the exerciſe of War, the principal means of amplifying a State, or by unprofitably taking up the people in Sutes. And therefore the Spaniards found no ſafer courſe to preſerve the new World to themſelves, then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring all Lawyers entrance into it.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That this made for the Phyſitians. For the Spaniards ſent many of them to the new World, to diſcover the ſimples there and bring them into <hi>Europe.</hi> Moreover, as 'tis more neceſſary to live and to live in health, then to live in ſociety or riches (which are the things Law takes care of) ſo much doth Law yield to Phyſick in this point, which Gods Word, who commands to honour the Phyſitian, ſaith was created for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which as plainly decides the Queſtion as that Reſolution was worthy of the Fool of <hi>Fraceſco Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> which he gave in the like Diſpute of preference between the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66371:57"/>
Phyſitians and Advocates; That at Executions the Thief marches before the Hang-man. Moreover Kings, who are above Laws, ſubject themſelves to thoſe of Phyſitians, whom <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> honour'd with the right of Incorporation into the City. Whereunto add the certainty of this Art (which is the true note of the excellence of a Diſcipline) being founded upon natural Agents, whoſe effects are infallible; whereas Law hath no other foundation but the will and phanſie of Men, which changes with Times, Places, and Perſons.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXVIII. Of Sea-ſickneſs.</head>
            <p>NAture hath furniſh'd Things with two ways of preſerving the Being ſhe hath given them, namely, to ſeek their good and flee their evil. Both which, Animals do by attracting what is proper to their nature by right fibers, and rejecting what is otherwiſe by tranſverſe fibers, of which the Expulſive Faculty makes uſe. So when the Stomack is ſurcharg'd with too great a quantity of matter, or goaded by its acrimony, the expulſive Faculty of this part being irritated by what is contrary to it, caſts it forth by yexing, belching, and vomiting. Yexing is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd motion of the upper Orifice of the Stomach which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and opens it ſelf to expell ſome thing adhering to its Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or orbicular Muſcles; which being commonly a ſharp and pungent vapour, we ſee this Hickcock is remov'd by a cup of cold water, or elſe by holding the breath; for the coldneſs of the water repreſſes the acrimony of the vapour'd, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd Spirits by heat cauſe it to reſolve and evaporate. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is alſo a deprav'd motion of the Stomack, which contracts it ſelf at the bottom to drive out ſome troubleſome matter; which, if it adhere too faſt, or Nature be not ſtrong enough, cauſeth Nauſeouſneſs or a vain deſire to vomit. Belching is caus'd when the ſaid matter is flatuous and meets no obſtacle. Theſe motions are either through the proper vice of the Stomack, or through ſympathy with ſome other part. The former proceeds ſometimes from a cold and moiſt intemperies. Whence man, the moiſteſt of all Animals, is alone ſubject to Vomiting, except Dogs and Cats; but he only has the Hickcock; and Children, as being very humid vomit frequently. Sometimes 'tis from a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conformation of the Stomack, as when 'tis too ſtraight, or from ſome troubleſome matter, either internal or external. The internal is a pungent humour, and ſometimes Worms. In ſhort, every thing that any way irritates the Expulſive and weakens the Retentive Faculty: So, oyly, fat, and ſweet things
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66371:57"/>
floating upon the Stomack, provoke to vomit by relaxing the fibres which ſerve for retention. External cauſes are all ſuch, as either irritate or relax the Stomack; as, ſtinking Smells, and the ſole imagination of diſpleaſing things, violent winds; exerciſe, eſpecially ſuch wherein the Body is mov'd by ſomthing elſe, and contributes not it ſelf to the motion, as going in a Coach or a Ship; for here the Body reſts and alſo the parts are relax'd, only the Spirits agitated by this motion act more ſtrongly upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and theſe are here more eaſily evacuated by reaſon of the relaxation of the fibres then in other exerciſes, wherein the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtirs it ſelf; as riding-poſt, or a troat, in which the Nerves are bent, and conſequently, all the parts more vigorous, and hence vomiting is not ſo eaſie. 'Tis alſo the equality of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which makes perſons, unus'd to go in a Coach, vomit ſooner when the Coach goes in a ſmooth and even field then upon rough ways. The ſame hapning upon the Sea, 'tis no wonder if people be ſo apt to vomit there.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That neither the agitation of the Air, nor the motion of the Body can be the ſole cauſe of Vomiting, and other Sea-maladies; ſince the like and more violent at Land, as Swings, Charets, and Poſts, produce not the ſame effects. For we conſider the agitation of the Stomack as the cauſe of vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that of the Feet and Legs being but accidental; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teſtifies, that 'tis not the lifting up but the falling down of the Ship that cauſes the riſing of the Stomack. Wherefore I ſhould rather pitch upon the ſalt-air of the Sea, abounding with ſharp and mordicant Vapours: which being attracted by reſpiration trouble the Stomack, eſpecially its ſuperior orifice, the ſeat of the ſenſitive Appetite by reaſon of the Nerves of the ſixth Conjugation: thus the door being open, the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Stomack, which is alſo infected with the malignity of theſe vapours, is voided by the ordinary ways: as happens ſometimes to ſuch who only come near the Sea. Indeed the bitterneſs and ſaltneſs of the humour in the Mouth, which is the forerunner of Vomiting, together with the quivering of the nether Lip, proceeding from the continuity of the inward membrane of the Stomack with that of the Gullet and Mouth, manifeſts the vapours which excite it to be ſalt and nitrous. Whence alſo plain water drunk with a little ſalt, cauſes Vomit. Now if this malady happens ſooner in a Tempeſt, 'tis becauſe thoſe nitrous ſpirits are more ſtirr'd in the toſſing of the Sea than in a Calm: as they ſay, 'tis more frequent in the Torrid Zone, becauſe there is a greater attraction of the ſaid Spirits by the heat of the Climate, which on the other is an enemy to the Stomack, extreamly weakning it, as cold much helps its functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such as go into deep Mines, are ſeis'd with the like diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to this of the Sea, by reſpiration of the nitrous Spirits which iſſue out of the entrails of the Earth and are the cauſe of its fecundity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:66371:58"/>The Third ſaid, That <hi>Cato</hi> (who repented of three things, (1.) Of having told a Secret to his Wife, (2.) Of having ſpent a day without doing ſomthing, And (3.) of having gone by Sea when he might have gone by Land) had no doubt experienc'd the michiefs of that unfaithful Element: the cruelleſt whereof is the Scurvy, a Diſeaſe complicated with ſeveral others, and whoſe chief ſymptoms, are the ulceration and ſwelling of the Gums and Legs, with pains over all the Body, caus'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity and malignity of the Air. But the moſt frequent is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, caus'd by the ſole agitation and violence of the Air. For our aerious Spirits not only receive the qualities of the air we breathe, but alſo follow its temper and motion, as is ſeen by the Head-ach, ſeiſing thoſe that are beaten by winds in the Country; and by the ſeeming turning of their heads who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively behold the circumgyration of a Wheel or ſome other Body. So the Air at Sea being much agitated puts in motion the Spirits which are of the ſame nature, and theſe being ſtirr'd ſet the humours on work, which incommoding the parts are by them driven out by vomits and other ejections, according to every one's temper and propenſity. For the cholerick and broad-breaſted, vomit more eaſily and ſucceſsfully then the phlegmatick and narrow-breaſted, whoſe Organs of reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not ſufficiently free. Whereunto alſo the ſeaſon of the year contributes; for Summer provokes vomit more then Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the humours being more heavy, rather tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But eſpecially Cuſtom is conſiderable herein, which renders thoſe that go frequently to Sea not obnoxious to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Earth conſiſts of three ſubſtances; one Unctuous, which is the inflammable moiſture, call'd by the Chymiſts Sulphur; another Cinereou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which they call the <hi>Faeces</hi> or <hi>Caput mortuum</hi>; the third humid and incombuſtible, which they divide into Mercury and Salt; this latter again into Salt-nitre and Vitriol, of which the Sea being full, the ſame is communicated to the firſt Region of the Air contiguous to the Waters; and, inſinuating it ſelf into our Bodies by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; produces the ſame effects therein, that it doth taken in ſubſtance; four Grains of which is a ſufficient Vomit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to alſo helps the gentle agitation of the waves, which makes it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate; the examples of others vomiting, and eſpecially the fear commonly incident to ſuch as were never upon the Sea before, who are moſt obnoxious to this trouble. For that Paſſion ſo conſtringes the whole Body, eſpecially the inward parts, that it weakens and relaxes the Nerves, eſpecially the Fibres which keep the parts in a juſt tenor; and ſo the oblique Fibres and orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Muſcles (which ſerve to retain them) being languid, ſuffer the juices and humours to paſs out. The ſame fear which cauſes relaxation of the <hi>Sphincter Ani &amp; Veſicae,</hi> relaxing the Muſcles which ſerve to open and cloſe the upper Orifice of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle:

Hence fear is commonly accompani'd with the pain of this part; whoſe ſenſe being very exquiſite is the cauſe that the Vulgar call it, The pain of the Heart; which alſo for the ſame reaſon happens to ſuch as look down upon low places.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXIX. Of Love by Inclination, or Sympathy.</head>
            <p>'TIs not only amongſt the Poets that Love is blind, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of this cauſes evidencing him no leſs ſo amongſt the Philoſophers, who aſſign two ſorts of it; one of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which tends to a good known; the other of Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby we love without knowing why. Indeed there is no love without ground, and ſome ſort of knowledge; but yet, when the cauſe obliging us to love is manifeſt, it makes the former kind of love; when obſcure, the latter: whereof we have many examples in nature, not only in the Symbolical qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Elements, Electrical and Magnetical attractions of Stones, particular alliances of Metals, and all the amities of Plants and Trees, as of the female Palm which is ſaid to lean towards the male, and thoſe which are found amongſt Animals; but eſpecially in the particular inclinations of ſome Perſons to others unknown and void of all recommendations to qualifie them for the ſame, and the emotions ſome have felt both in Soul and Body at the firſt ſight of their unknown Parents: as alſo of a contrary effect, when a dead body bleeds upon the preſence of its Murderer; which is a teſtimony of an antipathetical ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred contrary to the aboveſaid Love, which we find in our ſelves almoſt upon all occurrences; as when two equally ſtrangers play at Tennis, we wiſh that one may win and the other loſe. For the firſt motions of Love, as well as of all other Paſſions, are not in our power, and afford not the Mind time to deliberate and make reflexion upon them. Hence oftentimes, Anger, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Panick fright, and ſuch other Paſſions ſeiſe upon us without cauſe; and Love doth the like frequently, without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reaſon. Yea, we may ſay, there is no Love of Knowledg but what took its firſt riſe from that of Inclination, which preſently makes us enamor'd of the proportions of a Face, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes another that underſtands the ſame as well as we, but without being any way affected therewith, becauſe he finds not in it that correſpondence and ſympathetical reſemblance that produces a Love of Inclination, which may alſo ariſe without any knowledge, as in that blind man who lov'd a Laſs whom he had never ſeen; as alſo in <hi>Petrarch</hi> who made ſo many Verſes upon his <hi>Lawra,</hi> whom he could never behold; The cauſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66371:59"/>
whereof I ſhould attribute to the power of the Imagination, which fancies ſomthing of lovelineſs where there is none; or elſe to the ſole action of the Will, which not able to remain neuter between love and hatred (ſince its action is to will, and to will is to love) when it meets no cauſe of hatred in an object, loves it; and hates it, when it finds nothing amiable therein. For if you aſſign the reaſon of this love to the tranſpiration of Spirits iſſuing out of the lov'd perſon's body, their ſubſtance is too volatile to act ſo far off; and their iſſuing being never alike, (becauſe the pores of the ſkin are more ſtopt at one time then at another) this love would be remarkably alter'd every moment. Beſides, we many times love by an inclination an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perſon for his merit; and many have been enamour'd of Beauties at the firſt ſight of their Pictures; but love was never produc'd between two blind perſons, notwithſtanding any emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſympathetical Spirits. Moreover, 'tis the Species and not the Spirits that are receiv'd by our Senſes; and ſo none ſhould ever love thoſe they had not ſeen, but by a Proſpective-glaſs.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That it imports not much to the cauſing of love, whether the object be really or only imaginarily good; and indeed our minds ſeem to intereſs themſelves more in the purſute and preſervation of the latter then the former, which maintains it ſelf by its proper worth. Wherefore if Love of Inclination preſuppoſe goodneſs in the object, the ſame muſt be apprehended either by the Imagination or by ſome other Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which it muſt therefore be approximated either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by it ſelf, or by it ſelf. So the ſweetneſs of Honey makes it ſelf perceptible to the Tongue by it ſelf: but the proportion of a fair countenance cannot make it ſelf known but by its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which is the picture and repreſentation of it. This way, is produc'd the Love of Inclination as well as that of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; only with this difference, that the Species which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the former, act imperceptibly, and more ſuddenly then thoſe that produce the latter, which is more deliberate and rational.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, There are but two ſorts of Love; one, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and Metaphorical; the other, proper and formal. That precedes Knowledg, and is an Inſtinct inclining natural things to their proper good: This follows Knowledg as its guide, and is the firſt Expanſion of the Heart, pleaſing it ſelf with the good it likes. And as that is diffus'd over all Creatures, ſo this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd only to the ſenſible and rational. The Appetite, whence the former proceeds, is immers'd and incorporated in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every thing, and not diſtinguiſh'd from the faculties and powers they have to act. But the latter, ariſeth from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite properly ſo call'd, whoſe functions or motions are the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Paſſions, to which as many acts correſpond in the Rational Appetite. The Queſtion cannot be concerning that improper
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66371:59"/>
Appetite; for then Stones ſhould have Love, as well as Inſtinct, towards their Centre; but of the true and proper Love ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to Knowledg, which gives Amability to good, as Light doth Viſibility to colours. Wherefore they who talk of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spirits iſſuing out of the lov'd perſon's body into the eyes of the Lover, and ſeiſing upon the heart, without falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der knowledge, ſeem ignorant of the nature of Love. For ſhould ſuch ſpirits arrive at the heart without being obſerv'd; yet they muſt come out thence again to be known before they can cauſe Love; as we cannot know any thing that is in the ſoul, unleſs it come firſt out thence and become ſenſible; ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is in the Underſtanding but what paſs'd through the Senſe. So a man cannot know his own face but by reflection from a Looking-glaſs without him. For the Soul at our Nativity is like a ſmooth table or white-ſheet of Paper, and thence its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive notions during this preſent ſtate is by Phantaſms ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us by our Senſes. Now the eſſential reaſon of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance which keeps Love ſubject to Knowledg, is, that the Appetite, which is the Principle of Love, is only a Paſſion or Propriety of the thing wherein it is; but the Principle of Knowledge is an eſſential degree of Nature. Hence, Souls are diſtinguiſh'd by Cognition, not by Appetite: we call the Senſitive Soul, ſo, from the knowledg of Senſe, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes its eſſential difference; and the Rational Soul ſo, becauſe Reaſon, the principle of Knowledg is a degree of Nature: but Appetite is a propriety which follows it. And being there is the ſame reaſon of Actions and their Principles; as the Appetite ſuppoſes a principle of Knowledg, ſo Love, which is the action of the Appetite, ſuppoſes actual and clear Knowledg. Hence, there is no love without knowledg. For that we have more phanſie to the one of two perſons playing then to the other, 'tis becauſe we diſcern ſomthing in his face, geſtures, or motion that pleaſes us better. Sympathy (pretended the cauſe of this love) may indeed be the foundation of it; inaſmuch as we naturally love thoſe like our ſelves; but it can never make us love till we have found in the thing ſome <hi>Je-ne-ſcay-quoy</hi> of lovely. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the ſole cauſe of our love, ſince 'tis of it ſelf impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our knowledg, and conſequently cannot produce love till the effects of ſuch ſympathy, to wit, ſuch an Air, ſuch a Motion, and ſuch a Deportment have pleas'd us. And whereas 'tis ſaid that from eyes which behold us attentively we perceive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing come forth that animates us; I anſwer, that oftentimes quick fix'd and ſweet intuitions are tokens of love, from which 'tis no wonder if ours take riſe and growth, as from its proper cauſe; ſince Love begets Love.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXX. How the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding moves the Will.</head>
            <p>'TIs proper to the Underſtanding not only to conjoyn things wholly different, but oftentimes to abſtract and ſeparate ſuch as are perfectly united in one and the ſame ſubſtance, and differ only in accidents, which it ſevers from their ſubjects. Hence reflecting upon it ſelf, it diſtinguiſhes in its operation two Faculties, to wit, its Cognition and the Reaſonable Appetite or Will, although they are one and the ſame thing, not only in the Soul, whoſe eſſence is ſimple, but alſo in the Intellect; nor are their objects different, Truth, the object of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being convertible and all one with Good, the object of the Will. Hence Civilians acknowledg no Will in thoſe that want Underſtanding, as Ideots and Children. And as the ſame Sun-beam that produces light, cauſes heat too by the continuation of its action, or by its re-union in a Burning-glaſs: ſo an object long conſider'd or ſtrongly apprehended by the Underſtanding as good, immediately incites and inflames the ſame to ſeek and deſire it. So that the cognition of a thing in the Underſtanding is only Theory, which the Will, applying it ſelf thereunto by deſire, reduces into Practice. As the Theorical habit of an Art differs not from the Practical, and the concluſion of a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm is only a dependance upon its two Premiſſes. Wherefore the Will, which is the practice of the Underſtandings ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a reſult of its ratiocination, is not diſtinguiſh'd from the Underſtanding; and to know good, to deſire and ſeek means to poſſeſs it, are operations continu'd by one ſole moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Beſides, to ſeparate the actions of the Souls faculties, and make them independent one of another, would infer a kind of diviſibility in the Soul: but the Will being only a deſire, every deſire a ſpecies of motion, and motion an accident; it is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from its ſubject, the Underſtanding, whereof 'tis only an affection and propiety. So that the Intellect and the Will being the ſame thing, when the former is carried towards an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended good, we ſay it moves the Will, as it doth the other powers which it employs in queſt of that good, when the ſame is external and it cannot attain to it by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That to know, to will, and to be able, although of the ſame extent in things purely natural (as in a Stone, whoſe knowledge, deſire, and power to tend to its centre are the ſame thing) yet are different actions in rational agents. For oftentimes we know without willing, and will what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do; and ſometimes we know not that which we would: Oftentimes we will things not only without, but even againſt Reaſon; witneſs the irregular Appetite of breeding Women
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66371:60"/>
and Green-ſickneſs Maids. Wherefore theſe actions being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, the Faculties from which they proceed, the Intellect, Will and Motive Faculty, muſt be wholly diſtinct; ſeeing their two adequate Objects, which ſpecifie Faculties, are conſider'd under divers formal Reaſons, which are the ſole Cauſes of the diſtinction of Faculties. For Entity immaterial and ſpiritual, is, as true and intelligible, the object of the Underſtanding; but, as good and deſirable, 'tis the object of the Will: which are two wholly different formal Reaſons. Now though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and the Will are two different Faculties, yet there is ſuch a dependance between them that the one can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, and they communicate mutual aſſiſtance: the Underſtanding ſupplies Reaſons and Counſels, which the Will cauſes the Powers under its dominion to execute: for 'tis a blind Queen, having no knowledg of her own but only what light ſhe receives from the Intellect. But how can it ſee the ſame, if blind, as 'tis fancied? We anſwer, that as all things have a bent and natural inclination to their proper good, though they know it not (as even the Intellect aſſents to a truth known by ratiocination, but knows not why it aſſents to a firſt Principle, as, That the whole is greater then its part, and that 2 and 1 make 3; theſe being connate Notions) ſo the Will is carried to the Good propos'd to it by the Underſtanding, becauſe the goodneſs and ſutableneſs thereof engage it to endeavours of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it, wherein its ſupream Felicity lyes.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Since the Will is a deſire, every deſire a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every motion from ſome other (nothing moving it ſelf); the Will cannot deſire unleſs mov'd by ſome ſuperior power and knowledg: For as there is no deſire without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, ſo, to the end this may not be idle and unprofitable, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath joyn'd an Appetite to it; to wit, a Senſitive Appetite to the knowledg of a Senſible Good apprehended ſuch by the Imagination, which is common to Men and Brutes; and a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Appetite (the Will) to the knowledg of an honeſt Good apprehended ſuch by the Underſtanding. And whereas imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things cannot be known by themſelves but by ſuch as are ſenſible and corporeal, we cannot better judge of the manner whereby the Intellect moves the Will, then by that whereby the Imagination moves the Senſitive Appetite; which is the ſweetneſs of the Object, whoſe Species being receiv'd by ſome one of the outward Senſes, and carried from the Common ſenſe to the Phanſie which reliſhes the ſame to the full, is then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Senſitive Appetite, which preſently flyes to it, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſo impetuouſly as that it hurries the Reaſon and the Will along with it ſelf, and conſtrains them to yield to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of thoſe Paſſions which it excites to joyn with it in purſuit of that good, and which itre doubles upon the occurrence of any obſtacle to its deſigns. In like ſort the Will is carried of it ſelf to a vertuous action, when the Underſtanding repreſents the honeſty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66371:61"/>
of the ſame to it; provided it be not otherwiſe prepoſſeſs'd, and the ſaid action be not accompani'd with difficulties and thorns, as commonly happens; for then that Senſitive Appetite often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gets the better of Reaſon; the Fleſh, of the Spirit. There is this difference between the motions of the Will and the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, that the latter neceſſarily follows the duct of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which 'tis inclin'd inſpite of it ſelf towards a Delectable Good; but the Will (common to us with Angels) is ſo mov'd by the Intellect, that nevertheleſs it always remains miſtreſs of its own actions, and can do either good or evil by vertue of its liberty, which alone diſcriminates Man from Beaſt, and gives him right of empire and command, (which the Civilians define, a power of making uſe of any thing at one's pleaſure;) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which not only Judgments, Vertues, Vices, Rewards and Puniſhments, Praiſes and Diſpraiſes, Conſultations and Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would be uſeleſs; but alſo all Laws would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Man would be in worſe condition then Brutes, over whom he hath no other advantage but that of Reaſon; which would ſerve for nothing if he acted things neceſſarily, as other Agents do, and not freely and voluntarily.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, He had always accounted it a vain enquiry, how the Underſtanding moves the Will; and the Senſes, the Senſitive Appetite towards their Objects; becauſe the Cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citive Faculty, and theſe Appetites being really diſtinct and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing common, there cannot intervene any commerce between them. They are Officers that have ſevered charges, without having any thing to ſhare or diſpatch together. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it being true that we love nothing but what is firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and judg'd amiable, we muſt ſeek this dependance ſomwhat higher. Now all actions are of the whole Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; and conſequently Man, who is the whole, is he who by his knowledg either of Senſe or of the Intellect, judges what both the one and the other Appetite ought to embrace or reject. Then after he hath paſs'd his judgment by his Cognoſcitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he determines himſelf to follow by his Appetite what he hath judg'd fit to be done; in conſequence whereof he applies his Motive Faculty to the execution of his Reſolution. So that 'tis Man that moves himſelf by his Will towards Good or Evil, to purſue or avoid, after he hath conſider'd what he ought to will, how, and in what ſort to comport himſelf. By this means we obviate a world of difficulties ariſing from this Queſtion, and reſolve many; as, amongſt others, How the Underſtanding comes to illuminate corporeal phantaſms, without eſtabliſhing an <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> for that purpoſe, whoſe office is pretended to ſublime thoſe phantaſms by denudating them of their ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and materiality, that ſo they may become actually intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible and proportionate to the Intellect. For, beſides that 'tis impoſſible to conceive how any ſpiritual light can fall from the Intellect upon a corporeal phantaſm; (that which is corporeal
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66371:61"/>
being incapable of receiving any thing ſpiritual, and the Intellect of producing any thing out of it ſelf, ſince all its actions are imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent:) we are deliver'd from all this trouble by ſaying, that in the ſtate of this preſent life Man by his outward and inward Senſes takes in as much knowledg of things as they can give him, and afterwards by his Underſtanding deduces and infers things which the phantaſms alone could not acquaint him with. Thus when a phantaſm repreſents to him a thing which his eye beholds afar off, he by his Underſtanding judges the ſame a Subſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the phantaſm ſhews him that it ſubſiſts of it ſelf; if he ſee it walk, he judges it alive; So that 'tis ſufficient to the drawing of all his Conſequences that he infer from the phantaſms what they are capable to repreſent to him, without need of ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing them, or of commerce between them and the Intellect. In like manner, 'tis not needful that the Intellect ſhew the Will its Object; but the man's ſeeing it, is ſufficient to cauſe him to move himſelf by his Will towards the Good which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends. For as a King hath his Scouts to diſcover the ſtate of his Enemies, upon whoſe report he holds a Council of War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he reſolves what is to be done. So Man by his Senſes diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the nature of Objects, as by ſo many Spies, which make their report to the Imagination; after which the Underſtanding judges of the ſame; and laſtly, the Man reſolves and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines by his Will. Thus 'tis the Man that makes all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, employing all his Faculties diverſly for that purpoſe. And as 'twere impertinent to aſk how the Scouts and Council of War acted and mov'd the Troops which execute the General's reſolution to make them fight; but it ſuffices to ſay, That 'tis his Order: So 'tis abſurd to inquire how the Senſes or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding move the Appetite or the Will; 'tis ſufficient to ſay, That a Man reſolves to will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after cogniſance of the matter.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That that which moves the Will, is ſomething divine and more excellent then Reaſon, namely, that part of the Intellect, which is the knowledg of Firſt Principles, and is to the Soul what ſhe is to the Body which ſhe informs. This appears in all the Will's actions; whereof thoſe that tend to the End are, to Will, to Deſire, to Enjoy, when the ſaid End is a Good, and is either abſent or preſent; not to Will, to Flee, to be Sad, when the ſaid End is an Evil, and that conſider'd too either as abſent or preſent: thoſe which reſpect the means lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch End are, To Chuſe, to Conſent, and to Employ ſome rather then others. All which actions it cannot exert of it ſelf, but being mov'd by that divine power of the Intellect which repreſents to it the goodneſs of the End, and the ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Means for attaining the ſame: in like manner as the End moves the efficient Cauſe, attracting it to its proſecution by an improper and metaphorical Motion.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, As the Will is mov'd by the Intellect, ſo is the Intellect mov'd reciprocally by the Will, which commands
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66371:62"/>
it to divide, define, abſtract and perform its operations in ſuch and ſuch manner. Yea, there is no Faculty but is ſubject to its empire. It commands the Imagination to frame Idea's and Species; the Memory, to recall and repreſent them; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, to ſpeak, walk, and the like other actions; the Senſitive Appetite, to love, hate, be angry, to raiſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe its paſſions; though many times theſe are deaf to its dictats.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, Since the Rational Soul is a ſimple Form, and every Form a perfection of the ſubject wherein it reſides; that of Man being to know Truth, to love Good, and to be united to both by Fruition: the ſame Soul when it knows, is call'd the Intellect; when it deſires or loves the thing known, the Will. So that there is no need for the one to be mov'd by the other; for 'tis the Soul that moves it ſelf, which therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Entelechia,</hi> and the Principle of motion; the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans, a Self-moving number.</p>
            <p>The Eighth ſaid, That the Will depends not any way on the Intellect, and conſequently is not mov'd by it. Which is prov'd, firſt, becauſe the Will is mutable and oftimes contrary, upon the ſame ratiocination; as it would not be, if it were mov'd by the Underſtanding. For if the Will were, according to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> definition, a deſire of good with reaſon, the one ought always to follow the other. But it not doing ſo, 'tis an argument, that the Will hath another principle then the ratiocination. In the ſecond place, as it was lately argu'd, there are amities of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, properly ſo call'd, becauſe not grounded upon any Reaſon; and therefore the Will, which never exerciſes its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion more freely then in Love, follows not the Intellect in that kind of amities, and conſequently is not mov'd by it. Thirdly, whatever the Civilians ſay, Fools and Children have their Wills, as well as the Wiſer and Elder; yea both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Will, as reſolvedly as the latter: and Women, who we ſay have leſs judgment then Men, are yet more ſelf-will'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate then they. On the contrary, the moſt judicious are commonly the leaſt reſolute, and find moſt difficulties in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. An Emperick and ignorant Phyſician will be bolder and reſolve things more pertinaciouſly then an old experienc'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt. A young and giddy Captain will ſooner tell his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is the iſſue of his Will, then an old beaten Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier who doubts of every thing, and labours much to bring himſelf to a reſolution. But the contrary would happen, if the Will follow'd the Duct of the Judgment. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive rather that the Will moves the Underſtanding as well as all the other Faculties; ſince no body can reaſon inſpite of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he muſt will to ſet his Mind upon a thing before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect can make its reviews.</p>
            <p>The Ninth ſaid, The beſt courſe was, rather to ſalve the Opinions of the School by ſome Expedient, then wholly to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66371:62"/>
depart from them, as a way too difficult to keep; and that he conceiv'd it better to untye the Gordian knot then to cut it; which belongs only to <hi>Alexander.</hi> 'Tis acknowledg'd that the Intellect and the Will are two Faculties of the Rational Soul; that we will nothing unleſs the judgment believe it good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be really or only apparently ſuch. But the difficulty is concerning the means that the Intellect employs to carry the Will to ſuch good. Take it thus: The Will is carri'd of it ſelf to good, as a Stone to the Centre; but as this Stone is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hinder'd from arriving thereunto by obſtacles which ſtay it; ſo Ignorance puts a bar to the Will. Hereupon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding falls to work till it have remov'd that obſtacle by its reaſoning: Which done, as there is nothing between the end of a ſhadow, and the beginning of light; ſo there is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the end of our ignorance, and the beginning of our voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: where the operation of the Underſtanding ends, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that of the Will, no more induc'd, mov'd, and as little forc'd as the weight that tends downwards, which cannot be ſaid carri'd towards the Centre, unleſs improperly, by him that takes away the piece of wood or other obſtacle that ſtop'd it in the Air. Moreover, it were no longer a Will, if mov'd by any other principle but it ſelf. As is ſeen in thoſe who having a will to do ſomthing, when the ſame is once commanded them, change their reſolution, or do only with regret what before they deſir'd with paſſion: as the ſame motion which was natural to the Stone, becomes violent to it when it is impell'd, inſtead of being ſuffer'd to deſcend downwards.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXI. Whence come the Marks or Spots wherewith Children are born?</head>
            <p>AS the Degrees of Life have dominion over the Firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo they have authority one over another, each in his order. The Vegetative life in Man makes uſe of the Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Qualities at pleaſure, even to the prejudice of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So, Heat congregates things of the ſame, and ſeparates thoſe of different Nature; but our Vegetative Soul makes it do the contrary, namely, Unite the Four Humours in the Veins though different in nature, inſtead of ſegregating them: for in this Caſe, Heat acts not with full authority but as the Soul's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, following her intentions. And the reaſon is, becauſe theſe four Humours being ingredients into the Nativity of Man, they muſt neceſſarily paſs into his nouriſhment; which they cannot do without being mingled together. But when the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66371:63"/>
Blood is out of the Veins; then the Heat, diſengag'd from the Soul's juriſdiction, diſgregates and ſeparates all four, making the Choler float uppermoſt, the Phlegm next, then the Blood, and loweſt of all, Melancholy, as the dregs. Amongſt Souls there is the ſame order of Superiority. The Senſitive makes the Vegetative obey it; as appears by this, that if after meat the Imagination attend much to an object, the Concoction of the Food is retarded, becauſe all the Faculties of the Soul being united in their Root and Eſſence of the Soul, when ſhe ſets her ſelf much upon one object, ſhe leaves the other inferiour powers idle; they not being able to work but as the Soul, (their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) employs them. Now this premis'd, I ſay, when a breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woman hath a longing for any thing, this deſir'd thing is imprinted ſtrongly in the Phancy; and this imprinting being made in the Brain, the Spirits which flow from thence, carry a copy thereof with them. For as an intire Looking-glaſs repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents but one Image, but every piece of a broaken one hath its whole Pourtrait: becauſe the Intentional Species or Images of things, though diviſible by reaſon of their ſubject, are yet in themſelves formally indiviſible, being Forms without Matter, and conſequently indiviſible; Diviſion proceeding from Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, a concomitant of Matter: So thoſe Spirits which ſtream from the Brain, though they leave there the image of the deſir'd thing, yet withall they carry the ſame image with them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing portions of the ſubſtance wherein it is engraven; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the place where the <hi>Foetus</hi> is form'd, by reaſon of the union of its Umbilical Veſſels with thoſe of the Mother, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Infant and imprint the Characters, they bring, upon it: the Vegetative and Plaſtick or Formative Vertue ſuffering it ſelf to be over-rul'd by the Senſitive, as this is by the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and this again by the other ſuperiour powers. When the teeming Woman touching her ſelf in any part, the Spirits run thither from the Brain, either by reaſon of the touch or the motion (both depending upon the Animal Spirits) but finding the Mother's fleſh too hard and diſproportinate to their effect, and miſſing their blow, they go to give it upon the tenderer fleſh of the Child. And as in Generation, the Spirits of all the parts of the Body accur to the place where the Seed is receiv'd, there to engrave the Characters of the parts whence they flow, which afterwards ſerve for the Formative Vertue, every one having his taſk to make the part from which it iſſu'd: ſo the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Spirits keep the ſame courſe and rule towards the <hi>Embryo,</hi> ſo that thoſe which ſerv'd to the Mother's touch, go to find that ſame place in the Child's Body, there to mark the Image which they brought from the Brain; Nature finding ways for her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention where none appear.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, The impotence of that Sex and their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, (evidenc'd by the violence of all their Paſſions, which know no mediocrity) is one of the principal cauſes of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66371:63"/>
the impetuoſity of their deſires. Now the Species of the thing deſir'd being in the Imagination, it excites the Appetite which deſir'd it; this the motive Faculty, which employs the Animal Spirits to execute the commands of the Faculties by whom it is ſet on work. And as the Vertues and Images of things gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated here below by the heat and influence of the Stars, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Air which conſigns them to the Earth; ſo thoſe Spirits receive the Species and Images whereof the brain is full; and being directed by the Imagination to the Womb (which hath great communication with the Brain by means of the nerves of the ſixt Pair, as appears by the effects of Odors upon that part) there they retrace and imprint upon the Child the Images wherewith they are laden. For, if it be true that the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can act beyond its Subject, as Eſtriches and Tortoiſes are ſaid to hatch their Eggs with their Eyes, and that Hens hatch Chickens of the colour of ſuch cloths as are laid before them whileſt they are ſitting; much more may the Imagination of a Woman repreſent upon the tender Fruit in her womb the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of things which ſhe paſſionately deſires: and this is no more ſtrange than the common obſervation, of People falling ſick, and recovering again, meerly by Fancy.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the images of things deſired are, in the Spirits, juſt as thoſe of ſenſible objects are in the Air, which is full of them. But as theſe, that they may be ſeen, muſt be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by a ſmooth and opake body; ſo, that thoſe which are in the ſpirits may be expreſſ'd, they muſt be terminated by a ſoft, tender, and capable body, as a child's is in the firſt months of his conformation, during which alone he is ſuſceptible of theſe impreſſions, which are only of things edible and potable; being the Child, then endu'd only with ſenſitive Life, cannot be affected but by things ſerving to the Animal Life, as aliments are, which (beſides) are ordinarily and moſt ardently deſir'd by breeding Women; thoſe that long for chalk, coals, and other impurities being unhealthy and diſtemper'd. Now to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why the Grapes, Mulberries, Strawberries, Gooſe-berries, and other Fruits delineated upon our bodies, ripen and change colour at the ſame time as the true fruits upon the earth do, I ſhall not recurr to the Stars, or Taliſmanical Figures, but more probably to that Univerſal Spirit which cauſeth the ſame fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in the ſpirits of our bodies as in Wine and the Vine when it is in its ſap and flower; and in Pork or Veniſon when Hogs and Deer are ſalt, mezled, or go to rut.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſaid, That ſome of theſe Marks adhere to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Families. So the family of <hi>Seleucus</hi> had an Anchor upon the thigh; in <hi>Greece</hi> ſome were diſtinguiſh'd by a Lance, a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, a Star, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which marks, as Warts and Moles, proceed from the Formative Vertue in the ſeed, which containing the Idea of all the parts, expreſſes them to the life in the child. Other ſorts of Marks are not ordinary but fortuitous, and depend
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66371:64"/>
upon the Imagination alone, which employs the ſpirits which are common both to the Mother and Child by the Umbilical Veſſels, and have the ſame motions: ſo that when the Woman ſcratches her ſelf in any part of her body, the ſpirits having a like motion are carri'd towards that part, and at the ſame time towards that correſpondent part in the child's body, whoſe tenderneſs is alone ſuſceptible of the image wherewith they are impregnated, and which is never to be removed, as being from the firſt conformation.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That not only the deſire of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is pacifi'd by enjoyment, but any vehement paſſion, even a ſudden fright againſt which there is no remedy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leads the variable Fancy of Women to interrupt the work of the Formative Vertue, otherwiſe always very regular. As a certain Woman having ſeen a Criminal broken upon the Wheel, brought forth a child that all the bones were broken. Hereunto alſo contribute the exceſs or defect of the Matter, its evil quality, and the deprav'd conformation of the Womb. But to attribute the communication requir'd for this effect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Imaginative and Formative Faculties to the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Veſſels, cannot hold; there being but one Vein, two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachus,</hi> without any nerves, by which alone the animal ſpirits are tranſmitted from the Brain. Nor can thoſe Species without diſſipation and confuſion, ſeparate themſelves from the maſs of Blood, and paſs by the circuit of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Veins into the Umbilical Vein of the <hi>Foetus</hi>; wherefore 'tis more rational to aſcribe this effect to the correſpondence of the Faculties, whereof the Superior indeed move the Inferior, but by a ſimple and pure irradiation, without tranſmitting any thing to them: There needing no other communication then that of a Lutiniſt's finger, or a Dancing-maſter's foot with their Imagination, which yet follow one the other, although it tranſmits not to the ends of their hands and feet, the notes and cadences which they repreſent. Thus, for the imprinting of a Mark, the Formative Faculty being mov'd by the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath no need to receive any Species, as the Cognoſcitive Faculties have, of which number the Formative is not. Nor is it more ſtrange, that the <hi>Foetus,</hi> indu'd with a particular ſoul, yet feels the effects of its Mothers Imagination, than that Fruits receive the changes and alterations of the Trees to which they adhere.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXII. Of the Original of Forms.</head>
            <p>A Form is that which gives either Being or Motion. When it gives only Motion, 'tis call'd an Aſſiſtent Form, as that which moves the Heavens: When Being, an Informant Form, ſtyl'd alſo an Act, Perfection, Eſſence, Vertue, Beauty. For what ever is excellent in a Subject, proceeds from the Form; which determining the Indifferency of the matter (of it ſelf imperfect) makes it to be one, that is to ſay, not divided in it ſelf, and divided from every thing elſe. Created Forms are either ſpiritual or material; and both theſe again either ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or accidental. Spiritual accidental Forms are, Vertue, Science, and all Habits of the Soul. Subſtantial ſpiritual forms are Intelligences and Rational ſouls. Material accidental forms are either ſimple, as Heat and Whiteneſs; or compounded, as Beauty and Health. Under Material ſubſtantial Forms are comprehended Vegetative and ſenſitive Souls, which are the Forms of Plants and Brutes, and the Subject now in hand; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I will not grant them to be Subſtances, but only Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. All agree that there are Forms, becauſe there are Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which preſuppoſe Powers. Theſe Powers are properties flowing from ſome active principle which ſets them on work; which the Matter, becauſe purely paſsive, cannot do; and therefore it muſt be the Form. But the doubt is, whether this Form be ſubſtantial or accidental; as, whether it be only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of Heat, which makes Plants and Animals be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht, grow, generate, and move, or elſe ſome Subſtance and Form more excellent that employs Heat as its Inſtrument for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thoſe Actions. And this is moſt probable. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, A Subſtance compounded of Matter and Form ſhould, contrary to the Maxim, be made of that which is not Subſtance, if Forms were only accidental. They are introduc'd into a capable Subject by an Univocal Agent, which by generation communicates a ſoul of the ſame Nature with its own, which is material, and conſequently diviſible; yet ſo diviſible as that it is not diminiſhed in the traduction, no more than the Species of a Looking-glaſs which produces it ſelf wholly and entirely in all bodies capable of it, or then the flame of a candle wherewith a thouſand others may be lighted, without any diminution of its ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That Forms are primogenial Principles, no more generable than the Matter which they always accompany, and according to whoſe diſpoſitions they only change appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For 'tis not credible that Forms, the principal pieces of the world (without which it would be depriv'd of that from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66371:65"/>
which it bears its name, to wit, Ornament and Beauty) are ſubject to continual corruption; otherwiſe the world and the natures therein contain'd would have been chang'd in ſo long a time, and yet they remain ſtill the ſame. Beſides, if Forms periſh, they muſt either be annihilated (but nothing is ſo in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) or elſe reſolv'd into that whereof they are compos'd, ſince they are ſuppos'd material; and nevertheleſs we ſee no remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them. 'Tis therefore always the ſame form but diverſly dreſs'd, and ſaid to be generated when it changes from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect to a perfect ſtate; and to be corrupted when it returns into a worſe condition then what is had before; both, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral diſpoſitions of its Subject.</p>
            <p>The third ſaid, That all natural Forms are nothing but Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſince they are in matter as in a ſubject, from which they are inſeparable; and not as parts; for they are parts of the whole, but not of the Matter. The Forms of the Elements are the firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And as all Mixts are compounded of the four Elements, ſo they derive their form (as well as their matter) from them, which follows the nature of the Element predominant in the Compound. Thus Drineſs is the Form of a ſtone, which hath more of earth than of any other Element; Oyl is humid, becauſe aerial; all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures are Hot, by reaſon of Heat, the nobleſt and moſt active quality, which, attaining to the proportion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for performing the offices of life, is call'd a Soul; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is more or leſs refin'd, and meets with different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, 'tis called a Vegetative Soul in Plants, and a Senſitive ſoul in Brutes. I ſay further, that theſe Forms are nothing but Modes and Faſhions of Being. For as Water turn'd into Air, and this into Fire by rarefaction, or into Water by condenſation, are ſtill the ſame, not differing but according as their parts are more or leſs cloſe; ſo as well Forms purely natural as other living Forms, are nothing but Modes and Faſhions of Being of the Elements, their Qualities, and the ſeveral Mixtures from which thoſe Forms reſult.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſaid, according to <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>'s opinion, That all things are in all, and conſequently Forms in the Matter, out of whoſe boſom they are educ'd by Agents conjoyning things of the ſame Nature, and ſeparating others. As Art (which imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Nature) makes not Wine, but only preſſes out that vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal juice which was before in the Grape; and out of Marble forms a Statue only by paring off what was ſuperfluous: ſo out of the Earth, Nature forms Plants, which are turn'd into the ſubſtance of Animals, whoſe bodies are again reduc'd into Earth.</p>
            <p>The fifth maintain'd the opinion of <hi>Albert</hi> the Great, who is for the Generation of things, which the preceding opinion over throws, holding nothing to be new generated; He ſaid, that Forms are indeed in the Matter, yet not entire and perfect, but only by halves and begun; according to their eſſence, not according to their exiſtence, which they acquire by the Agents which educe things out of their cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:66371:65"/>The Sixth ſaid, If it were ſo, then there would be no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Generation, becauſe Exiſtence is nothing but a Manner of Being, adding nothing to Eſſence, nor really diſtinguiſh'd from it. Wherefore I embrace <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s opinion, that Forms are in the Matter, but only <hi>potentially,</hi> and as the Matter is capable of them; juſt as Wax is potentially <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Statue, becauſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving that form. This he calls, to be drawn and educ'd out of the power or boſom of the Matter: which is not to be receiv'd in it, or to depend of its diſpoſitions, ſince this belongs alſo to the Rational ſoul, which is not receiv'd in the body till the previous diſpoſitions, neceſſary for its reception, be introduc'd therein; but the Matter it ſelf concurrs, though in a paſſive way, not only to diſpoſe it ſelf, but alſo to produce the Form, and conſequently to preſerve it. Which is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Rational ſoul, whoſe Being depends not anywiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Matter.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, Matter, being a Principle purely paſſive and incapable of all action, cannot produce any thing, much leſs Forms, the nobleſt Entities in the world. 'Tis the principle of impotence and imperfection, and conſequently the uglineſs, deformity, contrary to the Form whereof it ſhould partake, if it contain'd the ſame in power, as Wine and Pepper do Heat, which becomes actual and ſenſible when reduc'd into act by our Natural Heat which looſens it from the parts which confin'd it. Wherefore Forms come from without, namely, from Heaven and its nobleſt part the Sun, the Father of Forms, which are nothing but Beams of light deriv'd from him as their Fountain, whoſe heat and influences give motion and life; which is the abode of Heat in Humidity: not Elementary Heat; for then Arſenic, Sulphur, and other Mixts, abounding with this Heat, ſhould have life; but Serpents, Salamanders, Fiſhes, Hemlock, Poppies, and other exceſsively cold Plants and Animals, ſhould not. Moreover in whatever manner the Elements and their Qualities be mix'd, they are ſtill Elements, and can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above their own Nature, which is, to calefie, refrigerate, attenuate, rarefie, condenſe; but not the internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſes, the various motions and other actions of life, which can proceed only from a Celeſtial Heat, ſuch as that is which preſerves a Plant amidſt the rigours of Winter; whoſe coldneſs would ſoon deſtroy the Plant's heat, if it were of the ſame nature. Hence Vegetative and Senſitive Souls having no Contraries, becauſe Contraries are plac'd under the ſame Genus, (but the Celeſtial matter whereof theſe ſouls are conſtituted, and the Elements are not) therefore they are not corruptible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of other Mixts; but like light, ceaſe to exiſt upon the ceſſation of the diſpoſitions which maintain'd them. For, ſuch is the order of Nature, that when a Subject is poſſeſt of all the diſpoſitions requiſite for introduction of a Form, the Author of Nature, or (according to <hi>Plato</hi>) the Idea, or that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66371:66"/>
Soul of the World (which <hi>Avicenna</hi> held to be an Intelligence deſtinated to the generation of ſubſtantial Forms) concurrs to the production of the Form, as alſo this concourſe ceaſes when thoſe diſpoſitions are aboliſht.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXIII. Whether Lean people are more healthy, and long-liv'd then Fat.</head>
            <p>THe Immortality of our ſouls having an abſolute diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to length of Life, it depends only upon that of the Body, that we do not live Ages as our firſt Fathers did. For 'tis from ſome defect in theſe bodies that the differences of life even in Animals and Plants proceed; whence ſome leſs perfect ſouls, (as thoſe of Oaks) are yet more long-liv'd then thoſe of Beaſts. The ſigns of long and ſhort life, are either ſimply ſuch, or alſo cauſes and effects. Such is the conformation of the parts of our body. A great number of Teeth is held a ſign of longae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as well becauſe 'tis an effect of the ſtrength of the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty and Natural Heat, as that thereby the food is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maſticated and prepar'd; and the other concoctions and functions more perfectly perform'd, whence comes health and long life. So alſo the Habit of the body is not ſimply a ſign, but likewiſe an effect of health and cauſe of long life; namely when the ſame is moderate, that is, neither fat nor lean; which two, though compriſable within the latitude of health, which admits a a great latitude, are yet ſo much leſs perfect as they decline from that laudable diſpoſition which is the rule and ſquare of all others. Now to make a juſt compariſon, we muſt conſider the Fat and the Lean in the ſame degree of exceſs or defect from this Mediocrity, and compare <hi>Philetas</hi> the Poet (who was ſo dry and lean that he was fain to faſten leaden ſoles to his ſhoos for fear the wind ſhould carry him away) with <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Heraclea</hi> who was choakt with fat, unleſs his body were continually beſet with Leeches. Or elſe we muſt obſerve in both an equality of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the Principles of Life, to wit, the Radical Heat and Moiſture in the ſame proportion, the ſame age, under the ſame climate, regiment, and exerciſes; otherwiſe the compariſon will be unequal: and laſtly, we muſt diſtinguiſh the fleſhy, great-limb'd, and muſculous from the fat. This premis'd, I am of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>'s Opinion, Aph. 44. Sect. 2. that ſuch as are groſs and fat naturally, die ſooner then the lean and ſlender; becauſe the Veſſels of the latter, eſpecially the Veins, are larger, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently fuller of Blood and Spirits, which are the Architects and principal Organs of Life: on the contrary, the Fat have ſmaller Veſſels by reaſon of their coldneſs which conſtringes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66371:66"/>
them; as is ſeen in Women, Eunuchs, and Children, whoſe voices are therefore more ſhrill, and who have alſo leſs health and life.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Nature hath furniſht Animals with Fat, to the end to preſerve them from external injuries, and therefore the Lean, who are unprovided thereof, muſt be of ſhorter life: for not many, beſides decrepit old people, die of a natural death; that is, proceeding from cauſes within, whereas moſt diſeaſes ariſe from external cauſes, wherewith the Fat are leſs incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded, eſpecially with cold, the ſworn enemy of life; the ſmallneſs of their pores, and the fat which environs them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all qualities contrary to life, and withall hindring the diſſipation of the Natural Heat, which becomes more vigorous by the confinement; juſt as the Bowels are hotter in Winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cold air hinders the efflux of the heat and ſpirits, caus'd in Summer, and in lean bodies, whoſe pores being more open, cannot retain thoſe volatile ſubſtances. So that, had the Fat leſs heat, as they have not (for plenty of fat argues plenty of blood, the purer and more aiery part whereof diſtilling like dew through the coats of the Veſſels, and paſſing through the Muſcles, when it comes to the Membranes, is by them condens'd into that whitiſh ſubſtance rather by their denſity and natural property then by their coldneſs) yet this Heat being better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd, and leſs alter'd in the Fat then in the Lean, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cauſe fewer diſeaſes, and laſt longer.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Life is the continuance of Heat in Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not aqueous and excrementitious as that of fat people is, but oleaginous and aerial; and the longer this Heat ſubſiſts therein, the longer doth life laſt. Now it continues longer in the Fat, whoſe more open pores let out the fuliginous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rais'd by Heat; which in fat bodies, whoſe paſſages are ſtopt by the coldneſs or clammineſs of pituitous humors, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and choke the heat, like fire that wants free tranſpiration, ſo neceſſary to life that it cannot ſubſiſt a moment without this action, whereby the ſoul attracts air in at all parts of the body, eſpecially the mouth, for refreſhing and ventilating the heat, and recruiting the ſpirits, and by the ſame paſſages emits the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginoſities neceſſarily following all conſumption of humidity by Heat. Which cauſes of Death being internal and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently neceſſary and inevitable; are much more conſiderable then the external, whereto lean people are ſubject, and which may be more eaſily avoided and remedied.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſaid, That Fat perſons have a more moderate and leſs conſuming heat, its activity being allay'd by the humidity of their Conſtitution; and therefore 'tis more durable than that of lean people, whoſe heat already violent of it ſelf is render'd more active by ſiccity, which is a ſpur to it. Hence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure faſting with more trouble than the Fat, whoſe moiſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance both moderates and feeds their heat, which appears to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66371:67"/>
the touch very gentle and temperate, as that of lean perſons is ſharp and pungent. Moreover, Diſeaſes of Inanition, to which the lean are ſubject, are more difficult to cure, than thoſe of Repletion incident to the Fat. And old age which continually dries us up, is the tendency to Death, which is ſiccity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, Health being a Diſpoſition according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which renders a man capable of performing the offices of life aright, and this diſpoſition conſiſting in a due proportion of the firſt qualities, which makes a harmony and laudable temper of the four humors; the principal evidence thereof is a good ſtate and habit of the body call'd by the Phyſicians <hi>Euexia</hi>; and that Extreme which comes neareſt this, is the moſt healthy and fitteſt for long life. The functions of life are Natural, Vital, and Animal; all which are better perform'd by the lean than the fat. Firſt, the Natural, which are Nutrition, Growth, and Generation; becauſe the hotter fleſh of the lean attracts more than that of the fat, which may indeed imbibe the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juices, but cannot perfectly concoct and aſſimilate the ſame for want of ſufficient heat; whence they produce abundance of crude flegmatick excrements, which render them pale and bloated. For their more fatneſs proceeds from want of heat to conſume ſuperfluities. Secondly, growth being an effect of heat, the Fat grow leſs, becauſe they are leſs hot than the Lean. For heat rarefies, ſubtiliſes, dilates, and make the parts mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as its defect makes the humors ſettle downwards; hence women are never ſo tall as men, and their lower parts are groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; whereas the upper parts of men, as the head and breaſt, are more large. Thirdly, the lean are more apt for generation, becauſe their ſpirits are more refin'd, and their ſeed more concoct and plentiful than that of the fat; the pureſt portion of whoſe blood is turn'd into fat inſtead of ſeed; whence all guelded Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals become fat; and, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> fat women are for the moſt part barren, bear ſeldom; who alſo, as well as men of the ſame habit, are more inclin'd to love; but we are commonly moſt led to that which we perform beſt. Then the Vital Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too, are more perfectly perform'd in the lean; as appears by their large reſpiration, their ſtrong and great pulſe, the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their motions and paſſions. Laſtly, ſo alſo are the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, to wit, outward and inward ſenſation, by reaſon of the pureneſs and ſubtlety of their ſpirits, (which likewiſe cauſes goodneſs of wit) and of the diſpoſition of their Organs, more purifi'd, and leſs burden'd with clouds and excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities, which render the fat more heavy both of mind and body.</p>

            <head>CONFEERNCE CXXIV. Whether we may better truſt one whom we have oblig'd, or one that hath oblig'd us.</head>
            <p>COnfidence being the fruit of Friendſhip, yea, the ſweet bond wherewith this Virtue unites Hearts; it may ſeem we ought to have moſt in him that loves moſt perfectly, namely, he that hath oblig'd us. For as 'tis harder to give then to receive, becauſe we cannot give without depriving our ſelves of what we enjoy, (which is contrary to our natural inclination) ſo it is a more virtuous action, and argues a greater kindneſs: the receiver of a benefit finding no difficulty in this action of receiving it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we cannot doubt of his good will, who obliges us by his benefits; but we may of his, that receives. For it frequently happens to thoſe that do good, as it did to the Sower in the Goſpel, part of whoſe ſeed fell in ſtony places, part amongſt thorns, part in the high-way, and was devoured by birds; and the leaſt part upon good ground, and brings not forth fruit but in its own time. Yea, there are many that hate nothing ſo much as the remembrance of thoſe that have done them good, as if their preſence were an Univerſal Reproach, notwithſtanding that a ſecond benefit revives the firſt, and a third or fourth cannot but mind them of the preceeding. But when you have obtain'd of them to remember it, yet many regret nothing more then to pay a debt, becauſe conſtrain'd thereto, either by Law or Duty; and Man being of his own Nature free, hates nothing ſo much as to do any thing by conſtraint. Hence, if he requites an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, 'tis not with that freeneſs and cheerfulneſs which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to good Offices, and becomes a Benefactor; in whom therefore we have more reaſon to confide then in another.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, The little fidelity now in the world, even amongſt neareſt Relatives, makes it reaſonable to enquire, Who may be truſted. And if the fear of Ingratitude, (the moſt vulgar crime, though in ſhew much deteſted by all the world) is the cauſe why he who hath done good to another, yet dares not truſt him; the receiver thereof hath oftentimes no leſs doubt of his Benefactor's intention. For though he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a ſeeming teſtimony of his kindneſs, yet the motives of benefits proceeding ſometimes from an other cauſe beſides true Friendſhip, ſuſpicion may as well ariſe in the Receivers, as in the givers Mind. Many give onely that they may receive with Uſury; others, out of vanity, and to make Creatures and Clients: which they regarding no longer but as their inferiors and dependents, 'tis as dangerous for theſe to confide in their Benefactors, as for a ſlave to uſe confidence towards his Maſter, or a Vaſſal towards his Lord; not often allow'd by the reſpect
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66371:68"/>
and timerouſneſs of the leſs towards the great, as commonly thoſe are that give: Whereas we ordinarily find in him whom we have oblig'd nothing but Subjection and Humility, Virtues much diſpoſing the mind to Gratitude, which cannot but aſſure their Benefactors of their fidelity. Nor can they eaſily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful if they would, your confidence in them obliging them continually to fidelity, and, withall, giving them occaſion to requite your kindneſſes by their aſſiduity and ſervices. Which was the recompence wherewith the poor amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> pay'd their Creditors, by ſerving them for ſome years. So that he is ſcarce leſs blameable who diſtruſts him whom he hath oblig'd, and by this diffidence deprives him of the means of requital, then he who having receiv'd a benefit betrayes his Benefactor; the Injuſtice being almoſt alike in both. If the firſt complains of having been deceiv'd by him whom he finds ungrateful; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in whom his Benefactor puts not the confidence which he ought, will have no leſs cauſe of complaint that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he hath diſtruſted him, and ſoil'd the luſtre of the firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation by his diffidence and bad opinion of him; which is to tax himſelf of impudence for having done good to one unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That if Men were perfect, Communicative Juſtice would require of them that the receiver of a benefit ſhould repay the like, or at leaſt ſome acknowledgment by his endeavours: Which the Poets intimated by the Graces, holding Hand in Hand. But the perverſity of Man is ſuch, that the more he is oblig'd to this Duty, the worſe he acquits himſelf thereof, not doing any thing handſomely but what he does freely; and becauſe being a vain-glorious Creature, he hates nothing ſo much as to be ſubject, and to pay homage to him that hath done him good; whoſe preſence ſeems to upbraid him with his own meaneſs. If he loves his Benefactor, 'tis with an intereſs'd and mercenary affection; whereas that of the former is free from all ſelf-reſpect, and proceeds meerly from a principle of Virtue, and conſequently, is with more reaſon to be rely'd upon. Moreover, a Work-man loves his Production more then he is lov'd by it: as alſo God doth his Creatures; and Fathers, their Children. Now a Benefactor, who is a kind of Work-man and Artificer of our good Fortune, cheriſhes and loves us as his work and creatures, becauſe he ſeems concern'd for our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; juſt as Cauſes are for that of their Effects, in which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves revive, and ſeem to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produc'd.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That our Natural Sentiments incline us more to rely upon thoſe whom we have oblig'd, then upon thoſe who have oblig'd us; not ſo much by way of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging a requital, (for Obligations are not to be done in hope of recompence; which would be exchange rather than kindneſs) as becauſe we are apt to truſt thoſe moſt, whom we love moſt. But we love thoſe moſt, to whom we
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66371:68"/>
have given greateſt Teſtimony of our Affections. A Man may be deceiv'd in reckoning his benefits as cauſes of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the receiver; but, they are certain Effects and Signs of Affection in the beſtower: So that in reſpect of us, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly better to truſt him whom we have oblig'd, than him who hath oblig'd us. The ſame is prov'd alſo in reſpect of him that is oblig'd; even the wild beaſts are tam'd, and, inſtead of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obey thoſe that feed them; and therefore 'twere injurious to humanity, not to judge It capable of acknowledging a benefit which it knows how to conferr without provocation. For upon examination, the Cauſes of Ingratitude will be found to ariſe from thoſe who boaſt of the title of Benefactors; the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whereof is ſo great in ſome, that they diſpleaſe more than oblige, by Preſents unſeaſonably given, of no value, and (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s advice) of little duration, intermixt with ill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, inſtead of being fenc'd with new to keep out the rain of the diſguſts and coldneſſes which deſtroy Friendſhip; with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and not with a chearful Countenance; after denials and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, ſo that the thing ſeemes rather ſnatch'd then receiv'd; diminiſh'd by burthenſome conditions; and laſtly, nullifi'd by reproaches, if not requited as ſoon as was expected. Whence ſuch pretended benefits deſerve rather the name of Out-rages: And nevertheleſs, being there are many that are grateful, even for ſuch benefits, we may juſtly conclude that Courteſies done with their due circumſtances, are far more capable to oblige the receivers to Gratitude, which cannot conſiſt with Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the Deciſion of this, as of all other Moral Queſtions, depends upon perſons, times, places, and other circumſtances whereupon Prudence is founded, which teaches when, how, and whom we are to truſt. Yet, ſuppoſing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances alike, and two perſons equally virtuous, one of which hath done me good, and the other receiv'd good from me; the contrary Reaſon of the Law, which preſumes him alwayes bad who hath been once bad, makes me judge, That he who hath once done me good, will ſooner do me good again then another; and therefore that I ought rather to truſt him.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXV. Of the Cauſes of Freezing and Thawing.</head>
            <p>AS Heat and Cold are the Efficient Cauſes of all Meteors, ſo Drineſs and Moiſture ſupply Matter for them, ſublim'd and made volatil by extraneous Heat. Vapours which make Aqueous Meteors, are of two ſorts; ſome aſcend to the Middle Region of the Air, whoſe coldneſs condenſes them into a Cloud,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66371:69"/>
which afterwards turnes into Rain, Snow, or Hail: Others, through the weakneſs of Heat, or tenuity of their Matter unable to aſcend, turn into Miſts and Dew, and the Serene which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes it, and Froſt. For the Matter both of Froſt and Dew, is a ſubtil thin Vapour, which when ſpread equally and uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Earth, hinders not the Air's tranſparency, which therefore in time of Froſt is alwayes clear and ſerene. But their Efficient is diſtinct; that of Dew is the moderate Coldneſs of the Night, whence 'tis moſt frequent in temperate Seaſons; that of a Froſt is Vehement Cold, whereby being firſt condens'd, it falls down in form of Cryſtal: Yet Cold alone ſuffices not to produce Froſt; for then Water, which is cold in an eminent degree, ſhould be alwayes frozen. But ſome terrene and groſs parts muſt ſerve for an uniting medium to compact the moiſt parts of the Water or Vapour, which being naturally fluid, cannot be link'd together but by means of ſome dry parts fixing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining their fluidity. Hence the impureſt and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Liquors are ſooneſt frozen; diſtill'd Waters, difficultly, by reaſon of their ſimplicity; Vinegar (though cold) never, by reaſon of the tenuity of its parts. But the ſurface of waters being full of earthy and groſs parts, which could not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Vapours or Exhalations, drawn up by the Sun's heat, is therefore firſt frozen; even that of running waters, though not ſo eaſily, by reaſon of their motion makes a divulſion of their parts; as neither Oyle very eaſily, (by reaſon of its aërious and unctuous humidity) the Sea, and Hot Spirits; which yet Experience ſhews are ſometimes frozen by Vehement Cold; the Poet in his deſcription of the ſharpneſs of Winter, in his Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks, ſaying, that they cleav'd Wine with hatchets; and the Northern Navigations of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> relating that they were detain'd three moneths under the ſeventy fourth Degree, where their Ships were frozen in the main ſea.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Heat and Cold are the immediate Cauſes of Freezing and Thawing, but 'tis hard to know, Whence that Heat and Cold comes? Now becauſe Cold is onely the Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heat, as Darkneſs is of Light; we ſhall ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Cauſes of Cold and of Freezing, if we know thoſe of Heat which cauſes Thawing. The truth is, the Sun, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and remoteneſs makes the diverſities of Seaſons accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different mutations which he cauſes in the qualities of the Air, contribute thereunto, but the Earth helps too; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it alone; for we ſee that the Snow on the Mountains which approach neareſt Heaven, is laſt melted. But the Sun's Rays piercing into the boſome of the Earth, draw out that Fire which is inclos'd in its entralls; and becauſe the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves but a very little from the Aequinoctial Line, therefore that part of the Earth which anſwers to that of Heaven where the Sun continually reſides, is alwayes Hot; and by a contrary Reaſon, that under the Poles is alwayes extreamly cold: And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66371:69"/>
even Country-people obſerve winds to be the Cauſe of theſe Effects; for thoſe that blow from the North quarter, bring with them an extream cold Air, which is the cauſe of Freezing; and thoſe from the South bring on us an Air extreamly heated by the continuall action of the Sun, and ſo are the cauſe of Thawing.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Winds being continual, becauſe their matter never fails, it happens that the ſtrongeſt gets the better of the weakeſt, and they chaſe one another; whence <hi>Virgil</hi> calls them Wreſtlers. When the South Winds blow, (which are more frequent, and more groſs then the Northern or Eaſtern, by reaſon of the Sun's ſtrength in the South, which opens the Pores of the Earth more:) the copious Exhalations which iſſue out of it, are hotter than thoſe which come out of the Pores of the Northern Earth, which are cloſed up by Cold, whence the Winds blowing from thence are colder and thinner; juſt as our breath is cold when we contract our Mouthes, and hot when we dilate them. In like manner, the Exhalations iſſuing out of the Earth's Pores, are hotter or colder, according as the paſſages out of which they proceed are more or leſs dilated, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, cauſe Freezing or Thawing.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Sun or other Stars are onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cauſes of Freezing and Thawing; namely, by their Heat which ſerves to raiſe the Vapors, which are the next cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according as they partake more or leſs of that external Heat; or, (as the Chymiſts ſay) as they are full either of certain nitrous and diſſolving Spirits which cauſe Thawing, or of coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ones which cauſe Freezing; ſuch as thoſe are, harden Plants into Stones, which ſo preſently congeal drops of water in Caves and Water-droppings, and form the Cryſtals of the Rock. Moreover, juſt before it freezes, Sinks, and other ſtinking places ſmell more ſtrong, by reaſon that the Spirits and Vapors of the Earth are complicated with thoſe ſtinks as they iſſue forth.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the Cauſe of Thawing is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Heat of the Earth, which exhaling warm Vapors, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt heats the bottome of the Water, (for which reaſon Fiſh retire thither) then they mollifie and moiſten the ſurface of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Earth hardned by Cold. Moreover, that Heat which is found in the deepeſt Mines where the Labourers work naked, and moſt ordinarily in the Water without enduring any Cold; the veins of Sulphur, Bitumen, Vitriol, and Arſenick, which are found in the entralls of the Earth; the Hot Springs, and the <hi>Volcanoes</hi> in its ſurface, ſufficiently argue, That if there be not a Central Fire, (as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> held) yet there is a great Heat there, like that of Living Bodies, which concocts Metals, and makes Plants grow. Hence the changes of Air are firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in Mines by the Vapors ariſing from beneath, which hinder Reſpiration, and make the Lamps burn dim, or go quite out. Whereby 'tis evident that they are exhaled by the Heat
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66371:70"/>
of the earth, and not attracted by that of the Sun and Stars, which penetrate but a very little way into the earth. Now as our bodies are inwardly hotter in Winter; ſo this heat of the earth being concentred in it ſelf, (as appears by Springs which ſmoke in that ſeaſon, and by the heat of ſubterraneous places) raiſes greater plenty of warm Vapors, which in Winte render the Weather moiſt and rainy: but when rain or the coldneſs of the air ſtops thoſe pores, then thoſe Exhalations being ſhut up, the Air remains cold, and it freezes; which froſt is again diſſolv'd by their eruption. For the natural heat of the Earth, being conſtring'd and render'd ſtronger by the ambient Cold, drives out hotter and more copious exhalations, which conſiſt either of the rain-water wherewith it is moiſtned, or of other humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; and which arriving at the ſurface of the Earth which is frozen, ſoften it and fill the air with clouds, which always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a Thaw, as Serenity do's a Froſt.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That as Hail is nothing but Rain congeal'd, ſo Froſt is nothing but Dew condens'd by the vehemence of Cold, and in the Water 'tis call'd Ice: which coldneſs conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Water, (which is a diaphanous body, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath an internal and radical light) is the cauſe of its white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the beginning of light, as the Stars are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd parts of their Orbs. Unleſs you had rather aſcribe that whiteneſs to the Air included in the Ice, which alſo makes the ſame ſwim upon the water. An Evidence that Cold alone is not the cauſe of Freezing; (for Cold alone render bodies more ponderous by condenſing their parts, whence Ice ſhould be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier then Water) but there is requir'd, beſides, ſome hot and dry exhalation, which inſinuating into the Water, gives it levity.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, That ſuch bodies as are frozen, are ſo far from receiving augmentation of parts, that they loſe the thinneſt of their own; hence a bottle ſo cloſe ſtopped that the air can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get in to ſupply the place of the thinner parts which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and periſh upon freezing, breaks in pieces for avoiding of vacuity. And Wine and Fruits loſe their taſt upon the loſs of their ſpirits, when they are frozen: which ſpirits not being able to tranſpire in Cabbages and other Viſcous Plants digeſt their crudities, and by that means render the ſame Plants more tender.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXVI. Of the Cauſes of the Small Pox.</head>
            <p>THe variety wherewith this Malady afflicts, or that which it cauſes in the body, hath given it the name of <hi>Variolae</hi> (Variolles or Vairolles) as its reſemblance to the bliſters, and to the manner wherewith the Venereous Diſeaſe invades the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (to whom the ſame is Epidemical, being cauſed by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the air) cauſes it to be called the Small Pox. Theſe are effloreſcences or puſtules appearing upon the body, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of Children by reaſon of the ſoftneſs of their ſkin, with a Feaver, pain, ſcabbineſs, and purulent matter. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady comprizes three ſorts of Diſeaſes; Namely, Intemperature, in its feaver and inflammation; Bad conformation, in the little Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies; and ſolution of continuity, in the Ulcers. Its prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigns are commonly, hoarſneſs of the voice, pain of the head, inflammation of the whole face, yawnings, diſtentions, trembling of the whole body, ſneezings, and ſtitches. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, eſſential, and pathognomonical ſigns are, Deliration, frightful Dreams, pains of the Breaſt and Throat, difficulty of Reſpiration, and a Continual Feaver, which is ſometimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid, ſometimes not. All which ſigns proceed from the violent ebulition and agitation of the humours, the conjunct cauſe of this Malady an effect of the natural heat; which being irritated by their Malignity, drives them outwards to the ſurface where they raiſe thoſe little Tumours; which, if red and leſs high, make the Meazles; and when more eminent, the Small Pox: the Pimples whereof at firſt appear very ſmall, afterwards in time wax red, and grow bigger from day to day till they become white; then they ſuppurate and dry, and laſtly, falling off com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly leave marks behind them, not to be got away, becauſe they have conſumed the ſkin which is never generated anew.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, A common effect muſt have a common cauſe. Now the Small Pox and Meazles (which differ only, in that the former is produc'd of thinner, and the latter of thicker blood) are diſeaſes not only common to many; but ſo few eſcape them that a general rule here ſcarce admits any exceptions. Two Cauſes there are, the Material, or the Efficient. The former is the impurity of the Menſtrual blood which ſerves for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>foetus</hi> in the womb; where at firſt it attracts the pureſt and ſweeteſt blood, but when grown bigger the groſs together with the thin. So that as Horſes once in their lives caſt the Strangles, ſo men muſt alſo once purge and void that menſtrual impurity, which being equally diſpers'd over all the body and in ſmall quantity, hinders not its functions. The efficient Cauſe, common likewiſe to all men, is the Natural Heat, which drives theſe impurities outwards, and ſo they come to appear upon the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66371:71"/>
ſkin, (which is the Univerſal Emunctory of the whole body) but eſpecially upon the face by reaſon of its tenderneſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being the place where all the Organs of Senſe terminate, 'tis fuller of ſpirits then any other, and conſequently there is a greater attraction thither of thoſe malignant Vapors. Now that it ſeizes ſome in their childhood, others in their youth, ſome very few in old age, and all after a different manner; this depends upon our particular Conſtitutions, either natural or acquiſititious by cuſtom, and a long uſe of the things not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. For, according as the humours reign in the body, they give occaſion to the eruption of that Venemous quality which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay hid; as Madneſs and Leproſie ſometimes appear not till after divers years. Our diet alſo contributes thereunto; for when it ſymboliſeth with that malignant humour, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the quantity thereof; as on the contrary, it corrects the ſame, and retards its motion, if it be of a laudable temper, or exceed in contrary qualities.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, What Original Sin is to the ſtate of the Soul, that the Small Pox ſeems to be to the ſtate of the Body; for this Diſeaſe commonly invades children, who never committed any fault in their courſe of living, and whoſe nature ſhould be ſo much healthier by how much 'tis more vigorous and nearer the principles of their Nativity; wherefore it ſeems rather to proceed from the vitioſity of the Parents. And as many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary diſeaſes come from the bad diſpoſition of the ſeed; ſo from the impurity of the blood (the material principle of our bodies) ſome may alſo ariſe; as Tettars, Kibes, Corns, and other deformities of the ſkin, which happen to children, very like this. Moreover, this diſeaſe uſually breaks forth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and ninth, which are the firſt climacterical years; when Nature endeavours the perfection of her work by purging and cleanſing it of all impurities. And as New Wine, when it comes to work, caſts forth all the heterogeneous impurities in it's body; ſo doth the natural heat attempt the like by cauſing an ebullition of the blood and ſpirits: whether this Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happens by the univerſal ſpirit of the world, as thoſe in other natural bodies; or whether (as 'tis moſt probable) it proceeds from the very ſtrength of nature, whoſe motions, although regular and certain, are yet unknown to any other beſides it ſelf, which produces them according to the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Subject wherein it reſides.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That being our bodies were always form'd of the maternal blood, and indu'd with one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, (which two are held the material and efficient cauſes of the Small Pox) this Diſeaſe ſhould have been in all times and places; and yet it was unknown before the <hi>Arabians,</hi> in whoſe time it began to appear. For the little red round puſtules, and thoſe other like flea-bitings, mention'd by <hi>Hippocrates, Aetius,</hi> and ſome other Ancients, are nothing leſs then the Small Pox;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66371:71"/>
to which not only Women during their Suppreſſions, but even brute Beaſts, which have alſo their purgations, (as among others, the Bitch, the Mare, and the Shee-Aſs) ought to be ſubject. On the contrary, ſuch as have burning Feavers ſhould be free from it; if it be true, that the ſeed and leven of this malady is diſſipated by the ebullition of the blood, which is vehement in a Feaver. But 'tis impoſſible to conceive, how a venemous and pernicious matter, (as that impure part of the blood is ſaid to be) can be preſerv'd for many years in its Maſs; for being the blood ſerves for continual aliment to all the parts, theſe ought to reſent ſomething of that malignity; yet thoſe that are taken with this diſeaſe are uſually the moſt healthy, and of a ſanguine conſtitution, which is the moſt laudable. For this were to accuſe Nature either of Imprudence or Weakneſs; but ſhe is good, wiſe, powerful, and ſolicitous for nothing ſo much as to purifie the body, which ſhe doth not only while the child is in the Womb, where ſhe wraps it up in two membranes, which receive the Urine, Sweat, and other Excrements of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification (as the Inteſtines do the groſſer excrements) but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as it is born, ſhe expells its immundicities by bliſters, ſcurfs, ſcabs, tumors of the head and other purgations, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, preſerve from diſeaſes, eſpecially from the falling ſickneſs. Nor can the Malignity of the Air be the Cauſe, as <hi>Fernelius</hi> holds, alledging that the difficulty of reſpiration, heavineſs of the head, inflammation of the face, and ſuch other concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſymptoms, ſeem to be caus'd by the viciouſneſs of the air, which infects the heart, and by that means hurts the other Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For then the Small Pox would be as Epidemical as the Peſtilence, or any other contagious maladies, and ſeize upon all men indifferently, not excepting ſuch as have once had them. Wherefore the matter of this diſeaſe is a ſeroſity accompanied with the humours, which make the Pox appear of ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, ſometimes Red, Yellow, Black, or White, according as the Blood, Choler, Melancholy, or Flegm flow thither; Wind or Water only cauſe bladders or bliſters. Nevertheleſs it muſt be confeſſed that this ſeroſity acquires ſome particular maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as appears by the deformity cauſed by the puſtules, which not only pit the ſkin and fleſh, but ſometimes even corrode and rot the bones.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the Small Pox is a new and hereditary diſeaſe, and that as all other new maladies of theſe laſt ages, have always had their cauſes, but only wanted fitting diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (without which nothing is produced) ſo the cauſes of the Small Pox have always been exiſtent, but the particular diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of bodies not lighting upon the point requiſite for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, it hath not appeared till theſe late times; whether through the influence of Heaven, or through the Malignity of the Air, or the intemperance of men (the moſt apparent cauſe of moſt diſeaſes formerly unknown) or elſe through contagion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66371:72"/>
and contact, by which way the great Pox is communicated. For the Small is likewiſe contagious, and (which is remarkable) more amongſt Kindred than Strangers; becauſe they, being iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſame blood, have greater affinity of diſpoſitions than Strangers.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXVII. Whether we profit beſt by Precepts or Examples.</head>
            <p>AS there is nothing ſo hard as to judg of the worth of things, ſo it is the higheſt point of prudence to underſtand the goodneſs of the means that may conduce to ſome end. Precepts and Examples are the two Means to attain Vertue; 'tis demanded which is the beſt and moſt proper. At firſt view, Example ſeems to have the ſame advantage over Precept that the Whole hath over the Part; for a Good Example, beſides being of its own nature a vertuous action holds the place of a Moral Rule; but a Precept is only a General Maxim, not neceſſarily follow'd by a particular Action: whence it follows, that Precept regards on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Underſtanding, whereto it affords ſome light; but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample makes impreſſion upon both Faculties together, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and the Will, by an order neceſſary in civil life, which is regulated by the example of others. Therefore Great Perſons are oblig'd to good Example, which derives its dignity from that of the giver. Moreover, Moral Propoſitions are ſo reaſonable and conformable to the inſtinct we have of good, that all the World aſſents to them as conſider'd in the General. There is no body but acknowledges, that, what belongs to each man ought to be render'd to him; that, we ought not to do that to another which we would not have done to our ſelves: yet in the circumſtances and particular caſes we do not always apply thoſe precepts, becauſe then they appear clog'd with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, to which our paſſion or intereſt give birth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Example, beng Particular, is more conſiderable in Morality, wherein people are govern'd more by opinion then reaſon; but Precept is Univerſal, and affects the mind only at a diſtance, our actions being oftentimes contrary to the ſecret dictates of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. In Example we feel the force and application of a precept in a particular ſubject, and know not only that which ought to be done but how it ought to be done by ſeeing it pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd. Experience it ſelf ſhew us, that Doctrine alone is weak and little perſwaſive, unleſs it be animated by the examples of a good life, whoſe ſilence is more eloquent than all precepts. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we are like thoſe with whom we live, and the maladies of the body are not ſo contagious as thoſe of the mind: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding may as well profit by bad examples; as good, the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66371:72"/>
Underſtanding being able to turn bad food into good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And as a brave Action excites good Motions in us by its beauty, reſulting from its conformity to Reaſon; ſo a bad Action, by its deformity and contrariety to Reaſon, gives us averſion againſt it, and an inclination to its oppoſite. <hi>Socrates</hi> judg'd no Leſſon ſo fit to moderate Anger, as for a Man to behold himſelf in a glaſs when he is agitated with that Paſſion. Which cannot be ſaid of a bad Precept; for this being a bad ſeed, can never produce any fruit but of the ſame Nature. On the other ſide, Men are ſuch Lovers of Pleaſures, that Virtue ſeparated from Delight, ſtumbles them, and ſeemes too ſevere: But Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is a pure Rule of Duty, without any attractive; whereas Example, which appears to our Eyes, and is an Action cloth'd with circumſtances, perſwades us more ſweetly, becauſe we are naturally prone to Imitation; whence it comes to paſs that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are ſo charming: And Example is the ſubject: of Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Precept cannot be ſo; for it is general of it ſelf, and all Moral Actions are ſingular.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid. That if it be true, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſay, that Virtue is nothing elſe but a Science, then Precepts muſt be the foundations, as of Science, ſo alſo of Virtute; which indeed being a habit of a reaſonable Faculty, muſt be more promoted by Precepts, (which are infallible verities, and ſupply light to that Power) than Examples which have no force to convince a ſtrong Mind. They who follow Virtue by Example, and not by Reaſon, have more of the Ape than of the Man; and all the power Example hath, is onely to move the Will to admire and deſire Virtue, but not to teach the way of attaining it, as Precept doth; which, beſides being invariable, and always alike to its ſelf, is more eaſie to be applyed than Example, which puts on a new face, according to the circumſtances of times, places, and perſons; there being no Actions, how, contrary ſoever, but have Examples to countenance their goodneſs. Moreover, they are either of the time paſt, and ſo move us not much; or of the preſent, in which there are few of Virtue; beſides that, they are of leſs duration than Precepts, which are eternal. If vicious Examples attract more powerfully to Vice than vicious Precepts, the ſame cannot be ſaid of the practice of Virtues; ſince theſe have not all the External Senſeſ of their party, as Vices have.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That ſenſible and palpable things, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are, have more power upon us than bare words, which cannot ſo well perſwade a Truth, but that they alwayes leave ſome doubting in us; whereas Examples being ſenſible, give us a more entire and perfect Knowledge: yea, they have influence even upon brute beaſts, who learn not by Precepts but by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which is an evidence of their certainty; for a thing is the more certain, the more common it is to us with more. Hence <hi>Plato</hi> affirmes, That Examples are neceſſary to perſwade high and lofty matters. Precepts, indeed, diſpoſe, but Examples
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66371:73"/>
animate the Soul to Virtue; thoſe admoniſh, theſe ſtimulate and guide, as in the reſolution of doing well: Inſtructions ſhew the way, but Examples drive us with the point of Honour, and the force of Emulation. Nor do Precepts include Examples, but the contrary; and every Example comprehends a Document. When we ſee a Good Man ſquare his Life out to his Duty, we find I know not what ſatisfaction and contentment in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his Virtue, and this pleaſure makes us conceive, yea, ſtrongly perſwades us, that all Virtues are amiable. Even Vicious Examples ſometimes make Vice appear to us ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that we deteſt inſtead of purſuing it. Hence the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> ſetting aſide the Precepts of Temperature, were wont to make their Slaves drunk, that the ill-favour'd ſpectacle might make their Children abhor that Vice. Laſtly, Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, whoſe Life was a continued Example of Virtue, did more Works to teach us, then he gave Words and Precepts, moſt of which are comprehended under Examples and Parables: Yea, the Devil, well knowing that <hi>Adam</hi>'s mind was too ſtrong to be prevail'd upon by Reaſons, firſt gain'd that of his Wife, which was more weak, that he might allure him to ſin by her Example.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, The end is not onely more noble, but alſo more effectual than the means; for 'tis to that alone that they aim and terminate. Now the end of all Examples, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Precepts from them; which Precepts, are general Notions grounded upon many Experiences or Examples, either of others, or our own; but theſe being wholly particular, can have no power upon the Underſtanding, which frames its concluſions onely upon things univerſally true, as Maximes and Precepts are, and that more than Examples; for theſe are never perfect, but full of a thouſand defects, thoſe ſure and infallible. Moreover, Precepts move the Underſtanding, which is the nobleſt of all the Faculties; whereas Examples make impreſſion onely upon the outward ſenſes and dull wits.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That as the Sight and the Hearing know how to put a difference between Colours and Sounds, without Learning; and all the Faculties can naturally diſcern their own Objects: So the Underſtanding knows naturally the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and clearly beholds thoſe firſt Verities: The Will hath alſo in it ſelf the Principles and Seeds of Virtues, (as the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſis, and remorſe of Conſcience in the moſt wicked, ſufficiently prove) and is of it ſelf carryed to Virtuous Actions, without needing either Preecepts or Examples, equally unprofitable to the bad, who amend not thereby; and to the good, who want them not.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That the Queſtion is to be decided by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the Minds of Men. Thoſe that excel in Judgement attribute more to Reaſon than to Examples, which being more ſenſible, affect the Imagination of duller heads, who are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66371:73"/>
of Reaſons. So that though Precepts and Arguments be without compariſon more perfect than Examples; yet becauſe very few are capable of them, (becauſe the generality of the World is ſtupid and dull) therefore they are not generally ſo proper to teach as Examples; which nevertheleſs being of no power, but ſerving onely to clear an obſcure Truth, ought not to have any aſcendant over a Mind that is reaſonable and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Knowledge.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXVIII. Of <hi>Incubi</hi> and <hi>Succubae</hi>; and whether Devils can generate.</head>
            <p>TWo ſorts of people err in this matter; the ſuperſtitious, and ignorant vulgar, who attribute every thing to Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and account the ſame done either by Saints or Devils; and the Atheiſts and Libertines, who believe neither the one nor the other. Phyſitians take the middle way, diſtinguiſhing what is fit to be attributed to Nature, and her ordinary motions, from what is ſupernatural; to which laſt Head, 'tis not reaſonable to referr diſeaſes and indiſpoſitions, as the <hi>Incubus</hi> is, call'd by the Greeks, <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> and by the vulgar, the <hi>Night-mare.</hi> 'Tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, An impediment of Reſpiration, Speech, and Motion, with oppreſſion of the Body, whereby we feel in our ſleep as 'twere ſome weight upon the Stomack. The Cauſe of it is a groſs Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, obſtructing principally the hinder part of the Brain, and hindring the egreſs of the Animal Spirits deſtinated to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts; which Vapor is more eaſily diſſipable than the humor which cauſeth the Lethargy, Apoplexy, and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which are therefore of longer duration than this, which ceaſes as ſoon as the ſaid Vapor is diſſipated. Now whereas the Paſſions of the Mind and Body commonly ſupply the matter of Dreams; (as thoſe that are hungry or amorous, will think they eat or ſee what, they love; thoſe that have pain in ſome part, dream that ſome body hurts the ſame) hence when Reſpiration, (the moſt neceſſary of all the animal functions) is impeded, we preſently imagine we have a load lying on our Breaſts, and hindring the dilatation of the ſame. And becauſe the Brain is employ'd in the <hi>Incubus</hi> therefore all the animal functions are hurt; the Imagination deprav'd, the Senſation obtunded, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impeded. Hence thoſe whom this evil ſeizes, endeavor to awake, but can neither move nor ſpeak, till after a good while. And though the Cauſe of this diſorder be within our ſelves, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the diſtemper'd perſon believes that ſome body is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to ſtrangle him by outward violence, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Imagination rather thinks upon than Internal Cauſes;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66371:74"/>
that being more ſenſible and common. This has given occaſion to the error of the Vulgar, who charge theſe Effects upon Evil Spirits, inſtead of imputing them to the Malignity of a Vapor, or ſome phlegmatick and groſs humor oppreſſing the Stomack; the coldneſs and weakneſs whereof, ariſing from want of Spirits and Heat, which keeps all the parts in due order, are the moſt manifeſt Cauſes. Much unlikely it is to be cauſed by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being an Effect of the Natural Faculty, as this of the Vegetative Soul, cannot belong to the Devil, who is a pure Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, As 'tis too groſs to recurr to ſupernatural Cauſes, when Natural are evident; ſo 'tis too ſenſual to ſeek the Reaſon of every thing in Nature, and to aſcribe to meer Phlegm and the diſtempered Phant'ſie, the Coitions of Daemons with Men; which we cannot deny without giving the lye to infinite of perſons of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions, to whom the ſame have happened; nor without accuſing the Sentences of Judicial Courts which have condemned them. For to omit the Births of <hi>Hercules, Aemas, Alexander, Servius Tullus,</hi> and many other Heroes begotten by the falſe gods of Antiquity, who were no other than Devils, as were alſo the Fauni, Satyrs, and the chief of them <hi>Pan,</hi> the prime of the <hi>Incubi,</hi> called by the Hebrews <hi>Haza,</hi> as the chief of the <hi>Succubae</hi> was termed <hi>Libith</hi>: And to ſay nothing of the Giants mentioned in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> who according to ſome Fathers were begotten by Angels; <hi>England</hi> hath had its <hi>Merlin</hi> a great Magician<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> begotten by an <hi>Incubus; Poitou,</hi> Counts begotten of a <hi>Succuba,</hi> half Woman and half Serpent, called <hi>Melluſine; Poland,</hi> Princes of the Race of the <hi>Jagelloes,</hi> iſſued from another in form of a Bear; <hi>Hungary,</hi> intire Nations called <hi>Huns,</hi> born of the <hi>Arlunes,</hi> Gothick Witches, and <hi>Fauni.</hi> Even at this day, in the Iſland <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> by the Relation of <hi>Chieza,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Peru,</hi> a Daemon, call'd by the Inhabitants <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cota,</hi> hath to do with the Women, and the Children proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſuch Conjunction have horns; as alſo among the <hi>Turks,</hi> thoſe people whom they call <hi>Nepheſolians,</hi> are believed to be generated by the operation of Daemons; whether they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſome humane ſeed which they tranſport almoſt in an inſtant, and ſo preſerve its Spirits from evaporation; or whether it be by their proper Virtue; ſince whatever is naturally producible, as ſeed is, may be produced by Devils. For in the order of things natural, the ſuperior and more noble contain eminently, and in a more perfect, degree, the powers of the inferior and leſs perfect. Yea, though they were not able to make true ſeed, it follows not that they cannot produce a perfect Creature; for Nature, of which the Devils have compleat Knowledge, may have divers wayes to compaſs the ſame end. But as the Devil performs the natural actions of Animals by means ſupernatural; as he ſees without Eyes, moves Bodies without Contact, tranſports him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from one place to another, without commenſuration of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66371:74"/>
intermediate ſpace, becauſe he hath no quantity; ſo he may make a perfect Animal without obſerving the conditions of ordinary Agents. Moreover, Nature her ſelf ſhews us ſtrange transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as of a Womans hair buried in a dung-hill into Serpents; and of leavs falling into the water, into Ducks; wherefore there is no doubt, but he who hath perfect Knowledge of all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, can by Application of Agents to Patients produce perfect Animals.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Devil being a Spirit of uncleanneſs delights not only to combat the Purity of Mankind by his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but will have a hand in the ſin too. When he hath to do with a Woman, he is called <hi>Incubus</hi>; when with a Man, <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuba.</hi> As for this latter, 'tis certain it cannot generate in its ſelf, for want of place fit to receive the Seed and to reduce it from power into act, as alſo of Blood wherewith to nouriſh the <hi>Foetus</hi> during nine moneths. 'Tis harder to reſolve, whether an <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> can generate in another. All agree that the Devil by Gods permiſſion (without which he can do nothing) hath power to move all Bodies from one place to another; and can by that means form a Body of Air, or ſome other groſs matter; or for want thereof, take a Body lately dead, animate it with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious heat, and give ſuch motions as he pleaſes to all its parts. But becauſe Generation requires three things; Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sex, Copulation of Male and Female, and emiſſion of ſome prolifick matter containing in its ſelf a vertue to form all the parts from whence it iſſued; the Devil may indeed make the two firſt conditions meet, but never the latter, namely a fit and convenient ſeed, indued with ſpirits and vital heat, without which it is unfruitful and barren. For he hath no ſuch ſeed of his own, becauſe it is the reſult of the laſt concoction, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made but in a body actually alive, as that which he hath is ſuppoſed not to be; nor can he borrow ſuch ſeed elſewhere, becauſe it becomes unfruitful when once ſhed out of the Veſſels of Nature by reaſon of the evaporation of its ſpirits.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, There is nothing ſupernatural in the <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>; for 'tis only a ſymptom of the Animal Faculty accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with three circumſtances, namely, Reſpiration hindred, Motion hurt, and a fanſie depraved. The firſt proceeds from a phlegmatick, raw, and cold matter, which coming to lye heavy in the bottom of the Stomack, pulls down the Diaphragm (whereto the Ventricle is annex'd by its upper part) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loaden and wanting its free Motion; Reſpiration, whereof it is the principal Organ, is conſequently hindred. As alſo it is by groſs fumes elevated from the Hypochondres and Meſaraical Veins; (which being the firſt ways of Food, abound with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities and groſs vapours) which coming to the hinder part of the Brain, obſtruct the commerce of the Spirits, dedicated to the motion of all the parts; but particularly that of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, by obſtructing the two couple of Nerves which iſſue
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66371:75"/>
out of the fourth and fifth Vertebrae, and communicate motion to it; juſt as, in ſleep, Senſation is ſtop'd by more tenuious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours poſſeſſing the forepart of the Brain, which is more ſoft. Hence ſuch as ſleep upon the back part of head are more ſubject to this Diſeaſe then thoſe that ſleep on one ſide. Laſtly, the voluptuous phanſie, which accompanies this accident, though very rarely, proceeds either from the abundance, or quality of the Seed; which ſending its Species into the phanſie, this Faculty frames to its ſelf a delightful object and ſtirs up the Motive Power, as this doth the Expulſive Faculty of the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Veſſels, which diſcharge that excrementitious matter, whilſt the laſcivious Imagination fancies to it ſelf the conjunction of unclean Spirits.</p>

         <div n="129" type="conference">
            <head>CONFERENCE CXXIX. Which Animal is happieſt, according to Nature.</head>
            <p>WHereas a man cannot ſo well ſpeak of others as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it were to be wiſhed that every thing, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally capable of felicity, came hither to give its ſuffrage. I believe the Birds would not be the laſt to teſtifie to us by their ſinging and agreeable warbling, the moſt certain indication of joy and contentment; as cries are of the contrary, grief and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Indeed, if there be any pleaſure in the World, I think Birds have it; for they go not only to ſeek their food in the bottom of the water, as Water-fowl do (to whom that Element is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with Fiſhes); they have not only the ſame ſhare in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the land with four-footed Animals, and both together with amphibious creatures; but moreover they fly in the Air, approaching Heaven nearer then we can, and cleaving that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an innocent pleaſure not to be underſtood but by the action it ſelf; whence Angels are painted with wings. And as of all Animals the moſt imperfect and leaſt capable of felicity are the Reptile, ſuch as Earth-worms, little differing from this very Element; ſo thoſe are the happieſt which remove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves furtheſt from it, as Birds do. Amongſt which I ſhall leave it to the Voluptuous to ſay, whether it be the Cock, the Sparrow, or the amorous Dove; thoſe that love Muſick, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether 'tis the Nightingal, and to thoſe that eſteem the ſight the moſt raviſhing of all the Senſes, whether it be the Eagle, whoſe eye diſcovers the remoteſt objects and turns not aſide even from the beams of the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That ſince nothing is intirely happy in the World, the Queſtion ſhould rather be put, Which is the leaſt unhappy of all Animals. Man, the only competent judge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges 'tis not himſelf, for he ſeems to be the Butt of all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66371:75"/>
the miſeries in the World; of which alſo he is ſo much more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible then Beaſts by how much he hath a mind more qualified to apprehend and reſent them. For whereas they ſay, he alone is capable of felicity; 'tis true indeed in reference to the future not the preſent life, no age whereof is capable of reliſhing an intire contentment: and if one drop of Gall mingled with a good quantity of Milk denominates the ſame bitter, certainly we cannot term mans life pleaſant whilſt it hath abundantly more pain then delight. He comes into the World weeping, and naked without any Arms or defence; wherein he is more unhappy then Beaſts whom nature hath guarded with cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures againſt the injuries of the air. His firſt Child-hood is not yet capable of any ſort of pleaſure. Adoleſcence would taſte thereof indeed, but is denied liberty by its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogues. Youth precipitates it ſelf into more kind of evils then it taſtes of good: beſides that, it ſees moſt pleaſures for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Divines, Phyſicians, and Civilians, who ſeem to have endeavoured to take from us all contentment in this World; which if old age makes us the leſs loth to part with, yet there is no ſo great reſignation of ſpirit but is thwarted by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the fleſh, nor ſecurity ſo carnal but is ſtartled with the records of conſcience. Moreover, the true mark of felicity being the ſatisfaction and contentment of him that poſſeſſes it, no perſon can be happy in this world ſince none is contented. For man being deſign'd to a more perfect life then this, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires the Supream Good, and all that is below it diſpleaſes him, as uncapable to ſatisfie him; and becauſe he cannot find it here, therefore neither can he find contentment, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſatisfying the Appetite. Beaſts, on the contrary, having no other knowledg but that of Senſual and Delectable Good, deſire no other, but are fully ſatisfi'd and contented therewith, and conſequently more happy in this World then men.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If Felicity conſiſt in action, that Animal muſt be moſt happy which acts moſt perfectly. So doth man, whether you conſider him as to the Body or the Soul. For to ſay nothing of the divine functions of his Underſtanding and Will; the ſole ſtructure of his Body, which was made erect that he might behold Heaven (whereof he is capable) and which alone is indu'd with beauty, one of the effects of Health, ſufficiently proves it: For though ſome Animals poſſibly ſurpaſs him in ſome one ſenſe, yet he alone excells equally in all, and knows the differences of colours, ſounds, odours, ſapours, and tactile qualities, in the participation of which he finds pleaſure whereof beaſts are incapable.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That to believe Man can be happy here, is to contradict the opinion of all the Sages of Antiquity, who have acknowledg'd Man the weakeſt and pitifulleſt of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and the Scripture it ſelf, which terms his life full of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and this World his baniſhment. And indeed if we place
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66371:76"/>
Felicity in the knowledg of poſſeſſing it, Miſery muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the knowledg or opinion we have of being miſerable; of which reflection Man alone being capable, he muſt be alſo more too of unhappineſs then felicity; and the more, inaſmuch as there are more things that can afflict then content him; ſome always bringing preſent inconvenience with them, others leaving ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be deſir'd after them, and never ſatiating our Appetite. For the Reaſonable Soul, which is held the ſubject of Mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is the principal obſtacle to attaining it: ſince having for its object a more perfect and abſolute Good then it can poſſeſs in this life, it cannot eſtabliſh a true Felicity (which of its own nature muſt be as laſting as the Exiſtence of him who enjoys it) upon things acknowledg'd frail and periſhing, as Natural and Senſible goods are; which being ſutable to the duration and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of other Animals, their enjoyment thereof fills them with perfect happineſs. But amongſt theſe, Fiſhes ſeem to me moſt happy; whether you meaſure their happineſs by the largeneſs of their habitation which is the vaſt Ocean, of far greater extent then the Earth, from which being more ſevered then Birds, who are forced to deſcend thither for their food and reſt, they are alſo leſs ſubject to the ambuſhes of men, and in this regard more happy; or whether you conſider corporal health (the foundation of all felicity) of which Fiſhes are ſo well provided that it hath occaſion'd the Proverb, As ſound as a Fiſh; or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether you place felicity in the privation of pain, which reſides chiefly in the ſenſe of Touching; which being more dull in them then in other Animals, they are alſo leſs ſenſible of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; and for this reaſon were made mute by nature which hath given a voice to Animals chiefly to teſtifie thereby the grief which they reſent.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, If there be ſo great a number of opinions wherein the felicity of one ſingle Animal, Man, conſiſts; there may juſtly be great variety of judgments, concerning which is the happieſt of all Animals. To determine which, we muſt imitate Painters, who before they couch their Colours propoſe a perfect Idea of their work; which the nearer it approaches, the more excellent it is reputed. In like manner, we muſt firſt form an Idea of this felicity, and then ſee which Animal comes neareſt it; whether the Servant or the Maſter, the brute Beaſt or Man; whoſe mind, whereby he infinitely ſurpaſſes all the reſt of the Creatures, ſeems to be ingenious to its own loſs; not imploying it ſelf, but to find out reaſons to prove him unhappy: ſince in favour of other Animals we lay aſide that ambition which is ſo natural to us, and are willing to yield to the vileſt of them, what we would diſpute with the moſt perfect of men. Now that which makes moſt people miſtaken in their judgment, is, that being no perſon injoys an intire felicity, they imagine that all happineſs lyes in that thing which is wanting, and ſo eſteem him alone happy that poſſeſſes it. Thus a poor ſpirit
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66371:76"/>
perſwaded that all happineſs conſiſts in ſtrength and courage, will ſay that the Lyon is the happieſt of all Animals, ſince his courage gives him empire over all thoſe of his condition. The ſick perſon accounting health (the moſt deſirable of all goods, prefers Beaſts before Man, whom his exact tempers renders more obnoxious to external cauſes which produce diſeaſes. On the other ſide, if Animals are happy, 'tis as Fools are, whoſe minds are quiet, by reaſon of their ignorance and inſenſibility. But as it is better to be ſenſible then inſenſible even upon the condition of enduring pain ſometimes; ſo it is more happy to have a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal mind, though it cauſes troubles to us ſometimes, then to have none. Moreover we cannot avoid the ſtroaks of fortune, otherwiſe then thoſe of Thunder, namely by being very high or very low; but 'tis better to be above tempeſts then below them, and to be incapable of them by reaſon as a wiſe man, then by ſtupidity as a beaſt.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXX. Whether is better, that Men have many Wives, or Women many Husbands.</head>
            <p>THough plurality of Wives or Husbands be diſallowed by the Chriſtian Law, yet not being contrary to the Law of Nations (for many admit it), nor of nature (during which it was in uſe); we may be permitted to doubt whether, ſuppoſing Polygamy, it were better one Husband ſhould have many Wives, or one Wife many Husbands. There are examples of both. Plurality of Wives was practiſed by <hi>Lamech,</hi> who firſt had two; by <hi>Abraham, Jacob,</hi> and the Patriarchs, for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of their Lineage; afterwards by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> who had 700 Wives and 300 Concubins; and at preſent 'tis in uſe among the Turks who are permitted to have as many Wives as they can keep. As for plurality of Husbands, though it be not now in uſe, yet it was ſometimes amongſt the Amazons who made uſe of Men only as Stallions; as alſo amongſt the Medes and Perſians, where it was a ſhame for a Woman to have leſs then five Husbands. And by the report of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, the Women of great <hi>Britain</hi> had no leſs then ten or twelve Husbands a piece. Nevertheleſs this plurality of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands is ſomthing againſt the Law of Nature, according to which the Male as the moſt perfect is the head and maſter of the Woman: and as 'tis a monſtrous thing for a body to have many heads, ſo 'tis for a Woman to have many Husbands; beſides that they hinder production of Children; (for we ſee publick Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are barren) and on the contrary, plurality of Wives is the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66371:77"/>
cauſe of much iſſue. Wherefore 'tis more expedient in a State, whoſe chief ſtrength conſiſts in the number of men, that one Husband have many Wives, then one Wife many Husbands.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, Though men, abuſing the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Laws to their own advantage, have oftner married more Wives then they have permitted them to have more Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; yet the women have as much reaſon of complaint in this point, as in any other eſtabliſh'd to their prejudice, without their being heard or ſummon'd. Their vehement and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar appetite after man (of which the irregular motions of that <hi>Animal in Animali</hi> are moſt certain evidences) ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in their favour. For Woman alone of all Animals deſires the Male at all times, even after conception; She, the Fire, the Sea, and Death, never ſay 'tis enough; as the matter hath a continual appetite of Forms, ſo hath ſhe of the Male: which deſire being natural, ought to be ſatisfi'd; otherwiſe it were in vain: but nothing is ſo in Nature, and therefore ſhe ought to be permitted more Husbands; ſince one alone is more apt to irritate then ſatiate her. She is able and hath wherewith to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them; but if one man cannot ſuffice one woman, how can he acquit himſelf towards a dozen; Eſpecially in this age, wherein, no doubt, women would appeal from the conſtitution of <hi>Solon,</hi> who would have men live with their wives only thrice a moneth; as well as from that fooliſh cuſtom of <hi>Cato,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver viſited his but when it rain'd. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was much better advis'd, when he permitted old or otherwiſe impotent perſons to chuſe out the handſomeſt young men to lye with their wives. This Sage Legiſlator well judging that they would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves take this liberty; and therefore 'twas better to grant it them, that ſo they might be quit of the vice and blame attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this action when prohibited.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the deciſion of this Queſtion (the very report of which ſometimes put the <hi>Roman</hi> Dames into an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar) being of very great conſequence to both parties, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to obſerve ſo much equity therein, that the Women have no ground of exception; though, to ſpeak truth, I know not which would be moſt to their advantage, whether to have more Husbands (who would be ſo many Maſters and Tyrants) or to ſhare with other Women the Careſſes of one alone; the firſt being contrary to their haughty humour. and the ſecond to their jealouſie. Beſides, the plurality of Huſbands would hinder not only the propagation, but alſo the education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for none would take care of the Children which were not his own; and though they were, he would not believe they belong'd to him. It would be impoſſible for a Father to know his own Child; the term of Child-bearing being no more certain teſtimony, then the reſemblance of Phyſiognomy. Moreover, whether the Wife were hated or loved by her Husbands, ſhe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66371:77"/>
would be diſpleas'd to ſee all her Rivals in bad intelligence, or the effects of their common hatred: However, being unable to pleaſe all, by reaſon of the diverſity of their humours, ſhe could not avoid the diſguſt of ſome of them. As for that impure plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, 'tis too ſhameful to be brought into the account; beſides that the frequency of it would take away its ſweetneſs; no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of life being ſuch, but upon the ſcore of their rarity.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, They that fear the multitude of Husbands would hinder conception, and conſequently generation, by the confuſion of ſeveral Seeds, know not how either is effected; ſince Phyſitians affirm with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> That the Womb no ſooner receives the fruitful Seed, but it ſhuts it ſelf up to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſame ſtraitly (as the Stomach does the Meat) and that ſo exactly as not to admit a needles point; ſo that it cannot open again to receive new Seed in a ſecond Coition. And though ſuperfoetation happen ſometimes, yet 'tis very rare, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to a Woman that lies with the ſame Man ſeveral times, as well as to one that lies with many. The other Inconvenience, of the incertainty of Iſſues, and conſequently of Succeſſions, is as little conſiderable; for Man being not born for himſelf, but for the State whereof he is a Member; and Children leſs belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Parents then to the Commonwealth, whereof they are the Nurſery; 'twere more expedient that they were bred and inſtructed like thoſe brave <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> at the publick charge, than of their Parents, whoſe tenderneſs and too great indulgence is oft-times the cauſe of their evil education. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this was the deſign of that Divine Commonwealth of <hi>Plato,</hi> who would have not only other Goods, but Wives and Children alſo common; that ſo thoſe ungrateful words of <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> which are the cauſe of all Miſchiefs, might be taken away. For by this means that importunate ſolicitude of Appropriation and Jealouſie, which oftentimes afflicts both parties, would be no longer any thing but a phantaſm: Women would find their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the plurality of Husbands; theſe, how many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to one woman, having always enough and more then they needed; and the woman being cunning enough to divide her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſo that all her Huſbands might be contented; who, beſides dividing the burden of domeſtick cares, would have an eaſier taſk by having the more Aſſociates. But eſpecially 'twould be much for the womans intereſt; for if ſhe be belov'd by all her Husbands, 'twill be unſpeakable happineſs to her; if hated by any, the careſſes of ſome will make her amends for the bad uſage of others: whereas finding no remedy in that Gordian knot which tyes her to one perſon, ſhe abandons her ſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: inſomuch that in the time of <hi>Spurius Carvilius,</hi> ſeventy women accus'd one another to the Senate of having poyſon'd their Husbands. But if ſhe be conſtrain'd to ſhare the careſſes of one Husband with a douzen rivals, there will be nothing but perpetual feuds, envies, and jealouſies. Witneſs <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>;

who, though holy women, yet daily conteſted for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their common Husband <hi>Jacob.</hi> And the Scripture obſerves that <hi>Leah,</hi> who was blear-ey'd, was conſtrain'd to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the fair <hi>Rachel</hi> with mandrakes the liberty of lying one night with <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſaid, That ſeeing a Woman is a hagger'd and indocible animal, (Experience ſhewing us, that one ſingle man is not capable to reduce her to reaſon) 'twere more expedient to allow her many Husbands; the reverence and aw of whom (and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof, their force) might tame her pride and inſolence; which is riſen to the higheſt pitch, ſince the time that <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Wife got the Law of Divorce repeal'd, which ever before had been a Bridle upon them.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXI. Of the manner of Accretion.</head>
            <p>MOtion, which is the mutation from one ſtate to another, is either ſimple or compound: Simple is either of Quality, &amp; is term'd Alteration; or of Place, and is call'd Lation or Motion Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Compound is either to Subſtance, and is nam'd Generation, which includes alteration and formation; or to a greater Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which comprehends Local Motion with Accretion or Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, which cannot be made unleſs the parts extended change place. This Accretion is an effect of one of the Faculties ſubſervient to the Vegetative or Natural, which are three, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative, the Auctive or Accretive and the Nutritive; according to the three operations obſerv'd in living bodies which have parts generated, nouriſhing, and increaſing; for a thing muſt be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated before it can grow and acquire the perfection wherein it is maintain'd by Nutrition. The Generative Faculty, which is compounded of the Alterative and Formative, regards the <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in the womb. The Auctive governs it from its birth till the twentieth or one and twentieth year, which is the term of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. The Nutritive continues all the time of life, which cannot ſubſiſt without nouriſhment; becauſe this repairs the continual diſſipation of our ſubſtance caus'd by the action of heat upon humidity; in which action, Life it ſelf conſiſts. Now though the body may be nouriſht without growing, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grow unleſs it be nouriſht. For Accretion being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the parts in length and breadth, new ſubſtance muſt be ſupply'd to fill up the place of that which is extended: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a living body ſhould grow no more then a bladder doth when it is blown, or a piece of leather when it is ſtretcht; in the former, what is gotten in capacity, is loſt in thickneſs; and in the latter, what is gotten in length is impair'd in breadth: ſo that the augmentation of parts would be rather imaginary than
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66371:78"/>
real, without ſupply of new matter to ſucceed that which is equally extended in all its dimenſions: amongſt which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that of ſtature, and of the ſolid parts, (as the bones) is call'd Growth, and not that which is made in thickneſs and the fleſhy parts, which are enlarged manytimes after the time of full growth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That all things being finite, muſt have bounds of magnitude ſutable to the uſe whereunto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; which bounds are not determinate in inanimate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as Stones, Metals, Hair, and Nails; whoſe accretion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by the bare appoſition of matter, they are augmented continually, ſo long as there is acceſſion of new matter to the former. But in living bodies the ſame are regular; for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of theſe being internal, and the work of the ſoul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till the body hath attain'd the proportion and ſtature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to its functions. To compaſs which, Nature employs Heat as the Efficient Cauſe, and Humidity as the Material. Hence children grow moſt in their infancy, becauſe they are then moſt moiſt; and men to a larger ſize then women, becauſe they have more heat. Young men indeed have a more pungent and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heat then Children, but theſe are better ſtor'd; (as being nearer the principles of their generation); and though it be not ſo active, yet 'tis more proper for the growth of the ſolid parts, which being deſiccated by a violent heat are not ſo extenſible as when they are full of a fat and unctuous humidity. But as for the manner of Accretion, 'tis almoſt the ſame with that of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition: The Aliment having been prepar'd in the Stomach and Liver, and by this latter tranſmitted by the veins into all the parts of the body, the purer particles of it, ſweat through the coats of the Veſſels, and fall like a gentle dew upon the parts, which firſt imbibe, then agglutinate, and laſtly, aſſimilate the ſame. So that Nutrition is nothing but Aſſimilation of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the food to that of the living body; and as Aliments nouriſh by reſemblance of their Subſtance, and by vertue of their Form, ſo they cauſe augmentation by their Quantity, and Matter, which arriving at the ſolid parts, as the Bones, Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and Ligaments, cauſes the ſame to extend and grow in all dimenſions; but eſpecially in height, by reaſon that 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Heat to drive Humidity upwards. And as when the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is equal to the Diſſipation, the body is only nouriſht (as in the Age of Conſiſtence) ſo when the Income of matter is greater than the Expence, the ſurpluſage meeting with a due heat cauſeth augmentation; if it be leſs, there follows waſting or diminution, as is ſeen Old-Age.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, As Animals are indu'd with a nobler degree of life than Plants, ſo they vegetate after a more ſublime manner, and not only by bare heat and moiſture. For amongſt Animals, the Elephant a melancholy, and conſequently, cold and dry beaſt, is yet the greateſt of the field; the Crocodile, though cold,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66371:79"/>
grows all its life; and ſome Serpents have by long age attained to the length of ſixty foot. So amongſt Trees, Oaks, though the dryeſt, are the largeſt. Of Bones, the <hi>Malleus, Incus,</hi> and <hi>Stapes</hi> in the Ear, which ſerve to reproduce ſounds, grow not at all, though they be full of mucoſity and humidity: on the contrary, the Teeth, the dryeſt of all parts (as is manifeſted by their rotting laſt) yet grow all the life long. But if Heat and Moiſture were the cauſes of Accretion, then the Sanguine, who are hot and moiſt, ſhould be of the largeſt ſize, as they are not, but commonly grow as well as the Flegmatick more in thickneſs than height, augmenting their fleſh and fat more then their ſolid parts. On the contrary, the talleſt men are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold, dry, and lean, the loweſt, generally hotter; and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grow upon recovery after fevers which dry the body. Wherefore 'tis more probable that the Growth of Animals is an effect of the Spirits, which inſinuating into the Veſſels extend the ſame, and withall the membranes, muſcles, and other parts encompaſſing them proportionably.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Spirits are indeed the Soul's Organs and Inſtruments whereby ſhe performs her functions; but being of ſo volatile and fluid a nature, as not to be reckon'd in the number of the parts of Man's Body, they cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cauſe Accretion, which requires Appoſition of new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which inſinuates it ſelf equally into all the parts juſt as the nouriſhment doth; both without penetration of dimenſions, or admiſſion of vacuity. This matter muſt be humid, becauſe, of all Bodies; the moiſt are moſt pliant and extenſible: Whence the Sea by reaſon of its humidity, produces Monſters of ſtrange bulk. Yet this humidity, as well as the heat muſt be in due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for a great heat conſumes inſtead of increaſing; whence the Males of Birds of prey are leſſer than the Females, becauſe they are hotter; but if it be too weak, then the moiſture, inſtead of aſcending, falls downward by its proper gravity; which is the cauſe that Women, who have leſs heat, are alſo of leſſer ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than Men, and larger downwards as Men are upwards. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various marriage of this heat with moiſture, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies grow variouſly; ſome more ſlowly; others, more ſpeedily; ſome are little and dwarfiſh; others, Giants; according to the defect or abundance of the matter ſerving to their firſt Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as for the reſt of Man-kind, Wiſe Nature hath ſet her ſelf ſuch bounds as ſhe hath judg'd convenient, beyond which the moſt part grow not; which are between ſix and ſeven foot: Not the Accretive Faculty is then loſt or corrupted, (for 'tis that power of the Soul, and conſequently, incorruptible and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, from her) but it cannot act longer for want of fitting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, to wit, the ſoftneſs and moiſtneſs of the ſolid parts. As a Mule hath a Senſitive Soul, but not the virtue of generating, which is one of the Faculties of that Soul; and a Load-ſtone rub'd with Garlick, hath ſtill the virtue of attracting Iron, but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66371:79"/>
cannot employ the ſame, by reaſon that its Pores are ſtopt, no more then the Eye can ſee in a Suffuſion.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXII. Whether the Dinner or Supper ought to be largeſt.</head>
            <p>DIet, or the Regiment of Living, (which is the firſt and moſt general part of Phyſick, becauſe it concerns both the healthy and the ſick) conſiſts in regulating the quantity and quality of Aliments, and the order and time wherein they are to be taken. The Quantity muſt be proportional to the nature of the Perſon, ſo that his ſtrength may be repair'd and not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd thereby. As for the Quality, they muſt be of good juice, and as pleaſing and agreeable as may be. The Order of taking them is to be this; ſuch as are moiſt, ſoft, laxative, and of ſooneſt Digeſtion or Corruption, muſt precede ſuch as are dry, hard, aſtringent, and of more difficult Concoction. The Time, in general, ought to be ſo regulated that the interval of Meals be ſufficient for digeſting the nouriſhment laſt fore-going. The Cuſtom of moſt Nations hath made two, Dinner, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; Break-faſt, and Afternoon-collations, being but Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or parts of them two, and the over-plus of notorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. Now if we compare Dinner and Supper together, it ſeemes requiſite that the latter be more plentiful, becauſe the Time enſuing, it is moſt proper for Digeſtion, in regard of the intro-receſſion of the natural heat during ſleep, which becoming by that means more united and vigorous, performes the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral functions, to wit, Concoction, Diſtribution, Appoſition, and Aſſimilation, more perfectly then after Dinner, when it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted otherwiſe, to the Senſes and Operations both of Body and Mind: Beſides that, the coldneſs and darkneſs of the night, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes not a little to the ſame effect upon the account of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſtaſis. Unleſs we had rather, with ſome, eſtabliſh a new power of the Soul, governing and diſpoſing the Spirits accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to neceſſity; ſometimes giving them the bridle, and cauſing them to move outwards, as in Anger, Shame, and Indignation; ſometimes ſummoning them inwards, as in Fear, Sadneſs, and Sleep, which for this reaſon renders the Countenance pale, and all the extream parts cold; whereas in the time of waking, the external parts being hotter, leave the Internal more cold.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That he agreed with the Church, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes Faſting in the Evening but allows Dinners; which it doth not without mature conſideration, drawn as well from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as from Grace. For it thereby deſignes the eſchewing thoſe Illuſions and Temptations attending good Cheer taken before going to bed; and conceives, a light Supper fitteſt for meditation
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66371:80"/>
and ſerenity of Mind. The reparation of our diſſipated Spirits by Food, cauſeth the ſame diſorder in the Body that happens in a Town or Village upon the entrance of ſtrangers to people it, after its deſolation by ſome accident; and therefore 'tis better that this trouble arrive in the day, when our waking ſenſes are able to ſecure themſelves from the Commotions cauſed by this change, than in the night, whoſe darkneſs helps to multiply the Phantaſms which are in the Imagination, peſter'd with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and groſs fumes of Meats, the Digeſtion whereof is then but begun. Whereas in the day time, ſuch vapors tranſpire more freely by the Pores which are opened by the heat of the Sun, and by the Exerciſes which are uſed in the Afternoon. Beſides, Meats being onely to fill emptineſs, the time of the greateſt inanition is the fitteſt for repletion; which certainly Noon muſt be, after the Evacuations of the fore-going Night and Morning.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, There are four manners of taking Repaſts: Firſt, Some eat often, and very much at each time; ſo did the <hi>Athletae</hi> of old, and ſo do thoſe Gourmandizers who are alwayes hungry, and whoſe Stomacks have been found after their death of unuſual capacity: This way is altogether oppoſite to Health. Secondly, Some eat little and ſeldom: which courſe befits acute Diſeaſes; thoſe that are judg'd the fourth day, requiring ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a total abſtinence, in caſe the Patient's ſtrength can bear it; thoſe that reach to the ſeventh or fourteenth, very little Food and ſeldom. Thirdly, Such as muſt eat little but often; as little Children and Old people, whoſe heat being weak and eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, they muſt be often nouriſh'd; but by a little at a time, for fear of overcharging their too weak Stomacks. The laſt and commoneſt way, is, to eat plentifully but ſeldom, which is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of middle-ag'd people, who uſually eat twice a day, and more at one Meal than at the other: it being hard for a Man to ſatiate himſelf both at Dinner and Supper without indammaging his Health. Which made <hi>Plato</hi> wonder when he heard that the <hi>Sicilians</hi> fill'd themſelves with Meat twice a day, and oblig'd the <hi>Romans</hi> to make a light repaſt about Noon, and a ſplendid Supper; which I am for. Upon this account the Church hath, to macerate us, forbidden Suppers on Faſting dayes; which is an Argument that they are more agreeable and more conducing to Health than Dinners. For ſuch quantity of Food is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as anſwers to the natural heat; which being not onely more vigorous, but alſo of longer duration between Supper and Dinner, than between Dinner and Supper, (the interval whereof is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom above ſix or ſeven hours, whereas that between Supper and Dinner is about ſeventeen) 'tis more reaſonable to ſup more largely than dine. For if the Dinner be largeſt, we ſhall eat either as much as the heat is able to digeſt by Supper-time, or more. If we eat more, and go to Supper before the digeſtion of the Dinner is wholly finiſh'd, we ſhall beget crudities, which are the ſeed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66371:80"/>
of moſt diſeaſes. If we eat as much as the heat can digeſt, and the Supper be leſs then the Dinner; then the heat which follows the Supper being ſtronger and more active, will ſoon concoct the meat taken at Supper; and (becauſe 'tis a natural agent, not acting from a principle of liberty but of neceſſity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remain idle) having no extraventitious matter to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will neceſſarily conſume the laudable juices of the body, drying up the ſame during ſleep. For whereas ſleep is ſaid to moiſten, whence aroſe the Proverb, <hi>Qui dort mange</hi>; He that ſleeps, eats; 'tis true, when the ſtomach and entrals being fill'd with ſufficient nouriſhment, the Heat raiſes and diſperſes to all the parts the pureſt of the juices and vapours like gentle dews; which it cannot do when the Stomach is empty.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſaid, Nature having given us an Appetite to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe us of the need of all parts, there is no certainer rule of the time of Repaſt than this Appetite, which for this reaſon is ſeated in the upper Orifice of the Stomach, render'd ſenſible by the Nerves of the ſixth Pair terminating therein. For there is a continual diſſipation of our ſubſtance in all the parts, which being exhauſted attract from their neighbours wherewith to fill their own emptineſs: theſe ſolicit the Liver, for ſupply; that, the Guts by the Meſaraick Veins: theſe the Stomack, at the top whereof this ſuction terminates, the ſenſe or perception whereof is call'd Appetite; which, if of hot and dry, is call'd Hunger; if of cold and moiſt, Thirſt. So that Nutrition being onely to recruit and repair the loſs of our Subſtance, there is no more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ſign of the fitting time to eat, then when the ſaid Appetite is moſt eager, at what hour ſoever it be.</p>
            <p>The fifth ſaid, That this might have place in well temper'd bodies which deſire onely ſo much as they are able to digeſt, but not in thoſe whoſe Appetite is greater than their Digeſtion, as cold and melancholy Stomacks; or who deſire leſs, as the hot and bilious, whoſe heat melting the juices, abates the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; as on the contrary, Coldneſs contracting the membranes of the Stomack, augments it: So that 'tis moſt expedient for every one to conſult his own Temper, Age, Nature, and Cuſtom of living; Old people, little Children, ſuch as are ſubject to Defluxions, or have weak Stomacks, muſt ſup ſparingly; on the other ſide, the Cholerick, and ſuch as are ſubject to the Head-ach, muſt eat a larger Supper than Dinner: But above all, the Cuſtom of every particular perſon is moſt conſiderable herein.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXIII. Which of the Humane Paſsions is moſt excuſable.</head>
            <p>MAn being compos'd of two Pieces, Body and Soul, and upon that account ſtyl'd by <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> The Horizon of the Univerſe, becauſe he unites in himſelf the ſpiritual nature with the Corporeal, the Inclinations whereof are different; he hath alſo need of two guides to conduct thoſe two Parts (the Rational and the Animal) and make them know the Good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which they are carried of their own Nature. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect makes him ſee the Honeſt and Spiritual Good; the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination enables him to conceive a ſenſible and corporeal Good. And as the Rational Appetite (which is the <hi>Will</hi>) follows the light afforded to it by the Intellect in purſuit of Honeſt Good, whence Vertue ariſeth; ſo the ſenſitive Appetite is carri'd to the enjoyment of ſenſible Good which the Imagination makes it conceive as profitable and pleaſant, and that by motions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo diſorderly and violent that they make impreſſion not only upon the Mind, but upon the Body, whoſe Oeconomy they diſcompoſe; and for this reaſon they are call'd Paſsions or Perturbations, and Affections of the Mind. Theſe Paſsions either are carri'd towards Good and Evil ſimply, as <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi>; the firſt inclining us to Good which is the Parent of Beauty, the latter averting us from Evil: or elſe they conſider both Good and Evil Abſent, as <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Flight:</hi> or Laſtly, they conſider them being preſent, and cauſe <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi>; which, if of longer duration, produce Joy and Sadneſs. Now becauſe difficulties frequently occurr in the purſuit of Cood and flight of Evil, therefore Nature not contented to have indu'd Animals with a Concupiſcible Appetite, which by means of the ſix above-mention'd Paſsions might be carri'd towards Good, and avoid Evil; hath alſo given them another Appetite call'd Iraſcible, to ſurmount the Obſtacles occurring in the purſuit of Good or flight of Evil; whence ariſe five other Paſsions, <hi>Hope, Deſpair, Boldneſs, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Anger.</hi> Hope excites the ſoul to the proſecution of a difficult but obtainable good. Deſpair checks the motions of the ſoul towards the purſuit of a Good no longer obtainable. Boldneſs regards an abſent Evil, which aſſures it ſelf able to ſurmount. Fear conſiders the ſame abſent Evil without any means of being able to avoid it. Laſtly, the violence of Anger is bent againſt a preſent Evil, whereof it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a poſsibility to be reveng'd. And becauſe a preſent and enjoyed Good cannot be accompani'd with difficulty; hence there is no Paſsion in the Iraſcible Appetite anſwering to Anger, as there is in the other Paſsions: which again are divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral objects about which they are exercis'd.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66371:81"/>
The deſire of Honours is call'd Ambition; that of Riches, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; that of fleſhly Pleaſures, Concupiſcence; that of Meats, Gourmandiſe or Gluttony. The Hatred of Vice cauſes Zeal; that of a Rival, Jealouſie. The ſorrow ariſing upon the ſight of Evil ſuffer'd by an undeſerving perſon, cauſes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion; Indignation proceeds from the happening of Good to one that merits it not. Now, among all theſe Paſſions, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which aims at a general ſuperiority, ſeems to me the firſt; and ſince it hath ſerv'd to excuſe Parricides and Violators of the publick faith, whom it hath caus'd to ſay, that for the ſake of command nothing is unjuſt, it may very well be excus'd every where elſe; beſides that, it hath been the inſtigator to the moſt glorious Actions, the ſource whereof is that laudable Ambition which every one hath to out-vie his companion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, If the Paſſions are Diſeaſes of the Soul, as the Stoicks held, and the Queſtion ſeems to preſuppoſe; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none more agreeable and excuſable than Love; whoſe ſweet violence inſinuating into the ſevereſt breſts, finds nothing capable to reſiſt it. Hence thoſe that are taken with it, wiſh nothing leſs than a cure, which cannot proceed but from obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of the thing belov'd, wherein they live more than in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the ſoul being more where it loves than in the body wherein it lives. Moreover, this Paſsion is the moſt natural and common of all, and conſequently, the moſt excuſable; being found not only in all men, but alſo in all Animals, who feel the aſſaults of Love, which makes them naturally tend towards Good. And as Love is the moſt common, ſo it is likewiſe the ſource and principle of all the Paſſions: for we neither hate nor fear any thing, we have neither joy, ſadneſs, deſire, fear, nor anger, but becauſe we love ſomething: the true courſe to become exempt from theſe Paſſions, being, To love No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>The third ſaid, That the moſt violent Paſſions being the moſt excuſable becauſe the hardeſt to ſubdue, thoſe of the Iraſcible Appetite (particularly Anger) being more vehement than thoſe of the Concupiſcible Appetite, are alſo the moſt worthy of excuſe. The former poſſeſs the nobleſt part of Man, the Heart, which is the ſource of Anger; the latter, the Liver which is the ſeat of Love; whoſe weakneſs the Poets have ſufficiently demonſtrated by repreſenting it to us under the form of a Child, which hath no power over us but what we ſuffer it to take. But Anger which is proper to the Generous, as Love is to the weak and effeminate, makes it ſelf maſter of the Soul; and by its ſudden and impetuous motions obſcuring the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, makes us the more excuſable in that we are no longer maſters of our own actions. And as Madneſs excuſes the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick from blame and puniſhment, ſo Anger which is a ſhort Madneſs, as the Poet ſaith, deſerves the ſame excuſe; its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence being ſo much above that of all other Paſſions, that it is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66371:82"/>
the moſt quick and paſſes like Lightning: for when it takes root in the ſoul, it loſes its name, and degenerates into Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That he was for Joy, becauſe all the other Paſſions acknowledg its power ſuch, that they are contented to be its ſervants; Love and Deſire are only in order to ſome hoped Joy; Hatred and Flight, only to remove all objects that may trouble it. Deſpair then only ſeizes us, when we can no longer hope for Joy; Hope is for it alone; Fear is only of what is contrary to it; Boldneſs, to break through all Obſtacles op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our contentment; and Anger ſerves to expreſs the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure we reſent for its delay or interruption. If a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us in his anger, or in his ſadneſs, yea, or in his deſpair; we will not excuſe him: but be we never ſo diſpleas'd, we not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſe the joy of others, but take pleaſure in it. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Contraries are known by their Contraries, ſince nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes us ſo much as Sadneſs, nothing pleaſes us ſo much as Joy; whoſe violence is manifeſted by ſome that have dy'd of it, as none ever did of Anger. In fine, we cannot better prove and approve the power and empire of any one than by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſubjects, as we all are of Joy; to which the greateſt part not only give part of their time, but alſo quit the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs to ſeek it in places deſtinated to the god of Laughter; whoſe Feſtivals are now more frequen then in in the days of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleius.</hi> And what makes us in youth bear and endure all the pains of ſtudy; Apprentices of each Trade, the hardſhips which they undergo; Soldiers, the danger of Death, but a pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hope of Joy? which he that poſſeſſes, becomes ſo maſter'd by it, that he forgets all his paſt evils: The Mariner no longer remembers the perils of the ſea, nor the ſick perſon his pains; In ſhort, every one ſuffers himſelf to be poſſeſſ'd and govern'd by this Paſſion, which is therefore the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
            <p>The fifth ſaid, That Grief brings greater Evil than Joy doth Good; becauſe Evil wholly deſtroys the Nature of a thing, which Good only renders more complete; whence it follows that the former is much more juſt and excuſable than the latter which gives only Well-being, but Evil deſtroys Being it ſelf; to the preſervation whereof all Creatures being naturally enclin'd, more carefully eſchew ſuch things as may hurt them, then they purſue thoſe that may procure joy and contentment. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the accents of the Voice which teſtifie Grief or Sadneſs are much more violent than thoſe of Joy; which being nothing elſe but a bare complacency receiv'd in the enjoyment of Good, conſiſts rather in reſt then in motion, whereof Grief partakes more largely by the endeavours which it cauſeth the ſoul to put forth for removing of what torments it.</p>
            <p>The ſixth ſaid, That the Paſſions being Appurtenances of our Nature, and part of our Selves, are all excuſable in themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66371:82"/>
natural and inevitable; but eſpecially thoſe whereto we are particularly moſt inclin'd by Temper: ſo Love and Joy are moſt excuſable in the ſanguine; Choler and Deſpair in the Bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; Hatred and Sadneſs in the Melancholick; Hope and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Youth; and Baſhfulneſs is excuſable in a Child, but cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in an old man. Yet Hope, which accompanies Man not only while breath laſts, but extends even beyond death, ſeems by that duration to plead, that as it is the leaſt ſeparable, ſo it is the moſt excuſable.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXIV. Which is the moſt laudable Temperament.</head>
            <p>TEmperament is the Harmony and Proportion of the four firſt Qualities, reſulting from the mixture of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof all ſublunary Bodies are compounded; which being deſtinated to ſeveral ends, requir'd therefore different Tempers and Qualifications. Now although the diverſity herein be almoſt infinite, yet it may be reduc'd to three Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Heads. For either the four Qualities are ſo mix'd that they remain in an equal proportion; or one of them excels the reſt; or elſe two together have the advantage. The firſt makes the Temperament equal; the two latter make it unequal. The equal Temperament is two-fold; one call'd Temperament by <hi>Weight (ad Pondus,</hi> as they ſpeak) when the qualities are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly proportionate, that, could they be weigh'd in a balance, not one would preponderate above another: (Underſtand this Equalneſs, only of Qualities, not of Elements; for were there as much Fire as Water, as much Air as Earth, the more active fire would conſume the reſt and reduce into aſhes all living things; whoſe diſſolution ſhews us that they conſiſt more of Earth and Water then of the other Elements. The other, call'd Temperament according to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is found in every ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound-ſubſtances; amongſt which there is one that ſerves for the rule or ſtandard to all individuals compris'd under it, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes in perfection the temper require requiſite to the functions of its nature. Thus amongſt Animals the Lyon is hot, the Swine moiſt, the Salamander cold, the Bee dry: but Man is temperate, and amongſt his parts the Bones, Cartilages, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments are cold and dry; the Blood, Spirits, Muſcles, Heart and Liver are hot and moiſt; the Brain, Phlegm and Fat are cold and moiſt; each of them being temper'd according to Juſtice. The Skin alone, eſpecially that in the Palm of a well-temper'd mans hand, being moderate in all the Qualities and ſeeming a texture of the Fleſh and Nerves, is equally cold and hot, ſoft and hard, and conſequently the prime Organ of Touch, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66371:83"/>
the judge of all other Temperaments. The unequal Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (which nevertheleſs lyes within the latitude of Health) is either ſimple or compound. The former (wherein one of the four Qualities prevails over its contrary, while the other two remain in a mediocrity) is of four ſorts, Hot, Cold, Dry, and Moiſt. The ſecond, (wherein two excell) is likewiſe of four ſorts according to the four combinations which the qualities ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; <hi>viz.</hi> Hot and Moiſt, Hot and Dry, Cold and Moiſt, Cold and Dry: for Hot and Cold, Dry and Moiſt, cannot ſubſiſt in one and the ſame ſubject. And though the heat inceſſantly conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moiſture, and the cold collecting plenty of humid excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hinder the hot and moiſt, and cold and dry tempers from ſubſiſting long in the ſame ſtate; yet they may continue therein for ſome time, though they become chang'd by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ages. Now of the nine ſorts of Tempers, to wit, the four ſimple, four compound, and one perfectly temperate, this laſt ſeems to me the moſt laudable and perfect; a body thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd being neither fat nor lean, hot nor cold, dry nor moiſt, but of a ſquare and indifferently fleſhy conſtitution, not inclining to one extream more then another, being in an exquiſite medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, and conſequently more laudable then any of thoſe which approach nearer the (always vicious) extreams.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, If there be ſuch an exquiſite Temperament as reaſon ſeems to demonſtrate, then ſince there is no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from one extream to another but by the middle; when a Child changes the heat and moiſture of his infancy into the cold and dryneſs of old-age, that middle equal Temper muſt paſs away as ſwift as lightning, and it's duration will be almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. Wherefore though it be the moſt perfect and deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet ſince 'tis only the ſtandard and rule of all others, I am for Hot and Moiſt, as moſt ſutable to life, which conſiſts in thoſe two qualities; as Death, and its forerunner Old-age, are cold and dry. This is the Temperament of Child-hood, allotted to us by Nature at the beginning of our life; and therefore the moſt perfect, anſwering to the Spring (the moſt temperate of Seaſons) and to Blood (the moſt temperate humour) whence 'tis call'd Sanguine; as the cold and dry, is Melancholick; the hot and dry, Bilious; the cold and moiſt, Phlegmatick. Which is not to be underſtood of the excrementitious but of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural humours contain'd in the maſs of Blood, which follow the principles of our Generation. Moreover, 'tis proper not only for the functions of life, whereof health is the foundation, and joy the moſt ſweet ſupport, which the Blood produces, (as Melancholy doth ſadneſs, Phlegm ſlothfulneſs; Bile, fury and anger) but alſo for thoſe of the Mind, which depending upon the pureneſs of the Animal Spirits, (as theſe do upon that of the Vital and Natural) which are more benigne in the Sanguine, their conceptions muſt be likewiſe more clear and refin'd.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If Heat and Moiſture are ſutable to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66371:83"/>
of the Vegetative Soul, (Generation, Accretion, and Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they are no leſs prejudicial to thoſe of the Rational, the ſeat whereof is therefore remote from the two Organs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, the Ventricle and the Liver; leſt the fumes of the Food coming to be mix'd with the Animal Spirits might offuſcate and cloud the phantaſms and ideas wherewith thoſe Spirits are charged, and conſequently hinder the operations of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which depend upon thoſe phantaſms ſo long as it is linked to the Body. For all Souls being alike, their operations differ only according to the diverſe temper of the Brain, which cauſes that of the Animal Spirits, which muſt be ſubtle and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, but not ſo far as to be igneous (like thoſe of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and frantick, whoſe motions are precipitate and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) but in the juſt proportion obſerv'd in the Melancholick temper, which being cold and dry (that is to ſay, leſs hot and moiſt) is moſt proper for Prudence and Wiſdom, which require a ſetled compos'd Spirit, like that of old men, who owe not their Wiſdom ſo much to the experience of many years, as to the coldneſs and dryneſs of their Brains, which makes men grave and ſedate. All brave men have been of this temper, which gives patience and conſtancy, without which nothing grand and conſiderable can ever be perform'd. And as the hot and moiſt temper is moſt ſubject to corruption, ſo by the reaſon of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the cold and moiſt muſt be leaſt obnoxious to diſeaſes (as amongſt Trees and Animals, the dryeſt and hardeſt are leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by external injuries) upon which account the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not only moſt deſirable, but alſo becauſe it moſt contents the mind of him that poſſeſſes it, who being at his eaſe makes more reflection upon the benefit he injoys, unleſs otherwiſe diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by contemplation.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That that is the moſt laudable temper which is moſt adapted to the functions both of body and mind; between which there is ſo great a diſproportion, that what agrees well with the one, ſeems prejudicial to the other. The Sanguine is the moſt excellent for the operations of life and good habit of Body, but incommodious for thoſe of the Mind; partly through the ſoftneſs and mildneſs of that humour which cannot ſuffer ſtrong attention, and partly through its exceſſive humidity, which filling the Imagination with vapours cannot ſupply fit matter to the Animal Spirits, whoſe temper muſt be dry for producing Wiſdom, whereunto Melancholy is by ſome judg'd conducible; but were it ſo, 'tis too contrary to the health and good conſtitution of the body to be deſirable. The phlegmatick temper is proper neither for the health of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nor the goodneſs of Wit. But the Bilious is for both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs repleat then the Sanguine, and leſs attenuated and dry'd then the melancholick, beſides very nimble and dextrous through the plenty of ſpirits; and as 'tis eaſily diſorder'd, ſo likewiſe 'tis reſtor'd in a little time; its maladies being the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66371:84"/>
Moreover, its vivacity is much more deſirable then the heavineſs and lumpiſhneſs attending the Melancholy and making the Vulgar think them Sage and prudent though they are only ſo in appearance: whereas the Cholerick are Induſtrious and Courageous, accompliſhing whatever they attempt; and as amongſt Beaſts and Birds the noble Lyon and Eagle are of this complexion, and according to ſome our firſt Parent <hi>Adam</hi> (which ſignifies Red) was in hair and temper bilious; whence perhaps alſo Man is call'd in the ſame language <hi>Iſh,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Fire, whereof choler partakes.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That indeed his readineſs to obey his Wife was an effect of that Temper, of which he ſeems rather to have been then of that laudable and perfectly temperate one which our Saviour enjoy'd. But indeed, Tempers being the principles of all our functions, which muſt be different in every individual, are deſirable according to the Places, Seaſons, Employments, Age, Sex, and Inclinations of every one in particular.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXV. Of Happineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs; and whether men are Happy or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy, becauſe they really are ſo, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think themſelves ſo.</head>
            <p>THree ſorts of effects are obſerv'd in Nature. Some ariſe always neceſſarily, as the viciſſitudes of Days, Nights and Seaſons, which depend upon the motion of the Stars, no more alterable without a miracle then the other effects of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Nature. Others come to paſs often but not always; the particular nature which produces them being ſometimes hindred by ſome accident, which makes it bring forth Monſters. The laſt happen neither always nor often but ſeldom; as all thoſe which depend upon contingent cauſes, which are of two ſorts. The firſt act by a neceſſity of nature, without any election: The ſecond by a principle of liberty without choice or delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Both, when they produce an effect contrary to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and primary deſign, are called fortuitous cauſes. And as thoſe which act by natural neceſſity produce a caſualty, as when a Stone falls upon the head of any one; ſo when thoſe which operate by election and deſign, produce another thing then what they had propounded to themſelves, they make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or good and ill-luck, according to the good or evil ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thence by ways and ſprings, by us unforeſeen: for in caſe the cauſe or motives be known, the effects are no longer fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and contingent, becauſe they have their manifeſt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cauſe. So when induſtry, labour, favour or friendſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66371:84"/>
Riches, the effect is not to be aſcrib'd to Fortune, no more then the loſſes which follow upon the luxury and profuſions of a diſorderly life: but Riches and Honours are fortuitous when they happen to perſons altogether incapable thereof; as alſo poverty, infamy, and contempt alſo to brave men, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and reſolution in undergoing all thoſe diſgraces hath made it be commonly ſaid, That a wiſe man is above fortune, becauſe he ſlights her ſtroaks by the ſtrength of his reaſon; which being alone capable to render us happy, ſince Beaſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute thereof have neither any ſhare in good-luck or bad-luck, I conceive that both the one and the other depends intirely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our fanſie, and the reflection we make upon the condition of the thing poſſeſſed; which appearing ſometimes good and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bad, makes us accordingly judge our ſelves happy or unhappy.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Diverſity is no where more apparent than in humane Actions, the incertainty and inconſtancy whereof is ſuch, that men rarely arrive at their propoſed end, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes behold themſelves either exalted to an unhoped degree of Felicity, or overwhelmed with the Miſery which there was no ground to apprehend. Which diverſity of accidents, induced Superſtitious Antiquity, to ſet up a blind and flitting Deity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant onely in her inconſtancy, whom they held the cauſe of all ſuch effects; thus betaking themſelves to an imaginary canſe, in regard they could not, or would not acknowledg the true; which I attribute to every ones temperament, by means of which is produced in the Soul a certain natural motion and impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for obtaining ſome particular thing, without Reaſons contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting thereunto; and according as a Man follows or reſiſts theſe inſtincts and inclinations, ſo he proves either happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. Thus he who finds himſelf diſpoſed to Arms, if he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, thrives better than in a ſoft and ſedentary life, whereunto the Melaneholly perſon is more addicted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers better herein. Now becauſe dull ſpirits, fools, and thick-ſkull'd fellows, eaſily ſuffer themſelves to be guided by thoſe motions; therefore they commonly prove more fortunate than the wiſe, whoſe Prudence and Diſcretion cauſing them to make abundance of reflections upon what they undertake, cauſes them alſo to loſe opportunities which never return. For I am not of their Opinion, who hold, That as there are Spirits which make the Celeſtial Orbes move, and, according to <hi>Averroes,</hi> an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence preſiding over natural Generations; ſo there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular one for the various events of life, which it makes to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen according to the different intentions of the Firſt Mover: Since without recurring to ſuch obſcure and remote cauſes, we carry in our ſelves thoſe of our Felicity and Infelicity, whereof we are the true Artificers; which to place in the Phanſie alone, and not in reality, is to ſay, good is not Good; ſince goodneſs being an eſſential affection of real entity, is inſeparable from it, and conſequently true, not barely imaginary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:66371:85"/>The Third ſaid, That Good being ſuch onely upon account of its conveniency or ſutableneſs to the Poſſeſſor, there is not in this world any Abſolute Good or Happineſs, but onely Relative and by Compariſon, ſeeing what ſutes well with one, doth not ſo with another. Riches, wherein moſt Men place their Felicity, were caſt into the Sea by a Philoſopher, that he might the better attend Contemplation. Honors and Pleaſures, (charms, which moſt powerfully inveigle moſt of Man-kind) are croſſes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſome others. Impriſonment, one of the hardeſt trials of Patience, is nevertheleſs ſought by ſome, who prefer Solitude and perpetual Reſtraint, before the vanities of the world. To have no Friends is the greateſt of infelicities; yet <hi>Timon</hi> made it his prime Pleaſure. Life, the foundation of all goods, hath been ſo tedious to ſome, that to be deliver'd from it they have kill'd themſelves; and the pains, afflictions, and diſeaſes leading to death, are, in the <hi>Stoicks</hi> account, but imaginary Evils, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no impreſſion upon the wiſe.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Since Happineſs and Unhappineſs ſeem to be the Elements, compoſing the Political Life of Men, and the two Poles of that Globe upon which the Antients plac'd Fortune, their Conſideration may be taken two ways, either in their Cauſe, or in their Effect. As for the firſt, the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who eſtabliſht a Fate governing All by a Series of neceſſary and determinate Events, were as impious as <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Leucippus,</hi> who, on the contrary, maintain'd that all things were done by Chance in the Univerſe, which, they ſaid, it ſelf was made by the caſual occourſe of their Atoms; theſe denying the Providence of God, thoſe his Power, by ſubjecting and tying him to the immutable Laws of Fatality. But without conſidering things in reference to God, to whom every thing is preſent and certain, we may diſtinguiſh them into two ſorts. Some acting neceſſarily, have alwayes their neceſſary effects: others, which depend abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Man's Will, which is free and indifferent, have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Effects incertain and contingent. Thus the accidents of the Sea, (where the vulgar believes is the chief Empire of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune), natural deaths, the births of poor and rich, have regular and neceſſary Cauſes. On the contrary, Goods freely given, or acquir'd with little induſtry, or found, have contingent Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which being almoſt infinite, (for there is no Cauſe by it ſelf, but may be a Cauſe by accident, by producing another thing than what was intended) they cannot fall within the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Humane Wit, which knows onely what is finite and terminate. Other Events have Cauſes mixt of Chance and Neceſſity, as the death of the Poet <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> hapning by a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe which an Eagle let fall upon his bald Head. As for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner wherein Happineſs may be conſider'd, namely, Whether it render us happy in Reality or in Imagination; 'tis an accuſing all Men of folly, to ſay that Felicity is imaginary and phantaſtical; ſince Nature, which hath given no Deſire in vain,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66371:85"/>
(as ſhe ſhould have done, if ſhe had caus'd us to deſire a thing that exiſts not) makes all Men aſpire to the one, and fear the other. There muſt be an Abſolute Happineſs as well as an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Good, namely, the poſſeſſion of this Good, as that of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence is, which being the foundation of all Goods, muſt be a Real and Abſolute Good. Virtue and, the Honor attending it, being likewiſe true and ſolid Goods, their poſſeſſion muſt adferr a ſemblable Felicity; the verity and reality is no more chang'd by not being equally guſted by all, than the ſavour of Meat, or the Beauty of Light, would be by not being perceiv'd by a ſick or a blind perſon: Yea, as he that ha's a rough Diamond is not leſs the poſſeſſor, or leſs rich for not knowing the value of it; ſo he that poſſeſſes ſome Good ought not to be accounted leſs happy, though he think not himſelf ſo. Moreover, 'twould be as abſurd to call a Man happy or unhappy becauſe he thinks himſelf ſo; as to believe a fool is a King, or Rich, becauſe he phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies himſelf to have Empires and Riches.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That Happineſs, which is rather an Effect of our Genius, (as the examples of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Simonides</hi> prove) than of our Temperament, much leſs of the Stars and their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, depends not onely upon the poſſeſſion of ſome Good, or the belief a Man hath that he poſſeſſes it, but upon both together; namely, upon the reflexion he makes upon the Good which he really poſſeſſes; for want of which, Children, Fools, Drunkards, and even the Wiſe themſelves, whilſt they are a ſleep cannot be call'd Happy.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXVI. Of the Original of Precious Stones.</head>
            <p>A Stone, which is defin'd a Foſſile, hard, dry, and frangible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is either common or precious. Both are compounded of the Four Elements, chiefly of Water and Earth, but diverſly proportion'd and elaborated. Coarſe Stones are made with leſs preparation, their proximate matter being onely much Earth and little Water, whereof is made a ſort of Clay, which being dry'd by Nature, is hardned into a Stone. Precious Stones have more of Water, and leſs of Earth, both very pure and ſimple, (whence proceeds their Luſtre, which attends the ſimplicity of the Elements) and exactly mixt by Heat, which concocting the aqueous humidity, purifies and ſublimes the ſame to a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree by help of that Univerſal Spirit, where-with the Earth and whole world is fill'd, on which account the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> eſteemed it a great Animal.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Three things are to be conſider'd in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the original of Stones; their matter, their efficient cauſe, and the place of their generation. Their remote mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Earth and Water, which two Elements alone give bulk
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66371:86"/>
and conſiſtence: but their next matter, (concern'd in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) is a certain lapidifick juice, ſupplying the place of Seed, and often obſerv'd dropping down from rocks; which, if thick and viſcous, makes common ſtones; if ſubtil and pure, the precious. Now this juice not only is turn'd it ſelf into ſtone, but likewiſe turns almoſt all other Bodies, as Wood, Fruits, Fiſhes, the Fleſh of Animals, and ſuch other things, which are petrifi'd in certain Waters and Caves. Their remote efficient cauſe is Heat, which ſevering heterogeneous bodies unites thoſe of the ſame nature, whereof it makes the ſaid homogeneous juice, which is condens'd by cold; which giving the laſt form and perfection to the ſtone is its proximate efficient cauſe. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their place is every where; in the middle region of the Air, which produces Thunder-bolts; in the Sea, which affords Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, (of a middle nature between Stone and Plant) and Pearls in their ſhells which are their wombs, by means of the Dew of Heaven; in Animals, in Plants and above all in the Earth and its Mines or Matrices which are cloſe ſpaces exempt from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of Air, Water, or other external Agents, which might hinder their production either by intermixtion of ſome extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body, or by ſuffering the Mineral Spirits ſerving to the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration of the Stones to tranſpire.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Precious Stones, produc'd for Ornament, (as Metals are for Uſe of life), are of three ſorts; namely, either bright and reſplendent, as the Diamond, Ruby, Cryſtal, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſt; or a little obſcure, as the Turquois, Jaſper, and other middle ones without perfect luſtre, as the Opal and all Pearls. And as the matter of common Stones is Earth the principle of Darkneſs; ſo that of the precious is an aqueous diaphanous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, congeal'd by the coldneſs of water or earth, or by the vicinity of Ice and Snow which inviron Mountains and Rocks, where commonly their Mines are found; and amongſt others, Cryſtal which is (as 'twere) the firſt matter of other precious Stones, and the firſt eſſay of Nature (when ſhe deſigns to incloſe her Majeſty in the luſtre of the moſt glittering Jewels) is nothing elſe but humidity condens'd by cold. Whence a violent heat, ſuch as that of Furnaces, reſolves and melts it. Moreover, the effects attributed to theſe Stones, as to ſtop blood, allay the fumes of wine, and reſiſt hot poyſons, argue them caus'd only by cold, which alſo gives them weight by condenſation of their parts.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, If Cryſtals and Stones were produc'd only by cold, they could not be generated in the Iſles of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the red Sea and other Southern parts, but only in the Northern, where nevertheleſs they are moſt rare, there being Mountains where cold hath preſerv'd Ice for divers Ages without ever being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Cryſtal; which (beſides) ſhould ſwim upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as Ice doth, and not be more heavy and tranſparent: which cannot be attributed to their greater denſity, caus'd by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66371:86"/>
a more vehement cold; ſince water inſpiſſated into Ice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes leſs tranſparent, and Cryſtals are not ſo cold to the touch as Ice. But above all, their Calcination evidently ſhews that there is ſomething elſe in them beſides Water; for finding out of which, we muſt examine the principles of Bodies neareſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to them; as Alom and Glaſs, which by their ſplendor and conſiſtence, much reſemble precious Stones, being (like them) Mineral Juices hardned and mixt by a proportionate quantity of Salts and violent Spirits, which joyned together, loſe their Acrimony to embrace one another more cloſely: Theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are very viſcous, capable of great ſolidity, and being of themſelves tranſparent, are proper to preſerve all the brightneſs and light, which their ſpecifick forms can add to them. This reſemblance being ſuppoſed, we are obliged to diſcover the ſame Principles of Compoſition in Jewels; ſince things agreeing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, and having reſemblance of qualities, agree alſo as to matters, and have nothing to diſtinguiſh them but that unknown Form which determines the Species. But the truth is, little brightneſs and hardneſs proceed not from their Form alone, which is uncapable of ſo cloſe connexion, but from much dark Earth, and a very impure Phlegm; which is not found in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, or in the Glaſs where-with in the <hi>Indies</hi> they make Emeralds. Moreover, 'tis this body that moſt reſembles thoſe Stones, which hath no other Principles but a Spirit mingled amongſt much Salt, and ſome little of Earth; which are united by the activity of heat, and condenſed by their natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to inſpiſſation, (cold contributing but very little thereunto, ſince they acquire their ſolidity and conſiſtence whilſt yet very hot.) The Artifice of counterfeiting Rubies and Diamonds, with the ſame Principles of Glaſs, greatly confirms this Opinion; onely for avoiding brittleneſs, they mix leſs terreſtreity, and conſume not the moiſture, (which cauſes Concretion) with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The Calcination of Cryſtals, whereby much Salt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from them, and the eaſineſs of making Glaſs there-with, in like manner ſhews what are the Material Principles of theſe Stones. Which Principles being contained, or generated in the boſome of the Earth, certain Juices are formed of their ſeveral mixtures, which unite to the firſt body which happens to impreſs its Virtues upon them; then the pureſt part of theſe Salts and Earths, is volatilized by the Spirit mixt there-with, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Heat, which alwayes perfects it by further Concoction, till it have rendered it Homogeneous. Theſe Juices common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtick in ſuperficial parts of the Earth, where a moderate heat finiſhes their Concoction, evaporating, the too great humidity which hinder'd the induration natural to ſuch ſubſtances; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſpecies are made according to the different impreſſions of Heaven, or the place of their Generation, or other diſpoſitions; to which I alſo refer the diverſity of their Colours, and not (as moſt Chymiſts do) to Sulphur, which is never found in theſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66371:87"/>
Stones; which Colours, they ought to attribute rather to Salt, their principal matter, ſince by ſeveral degrees of Coction or Calcination, it acquires almoſt all the Colours of theſe Stones; being firſt white, then blew, and laſtly, reddiſh.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, 'Tis moſt probable that in the beginning there were Species of Stones of all ſorts, diſpos'd in places moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for their Conſervation, which have continually generated the like, determining fit matter by the Emiſſion of a certain Vapor or Spirit, impregnated with the Character of their Species during its union with their ſubſtance, before a perfect, induration preſs'd it forth; which Spirit lighting upon, and uniting to fit Matter, fixes and determines the ſame to be of the ſame Species, with the Maſs from which it iſſu'd. For the common Opinion, That theſe Stones are produc'd of a certain ſlime, compounded of Earth and Water, concocted and hardned by the action of Heat, is groundleſs; ſince how temperate ſoever that Heat were, it would at length diſſipate all the moiſture, and leave nothing but the Earth, the darkeſt and moſt friable of all the Elements; beſides that, Water and Earth, having no viſcoſity, are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any continuity and hardneſs, which ariſes from Salt, which indu'd with a Principle of Coagulation, perfectly unites the Water with the Earth, ſo as not to be afterwards diſſolvable by any Water, but ſuch as is mix'd with much Salt. Laſtly, the Cement they make with Lime, Water, and Sand, petrifying in time, ſhews the neceſſity of the fix'd Salt of Lime, (which gives the coherence of all) in the generation of Stones. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that as in common and opake Stones, there is a little Salt amongſt much Earth; ſo in thoſe which are precious, there is much Salt amongſt a very ſmall quantity of Earth.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXVII. Of the Generation of Metals.</head>
            <p>MEtal, which is a Mineral, ſolid, opake, heavy, malleable, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile, and ſounding body, is compounded either by Nature, Art, or Chance, as, Latin, Electrum, and Corinthian Braſs; or elſe it is ſimple, and divided into ſeven Species, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Planets, whereunto each of them is referr'd, as precious Stones are to the Fixed Starrs; namely, Gold, Silver, Lead, Copper, Iron, Tinn; and Quick-ſilver, which others reject, from the number of Metals, becauſe not malleable; as alſo Tinn, becauſe compounded of Lead and Silver. Their remote Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is much Water with little Earth; their next, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> a vaporous exhalation. Their general Efficient Cauſe is Heaven, by its Motion and Influencess producing Heat, which attenuates and concocts the ſaid Exhalation, which is afterwards
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66371:87"/>
condens'd by Cold: Hence all Metals are melted by violent Fire, which evaporates Quick-ſilver, and ſoftens that ſort of Iron which is not fuſible. The place where they are generated is the boſome of the Earth; the Metals found in Waters, as Gold in <hi>Tagus</hi> and <hi>Pactolus,</hi> having been carry'd from the Earth by the Waters; which waſhing and purifying them, render them more perfect than thoſe of the Mines.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Although Metals were generated at the beginning of the world in their Mines, whence they were firſt extracted and wrought by Tubalcain, who is the fabulous Vulcan of Paganiſm; yet they ceaſe not to be generated anew by the afflux of ſutable Matter, which is a metallick Juice form'd of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, not ſimply aqueous, (for then Heat ſhould evaporate inſtead of concocting it) but viſcous, unctuous, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what terreſtrial, which for a long time holds out againſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever violent Heat, as appears by the Fires of <hi>Volcanoes,</hi> which are maintain'd by Bitumen alone, and other ſulphureous Earths. This alſo is the Opinion of the Chymiſts, when they compound them of Sulphur and Mercury; Sulphur holding the place of the Male Seed, and Mercury, which is more crude and aqueous, that of the maternal blood. And as the Salt or Earth predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in Stones is the cauſe of their friability; ſo Sulphur and Mercury, which is unctuous moiſture, renders them malleable and capable of extenſion; which is an Argument of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as well as colour, ſound, and fixation, or enduring Fire without alteration, but not weight; for then as Gold, the perfecteſt Metal, is the heavieſt, ſo Silver ſhould be next to it in weight, which is not; Quick-ſilver being much more ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; next, Lead; after which follow Silver, Copper, Tinn, Iron, and Stones, whoſe weight is very different. Whence it appears, that Gravity is not an Effect of the condenſation of Matter; otherwiſe the Starrs being the denſer parts of their Orbs ſhould be heavy, as they are not; but it proceeds from the Form, whereunto alſo the many wonderful Effects obſerv'd in Metals muſt be referr'd; as that Gold diſcovers Poyſons, attracts Quick-ſilver, and is attracted by the Foot of a Spar-hawk, and lov'd by Gryphons, as Iron is by Eſtriches, who digeſt it; that Tinn makes all Metals brittle where-with it is mixt, Copper ſinks not in the water of the Iſland <hi>Demoneſus,</hi> near <hi>Carthage</hi>; and that Quick-ſilver, though humid, and alwayes fluid, moiſtens not; which ſome attribute to the equal mixture of ſiccity and humidity.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If ever the Opinion of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> (who held, <hi>Omnia in omnibus</hi>) was well grounded, it was chiefly in reference to Metals, whoſe Etymology, together with the Chymiſts operations, ſpeak the eaſie tranſmutation of one into another; imperfect Metals differing onely in certain accidental degrees from Gold and Silver, which they may be turn'd into after purifying from their Leproſie, and refining by Nature or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66371:88"/>
Art. And thus according to the opinion of ſome Moderns, it may be ſaid, that, ſuppoſing the earth a great Magnet, it hath alſo in it ſelf a commencement towards ſuch metallick mutation, ſince the Loadſtone is in a manner the principle of Iron, the moſt terreſtrial of all Metals; whence it is that they attract one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as do Mercury and Gold, which is compos'd thereof. And thus by the power of heat in the bowels of the Earth, Iron the moſt imperfect and lighteſt of all Metals is turned into Steel and Copper, afterwards into Tin, and laſtly, being more depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Silver and Gold. And ſince Art imitates Nature as in the fabricating of Artificial Gold you muſt firſt reſolve a ſolid matter, then volatilize, and again fix and return into a ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſo the generation of Metals may be conceiv'd to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by evaporation of the thinner parts of Earth and Water, which being volatilized by the ſubterranean heat, and lighting upon Rocks and hard Stones, are there fixed and condenſed into Metals differing according to the purity and concoction of their matter, and the places it lights upon, which are ordinarily Mountains.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the different properties of Metals plainly argue the diverſity of their Species; ſince Properties preſuppoſe ſpecificating Forms. Beſides, the World would have been very defective, if Nature had made only Gold, which may be better ſpared than Iron and Steel, and is leſs hard for uſes of Life. Nor is it likely that Nature ever intended to reduce all Metals to Gold; which then ſhould be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than Iron and Lead; ſince wiſe and potent Nature ſeldom fails of her intentions: As for the alledged tranſmutation of Metals, were it poſſible, yet it proves them not all of the ſame Species, change of Species being very ordinary, and as eaſie to be made in Crucibles as in Mines; nothing elſe being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thereunto but to open the bodies of the Metals, and ſet at liberty what in ſome is moſt active, and in others more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of the Forms you would introduce. Nature indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways intends what is moſt perfect, but not to reduce every thing to one moſt perfect Species, as all Metals to Gold; but to make a moſt perfect individual in every Species; labouring with no leſs ſatisfaction for production of Iron and Flints then of Gold and precious Stones. As for the principles of Metals, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them of Mercury and Sulphur, joyning Vitriols there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto inſtead of ſalt to give Body to the ſaid Ingredients; but ſome will have Mercury to be the ſole matter, and underſtand by ſulphur an internal and central heat in the Mercury concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its crudity, and by Mercury the cruder portion of its ſelf; their Salt being only the conſiſtence whereof the Mercury is capable after Coction. Others diſtinguiſh what is metallick in metals (as only Mercury is) from the impurities mixt therewith, as earths, ſulphurs, and Vitriols; and make the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect metals ſo homogeneous that 'tis impoſſible to ſeparate any
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66371:88"/>
thing from them; which is a proof (they ſay) of the unity of their matter and conformity with Mercury, which always retains its own nature, though preparations make it appear in ſeveral ſhapes. Moreover, they inferr from the great pondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Gold, that it is only Mercury; otherwiſe the leſs heavy bodies pretended to be mixt therewith, ſhould diminiſh its weight; and Fuſion, which ſeems to reduce all metals into their moſt natural ſtate, makes them perfectly reſemble Mercury, in which alone the Chymiſts for that reaſon ſeek their Great Work. Nevertheleſs ſeeing Experience teaches us, that Mercurie's ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs and vitriols are found in all metals except Gold, it muſt be confeſs'd that theſe three bodies are their immediate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Nor doth it follow that they are not in Gold too, though the Chymiſts have not yet been able to find them, but ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united as to be inſeparable; Coction having ſuch power upon matters that have affinity, as to unite them beyond poſſibility of ſeparation; as appears in Glaſs, of which nothing elſe can be made but Glaſs, though it be compos'd of different principles, and in Mercury it ſelf, which is a Mixt, but reduc'd to ſuch homogeneity that nothing can be extracted out of it but Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. Indeed Gold could not be ſo malleable us it is, if it were all Mercury; and they that know Mercury, and the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of depriving it of the proneneſs to revive, will not eaſily believe it can, without mixture of ſome other body, acquire the form of Gold; whoſe gravity proceeds from its proper Form, and not from Mercury which can give it no more weight then it ſelf hath; Gold by being more denſe, not acquiring more gravity, any more then Ice doth which ſwims upon the water.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXVIII. Whether there be an Elementary Fire, other than the Sun.</head>
            <p>AS there are three ſimple bodies in the world, poſſeſſing, by right of Soveraignty, Drineſs, Cold, and Moiſture; ſo there muſt be one primely Hot, which they call Fire. The diverſities of Motion, the four firſt Qualities, and their poſſible Combinations, the Humours, Temperaments, Ages, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Compoſition and Reſolution of all Mixts, are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inductions for that quaternary number of Elements. Amongſt which there is none controverted but Fire; the variety of fires found in the world rendring it dubious which of them ought to be acknowledg'd the Element, that is, the natural, ſimple, firſt hot and dry body, wherewith, together with the other, three all Mixts are compounded. The Sun indeed is the Efficient Cauſe of all productions here below; but being a celeſtial and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body cannot enter into the compoſition of any thing as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66371:89"/>
a Material Cauſe. Much leſs can our common Fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours every thing, and continually deſtroyes its Subject. But it muſt be that Elementary Fire, which is every where potential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and actually in its own Sphere, which is above that of the Air, and below that of the Moon. Moreover, being the lighteſt or leaſt heavy of all the Elements, the Harmony of the Univerſe which conſiſts chiefly in their ſituation; requires that it be in the higheſt place, towards which therefore all other Fires which are of the ſame Nature, aſcend in a point with the ſame violence that a ſtone deſcends towards its Centre; thoſe remaining here below, being detain'd by ſome Matter whereof they have need, by reaſon of the contraries environing them; from which that Sublunary Fire being exempt, hath nothing to do with Matter or nouriſhment; and by reaſon of its great rarity and tenuity, can neither burn nor heat, any more then it can be perceiv'd by us.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That ſubtlety, one of the principal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiſite to the converſion of Matter into Fire, is ſo far from hindring, that it encreaſes the violence and activity of Fire, making it penetrate even the ſolideſt bodies; whence that pretended Fire, not being mixt with extraneous things to allay its heat, as that of <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> is temper'd by its Phlegm or aqueous humidity, but being all Fire in its own Sphere and natural (place, which heightens the Virtue and qualities of all Agents) muſt there alſo heat, ſhine, burn, and produce all its Actions, which depend not upon denſity or rarity, or ſuch other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Matter purely paſſive, but upon its whole Form; which conſtituting it what it is, muſt alſo make it produce Effects ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its Nature. Wherefore as Water condens'd into Ice or Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, is no longer Water, becauſe it hath ceas'd to refrigerate and moiſten; ſo the Fire pretended to be above the Air, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inſenſible, by reaſon of its rarity, is not Fire but ſubtile Air. They who ſay its natural inclination to heat and burn, is reſtrain'd by the Influences of the Heavens, particularly, of the cold Starrs, as <hi>Saturn</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> ſpeak with as little ground; ſince the circular motion of the Heavens, whereby this Fire is turn'd about, ſhould rather increaſe than diminiſh its heat; And beſides, Fire being a neceſſary Agent, its action can no more be hindred by ſuch Influences, than the deſcent of a ſtone down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Whereunto add, that the beams of all Stars have heat; and were any cold, yet thoſe of <hi>Saturn</hi> are too remote, and thoſe of the <hi>Moon</hi> too weak in compariſon of this Fire, the extent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is about 90000. Leagues, for the diſtance between the Earth and the Moon is almoſt as much, namely, 56. Semidiameters of the Earth, from which ſubſtracting between 25. and 30. Leagues, which they allot to the three Regions of the Air, the reſt muſt be occupy'd by the Fire, which they make to extend from the Concave ſurface of the Moon, to the convex ſurface of the Air; which it would conſume in leſs than a moment, conſidering the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66371:89"/>
great diſproportion between them. Moreover, were there ſuch a Fire, it could not be own'd an Element, becauſe its levity would keep it from deſcending and entring into the Compoſition of mixts; and, were it not leight, yet it would be hindred from deſcending by the extream coldneſs of the Middle Region of the Air, accounted by ſome, a barrier to the violence of that Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Fire, which ought rather to be reckon'd amongſt their <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> than the Natural Elements, whereunto Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity and Palpability are requiſite. For theſe Reaſons, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that the Sun is the true Elementary Fire, plac'd for that purpoſe in the middle of the World, whoſe Light and Heat enter into the Compoſition not onely of all living things, but alſo of Stones and Metals; all other Heat beſides that of the Sun, being deſtructive, and conſequently, no-wiſe fit for Generation.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, He confounds Heaven with Earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the Nature of the Sun, who takes it for an Element, that is to ſay, a thing alterable and corruptible by its contraries, which it muſt have if it be an Element. The Heat of his beams proves it not the Elementary Fire, ſeeing commonly the nearer we are to Fire, the more we feel the Heat of it; but the Supream and Middle Regions of the Air, are colder than ours. Beſides, were our common fire deriv'd from the Sun, it would not languiſh, as it doth, when the Sun ſhines upon it; nor would the heat of dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils and caves be greater in Winter than in Summer. Wherefore I rather embrace the common Opinion, which holds, That the heavieſt Element is in the loweſt place, and the leighteſt in the higheſt, whoſe Action is hindred by the proportion requiſite to the quantity of each Element.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the qualities of Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat, Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Light, concurring in the Sun in a ſupream degree, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it the Elementary Fire; for Light being the Cauſe of Heat, the Sun (which is the prime Luminous Body) muſt alſo be the prime Hot, that is to ſay, Fire. For as the pretended one above the Air, was never yet diſcover'd; ſo 'tis repugnant to the Order of the Univerſe, for the leighteſt of Elements to be ſhut up in the Centre of the Earth, where ſome place it. We have but two wayes to know things, Senſe, and Reaſon; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which, is founded either upon Cauſes or Effects: Now we know nothing of the Sun, or any other Celeſtial Bodies, otherwiſe then by its Effects and ſenſible qualities, which being united in Spherical Burning-glaſſes, (as they are in the body of the Sun) notifie to us by their Effects the Nature of their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid. That Fire being to the World what the Soul is to the Body, as Life is in all the parts of the Body; ſo alſo is Fire equally diffuſed throughout the whole World. In the Air it makes Comets, and other Igneous Meteors: In the Earth it concocts Metals, and appears plentifully in <hi>Volcanoes,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66371:90"/>
Fires would not continue alwayes, if they were violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe Concavities; yea, 'tis in the Waters too, whoſe ſaltneſs and production of Monſters, cannot be without Heat. Yet being the moſt active of all Elements, it is therefore diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in much leſs quantity than the reſt; Nature having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame proportion both in the greater and leſſer World, Man's Body; in which there is leſs of Fire than of the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Otherwiſe, had the Fire been equal to the reſt, it would conſume all living things to aſhes. Nevertheleſs as the fixed Heat of Animals requires reparation by the Influent Heat from the Heart, the Soul's principal ſeat; in like manner the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Fire, diſperſed in all part of this great body of the World, needs the Influence of the Sun's Rayes, which produce and conſerve it.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXXXIX. Which is moſt deſirable, long or ſhort Life.</head>
            <p>NAture, not contented to produce all things, hath given them a deſire of Self-preſervation. Even Inanimate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies redouble their activity at the approach of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive contraries; whence proceeds Antiperiſtaſis. But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire appears chiefly in Animals, and above all in Man, being grounded upon the Love he bears to himſelf: Which extream Love, inſtigating him to ſeek all good things contributary to his contentment, makes him likewiſe deſire long Life, whereby he may continue his other enjoyments, and, conſequently, avoid all occaſions of Death, as that which interrupts the courſe of this Life, and makes him ceaſe to be. Hence, as by general conſent Death is the moſt terrible of terribles; ſo, by the reaſon of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, Life is the moſt agreable, and conſequently, moſt deſirable and beſt thing in the World; and not deſirable only by all Men who are endued with Knowledg, but alſo by all living things, each after its mode, and according as they are capable of deſiring; Plants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their nouriſhment, and Animals ſeeking their Food with difficulty, and carefully avoiding all dangers that lead to Death. For though Nature loves change, (whereof ſhe is the Principle) yet 'tis onely that of Generation, or of a leſs into a more noble ſubſtance; that of Corruption and Death ſhe abhorrs, being not further pleaſed in the viciſſitudes of mutations, than ſhe gains by the change; but ſhe is a loſer by Death, which ſeparates the Body from the Soul, in the union whereof, ſhe hath all that ſhe can wiſh. She may diſguiſe her ſelf, and changing of ſhape and countenance, but can never light upon any more agreable, than that which ſhe makes appear in the Marriage of a Body with a Soul; which are ſo perfectly united, that, after their diſſolution, our Souls alwayes retain an Inclination toward their ancient Mates which they once animated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:66371:90"/>The Second ſaid, If the ſentiment of Nature makes us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive long Life deſirable; Reaſon, which evinceth it full of Miſeries and Calamities, teaches us that the ſhorteſt is beſt, and that we may juſtly wiſh, either never to have been, or to have dy'd as ſoon as we came into the World. This was the Judgement not onely of the greateſt Sages of Pagan Antiquity, many of whom cheerfully quitted Life to eſcape its Miſeries; but the ſometimes famous Republick of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> gave Licence to the miſerable to take Poyſon, which was kept in a publick Store. Yea, even the holieſt Perſonages have been of the ſame Advice; as <hi>Job</hi> amongſt others, who calls Man's Life a warfare upon Earth, and curſes the day of his Birth; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who pray'd to God they might dye; and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who deſires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as to be loos'd from this miſerable Body; in which, as in a dark priſon, the Reaſonable Soul is enclos'd, and remains againſt, its will; ſince being of a Celeſtial Nature, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually longing after the place of its extraction, Death, which delivers it from its fetters, muſt be as deſirable to it as contrary to the Body, which having nought to hope for after this Life, but to be the food of worms and corruption, hath all reaſon to dread it, and avoid the occaſions of it; as accordingly all ſuch do who live onely for the Body, reſenting no other motions in themſelves but of deſire to live long. Whereas Reaſon inſtructs us, that here we never poſſeſs the Good whereof the Immortal Soul is capable by its two Powers, the Underſtanding and the Will, which never find any Truth or Goodneſs in the things of this World but what is ſophiſticate; it makes us alſo conceive Life as a violent ſtate, and contrary to the Felicity of our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Since Life is the duration of Being, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is the greateſt of all Goods, (Entity and Good being convertible) that muſt be the moſt deſirable which is of greateſt continuance, becauſe it comes neareſt infinity and eternity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which all Perfection is compris'd, and which being therefore paſſionately deſir'd by all Men, but not attainable by any, they endeavor to partake as much of it as they can by prolongation of Life, which is the foundation not onely of the Goods of the Body and Fortune, (whoſe ſweetneſs makes amends for ſome Evils of Life) but alſo of the Mind, in which Natural Felicity conſiſts; whereunto amongſt other conditions, long Life is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite both for attaining of Knowledge and Virtue, not to be gotten without long time, (which renders Men knowing and prudent) as for making others taſte the fruits of an exemplary Life.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Beaſts and even Stones having the good of Exiſtence as well as we, that alone is not ſufficient to render Life deſirable, in regard Non-exiſtence is much rather to be wiſht than a Being alwayes miſerable, what ever ſome ſay to the contrary; ſince even our Saviour ſaith, It had been better for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66371:91"/>
               <hi>Judas</hi> never to have been born, then to have fallen into the crime of Treaſon. Moreover, <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, No perſon would accept of Life, if he knew how dear it muſt coſt him. Hence we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the World weeping, as if it were againſt our conſent; and as our Lives begin with tears, ſo they are continu'd with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and ended with pain. Nor have we more reaſon to deſire long Life for the Goods of the Mind, which conſiſt in Virtue alone. For if we be vicious, 'tis expedient both for our ſelves and the Publick, that we live but little, for fear of corrupting others by our evil Examples, If virtuous, 'tis much to be fear'd leſt we be corrupted by the converſe of the wicked, who are very numerous; which was the cauſe why God by a ſpecial favour took away <hi>Enoch</hi> in the midſt of the courſe of his Life, and tranſported him into the Terreſtrial Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>The fifth ſaid, If a long Life were leſs deſirable than a ſhort, God ſhould have deceiv'd thoſe that honour their Parents, by promiſing them a bad ſalary in recompence of a good Action: Nor ought Phyſick to trouble it ſelf and thoſe that uſe it, by ſo many Rules and Receipts, were a ſhort Life (that is to ſay, a ſpeedy death) ſo deſirable; nor would the Laws puniſh Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals with Death, if what they give them were better than what they take from them. Moreover, as the long-liv'd Oak and Palm-Tree are more excellent than the Muſhrome, Hyſop, and the Roſe; Stags, Elephants, Eagles, Ravens, and the Phoenix more perfect than Butterflies, and thoſe Inſects which they call <hi>Ephemera,</hi> becauſe they live but one day; ſo amongſt Men, thoſe that live long, ſeem to have ſome advantage above thoſe that are of a ſhort Life, having the Principles of their Generation more vigorous: wherein nevertheleſs the Sex, Temperament, Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, Habitation, and manner of living, make a notable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Sanguine Men, and the Inhabitants of Temperate Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, commonly living longer than Women, cholerick Perſons, and ſuch as live under intemperate Climates.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, Reaſon having been given Man to correct the Inclinations of the Senſitive Appetite, 'tis that alone muſt judge whether it be expedient for him to live long; not Senſe, which makes us judge like beaſts, That nothing is dearer than Life. But Reaſon, illuminated either by Faith or by Philoſophy, teaches us that this World is the place of our baniſhment, the Body the Soul's Priſon which ſhe alwayes carryes about with her, Life a continual ſuffering and War; and therefore he fights againſt Natural Light who maintaines it expedient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſo miſerable a State. For, beſides the incommodities at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a long Life, which after 70. years, as <hi>David</hi> teſtifies, is onely labour and ſorrow, long Life is equally unprofitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attaining Knowlege and Virtue. He that lives long can learn nothing new in the World, which is but a Revolution and Repetition of the ſame Effects produc'd alwayes by the ſame Cauſes; not onely in Nature, whoſe courſe and changes may be

ſeen in the Revolution of the Four Seaſons of the Year, but even in Affairs of State and Private Matters, wherein nothing is ſaid or done, but what hath been practis'd before. And as for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the further we are from Childhod, the leſs Innocence and Sanctity we have, and Vices ordinarily increaſe with years.

            <head>CONFERENCE CXL. Of the Lethargy.</head>
            <p>AS the Brain is the moſt eminent and noble of all the parts, being the Seat of the Underſtanding, and the Throne of the Reaſonable Soul, ſo its diſeaſes are very conſiderable; and the more, in that they do not attaque that alone, but are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all the other parts, which have a notable intereſt in the offence of their Chief, ceaſing to diffuſe its Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits deſtinated to Motion, Senſe, and the Function of the Inferior Members. Which Functions are hurt by the Lethargy, which deprives a Man of every other Inclination but that to ſleep, and renders him ſo forgetful and ſlothful, (whence it took its Greek name, which ſignifies ſluggiſh oblivion) that he remembers nothing at all, being poſſeſs'd with ſuch contumacious ſleepineſs that ſhe ſhuts his Eyes as ſoon as he ha's open'd them; beſides that, his Phanſie and Reaſoning is hurt with a continual gentle Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Which differences this Symptom from both the ſleeping and waking Coma, call'd, <hi>Typhomania:</hi> the former of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begins in the Fits of Fevers, and ends or diminiſhes at their declination, but the Lethargick ſleeps ſoundly, and being wak'd by force, preſently falls a ſleep again: The latter makes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient inclin'd to ſleep, but he cannot, by reaſon of the variety of Species repreſented to him in his Phanſie. The ſignes of this Malady are deliration, heavineſs of the Head, and pain of the Neck after waking, (the Matter taking its courſe along the ſpine of the back), frequent oſcitation, trembling of the Hands and Head, a paliſh Complexion, Eyes and Face pufft up, ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, troubled Urine, like that of Cattle, a great Pulſe, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and fluctuating, Reſpiration rare with ſighing, and ſo great forgetfulneſs, as ſometimes not to remember to ſhut their Mouths after they have open'd, nor even to take breath, were they not forc'd to it by the danger of ſuffocation. The Conjunct and next Cauſe of this Malady is a putrid Phlegm, whoſe natural coldneſs moiſtens and refrigerates the Brain, whilſt its put refa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive heat kindles a Fever by the vapors carry'd from the Brain to the Heart, and from thence about the whole. Now this Phlegmatick Humor is not detained in the Ventricles of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66371:92"/>
Brain; for then it would cauſe an Apoplexy if the obſtruction were total, and if partial an Epilepſie, wherein the Nerves contract themſelves towards their original for diſcharging of that Matter: But 'tis onely in the ſinuoſities and folds of the Brain, which imbibing that exceſſive humidity, acquires a cold and moiſt intemperature; from whence proceeds dulneſs and liſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs to all Actions. For as Heat is the Principle of Motion, eſpecially when quickned by Dryneſs; ſo is Cold the Cauſe of ſtupidity and ſluggiſhneſs, eſpecially when accompanied with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, which relaxes the parts, and chills their Action. In like manner, Heat or Dryneſs inflaming our Spirits the Tunicles of the Brain, produce the irregular Motions of Frenzy, which is quite contrary to the Lethargy; although it produce the ſame ſometimes, namely, when the Brain after great evacuations acquires a cold and moiſt intemperature; in which caſe the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy is incurable, becauſe it teſtifies Leſion of the Faculty, and abolition of ſtrength: But on the contrary, a Frenſie after a Lethargy is a good ſign, reſolving by its Heat, and diſſipating the cold humors which produce the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That coldneſs being contrary to put refacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Phlegm the coldeſt of all humors, cannot eaſily putrifie in the Brain, (which is cold too of its own nature) much leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Heat ſufficient to communicate it ſelf to the Heart, and there excite a Fever; it being more likely for ſuch adventitious Heat to cauſe in the Brain rather the impetuous motions of a Frenzy, than the dulneſs and languor of a Lethargy. Nor is it leſs then abſurd, to place two enemy-qualities in the ſame Subject, to wit, Cold and Heat, whereof the one cauſes ſleep, the other a Fever; which, I conceive, to precede not to follow the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, and which having raiſed from the <hi>Hypochondres</hi> to the Brain, a Phlegmatick blood mixt with groſs vapors, there cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that obſcuration of Reaſon, and ſluggiſhneſs of the whole Body, but eſpecially the abolition of the Memory, the ſutable temperament for which is totally deſtroyed by exceſſive humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Indeed the troubled Urine, liquid Digeſtions, Tumors and pains of the Neck, bloated Fleſh, and other ſuch ſigns accompanying this diſeaſe, argue that its matter is more in the reſt of the Body than in the Brain, which ſuffers onely by Sympathie.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If it be true that ſleep is the Brother of Death, then the Lethargy, which is a continual drowſineſs, with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and <hi>Delirium,</hi> ſeemes to be a middle Eſtate between Life and Death which is known by the ceſſation of Actions, moſt of which fail in thoſe afflicted with this Evil, which nevertheleſs is leſs then the <hi>Carus,</hi> wherein the ſleep is ſo profound, that the Patient feels not when he is prickt, or call'd by name; but is depriv'd of all Senſe and Motion, ſaving that of Reſpiration, which ſcarce appears in the <hi>Catoche,</hi> or <hi>Catalepſie,</hi> (a ſtranger ſymptom than any of the former) wherein the Eyes remain wide open, the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:66371:92"/>
whole Body ſtiff, and in the ſame ſtate and poſture wherein it hapned to be when it firſt ſeiz'd the ſame. The Cauſe whereof, moſt ſay, is a cold and moiſt humor, obſtructing the hinder part of the Brain; but I rather aſcribe it to a ſudden Congelation of the Animal Spirits, as I do the Lethargy to narcotick and ſomni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous vapors, which are the ſole Cauſes of Inclination to ſleep; which cannot be produced by ſimple, cold, and aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humidity, (for then Water ſhould do it ſooner than Wine, whoſe very ſmell in Preſſes and Cellars cauſes ſleep, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inebriates) but by a fat and oleaginous humidity, ſuch as is found in all Hypnoticks; ſome whereof are hot, as Aniſe and Opium; others Cold, as Lettice, Poppy, and Henbane.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Brain being the Principal of Senſe and Arbitrary Motion, which it derives into all the parts, both the one and the other are offended by the maladies of that part; ſome whereof are without, others, are neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with a Fever: which is either Acute or Gentle, according to the diverſity of the humor producing it, the former commonly proceeding from Choler or Blood, the latter from Phlegm or Melancholy. Amongſt theſe Diſeaſes, thoſe which invade ſuddenly, as the Apoplexy and Convulſions, are cauſed by the obſtruction of the Ventricles, Conſtriction, or Diviſion of the Nerves, which hinders the Flux of the Animal Spirits: but thoſe which arruire in ſome ſpace of time, as the Coma, Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and Carus, proceed either from a ſimple intempeires, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Cold and Moiſt, or elſe joyn'd with ſome Matter, which is oftentimes a Cold Phlegm, whereof the Brain is fruitful: Which coming to be inflamed, by reaſon of its putrefaction cauſed by defect of Tranſpiration, and the Heat of the Brain (which though Cold by its firſt Temper, is yet hot, inaſmuch as animated, and more burning than the Air of Sommer) that Extraneous Heat begets a Fever, which yet is but little violent, and ſo hinders not the Natural Coldneſs of the humor from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the ſleep and ſluggiſhneſs apparent in the Lethargy; which nevertheleſs by is, <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> plac'd amongſt Acute Diſeaſes terminated on the ſeventh day; which time if it exceeds, the Patient recovers, eſpecially if the Matter happen to be diſcharged into the Breſt, and cauſe an Empyema there, or, in ſome others, the Parotides.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the Internal Maladies of the Head are of three forts: Some attaque the Membranes, and cauſe the Cephallagy, Megrim, and other pains of the Head, being very dolorous, by reaſon of the exquiſite ſenſibility of thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, which are either prickt, preſs'd, or too much extended by vapors, wind, or humors, for the moſt part acrimonious and ſerous. Others are in the Cavities and Paſſages of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, whoſe Influence being ſtopt by ſome Matter that obſtruct the Paſſages, they cauſe the ſymptoms of the Leſion of Motion and Senſe in the Vertigo, Palſie, Apoplexy, Epilepſie,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66371:93"/>
Incubus, Convulſions, Trembling, and Catarrhs or Defluxions, to which Man alone of all Animals is ſubject, by reaſon of the quantity of excrements where-with his larger and more elevated Brain abounds: The third ſort which poſſeſs the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Brain, and either onely deprave the functions of the three Prime Faculties, Reaſon, Imagination and Memory, are the ſimple <hi>Delirium,</hi> the Frenzy, Melancholy, Madneſs, and Lycanthropy; or elſe wholly aboliſh them, as in Folly, Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, Forgetfulneſs, the <hi>Catoche, Carus,</hi> and Lethargy, which is caus'd not onely by a Cold Aqueous Phlegm, where-with the Brain is ſoak'd, but alſo by ſuch as is render'd viſcous, thick, and tough, by the ſubſtance of the ſtrange and ſome extraneous heat, which cauſeth the Putrefaction and Fever.</p>

            <p>IF Nature made the Cryſtalline humor of the Eye without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the Tongue without ſavour, the Ear without ſound, to the end they might impartially judge of all Objects offer'd to thoſe Senſes; I know not to whoſe judgement we muſt referr the Deciſion of this Queſtion: Virgins, marry'd people, and thoſe that are not marry'd, being equally intereſſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, lyable to exception. The firſt, profeſſing Hatred of Marriage; The ſecond, unwilling to blame it, for fear of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting their paſs'd Judgement; And the Third, being unfit to judge thereof for want of Experience. If we will credit <hi>Cato,</hi> who had try'd it, and who being one day ſollicited by his Friends to ſecond Nuptials, told them, He had once been deliver'd from Shipwrack, and therefore car'd not for venturing to Sea again; thoſe that never embarque in Marriage will gain the Cauſe, it being the higheſt point of Humane Prudence to be wiſe at the expenſe of others, whoſe example makes them juſtly fear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenienes of a Contract, ſo diſadvantageous to the freedom of Man, as that of Marriage is, wherein there is this peculiarity, that in all other Contracts, ever one party is a gainer; but here both are oftentimes cheated, almoſt alwayes diſcontented with the bargain, and willing to retract, if they had liberty, which hath been retrencht everſince the Law of Divorce was abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that of Grace, for the greater mortifying of Men, and teaching them to ſuffer and ſigh, in ſatisfaction for their ſins, under the heavy yoke of Marriage. Beſides that, the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo much boaſted therein, is ſo rare, as to be almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; partly, becauſe the Will is never carry'd to love an Object but by its full Liberty, and loves leſs upon never ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; and partly, becauſe Converſe ſhews the Marry'd Couple
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66371:93"/>
one another's defects, which being alwayes more then their Virtues, 'tis no wonder if Hatred ariſe thereupon more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than Amity, whatever artifice be us'd to make ſhew of the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, He muſt be a Miſanthropus, and have wholly renounc'd all Humane Sentiments that can blame Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the moſt honourable and ancient Society of the World, founded not onely upon the Divine Law, (which makes it a Sacrament, and a very great Myſtery) and upon that of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by whoſe univerſal Conſent, it hath been honor'd with great Priviledges and Immunities; as on the contrary, Celibacy hath been publickly diſcountenanc'd and puniſh'd: but alſo upon that of Nature, who hath inſpir'd into all Animals a deſire of joyning and coupling together for Generation of their like; which deſire is greater in Men, inaſmuch as he aſpires to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, no otherwiſe attainable in this World but by Marriage, which revives him in his Children. And the pleaſure of them too is ſo great, that he muſt firſt be a Father that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what it is; nor is the yoke of Marriage inſupportable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to ſuch as deſire to live diſſolutely. The Amity ariſing thereupon, if founded upon Virtue and Honor, not upon Beauty, or ſuch other profitable or delightful Good, differs as much from Love, as the continual temperate heat of the Blood and Spirits doth from its ebullition and diſtemper; being alwayes augmented by mutual Offices of either party, rendred with a frankneſs and confidence not found in any other condition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, where there is nothing elſe but Diſſimulation and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. 'Tis in Marriage alone that there is any treating with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Ingenuity; and therefore that State is to be deſir'd, not onely by the miſerable for Conſolation of their Afflictions, but alſo by thoſe who are happy for communicating their Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which is tedious when it hath no partakers.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Our Life is full enough of miſeries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out needing addition of thoſe that commonly attend Marriage; which a Philoſopher, who had triy'd it, ſaid, hath but two good dayes; the firſt, when there is nothing but laughing; and the laſt, which delivers us from that ſad ſlavery; perfectly contrary both to liberty and quiet, (the two greateſt Goods a wiſe Man can enjoy in this Life) which are inconſiſtent with the turmoil of Houſwifrie, and the Cares of Marriage, from which therefore the Brachmans, Gymnoſophiſts, Galli, and Veſtals, and at this day, ſuch as are devoted to God's Service, have been exempted, to the end the better to mind Contemplation and Virtuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; both hard to be done in Marriage, wherein ſcarce any other Virtue is practis'd but Patience, (whereof 'tis the true School) which <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, He had learnt better by the ſcolding of his Wife, than by all the Precepts of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Men would be Vagrants and Stragglers like
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66371:94"/>
wild Beaſts, were it not for Marriage, which is the foundation of the State; for it makes Families, and Families make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths; which, conſequently, owe their Nativity and increaſe to marry'd people, who have a much greater intereſt in the Conſervation of the State, than thoſe that have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe nor Home, as unmarry'd Men ſeldom have. But as there is no compleat Good in this World; ſo Marriage, though a moſt holy and good thing in it ſelf, inſtituted by God in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and during the ſtate of Innocence, hath nevertheleſs its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, not ſo much from it ſelf, as from the fault of the perſons who know not how to uſe it as they ought.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, 'Tis peculiar to Marriage to have nothing ſmall or moderate; every thing in it is extream. 'Tis either full of ſweetneſs and Affection, or of Hatred and bitterneſs; 'tis either a Paradiſe, or a Hell. When 'tis ſuted with all Conditions requiſite, there's no ſtate happier; but when any is wanting, no Infelicity equals it. And becauſe Good requires the integrity of all its conſtituent parts, but Evil comes from the leaſt defect; 'tis no wonder that few or no Marriages are happy, ſince there is none wherein there is not ſomething to be wiſht for, eſpecially when the match is made, (as moſt commonly 'tis) by another's Hand; though 'tis ſtrange, that Men who are ſo circumſpect and wary in other bargains, ſearching, examining, and taking Eſſay of what they buy, ſhould have ſo little Prudence in an Affair of ſuch Conſequence and Danger. There is nothing but a Wife that a Man is oblig'd to keep as long as he lives; but they have been taken at a venture, ſince, at the inſtance of the Roman Dames, the Law of <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> was aboliſht, who had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely built a Temple to Male-Fortune near the <hi>Tyber,</hi> where Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were carefully examin'd. And as tis an intolerable madneſs to engage voluntarily into fetters and a perpetual Priſon, by ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one's ſelf to the Caprichio of a Woman; ſo 'tis great ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in a Man to entruſt his Honor, the chiefeſt of all Goods, to her inconſtant humor, who may render us infamous when the Phanſie takes her. I think therefore, every one ought to conſult himſelf, Whether it be fit for him to marry or not, that is, Whether he believes he ha's Virtue and Conſtancy enough to ſuffer the defects of a Woman, who may be commendable in ſome Point, but at the bottom is alwayes a Woman.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLII. At what time the Rational Soul is infus'd.</head>
            <p>AS Religion obliges us to believe, that the Soul, which is of an Immortal Nature, comes immediately from God, who drawing it out of the Abyſſe of Nothing, at the ſame time creates it in the Infuſing, and infuſes it in the Creating; ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is determin'd abſolutely touching the time in which that infuſion is made. For knowing which, we muſt obſerve that the whole time of the Child's reſiding in the Womb, is divided into four parts; namely, the Conception, Conformation, Motion, and Parturition; ſo diſtinguiſhed between themſelves, that the time of Motion, is about treble to that of Conformation; and the time of Parturition, double to that of Motion. The whole work of Conformation is divided again into four times, according to which the Matter contained is diverſly faſhioned and wrought, and is called Geniture, or Coagulated Milk, Foetus, Embryo; and an Infant when the Conformation of the parts is finiſhed, which is at the thirtieth day for Boyes, and at the forty ſecond for Girles; whoſe leſs Heat and more wateriſh materials, require a longer time for Conformation of their Spermatick parts: After which the Blood arriving, fills the void ſpaces of the Muſcles, Fibres, and other carnous parts, which are not perfectly ſhaped till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the time of Motion, which is the third month for Males, and the fourth for Females; at which time the Second Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ends, and the whole organization is compleated. At firſt, the Infant hath onely a Vegetative Life, by means of which, his parts are generated by the Alteration and Conformation of the Matter, and are nouriſhed, and take their growth not onely by their Attraction from all parts of the Matrix, but alſo by an Internal Vital Principle, which is the Vegetative Soul, reſiding in all fruitful ſeed, and being the ſame with the Formative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Now becauſe the Vegetative or Senſitive Soul is but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, namely a certain Harmony of the Four Qualities, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they eaſily give place upon the arrival of the reaſonable ſoul, which I think happens when the organization of the parts is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, to wit, about the third or fourth month; before which time, the Body not being organized, cannot receive the Soul, (which is the act of an Organical Body) which alſo ſhe forſakes, when, upon any notable ſolution of continuity, the Organs are deſtroyed and aboliſhed oftentimes, though the Temper of the ſimilary parts be not hurt; which conſequently, is not the ſole requiſite for the Infuſion of the Soul, but alſo the convenient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Organs.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the opinion, which introduces the Rational Soul in the firſt days of Conception as ſoon as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:66371:95"/>
neceſſary for receiving it, begins to put on the diverſity of Organs, is the moſt probable; ſince by this means this ſoul dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from others in that it proceeds and makes the diſpoſitions, whereas others follow the ſame and abſolutely depend thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the ſame reaſon which obliges us to acknowledg the Reaſonable Soul after motion, conſtrains us to admit it before; which nothing hinders us from attributing to ſome other cauſe, (as to the Senſitive Soul introduc'd before the Rational) ſaving that cauſes are not to be multiplied without neceſſity, and one Soul alone may ſuffice for Senſe, whilſt yet the defect of Organs allow not the exerciſe of Reaſon. The ſame reaſon ſhews how abſurd it is to aſſign any other cauſe, in the firſt days, of the Vegetative Actions; it being as eaſie to infer the preſence of the Reaſonable Soul by this ſort of actions as by the Senſitive Actions, which may alſo have another cauſe. For the infuſion of the Reaſonable Soul after forty days cannot be proved by actions proper to it (for it reaſons not till long after) nor by the actions of a Soul ſimply; for then you muſt grant that it is there before Organization, which is an action proper to animated things. Moreover, the Soul muſt be admitted in the Body as ſoon as it may be there, which is at the beginning of conception; becauſe even then there wants no fit diſpoſition to this Soul, which needs not any different Organs for the bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vegetative Actions which ſhe then performs, no more then Plants do; nor are different Organs neceſſary to her abſolute exſiſting, ſince God hath created her immaterial and without any dependance: and we ſee the ſimilary parts of the Body are animated; ſo that the diſpoſitions wherewith the Soul can ſubſiſt, and which ſuffice to retain her in the Body, are alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to introduce her thereinto. Now theſe diſpoſitions are no other then the ſame which are requiſite for the actions of the Vegetative Soul. For whatever indiſpoſition happen to the Organs of Senſe and Motion, the Soul abides in the Body till the heat be diſſipated or extinguiſhed; the Organs of Senſe and Motion being not neceſſary to retain the Soul in the Body ſaving in as much as they contribute to reſpiration. Even the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie which aboliſhes all the noble diſpoſitions which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers hold neceſſary to the Soul, never drives her away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be by accident; ſince a Child in his Mothers belly may have that diſeaſe without incommodity, ſaving when it comes to need reſpiration. Now though Organization be not a diſpoſition requiſite to the introduction of the Soul, yet ſhe requires cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others, ſome whereof we know not, as that unexplicable character imprinted in the Seed, beſides the temperament which ſuffices perfectly to determine the matter for introdudion of this form and excluſion of all other. The conformation of Organs being not a diſpoſition which determines neceſſarily (ſeeing amongſt humane bodies ſome differ more from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men in reſpect of the principal parts then they do from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66371:95"/>
certain other Animals) but 'tis the temperament alone, which ariſing in the firſt days after the mixture of the two ſeeds, and according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the <hi>foetus</hi> having in the firſt ſeven days all that he ought to have, this opinion is more pious and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for repreſſing the criminal licenſe of thoſe who without ſcruple procure abortion within the firſt forty days.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Though the Reaſonable Soul be of a much ſublimer nature then the ſouls of other Creatures; yet being created with reference to the Body 'tis not introduced thereinto till the ſame be fitted for its reception; as no other natural form is ever received into a ſubject not previously fitted with all due diſpoſitions. And ſince the Soul is the principle of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hence ſhe needs Organs and Inſtruments for performing them; and the more ſublime ſhe is, the greater preparation doth ſhe require then the Senſitive Soul, as this alſo doth then the Vegetative, which demands only a certain mixture of the firſt qualities, beſides which the ſenſitive requires a more exquiſite temperament of the two Principles of Generation, Seed and Blood, endued with a vital Spirit, capable of producing Senſe and Motion. So that the Reaſonable Soul ought not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, till after the conformation is in all points completed.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Since there is no proportion but between things of the ſame nature, the Immortal Reaſonable Soul cannot have any with the corruptible Body, and ſo not depend more on the matter in its infuſion then in its creation, which is probably the third day after conception; at which time the actions of life appear in nutrition, growth, alteration, and configuration of the parts. Which actions muſt proceed from ſome internal and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated principle; which cannot be the Soul either of Father or Mother, ſince they act not where they are not inherently; nor yet the ſpirit of the Seed which is not a principal agent but only the inſtrument of a Soul; nor the formative vertue, which is only an accident or temper of qualities, and in like manner the inſtrument of ſome more noble agent. 'Tis therefore the Soul contained in the boſom of the matter, which produces all theſe actions therein. They who hold the Reaſonable Soul not introduced till after the two others, conſider not that Forms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no degrees of more or leſs cannot be perfected or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged one into another, much leſs annihilated; ſeeing corruption is cauſed only by contraries, and Forms have none. It follows therefore that the Reaſonable Soul is the principle of all theſe functions; which ſhe performs according to the diſpoſitions ſhe meets with; and that ſhe is the architect of her own habitation.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLIII. Of Metempſychoſis, or Tranſmigration of Souls.</head>
            <p>THough Metemphychoſis, or the Tranſmigration of Souls, be rather imaginary then true; yet becauſe there is nothing which more inriches the Field of Philoſophy then liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reaſoning, we ſhall here inquire whether the Heathen, guided only by the light of Nature had any reaſon to maintain this extravagance; which was firſt taught in <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Pythagoras</hi> who had learn'd it of the Egyptians; by whom and moſt other Nations of antiquity it was believ'd not only that ſouls departed out of ſome bodies re-entered and animated others, but alſo that all things after a certain revolution of Ages ſhould reſume the ſame ſtate wherein they had formerly been. This was alſo the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> ſaving that he was more rational then <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who making three Souls of the ſame quality, ſaid that thoſe of men after death went to animate the bodies of Men, Beaſts, or Plants; for which reaſon he abſtained from the fleſh of Animals, and could hardly reſolve to eat Beans for fear of biting his Fathers head. But <hi>Plato</hi> held the Tranſmigration of Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Souls only into humane Bodies. Which opinion though leſs abſurd then the former (which deſtroys it ſelf by the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it introduces amongſt all natural beings) yet it hath its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences too; ſince the Soul being an incompleat form, making one whole with its other half the Body, it can never meet with one in all points like the firſt; beſides that, were it in another, it would have an inclination towards the firſt, and ſo would not be in ſuch body in quality of a form, but in a ſtate of conſtraint and violence.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the Pythagorical Metemphychoſis is not more abſurd (in regard that being the form gives a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and ſpecifical being to every thing, if humane ſouls paſt into the bodies of Beaſts or Plants, theſe Creatures would be Men;) then that of <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems probable: nothing hindring but that a humane ſoul may enter into another humane body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſſolution and ruine of the former. For if there be any thing to hinder it, it muſt be becauſe there is no return from privation to habit, That which hath ſometimes been, can no more be ſuch as it was, and 'tis impoſſible for a ſoul which hath once informed a body to re-enter it again and there exerciſe the functions of life after having been once totally thence expelled. But theſe Reaſons hinder not, ſeeing the ſoul may be introduced anew into ſome body wherein it is not now, but hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; as Gangraenous and wholly mortified members may be again vivified by a powerful effect of the ſoul and the goodneſs of temperament. Moreover, it is not leſs poſſible for that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:66371:96"/>
which never was to begin to be, then for that which hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been to exſiſt again in nature; ſeeing both being equally pure nothing, they are objects ſufficient to be created by God; as the firſt matter (which is almoſt nothing) is the object of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his inferior; and natural bodies are the objects of Art which is below Nature. So that not only ſouls, after having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed one body, may paſs into an another by Metempſychoſis, but (which ſeems more difficult) the ſame ſoul may again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame body.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, 'Tis impoſſible for one and the ſame thing which hath been to be a new; for then it ſhould be twice and have two durations, and conſequently two exiſtences, and ſo not be one and the ſame thing; ſeeing ſingularity depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exiſtence. So neither can the ſame ſoul return into the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſerted body, although it may re-animate ſome parcels of it, nor yet into other bodies. For in the firſt place, as for the ſouls of Plants and Beaſts, there is no more reaſon to believe that theſe forms diſappearing upon deſtruction of the Organs whereby they exerciſe their functions, go to animate other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſame ſpecies, then that, when my wood is burnt, the ſame form of fire goes to ſeek another faggot and kindle the ſame as ſoon as fit diſpoſitions thereunto ariſe; if it were ſo, the Woodmongers ſhould have a very dangerous Trade. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this tranſmigration of ſouls is either abſolutely neceſſary (that is, bodies are animated no other way but this) and ſo there will be no other new generation, but the ſupernumerary ſouls muſt wait till their turn come, (according as the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick poet <hi>Virgil</hi> repreſents them in the ſixth Book of his <hi>Aeneis</hi>) for if there be more bodies then ſouls, there will be no produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whatever diſpoſition be found in the matter; and then though we ſow the Ground never ſo much with Corn, nothing will come of it, in caſe more be ſown then there are Vegetative Souls to animate it; whence we ſhould be in great danger of Famine. As for the Reaſonable Soul, ſince there is no animated body whoſe outward figure is not an Index of its inward form, were there ſuch a thing as Metempſychoſis, the ſoul of a Horſe ſhould be under the outward form of a Man, and ſo all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg from external ſhape ſhould be deceit and deluſions, far from ſerving for Phyſiogmony. Moreover the Ancients intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Opinion, partly to frighten the wicked, by making them believe that after death their ſouls ſhould do penance in the bodies of Beaſts whoſe manners they had imitated (Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards becoming Hares, and cruel perſons Wolves,) till after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation by the River <hi>Lethe</hi> they ſhould again become men; and partly to excite the good with hopes that their ſouls ſhould be received into the bodies of Heroes and Demi-gods; ſuch fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtories ſerving to keep the more ignorant ſort within their duty.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the ſeparated ſoul carries along with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:66371:97"/>
her, only three powers, the Underſtanding, Will, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty; by means whereof ſhe is carried towards what ſhe deſires by a real local-motion, whereof ſhe is as well capable without as within the body. Now ſhe deſires nothing ſo much as to be united to the body with whom ſhe hath formerly been conjoyned. And conſequently ſhe cannot but return thither of her own accord; ſeeing when the deſire and power meet the effect muſt neceſſarily follow, eſpecially when the deſiring is in a violent ſtate, contrary to its own Nature, as that of the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Soul is; and therefore ſince nothing violent is of long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Soul's ſeparation from her Body cannot be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, If it be true that nothing is made which hath not already been, and that, according to <hi>Origen,</hi> there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Souls produced in the beginning of the Creation, after which it is ſaid, That God reſted from all his Works, and that he creates nothing ſince he put the laſt hand to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the World, (which it borrows from the forms or beauties which it contains) it may ſeem conſentaneous to the ornament of the Univerſe, to ſay that it was at firſt ſtor'd with all the forms, where-with the Matter is informed, according as it comes to have fit diſpoſitions thereunto. And that theſe forms having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and conſequently being incorruptible, upon forſaking their firſt Subject, (through default of fit diſpoſitions to maintain them) are received into other Subjects, like the firſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, as capable of receiving ſuch form, which of it ſelf is indifferent to one Subject as well as to another; but ſince the Rational Soul cannot have any particular Inclination towards the Body it formerly animated, which after Death being no longer Organical, nor capable of being ſo, but onely Duſt and Aſhes; 'tis more probable, that when ſeparated, it reſents motions (if it have any) towards ſome Body duly organized, and not yet furniſhed with a form; there being (beſides) leſs incovenience in ſaying that one and the ſame Soul, can animate divers Bodies one after another, than that it can animate divers at the ſame time, and in divers places, which nevertheleſs is the Opinion of moſt Philoſophers. For when it is ſeparated, it remains ſtill an Act and a Form, capable of informing any ſort of well diſpoſed Body, without affecting any in particular; into which it enters not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ſince Knowledge follows Immaterality, and the Species and Notions being to the Soul, what accidents are to their Subjects from which they are inſeparable, they muſt accompany her where-ever ſhe goes; although by reaſon of the Clouds, and humidities of the Body which ſhe informes, ſhe is not actually knowing in Infancy, but onely proportionably, as in time the Body comes to be dried, and the humidities abſumed, the Species which were ingraven in the Soul begin to appear, and as it were to be produced a new by Reminiſcence, which neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Metempſychoſis.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLIV. Whether there were braver Men in any preceding Age, than in the preſent.</head>
            <p>ALthough this Queſtion, being rather of Fact than of Right, might beſt be diſcuſs'd, by comparing all the great Men of every Age between themſelves, or thoſe of each Age with ours; yet that way would be too long, by reaſon of the great number of Illuſtrious Men who have flouriſh'd downwards to our Age, which is the fifty ſeventh ſince the Creation of the World, (the duration whereof amounts to 5920. years, according to the moſt probable Opinion, which reckons 3683. years and three months to the Nativity of our Lord) the Matter may alſo be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by Reaſon, provided we lay aſide two powerful Paſſions; the one proper to young Men, who alwayes value themſelves above their Predeceſſors, and, like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> think their own little finger ſtronger than the whole Body of their Fathers; the other ordinary to old Men, who alwayes extoll the time paſt above the preſent, becauſe the infirmities of their Bodies and Minds, no longer allowing them the contentment they formerly enjoyed, they know not where to charge the fault but upon Time, though, in truth, it lyes upon Themſelves. For Nature being ſtill as Wiſe and Powerful as heretofore, and the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Cauſes the ſame, their Operations muſt be likewiſe as perfect, and their Effects as excellent in theſe dayes, as they have been in any. Then, as for our Minds, they are ſo far from being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, that they improve more and more in acuteneſs; and being of the ſame Nature with thoſe of the Ancients, have ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage beyond them, as a Pigmy hath upon the ſhoulders of a Gyant; from whence he beholds not onely as much, but more than his ſupporter doth.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, As a Stone hath more force by how much 'tis leſs from the hand that flings it; and generally all Cauſes act more powerful upon their next, than upon their diſtant Effects: ſo alſo Men are leſs perfect proportionally to their remoteneſs from their Source and Original, from whence they derive all their perfection. This decay is chiefly obſerv'd in our bodies, which are not ſo ſound and well-conſtituted, as thoſe of our Anceſtors; and therefore 'tis no wonder if the Souls where-with they are inform'd, have leſs Vigor though the ſame Nature. For although, in order to judge aright of the Excellence of the Souls of one Age compar'd with another, we ought to wave that advantage which the later have over the preceding, by enjoying the benefit of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; whereunto 'tis as eaſie to add, as 'tis to build upon a good foundation, whereof others have firmly lay'd the firſt ſtones and Pillars. Yet, for all thoſe great advantages, there hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66371:98"/>
not in theſe laſt Ages, appear'd any one equal to thoſe grand Perſonages of Antiquity, who have had the vogue in each Art and Science. Moreover, want of things made them more ingenious, and the Experience of many years render'd them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of every thing; whereas now we ceaſe to live, when we but begin to know our ſelves. Indeed they had the true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines and Sciences, whereof we have no more but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; and inſtead of real and ſolid Philoſophy, ſuch as that of the Firſt Ages was, nothing remains to us but an uſeleſs Scholaſtick Gibberiſh, which having been baniſht the Company of all diſcreet people, is ſhamefully confin'd to the incloſure of Colledges, where I am confident the Profeſſors will readily yield to <hi>Socrates, Plato, Lycurgus, Solon,</hi> and the Seven Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> to whoſe Age, which was the year of the World, 3400. I clearly give the prize; there being no indowment of the Mind preferrable to that of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If Wiſdom muſt carry it, there is no Age to be compar'd to that of <hi>Solomon</hi>: but becauſe one Swallow makes not a Spring, I ſhould prefer before it that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> when the Roman Empire was in its greateſt Glory; the rather becauſe our Saviour, the Paragon of all great Men liv'd in it, and <hi>Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, Cato,</hi> beſides many others, flouriſht at the ſame time. Not to ſpeak of the rare Inventions which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo then appear'd; as Malleable Glaſs, and Perpetual Lights, both now unknown.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, If the complaint of the decay of Witts were true and new, the World muſt be very old, ſince <hi>Seneca,</hi> who liv'd 1500. years ago, made the ſame in his time: But if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Wits are not inferior to thoſe of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s time, it will follow, either that the world grows not worſe, as is commonly ſaid, or that long Series of years, which makes above a quarter of the whole Age the world, is taken but for one and the ſame time: In which Caſe, the world muſt be older than religion and truth teach us, before it fell into that decay, wherein we ſee it continue for ſo many Ages. But indeed, 'tis a weakneſs to imagine that Witts diminiſh; our Natural Inclination to deſpiſe what we poſſeſs, and to regret what is paſs'd, making us judge to our own diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that we are leſs perfect than our Anceſtors, and that our Nephews muſt be worſe than our ſelves; whence aroſe that Fiction of Four Ages, differing according to ſo many Metals; the Golden one, by reaſon of its excellence; that of Silver, Braſs and Iron, proportionably, as Men fell from the former Perfection of Soul, and Innocence of Manners. But all this while, 'tis in the beginning of the World that the weakneſs of Man appear'd by ſuffering himſelf to be govern'd by his Wife, and the damnable Reſolution of a Fratricide. Moreover, the Mind of Man being a Power of well Conceiving, Reaſoning, Inventing, and doing other Functions, whereof he is capable, he may arrive to a Supream Degree of Excellence, either by the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66371:98"/>
pure and liberal Will of his Maker, or by the diſpoſition and concurrence of Natural Cauſes, or by Humane Induſtry. So that God, Nature, and Art, the three ſole Agents of this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame as heretofore, they muſt produce the ſame Effects. For God creates not Souls now with leſs advantages and grace than formerly; he is as liberal of his favours as ever, eſpecially in the Ages of Grace. Nor doth Nature and other Second Cauſes contribute leſs to the perfection of Souls than heretofore. And the Humane Soul, however independent of Matter as to its Eſſence, yet is ſo link'd to the Organs of the Body, that it operates well or ill according as thoſe are diverſly affected, which is, what we call Good or Bad Wit, whilſt we judge thereof by the Actions, and not by the Eſſence. For thoſe Organs and Diſpoſitions depend of the Elements and Superior Bodies, which are alwayes the ſame, and conſequently, muſt produce the ſame Effects; and hence, the equal Diſpoſitions of Bodies, will inferr equal perfection of Minds. But as for the difference of Souls ariſing from Art and Inſtruction, undoubtedly, thoſe of our Age are better cultivated than any ever have been in times paſs'd.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, When I conſider the high pitch whereunto ſo many great Men have carry'd the Glory of theſe laſt Ages, I find more wonders than in the preceding; but it pertains onely to the Ages enſuing to make their <hi>Elogiums</hi>; Great Men, whilſt living, being kept down by Envy or Contempt. One Age muſt be let paſs, before we begin to judge of the worth of it; then the following begins to regret what it ſleighted, it being natural to us to ſeek onely what is wanting, and to be diſguſted with plenty. And truly, I think 'tis the multitude of perſons excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all ſort of Arts, and eſpecially in the Sciences, (whereof never were ſo many Doctors, Regents, and Profeſſors, ſeen in one ſingle Age as in this) that makes us leſs eſteem the ingenious that are now living; for 'tis onely rarity that gives price to things, and that made him paſs for a great Clerk a few Ages ago, who could but write and read; he that ſpoke Latine was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, though now 'tis a Tongue almoſt as univerſal, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as the Native. Now Admiration being the Daughter of Ignorance, the eſteem had of moſt of the admired in former Ages, is rather an Argument of the Rudeneſs and Ignorance of the Times, than of the excellence of their Witts. Nor were they better than we in their Manners, but onely more ſimple, and yet culpable of as many Crimes. But were we the more wicked, this were no Argument of want of Witt, which is the matter in queſtion. And if there have been ſometimes a <hi>Ceres,</hi> a <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a <hi>Pallas,</hi> a <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and others, advanc'd to Deities for finding out the way to ſow Wheat, plant Vine-yards, ſpin Wool, and forge Iron; we have had in theſe laſt Ages the Inventors of the Compaſs, the Gun, Printing, the Tubes of <hi>Galileo,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Inventions both more difficult and excellent; the

The Modeſty of thoſe that govern us, (who no leſs hate the vanity of praiſe, than they know how to exerciſe Actions deſerving it) permits me not to ſhew you, that all paſs'd Ages have nothing that comes near the grandeur of their Souls, and that their conduct is the more to be admir'd, in that their buſineſs is both to keep themſelves up with Friends, and give reaſon to Enemies, who alſo help to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, that there are greater Stateſ-men and Captains in this Age, than in any of the preceding.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLV. Of the Serene, which is a hurtful Dew falling in Summer Evenings.</head>
            <p>AS Painters find it harder to repreſent a calm ſmooth Sea, than the rampant foaming billows of a ſtorm, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more variety of Colours, and afford the Pencil more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and as a Hiſtory of Peace is harder to write, and leſs pleaſant to read, than the Troubles and Commotions of Warr: So I think it leſs difficult to deſcribe the ſeveral impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Tempeſts, than thoſe of a calm Air, which nevertheleſs at certain times, produces pernicious Effects; ſo much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in that they proceed from a very ſimple Cauſe, no-wiſe malignant of it ſelf, to wit, from a clear and ſerene Air, free from Clouds and Vapours, which in the Evening being cool'd by the reaſon of the Sun's Elongation, acquires a certain Refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating and Catarrhous quality, call'd by the vulgar, The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene:</hi> becauſe it happens either in the Evening, or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in fair weather, when the Air is ſerene, than when it is pluvious and full of Vapours. Which quality, ſome aſcribe to the Influence of the Stars, eſpecially to the Moon, term'd for that reaſon by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Infrigidans</hi>; which hath indeed a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dominion over all Humid Bodies, particularly, thoſe of Men, who find ſenſible alterations in themſelves, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral faces of that Planet. But becauſe the Heavens diffuſe their Influences upon thoſe that are under covert, as well as upon thoſe that are in the open Air, where onely the Serene is felt; I ſhould rather pitch upon the alterations of the refrigerated Air, which acts but ſo far as it is near us; and 'tis always more proper to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute Effects here below to proximate Cauſes, than to recur to the Heaven, which is but an equivocal Cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid. If Cold were the Cauſe of the <hi>Serene,</hi> the ſame ſhould happen where-ever it were cold, and be more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful according to the vehemency of that quality, as towards Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or Morning, and likewiſe in Winter: Yet the <hi>Serene</hi> is never ſpoken of but in the temperate Seaſons of Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66371:99"/>
and ſome little portion of the Seaſons bordering upon them. Beſides, in Summer the air of our cold Caves ſhould be capable of producing it at mid-noon. Wherefore I cannot think the Serene an effect of bare cold, but of the vapors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the air, howſoever apparently pure, is always charg'd (whence proceeds the diverſity of refractions In the Planets, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at Sun-riſe and Sun-ſet, which is never without ſome clouds) which vapours being deſtitute of the diurnal heat and ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be condens'd, fall down upon our heads juſt as Dew doth, which is produc'd after the ſame manner but of a matter ſomwhat thicker and more copious. And as there is no Dew ſo there is no Serene but in temperate Seaſons, and Regions; never in Winter or the midſt of Summer: for violent cold congeals theſe vapours into Froſt and Ice, and vehement heat diſſipates and conſumes them. The practice of our Ladies (who uſe to remain in the Serene, thereby to whiten their complexion and ſoften their fleſh) ſhows that this evening-air having a cleanſing and levigating vertue muſt be impregnated with a quality like Dew, which is deterſive by reaſon of the ſalt which it drew from the earth; by means whereof it not only whitens Linen and Wax but alſo purgeth Animals, as appears by the fluxes hapning to Sheep driven out to graſs before the Sun has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the Dew; and by Manna, which is nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd dew, and hath a purgative vertue.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Mans body being ſubject to the injuries of all external Agents, receives ſo much greater from the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Air, as the ſame is more neceſſary to life; capable of ſubſiſting for ſome time without other things, but not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Air, which is continually attracted into our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies not only by reſpiration, but alſo by inſenſible tranſpiration through the Pores of the Body, which is pierc'd with holes like a Sieve for admiſſion of air which is taken in by the Arteries in their motion of Diaſtole or Dilatation. And being moſt agile and ſubtle, it eaſily penetrates our Bodies, altering them by the four firſt qualities wherewith it is variouſly impregnated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vicinity of the Bodies environing it, which make the four Seaſons of the Year, wherein it variouſly diſpoſes the bodies upon which it acts, changing even their natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament. And becauſe the parts of a natural day have ſome proportion with thoſe of a year, upon account of the ſeveral changes caus'd by the common and proper revolutions of the Sun; hence the Morning is like the Spring hot and moiſt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temperate, and the Blood then predominates: Noon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles Summer, hot and dry, at which time Choler is in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the following part is cold and dry, Melancholy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to Autumn: the Evening and whole Night, by its coldneſs and humidity which puts Phlegm in motion, is a little Winter, the coldneſs whereof proceeds not from the vapors (which are always accompani'd with ſome extraneous heat,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66371:100"/>
whereby they are retain'd in the Air and kept from falling) but from the bare privation of the heat of the Sun, who, as by his preſence he actually cauſes heat in the Air, ſo by his abſence he cauſes coldneſs in the ſame; which penetrating our Bodies cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd by the diurnal heat, eaſily therein condenſes the vapors which are not yet ſetled or laid, and ſqueeſing them out of the Brain and all the parts (juſt as we do water out of a wet ſpunge) they fall upon the weakeſt parts, where they cauſe a fluxion and pain.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Air being of it ſelf very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, can never do any miſchief, unleſs it be mix'd with ſome extraneous ſubſtances, as Vapors and Exhalations which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually infect the firſt Region wherein we reſide. And becauſe thoſe ſubtle parts of Earth and Water exhal'd into it are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, 'tis not ſtrange if they produce ſuch ſudden and unexpected effects, as we ſee the Serene doth; which is caus'd by vapors rais'd after Sun-ſet by the force of the heat remaining upon the ſurface of the Earth, like thoſe ariſing from heated water after it is taken off the fire: So that the Serene is that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour whilſt it mounts upwards, not when it falls downwards; for it cannot deſcend till it be render'd heavier by condenſation into Water, Clouds or Miſts, which make the Air nubilous and not ſerene, as in this effect it uſes to be. But at their firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they are more volatile, rare, ſubtle, and inviſible.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the chief cauſe of this hurtful accident, is the change of one contrary into another without <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> which is always incommodious to Nature; who for that reaſon conjoyns all extreams by ſome <hi>mediums,</hi> which ſerve for diſpoſitions to paſs from the one to the other without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. And as the alteration of the body from cold to hot is painful, (witneſs thoſe who hold their cold hands to the fire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handling of Ice) in like ſort that from hot to cold is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious; whence the hotter the preceding day hath been, the more dangerous is the ſerene; becauſe the pores of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being open'd, and all the humors diſorder'd and mov'd, by the diurnal heat, the cold inſinuates into and works upon the ſame with more liberty; juſt as heated water is ſooneſt frozen by reaſon its parts are more open'd by the heat, and conſequently more capable of receiving the impreſſions of Agents. Which is alſo the reaſon why the firſt cold hurts us rather then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt froſts, namely, becauſe it finds the body more open, then enſuing hard weather doth. So though in Winter the air be colder, yet becauſe 'tis almoſt continually the ſame, it makes leſs impreſſion in the evening upon our bodies already accuſtomed to its rigor: and though the air is colder at midnight then at Sun-ſet, yet the ſerene is only at the beginning of the night, when our bodies more ſenſibly receive alteration from the ſame. Wherefore 'tis only the ſudden change of the air which makes the ſerene, whereof our bodies are the more ſenſible according
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66371:100"/>
to the openneſs of the pores and of the futures of the head, and the ſoftneſs of the fleſh, which renders the body obnoxious to external cauſes, as hardneſs (which ſecures it from them) makes it ſubject to internal cauſes, through want of tranſpiration. Hence Peaſants, Souldiers and all ſuch as are hardned by labour and are of a firm and conſtant conſtitution, feel no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the Serene, although they breathe an air more ſubtle, and conſequently more capable of being impregnated in the evening with qualities noxious to the body.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLVI. Whether the French are Light and Inconſtant; and why?</head>
            <p>THere is no more perfect Mirror of Inconſtancy, then Man; as appears by the pleaſure his body takes in the change of Paſture, his mind in that of Objects, and both in that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Hence men look not upon preſent honours but as ſo many ſteps whereby to aſcend to new; the poſſeſſion of preſent goods bringing no other ſatisfaction then that of their Stomack, that is, till a ſecond Appetite be excited by new Meats. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the nimbleneſs of their volatile Spirits, the fluidity and mobility, of their humours which conſtitute the temperament, too notoriouſly furniſh the efficient and material cauſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire elſewhere for them; for which reaſon the melancholick are leſs ſubject to this defect; this earthy humour being leſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of change, whence they prove more wiſe. But amongſt all Nations there is none to whom the vice of Levity is more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then to the French. <hi>Caeſar</hi> who had long convers'd with them, frequently objects the ſame to them, and experience ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews by what is paſs'd that they are very far from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of other Nations, as not only their Statutes and Edicts which they cannot long obſerve, but all their Modes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and their deſire of novelty abundantly teſtifie. The cauſes whereof are either from the Climate or the Soil. For 'tis obſerv'd that where the Heaven is always in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as toward the Poles; or where the Sun heats almoſt in the ſame degree as near the Equator (which makes the days and nights equal), the Manners and Inclinations of the People are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo equal: on the contrary, thoſe that by the ſeveral remotions and approaches of the Sun have different conſtitutions of Air, receive ſutable impreſſions from the ſame, which are afterwards manifeſted in their actions. And becauſe what is below is the ſame with what is on high, the Earth conſequently partakes of the ſame alterations which the Heaven produces in the Air, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66371:101"/>
retains them longer: Thus our Soul being heated and cooled, moiſtned and dry'd in one and the ſame day, ſuffering contrary changes in a very little time; 'tis no wonder if the Aliments it affords make the parts, humors, and ſpirits, like it ſelf, that is to ſay, flitting, inconſtant, and mutable; which parts being communicated from Father to Son, can no more be chang'd by us, even by Travels and Alteration of Soil, than the Moor can change his ſkin which the temper of his native climate hath in like manner given him. Add hereunto, that the French Courteſie, receiving all ſtrangers more civilly than any Nation of the World, is alſo more eaſily lead by their perſwaſions and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: And whereas the roughneſs and ruſticity of many other people thinks ſhame and ſcorn to change, (as implying prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ignorance) the ſincerity and frankneſs of the French is ſuch, that he eaſily alters his Mind and way as ſoon as another ſeems better to him than his own: other Nations, (what-ever Pride they take in being always conſtant and equal to themſelves, and eſpecially more patient than we in our Adverſities) ſurpaſſing us onely in this particular, that they better know how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their diſcontents.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Lightneſs of Minds is, like that of Bodies, reſpective onely, not abſolute. And as Air is term'd Light, in reſpect of Water and Earth; ſo dull people, thoſe of the North, and ſuch others as would have gravity alone in words, geſtures, and actions, paſs for Wiſdom, call the French light, becauſe they are more nimble and active then themſelves; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally what others are onely in appearance, affect not that falſe maſk of Wiſdom, whereof they poſſeſs the ſolidity and Body, whilſt theſe content themſelves with enjoying its ſhadow and ghoſt. For 'tis not the change of habits or modes that argues that of the Mind, but in great Matters, as Religion and State, in maintaining whereof, the French may be affirm'd more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant than any Nation. 'Tis not an Age yet, ſince <hi>France</hi> bad reaſon to glory, (as well as in Saint <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time) of never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving produc'd Monſters, but of planting the Faith well amongſt all its Neighbors, whoſe rigorous Inquiſition is leſs a teſtimony of the Conſtancy, than of the lightneſs or baſeneſs of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſince they are kept in their Religion by fear of the Wheel and the Gallows. Then as for the State, the French Monarchy is the ancienteſt in the world, and hath been always maintain'd amidſt the ruines and downfalls of other States, by the exact obſervation of its fundamental Laws; which is an eminent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Conſtancy of the French; the Nations who have moſt charg'd them with this Vice, ſhewing themſelves the moſt inconſtant, whilſt this puiſſant body of <hi>France</hi> remains always like it ſelf; which it could not do, if the members which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were light and inconſtant, the greateſt Vice where-with they can aſperſe us. For ſince, according to <hi>Seneca,</hi> Wiſdom is always to will and not-will the ſame things; Inconſtance and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66371:101"/>
Irreſolution, in willing ſometimes one thing, ſometimes another, is a certain teſtimony of Folly, Imprudence, and weakneſs of Mind; which coming to change, intimates either that it took not its meaſures aright, nor apprehended the fit means of attaining to the propoſed end, or that it had not Courage and Reſolution enough to go through with its deſignes. And not onely he who hath an inconſtant and flitting Spirit is incapable of Wiſdom, which requires a ſettled Mind, not mutable like that of the Fool, (who, as the Scripture ſaith, changes like the Moon) but alſo of all ſort of Virtue, which conſiſting in a mediocrity, is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable but by Prudence which preſcribes its Bounds and Rules, and by Stability and Conſtance which arms the Mind againſt all difficulties occurring in the way of Virtue; in which, as well as in the Sciences and Arts, the French having more ſhare than any other Nation, 'tis injurious to accuſe them of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, 'Tis not more vanity to believe one's ſelf perfect in all things, than temerity in going about (upon blind paſſion for his Country) to exempt it from a Vice, whereof all ſtrangers, who know us better than we do our ſelves, are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agreed. Let us confeſs therefore that we are inconſtant, ſince, in compariſon of the Vices of other Neighbouring Nations, this will not onely appear light, but make it doubtful, whether it be a Vice, ſince 'tis grounded upon Nature, which is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual change; whereby ſhe appears more beautiful and agreeable than in identity and reſt, which, is not found even in the prime Bodies and univerſal Cauſes, which as well as others, are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual mobility and change, which is no-wiſe contrary to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which requires that we accommodate our ſelves to the circumſtances of places, perſons, and times, which alter inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, and that we conſequently alter our Concluſions according thereunto; beſides that, change of Opinion is a teſtimony of a free and ingenuous Spirit, as that of the French is; and it may be attributed to the power of example, in a people environ'd with ſundry Nations extreamly different, and conſiſting of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are imbu'd with the qualities of them all. For this Country lying under the forty third degree, and the forty eighth, the mixture of theſe people, which partake a little of the Southern, and a little of the Northern Neighbours; ſometimes conforms to the modes of one, ſometimes to thoſe of the other: And as in the change of Colours, the difference is not ſeen but in the two extreamities, thoſe of the middle appearing changeable and diverſifi'd; ſo <hi>France</hi> ſituated between the Germans, Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Spaniards, mixing and tempering in it ſelf the qualities of thoſe Nations which are in its extreamities, appears to them changeable and uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Though the French are not more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant than others, yet their boyling and impetuous humor, and the quickneſs of all their Actions having made them be eſteemed
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66371:102"/>
ſuch by all their Neighbors, I ſhall rather refer the Cauſe thereof to their abundance of Spirits, which are the ſole Motors and Principles of all Actions, (produc'd by the purity of their Air, and the variety of their Aliments) than to the Aſpects of Heaven, or ſuch other Cauſes; ſince Nations under the ſame parallel, with <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Podolia, Hungary, Tartary,</hi> and many others, ſhould be ſubject to the ſame Vice, which was ſometimes imputed to the Grecians, the moſt fickle and inconſtant of all people; without referring the Cauſe to the Winds, as <hi>Cardan</hi> held, that ſuch as are moſt expos'd thereunto, to have volatile Spirits; otherwiſe the French, and other Nations, ſubject to Winds, ſhould quit their levity when they came into Climates leſs windy.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLVII. Of the ſundry Motions of the Sea and Rivers.</head>
            <p>NOthing raviſhes us more than the Motion of Inanimate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; <hi>Automata,</hi> or Bodies moving by Artifice, having in the beginning made Idolaters, who were undeceived when they came to know the Springs of them. But above all, the Motions of the Sea ſeem the more marvellous, in that they are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and contrary. And they are of two ſorts; One Internal, and common to all heavy Bodies, whereby the Water deſcends downwards, the agitated Sea becomes calm by returning to its level, and Rivers follow the declivity of the Lands through which they paſs: The other, violent, which is either irregular, (render'd ſo by the irregularity of the Winds) or regular; which again is of two ſorts, namely, that of reciprocation in the flux and reflux of the Sea, and that which depends upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the World, being either from Eaſt to Weſt, or from North to South. 'Tis true, Water being naturally fluid and moveable, and not to be contain'd within its own bounds, it were more ſtrange if this great Body were immoveable, than to ſee it move, as it was neceſſary it ſhould for Navigation, and to avoid corruption. The wonder onely is, to ſee in one ſole Body ſo great a diverſity of Motions, whereof onely the firſt is natural to it; the others ariſe from ſome extrinſick Cauſes; amongſt which, none acting more ſenſibly upon the Elements than the Celeſtial Bodies, 'tis to the diverſity of their Motions, that thoſe of the Sea muſt be imputed, but particularly, that of its flux and reflux, which being regular, and always alike in one and the ſame Sea, cannot proceed but from as regular a Cauſe, ſuch as the Heaven is, and chiefly the Moon, which manifeſtly exerciſes its empire over all Humid Bodies, the flux and reflux
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66371:102"/>
following the Lunar Periods and Motions, not onely every ſix months, to wit, during the two Aequinoxes when their Tides are very high, but alſo every month in the Conjunction and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Moon, and alſo every ſix hours of the day, almoſt all Seas have their flux and reflux, except ſome which make the ſame in more or leſs time, and are longer in their reflux than their flux; or on the contrary, according to the declivity and various winding of the Lands, the greatneſs or ſmallneſs of Creeks, the Streights of the Seas, narrowneſs of banks, and other differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of ſituation.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the Sea, being a ſimple body, can have but one natural Motion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of its own weight, which makes it flow into places lower than its ſource, which it can never ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount. Amongſt the other three Motions proceeding from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that from Eaſt to Weſt is diſcern'd by the time ſpent in Voyages at Sea, which is much longer from Weſt to Eaſt, than from Eaſt to Weſt: becauſe in the firſt, they move contrary to the Motion of the Sea, and in the ſecond with it. Now the cauſe hereof is the impreſſion of the Firſt Mover upon all the Orbes and Inferior Bodies, which follow the rapidity of its daily Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Eaſt to Weſt upon the Poles of the World. That from North to South, is likewiſe ſeen in moſt Seas, and chiefly in the <hi>Euxine,</hi> which being fill'd by the <hi>Palus Maeotis,</hi> and the <hi>Tanais,</hi> diſcharges it ſelf by the <hi>Aegaean,</hi> into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; which, were it not for the high ſluces of <hi>Africa,</hi> would continue the ſame Motion Southwards: Which ſometimes hindred <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> from digging that ſpace of Land which is between the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> for fear leſt this latter ſhould overflow thoſe Southern Countries. The Cauſe of this Motion, is the multitude of Waters towards that Pole, whoſe coldneſs not raiſing ſo great a quantity of Vapors and Rains as towards the South, the Waters come to be greater there, and ſo are forc'd to fall towards the lower places. Or rather, (ſince there is the ſame cold under the Antarctick Pole, and conſequently, the ſame quantity of Waters and Rains) this deſcent of the Waters Southwards, muſt be attributed to the Elevation of the Earth in the North, or to the narrow mouths or gulphs of thoſe Seas which make the waters deſcend out of them more eaſily than they enter into them. As to the flux and reflux, which is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but regular Motion, it cannot proceed from Vapors, or from inconſtant and irregular Winds, but from the Motion, Light, and particular Influence of the Moon; which attracting the Sea in the ſame manner that the Load-ſtone doth the Iron, is the Cauſe of its accumulation, or ſwelling and increaſe, which makes the flux: And then her Virtue abating by her elongation, the Waters by their proper weight reſume their level, and ſo make the reflux. And becauſe all Seas are continuous, the Moon when under our Horizon, ceaſes not to cauſe the ſame Motions in our Seas, as when ſhe is above it; the Waters neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66371:103"/>
the motion of thoſe which are next them, which would be alike in all did not ſome variation ariſe from the different ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations of Lands, which is the cauſe that the flux and reflux of the Ocean is more ſenſible then the Mediterranean, and in this the Adriatick, then the Tuſcan, by reaſon that <hi>Sicily</hi> and the point of <hi>Italy</hi> makes the Sea enter impetuouſly into the Gulph of <hi>Venice</hi>; wherein is obſerv'd another particular motion call'd Circulation, whereby the Mediterranean flowing by its proper motion from Eaſt to Weſt, and meeting immediately at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of that Gulph the Coaſt of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> diſcharges it ſelf impetuouſly thereinto and continues its motion to the bottom of the Gulph, whence being repercuſs'd it returns by the oppoſite Coaſt of <hi>Calabria</hi> to the other point of the Gulph by which it enters into the Tuſcan Sea. Hence, to go from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Otran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> they take the Coaſt of <hi>Galabria</hi>; and to return back, that of <hi>Macedonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Nothing ſo ſtrongly argues the mobility of the Earth as the motions of the Sea and Rivers: for what elſe were it but a miracle if water contain'd in an immoveable veſſel ſhould agitate and move it ſelf. That of Rivers proceeds not from their weight, which makes them fall into a place nearer their Centre; ſeeing that in a declivity requiſite to the courſe of a River for 200 leagues, there muſt then be a depreſſion more ſenſible then the altitude of the higheſt Mountains of the Earth, nor could the Sea remit the waters to their Springs (as the holy Scripture ſaith it doth) if thoſe Springs were higher then it. But ſuppoſing the motion of the Earth, 'tis eaſie to render a reaſon of that of the Water. As for Rivers, (almoſt all which run weſtward) the Earth having its Diurnal Motion from Weſt to Eaſt (according to the Hypotheſis of <hi>Copernicus</hi>) may cauſe this their contrary motion by ſubtracting it ſelf from the fluidity of the waters (liquid bodies not exactly following the motion of ſolid) as the water in a Tub riſes in the ſide oppoſite to that towards which you ſway the Veſſel. By the ſame reaſon alſo the Sea ſhall have its courſe from Eaſt to Weſt, which is therefore very ſenſible between the two Tropicks where the rapidity of the Earths motion is greater then under the Poles. Hence upon this account Navigation is very eaſie Weſtward, the Currents very violent, the Tides great towards the Coaſt of <hi>America</hi>: as is obſerv'd chiefly in <hi>Magellan's Streight,</hi> where the refluxes of the Northern and Eaſtern Sea are advanc'd above 70 leagues; and the <hi>Mar del Sur</hi> ſcarce goes to 25, and that weakly: but about the Poles the Sea hath no other motion but that which is caus'd by Winds and Tempeſts. As for the flux and reflux of the Sea, according to the ſame ſuppoſition, of its motion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the annual in the Ecliptick (where others make the Sun circulate) and the Diurnal upon its own Axis and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Centre there ariſes a certain irregular motion, ſometimes ſlower and ſometimes ſwifter, which is the cauſe of that flux
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66371:103"/>
and reflux: for as in a Boat mov'd at firſt ſwiftly and then caus'd to move ſomwhat ſlower, the water contain'd therein ſwells in its extremities till by continuation of that motion it recover its le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and the Boat being again driven with the ſame velocity, the water ſwells again upon the change of the motion: the ſame comes to paſs upon the unequal motion of the Earth mixt of the annual and diurnal. But becauſe the Moon being annex'd to the Earth exactly follows its motions; therefore moſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have taken the Moon for the cauſe of the flux and reflux, although ſhe be only the ſign of it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That according to this Hypotheſis 'tis eaſie to render a reaſon of two things very remarkable in <hi>Danubius</hi> and <hi>Nilus.</hi> The firſt which runs from Weſt to Eaſt, is obſerv'd in <hi>Hungary</hi> to move ſlower about Noon then at other hours of the day, as appears by the Water-mills which grinde leſs at that time: becauſe the motion of the Earth being then contrary to that of the Ecliptick, it conſequently appears more ſlow. And as for the other effect, namely, the increaſe and inundation of <hi>Nilus,</hi> which begins at the Summer Solſtice, this River run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning directly from South to North from, one Tropick to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is juſt the middle part of the Earth, when it comes to incline its Axis and return the Antarctick part to the Sun, the ſtream of this River, which is contrary to that motion, waxes ſlower; and being beſides augmented by the continual Rains of Summer, ſwells and overflows the Plains of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Which made ſome Ancients imagine that the North Winds blew again the ſtream at that time and forc'd the water back upon themſelves.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLVIII. Whether is better, to Love, or to be Lov'd.</head>
            <p>THe ſame Nature, which by an inſtinct common to us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things in the world, cauſes us to ſeek our own good, obliges us likewiſe to Love, when we meet Goodneſs or Beauty in an object capable to render us happy by its poſſeſſion; which conſiſting in being united to the thing lov'd, 'tis in this union that the Lover places his greateſt felicity, and accordingly goes out of himſelf to joyn himſelf to what he loves; the motions of the will (of whoſe number Love is) differing in this point from the actions of the Underſtanding, that theſe are perform'd by the Species receiv'd by mediation of the Senſes into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, which cannot know any thing but what comes home to it; but the Will when it Loves, muſt go out of it ſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come united to the thing it Loves, to the end to beget ſomthing for Eternity. And becauſe things are not known by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66371:104"/>
till they have been firſt purifi'd from the groſsneſs of their matter by the illuſtration and abctraction which the Agent Intellect makes of their Phantaſms or Species, hence the notions of the fouleſt and moſt diſhoneſt things are always fair and laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being ſpiritualis'd and made like the Faculty which knows them. On the contrary, the Will in loving renders it ſelf like the object which it Loves, is turn'd into its nature, and receives its qualities; if the object be unlawful and diſhoneſt, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes vicious and its love is criminal. Which ſeems to argue that the Lover is leſs perfect then the Loved, into which he is transform'd; as food is leſs perfect then the body, into which it is converted. And as that which attracts is more excellent then what is attracted, becauſe the ſtronger draws the weaker; ſo the thing Loved muſt be more excellent and noble then the Lover, whom it attracts to it ſelf. Moreover, Love, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Plato,</hi> is a deſire of Pulchritude, which deſire implies want; and therefore he that Loves ſhews thereby that he wants ſome perfection, which renders the thing Lov'd amiable: ſince the Will is never carri'd to any object but what hath ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs either apparent or real. Only God loves not his Creatures for their goodneſs, ſince they have none of themſelves; but his will being the cauſe of all things, he renders them good by loving them and willing good to them.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Since friendſhip conſiſts in the union of two, or at moſt, of three Wills, whoſe mutual correſpondence makes that agreeable harmony and thoſe ſweet accords, which make raviſhing Lovers dye in themſelves to live in what they love; there is no true love but what is reciprocal; which is the reaſon why none can be contracted with inanimate things, no more then with Beaſts or Fools. And Juſtice commanding us to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as much as is given us; 'tis a great injuſtice not to love thoſe that love us; yea, if we may believe the Platoniſts, 'tis a kind of homicide of the Soul; ſince he that loves, being dead in himſelf and having no more life but in the thing lov'd, if that refuſes his love, by means whereof it ſhould live alſo in him as he in it, he is conſtrain'd either to dye or languiſh miſerably. And whereas he that loves is no longer his own but belongs to the thing lov'd to whom he hath given himſelf, this thing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to love him by the ſame reaſon that obliges it to love it's ſelf and all that pertains thereunto. But though perfect love be compos'd of theſe two pieces, to love and to be lov'd; yet the one is often found without the other, there being many Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wounded with the Poets leaden Arrows, who inſtead of ſeeing their love requited with love, have for all recompenſe nothing but contempts and, refuſals. 'Tis true, that it being harder to love without being lov'd, then to be lov'd without loving, there is no body but would chuſe rather to be lov'd then to love upon thoſe terms, becauſe nothing flatters our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ſo much as to ſee our ſelves ſought unto. Yet loving is a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66371:104"/>
nobler thing then to be lov'd; ſince honor being more in the honorer then the honored, the honor receiv'd by the lov'd thing reflects upon him that loves; who for that reaſon being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by every one that eſteems a good friend as a good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not he that is lov'd, is alſo more excellent and hath more vertue, inaſmuch as he hath more honor and praiſe which are the attendants of vertue. Moreover, the Lover acts freely, and therefore more to be valu'd then the lov'd perſon, who is forc'd to ſuffer himſelf to be lov'd. For though deſire common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow Senſual Love, yet Love is not a deſire, nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſign of Indigence; otherwiſe, it ſhould ceaſe with the deſire, and expire after enjoyment; which is falſe: for Mothers love their dead Children, and even before they came into the world, not by a deſire but by a motion of Nature, which cauſes us to love what appertains to us, and the more if it coſt much pain; which is the reaſon why Mothers, who contribute more to the birth of their Children, and have better aſſurance that they are their own, love them alſo more tenderly then Fathers do.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That to compare the lov'd perſon with the Lover, is to equal the Maſter with the Servant; for the amorous aſſuming to themſelves the quality of Servants of the Ladies whom they call their Miſtreſſes, manifeſt ſufficiently thereby that they yield them the pre-eminence. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be the moſt intereſſed in this cauſe; yet they will never have the vanity to prize themſelves above what they love; which would be to condemn their own choice and their love of defect of judgment, which making them ſigh after the enjoyment of the object they adore, argues their want and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, not to be ſupply'd by poſſeſſion of the good they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from it; which herein like the Intelligences which move without being mov'd themſelves, excites paſſions and motions in the Lover's breaſt, it ſelf oftentimes remaining immovable. And as he acts in a more noble way that moves without being mov'd, becauſe he reſembles the end, which is the nobleſt of all the Cauſes; ſo he that loves reſembles Matter which Deſires all Forms, expecting its perfection from them; and conſequently is inferior to the perſon that is lov'd, as from whom he expects his felicity. Even in Mutual Love, he that begins is leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as confeſſing by that addreſs ſome inviting accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the other, who finds not any obligation to love him again but the conſideration of gratitude: For inferring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thoſe that love from the nobleneſs of their ſubject, as in Gods love to his Creatures, and that of Parents to their Children; I anſwer, that 'tis rather an effect of paſſion then of true love.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Love is according to the variety of its Object, (Good), three-fold; conſidering either Profit, or Pleaſure, or Vertue. In the two former, 'tis better to be lov'd then to love, but they are of no long duration; thoſe friends
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66371:105"/>
being wont to break as ſoon as they ceaſe to find their market or the contentments which they receive from thoſe to whom they pretended kindneſs. In honeſt friendſhip (which alone deſerves that name, being founded only upon vertue, which makes it durable) though 'tis not poſſible to love without being lov'd, becauſe vertuous perſons being alike mutually love and agree well together; yet ſince this Amity, before it can become ſuch muſt be cemented by frequentation, without which they cannot underſtand, nor conſequently love one another, becauſe love ariſes from knowledg, it may be demanded whether the active love of him that loves firſt be better then the paſſive of the other who is lov'd. Which Queſtion I determine for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe he contributes moſt to the enſuing friendſhip, by laying the foundations of it. For friendſhip, as well as other things, is preſerv'd by the ſame means that produce it, namely, by loving. And as the Agent is nobler then the Patient, as concurring more conſiderably to the perfection of the work; ſo he that loves being the Agent is more perfect then the Perſon lov'd, who is the Patient. Alſo to love is to wiſh and do good; to be lov'd, is to receive it: But 'tis more honorable and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to give then to receive; which is a ſhameful action: and therefore he that receives never deſires witneſſes. Hence, as he that do's a benefit loves more then he that receives it, as the Artificer loves his work more then his work loves him, and a Creditor deſires his Debtor's ſafety more then on the contrary; in like manner he that loves is more excellent then he that is lov'd, Love being not ſo much a teſtimony of indigence as abundance, becauſe 'tis a deſire of communicating; and the more goodneſs a Being hath, the more it is communicative and diffuſive.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXLIX. Of Hair.</head>
            <p>OF the different parts of Man's Body ſome are abſolutely neceſſary, others only for convenience or ornament, as the Hair, wherewith wiſe Nature hath adorn'd the Head (his nobleſt part) whoſe nudity would have been indecorous; whence people are aſham'd of baldneſs, which is alſo threatned by God as a curſe to the Daughters of <hi>Sion.</hi> The good man <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> had ſufficient patience to endure <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s perſecutions for a long time, but not to ſupport the affront of the little Children of <hi>Bethel</hi> who call'd him bald-pate; and upon his curſe forty two of them were torn in pieces by two Bears which came out of the neighbouring Woods; God by that means avenging the injury done to the nobleſt part of this Prophet, namely the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66371:105"/>
Head; upon which 'tis alſo the cuſtom to place Crowns: and becauſe 'tis the Manſion of the Rational Soul, our Lord forbids ſwearing by it The Superincumbent Hair receives by that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity ſome particular and myſterious dignity, which hath made it ſo eſteem'd, that not onely the Ancients offer'd it in ſacrifice to their Deities, eſpecially when they were toſs'd by Tempeſts of Sea, and burnt it upon the death of Friends; but alſo the <hi>Nazarens</hi> who were the Religious, or Monaſticks among the <hi>Jews,</hi> were particularly prohibited by God to cut it; wherein likewiſe <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s ſtrength, <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Beauty, and, according to the Poets, <hi>Niſus</hi>'s happineſs conſiſted. But above all, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Majeſty in the Beard, which is reſerv'd onely to Man, as beſt ſuting with the gravity of his manners. A large Beard was ever counted the character of Wiſdom, and as ſuch choſen by Philoſophers as a badge of their profeſſion. Hence <hi>Diogenes</hi> to one that aſk'd him, Why he wore ſo long a Beard, anſwerd, To the end, that beholding it, I may remember that I am a Man, not a Woman. For though Wiſdom and Folly be found in all Ages, and there be as many old fools as young hair-brains, yet the Beard is a ſign of Experience, which principally renders Men wiſe. Natural Reaſon ſeems alſo to prove, that thoſe that have Beards are wiſer, and leſs impetuous than thoſe that have not yet put them forth; inaſmuch as the fumes and fuliginoſities, which are the matter of Hair, being ſtill inclos'd in the latter, make them more inconſiderate and raſh. Yea, were it onely for ſhew, I ſhould conclude in favor of great Beards, which at leaſt have this good that they make Men appear wiſe, though they be not ſo. And as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſaid of long Hair, that it adds handſomneſs to them that are handſome, and covers the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of them that are not, whom alſo it renders terrible to their Enemies; ſo large Beards ſerve for Ornament to thoſe that are already wiſe, and make them conſiderable that are not ſo overmuch.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Hair is the Symbol of Thought, deriv'd from the ſame Brain, and as various in conceit and faſhion; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions having chang'd modes for Hair and Clothes accordingly, as they have fancy'd more becommingneſs and ſutableneſs in one faſhion than in another. Four hundred years together there was no Barber at <hi>Rome,</hi> the firſt being carry'd thither from <hi>Sicily</hi> by <hi>Ticinius Menas,</hi> Anno <hi>V. C.</hi> 454; and after that time 'twas accounted with them a note of barbarity and extream deſolation to let their Hair and Beards grow, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did after the defeat of <hi>Varus.</hi> The French have been as mutable in this matter as in any other; Their Kings of the two firſt Races, wearing long buſhes of Hair, in token of liberty. And ſince <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, who ſhav'd his Hair upon occaſion of a wound in his Head, and let his Beard grow to hide the deformity of ſcarrs remaining in his Face after other wounds; ſhort Hair and long Beards began to be in requeſt, and continued ſo till our Age, wherein Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66371:106"/>
are more the mode than ever; which being to be grounded upon convenience or ſeemlineſs, I ſee nothing that can juſtifie the great buſh but Caprichio and Example. For Hair being a ſuperfluous Excrement, its exorbitant greatneſs cannot but be incommodious and prejudicial to Health, and the good Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Brain; the fuliginous vapors whereof, being reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd by the abundance of Hair, cauſe Vertigoes and pains of the Head, not more certainly cur'd than by ſhaving the Head. As for ſeemlineſs, much Hair is rather frightful than handſome, and our Anceſtors were no leſs comely perſons than we, though they wore ſhort Hair; as at this day alſo do many warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Enemies of ſoftneſs and delicacy, whereof great Hair is a moſt certain token, being proper to Women, as on the contrary, the long Beard is a note of Virility. For inaſmuch as he that loves, conformes as much as poſſible to what he loves, we may judge of the ſoftneſs and diſſoluteneſs of the manners of this time, by the deſire Men have to render themſelves as like Women as they can, by wearing (like them) much Hair and little Beard: For when Men wore ſhorter Hair, long Beards were in requeſt; and when the Hair ha's been long, the Beards have almoſt ever been ſhort; the length of the one recompencing the brevity of the other, which would otherwiſe render Men hideous.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid. If ever 'twas true that Cuſtom is a Tyrant, 'tis in this Caſe, no variation having been ſo much as in matter of Hair. The <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> wore both Hair and Beard long, thereby to terrifie their Enemies. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe Hair is much commended by <hi>Homer,</hi> kept it long, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from their ſlaves, who were ſhorn, as at preſent are Galley-ſlaves, Artizans, and Monaſticks for Humility; whom alſo <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> caus'd to ſhave their Hair and Beard in the year 1160, according to the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon of the Fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which forbids Clerks to wear either Locks or Beards. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> wear their Hair long, and ſhave off their Beards. The <hi>Maxii,</hi> a people of <hi>Africa,</hi> are ſhorn on one ſide of the Head, and let the Hair grow on the other. The <hi>Abaudi,</hi> had the fore-part onely ſhaven, the <hi>Antii</hi> contrary. The <hi>Arabians</hi> ſhave even their Daughters round about, leaving a Lock on the top. The <hi>Armenians</hi> ſhave their Hair into the form of a Croſs; but there is ſomething more majeſtical in the Beard than in the Hair, and even Animals fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht there-with, ſeem to have ſome ſort of gravity more than others. Hence ſuch as have affected the title of Wiſe, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuffer'd their Beards to grow; but the <hi>Ephori</hi> made the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> cut theirs, as alſo <hi>Alexander</hi> and many Captains did their Souldiers, leſt their Enemies might catch hold of them. But as the caprichio of perſons of authority, eſpecially Courtiers, gives the firſt model of faſhions, particularly, as to Hair and Beard; ſo to wear ſhort Hair now every one's reaches to his waſte; or a magiſterial ſpade Beard, now all are cloſe ſhaven,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66371:106"/>
(except ſuch whoſe Age and Condition exempts them from this Rule) were for a Man to make himſelf taken notice of, for things which bring no commendation: which hath no place in diſcreet Minds, but argues a phantaſtical and humorſome perſon, who is commonly appointed contrary to the Modes; whereof the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent continually out-vie the Antient.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Hair, which is rather the leavs and boughs, than (as <hi>Plato</hi> held) the roots of Man's Body, (which he terms a Tree revers'd) having been chiefly deſign'd for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Brain from External Injuries; they who would have care of their Health, muſt conſult the Conſtitution of their Brain before they determine either for long or ſhort Hair. Cold and Moiſt Brains, need ſtore of Hair to fence off the cold Air; Hot and Dry, the contrary. As for the Hair of the Chin, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd onely for Ornament, and a Teſtimony of the Authority which the Male hath above the Female; whence that part ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſomewhat ſacred, it being an Injury to touch one's Beard, of which the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> made ſuch account, that according to <hi>Cuſpinian,</hi> he was wont to ſwear by his own.

            <head>CONFERENCE CL. VVhether Alterations of States have natural Cauſes.</head>
            <p>STates being compos'd of Realms or Provinces, theſe of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns, theſe of Families, theſe of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and each Perſon having Natural Cauſes; 'tis clear that the Alteration of the Whole is to be attributed to the ſame Cauſes which make the change of its parts. Thus when all the Houſes of a Town are afflicted with Peſtilence, or conſum'd by Fire, (which Accidents are capable of producing great Mutations in a Common-wealth) it cannot be otherwiſe expreſs'd, but by ſaying, that the Town is burnt or waſted by the Plague. And as when the particular ſuffrages of each Counſellor tend to the abſolution or condemnation of a Criminal, 'twere ſenſeleſs to ſay, that the Sentence of the Court were other than that of the Preſident and Counſellors; ſo alſo it is ridiculous to ſay, that the Cauſes of perſonal mutations are Natural, but not thoſe of Political. As therefore 'tis almoſt the ſole demonſtration we have in Phyſicks, that our Bodies are chang'd and corrupted, becauſe they are compos'd of the four Elements; in like ſort, I conceive, the Cauſe of alteration befalling the body of a State, is to be ſought in the Collection of the ſeveral members that compoſe it; which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66371:107"/>
coming to loſe the harmony, proportion, and reſpect which made them ſubſiſt, they are diſſolv'd and corrupted; which is a mutation, purely natural, and of abſolute neceſſity.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, If God hath reſerv'd any thing to his own diſpoſal, 'tis that of Crowns and the preſervation of States, which are the firſt and univerſal Cauſes of the ſafety of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon. Whence the transferring of thoſe Crowns, from one State to another, which is a greater myſtery, is a mutation purely ſupernatural; as not onely God himſelf hath manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he ſubjected the State of the Iſraelites firſt to Judges and Captains, which was a kind of Ariſtocracy, and afterwards to Kings reducing them to a Monarchy; but alſo all ſuch as have wrought great changes in States of the World: And Legiſlators knowing this belief imprinted in all Men's Minds, have affected the Reputation of being deſcended from, or favor'd by ſome Deity, as did <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Numa Pompilius.</hi> Moreover, the Holy Scripture attributes to God the changing of Scepters, and frequently ſtyles him the God of Battels, the winning and loſing whereof, are the moſt common and manifeſt Cauſes of the change of States. And 'tis a pure effect of the Divine Will, that Men born free, ſubject themſelves to the Will of one ſole or few perſons; ſo the changing of that Inclination, cannot proceed but from Him who is the ſearcher of Hearts, and gives us both to will and to do. If Natural Cauſes had their effects, as certain in Politicks as in Phyſicks, States ſhould have their limited du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as Plants and Animals have: and yet there is ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in the duration of all States, paſt and preſent, that one hath laſted above 1200. years, (as the French Monarchy, whoſe flouriſhing State promiſes as many more Ages, if the World continue ſo long) and another hath chang'd its Form ſeveral times in one yeat, as <hi>Florence.</hi> Upon which conſideration, the greateſt Politicians have put their States under the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and caus'd all their Subjects to venerate ſome particular Angel or tutelar Saint. Thus <hi>France</hi> acknowledges Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> for its Protector; <hi>Spain,</hi> Saint <hi>James; Venice,</hi> Saint <hi>Mark</hi>; and even the Ethnicks thought that a City, (much leſs a State) could not be deſtroy'd till the Deity preſiding over it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd. Whence <hi>Homer</hi> makes the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> carry'd away by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> before the <hi>Greeks</hi> could become Maſters of it.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, The Supream Cauſe exerciſes its Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Riſe, Conſervation, and Deſtruction of States, as well as every where elſe; yet hinders not ſubordinate Cauſes from producing their certain Effects, natural in things natural, (as in the Life and Death of Men, which though one of the moſt notorious Effects of God's Power, and attributed to him by the Scripture and all the World, yet ceaſeth not to have its infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and natural demonſtrations.) Inlike manner, ſubordinate Moral Cauſes, produce their Moral and contingent Effects in Moral Things, ſuch as that in Queſtion is which Cauſes, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66371:107"/>
upon Humane Actions which ariſe from our Will, no-wiſe neceſſitated but free, cannot be term'd natural and conſtrain'd, unleſs either by thoſe that ſubject all things here below to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, which ſubverts the liberty of the Will (that is, makes it no longer a Will) or thoſe who will have not only the manners of the Soul, but alſo the actions always to follow the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body; which were hard to conceive, and yet would not infer a neceſſity in the alteration of States, ſince the effects of Love and Hatred, and other paſſions which give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or averſion are oftentimes prevented by thwarting cauſes. When the Lacedemonians chang'd the popular State of <hi>Athens</hi> into an Ariſtocracy of thirty Lords, whom they call'd afterwards the thirty Tyrants, no other cauſe can be aſſign'd thereof but the chance of War, which ſubjected the will of the Athenians to that of the Lacedemonians: And the ſame may be ſaid of all other ancient and modern Revolutions. Indeed, if the cauſes in Policy had regular effects, or States were ſubject to natural declinations. Prudence, which is converſant about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent things to manage them freely and alter its courſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to occaſion, ſhould ſignifie nothing. 'Tis more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that as in the ſtate of Grace God hath left our actions to the diſpoſal of Free-will, that we may work out our Salvation our ſelves; ſo in the adminiſtration of Republicks he hath left moſt things to chance, for imploying men's induſtry according to their will, whoſe motions being free and contingent, are dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to the neceſſity of natural cauſes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That theſe alterations may be, though vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, yet natural, yea neceſſary too; our Will being as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to apprehended good, as our Intellect is to Truth. As therefore knowing this truth that 2 and 2 are 4, 'tis impoſſible but I muſt believe it; ſo, knowing that ſuch an action will bring me good, I ſhall do it: ſo that the cauſes of humane actions have ſomthing of neceſſity, and (beſides) having their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in nature may in ſome ſort be term'd natural. Moreover, ſince things are preſerv'd by their like and deſtroy'd by their contraries (which contraries are under the ſame genus) it follows that all ſublunary things having had a natural beginning muſt alſo have a like end. Deſire of ſelf-preſervation, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, gave birth to States; but if, inſtead of this deſire which renders Servants obedient to their Maſters, theſe to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and him to the Sovereign, Rebellion and Treaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive their Chiefs of the ſuccour they expect from them, and by this means expoſes the State in prey to the Enemies, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but fall to ruine; unleſs that ſome other natural cauſe, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion (as that of <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> taken from the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, upon a Seceſſion of the Mechanicks of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) or an exemplary puniſhment reduce the Subjects to their forſaken duty. Whereby it appears that the State reſumes its firſt vigor by as ſenſible and natural cauſes, as 'tis to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66371:108"/>
or become wiſe by others harm. Amongſt many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, the ruines of <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Thebes</hi> were caus'd by the rape of <hi>Helene</hi> whom the injuſtice of the Trojans deny'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to her Huſband, and the feud of two. Brothers aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the ſame Royalty: then which no cauſes can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd more natural and more neceſſarily inferring the loſs of a State.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLI. Which is more healthful, to become warm by the Fire or by Exerciſe.</head>
            <p>THey who queſtion the neceſſity of Fire for recalefying our Bodies chill'd by cold the enemy of our natural heat, deſerve the rude treatment of the ancient Romans to their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd perſons, whom they expell'd no otherwiſe from their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but by interdicting them the uſe of Fire and Water; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to want either was equally impoſſible. Without Fire our Bodies would be ſoon depriv'd of life which reſides in heat, as cold is the effect and ſign of death. And as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, thoſe that deny Vertue would not be otherwiſe diſputed with but by caſting them into the fire; ſo would not I otherwiſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe that decry it, but by expoſing them to freez in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winter, inſtead of burning a faggot for them. What could little Children and old people do without it? For though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat be of another kind then that of our material fire, yet this ſometimes aſſiſts that in ſuch ſort that thoſe who digeſt ill are much comforted by it, not to mention weak perſons and thoſe that are ſubject to ſwoonings. Moreover, the external cold muſt be remov'd by an external heat, as Fire is, which heats only what part and to what degree you pleaſe; but motion heats all alike. As the Sun (which ſome Philoſophers take to be the Elemental-fire) contributes to the Generation, ſo doth Fire concur to the conſervation of Man; not by immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, but by the heat which it communicates to the Air and the Air to our Body, which by approaching or receding from it, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers its exceſs in diſcretion, and thereby renders it ſutable to our natural heat, not deſtroying Bodies but in its higheſt degree; as alſo the Sun offends thoſe at Noon whom it refreſhes at riſing and ſetting.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the violent action of Fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all ſublunary Bodies, argues its diſproportion with our natural heat; which diſproportion renders the Stoves and places heated artificially by Fire ſo noxious, and makes ſuch as love the Chimney-corner almoſt always tender, ſcabby, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66371:108"/>
of the leaſt inclemency of the Air; that heat againſt nature not only deſtroying the natural but corrupting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and exſiccating the parts. But the bodies of Plants and Animals inur'd onely to natural heat are far more vigorous, whilſt the ſame is ſecured againſt external cold by Bark, Hair and Skin, and thoſe defenſive Arms which Inſtinct taught our Fore-fathers ſo long as they were guided by Nature, in Caves of the Earth which moderate the injuries of the Air much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then humane Art can do; or elſe by thick clothing which reflects the fumes inceſſantly iſſuing out of the pores of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; from which repercuſſion, proceeds the warmth of our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If cold happen at any time to over-maſter the natural heat in the external parts, the ſame is preſently reviv'd (but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated by fire, before which infirm perſons frequently fall into fainting fits) by motion and exerciſe which heats all Bodies, and much more ſuch as are animated, driving the Spirits and Blood (and with them heat) into the agitated part. Of the benefit of which motion we cannot judge more certainly then by its effects. For as Fire takes away the Appetite and dulls the Senſes of thoſe that ſit at it, ſo Exerciſe encreaſes it and renders the Body and Mind much more lively. Wherefore I conclude for Exerciſe againſt Fire, without which a late Phyſician liv'd twenty years, ſeeing no other but that of his Candle, and without employing his Wood, as <hi>Sylvius</hi> did who run up and down Stairs laden with two or three Fagots, more or leſs according as he was cold, till he was warm, and then he laid them up till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Exerciſe is not more profitable to ſuch as are accuſtom'd to it, then hurtful to others. Which Sedentary perſons find true when they play at Tennis, or Hunt, or uſe ſuch other violent motion. For every ſort of motion is not Exerciſe, but only that which is perform'd with ſome ſtreining, whereby reſpiration is render'd more frequent, the Arteries dilated, the Spirits and blood chaf'd, whence oftentimes they break their veſſels, and beget Fevers, Pleuriſes, Fluxes, Head-aches and Catarrhs: which is a manifeſt proof that 'tis better to leave the Humors and Spirits in their natural temper. For Health conſiſts in a juſt proportion of the Humors, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Concoction of temperate and moderate Food; which Concoction is perform'd better during reſt then during motion, and in the ſleep of the night then in the labour of the day. So alſo are excrements better expell'd when the Body is quiet then when 'tis in motion, which brings a confuſion of pure with impure; Inſenſible tranſpiration is ſufficiently effected only by the internal motion of Nature without the help of external, which Nature hath not preſcrib'd Animals, although they have no need of Fire, being naturally Furr'd, Feather'd, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe guarded againſt the injuries of weather, and yet their age is almoſt as regular as that of immovable Plants. Man, on the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66371:109"/>
contrary, by reaſon chiefly of his ſeveral violent exerciſes hath no prefix'd time of life, which labour (inſeparable from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe) wears and conſumes more then his years, and makes him old before his time, depriving him alſo of that contentment and pleaſure which makes us live. Moreover, ſince things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and acquir'd by the ſame cauſes, loſt health which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by reſt and the bed, cannot be preſerv'd by travel; which, beſides conſuming our radical moiſture ſwifter then the natural heat doth alone, hath the ſame effect that motion hath in a lighted Candle which is ſooner ſpent when ſtirr'd then when at quiet.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That ſince Fire introduces into us a foreign and contranatural heat, as beſides the inconveniences already alledg'd, the ſweating of the head teſtifies, 'tis more hurtful then Exerciſe, which only rouſes up the natural heat enfeebled by the apertion of the pores caus'd by the Fire in Winter and the Sun in Summer, when for that reaſon Exerciſe ought to be leſs. The incommodity Exerciſe brings to unaccuſtom'd Bodies ought not to hinder their being form'd thereto by little and little, and by the degrees recommended by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in all changes. For if Phyſicians contribute all their ſkill to correct diſtempers drawn from the birth, much rather may they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to turn bad cuſtoms into good; as being an eaſier taſk. Thus <hi>Galen</hi> was not accuſtom'd to cleave wood, nor <hi>Pittacus</hi> King of the Mytelenians to grind corn, yet they exercis'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe labours for their health. And indeed ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, as thoſe which proceed from a cold and moiſt diſtemper, are cur'd by exerciſe; eſpecially if they come from repletion. Thus <hi>Nicomachus</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was ſo monſtrouſly fat that he could not put his hand behind him, yet was brought to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bulk by Exerciſe. On the contrary, <hi>Germanicus</hi> whoſe legs were ſomewhat too ſlender brought them to a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion by Riding; the concuſſions whereof ſhake the Stone out of the Kidneys. Recovering perſons need Exerciſe ſo much, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſtrength that 'tis the moſt ſafe means of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and old men are chiefly preſerv'd by it. <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Phyſician and <hi>Spurnia,</hi> both of them 80 years old, preſerv'd their Senſes and ſtrength, entire by walking a great way every day on foot. And yet Fire is leſs hurtful in that age by reaſon of the coldneſs and thickneſs of the ſkin which gives not its heat ſo free entrance, nor ſo eaſie an iſſue to that within.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLII. Whether Wine helps or hinders Digeſtion, and why?</head>
            <p>THis Queſtion will ſeem frivolous to the vulgar, who are no ſooner debarr'd Wine by the Phyſitian, but they complain of Indigeſtion and weakneſs of Stomack. But our free Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy ſhall uſe its own rights, and inquire, whether the common Opinion in this Point be the beſt. Now if Wine, which is hot, and acknowledg'd ſuch by all Phyſitians, be receiv'd into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Stomack, it brings it into a diſtemper, whence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyn'd it not to <hi>Timothy,</hi> but in regard of the coldneſs or weakneſs of his Stomack, in which caſe a due temper reſults from the one cold, and the other hot. But temperate perſons muſt avoid it's uſe, which was a juſt cauſe of Divorce to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Dames, capital in the Camp of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and ſtill in divers parts of <hi>Aſia</hi>; whereunto if you add, all thoſe that are depriv'd of it, becauſe they have none produc'd amongſt them, Children and ſick perſons, it will appear that (to ſay nothing of Beaſts, which drink onely water, and are more healthy than we) there are a hundred live without it for one that drinks it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they who are troubled with Indigeſtions, find and make others ſufficiently underſtand, that Wine is laſt digeſted; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would not keep its firſt colour, ſavor, and ſmell, after all other food, or at leaſt onely alter'd by the acidity into which 'tis eaſily corrupted. Beſides, Water-drinkers have a better Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite than Wine-drinkers, which is an Argument that Wine helps Concoction leſs then Water; and no wonder, ſince, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, it increaſes Thirſt inſtead of quenching it as Water doth. For Thirſt, which is the Appetite of Cold and Moiſt, cannot be extinguiſh'd by Wine, which is Hot, and ſo more apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it. The Life of the firſt Patriarch, before the uſe of Wine, namely, before the Deluge, was much longer than it hath been ſince; and, no doubt, the principal defect in Man, and the Cauſe of moſt Diſeaſes, is bad Digeſtion.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Digeſtion being perform'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Spirits elaborated in the Spleen, and Wine which is more ſpirituous, and conſequently, furniſhes more matter for our Spirits than any other Aliment, cannot but powerfully promote the ſame. Which clearly appears by old men, in whom Wine hath the ſame Effect that Milk hath in Children, and preſerves theſe latter from Worms. Whence poſſibly <hi>Hippocates</hi> gave it not onely in Quotidian, but alſo in Continual Fevers; the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to be fear'd from its heat, were it conjoyn'd with dryneſs, being ſecur'd by its humidity, which makes it ſymbolize with blood. Yet all Wines are not hot; ſmall green Wines, eſpecially the White and Sharp, have more of coldneſs than of heat; and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66371:110"/>
other Wines drunk in ſmall quantity with much water, refreſh more than water alone, becauſe opening the Pores, they inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate into the remote parts, which plain water preſently cloſes. Yea, Wine, as hot, is a friend to the Stomack and Bowels, whoſe membranous ſubſtance being cold and dry, needs the contrary qualities of Wine; wherefore Wine helps Digeſtion, which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hinders, being indigeſtible it ſelf, and ſo unable to give what it hath not. God's diſcovering Wine to Men after the Flood, as a remedy to the defect, left thereby in all Creatures ſerving for their food, being rather an evidence of its utility than hurtfulneſs. And there is as little reaſon to accuſe it of ſhortning our dayes, as <hi>Guaicum</hi> of cauſing the Pox, upon pretence that the uſe thereof was not known till that Malady appearing, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for its Cure.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the ſole reaſon of the difficulty we find in digeſting Wine, is the great reſemblance of its qualities with thoſe of Blood, both being Hot and Moiſt. But there can be no proper Phyſical Action without contrariety. For ſince every principal Agent induces Alteration in the ſubject which receives its Action, this change cannot be effected, but by depriving it of its former State, and the qualities which maintain'd the ſame. Which cannot be done, but by conteſting with, and deſtroying them by contrary qualities; and ſo according to more or leſs contrariety, the Action is ſtronger or weaker. Hence in the Digeſtion of Aliment, which is a proper Phyſical Action, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Natural Heat deſtroyes the Food, in order to turn it into another Form, there muſt be contrariety; and ſuch Food as ha's leaſt, gives the Heat leaſt hold to work againſt it; it not being eaſie for the Natural Heat and Moiſture to act againſt an Aliment Hot and Moiſt, by reaſon of the reſemblance between them; as a Friend hardly combats and deſtroyes his Friend. Wherefore Wine being of the ſame quality, our Heat becoms idle in order to its Concoction. Poſſibly too, its abundance of Spirits make it hard to be digeſted, ſtifling the Spirits employ'd for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, by reaſon of the too great reſemblance between thoſe of the one and the other.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That onely a diſproportionate quantity of Wine is of difficult Digeſtion, a ſmall quantity promoting it. Which holds good in all repletions, but, particularly, of Wine; which relaxing the Fibres and Tunicles of the Stomack, weakens the Retentive Faculty, provokes the Expulſive by its Acrimony, either in the Superior Orifice, whence ariſe Hick-cocks; or in the Inferior, whence proceed loathings and vomitings. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, Drink a little (not drink much) Wine. Nor would the inconvenience be leſs, if the beſt Aliments in the World were taken in Exceſs. For when their maſs is too great to be conſtring'd and embrac'd by the Stomack, the Natural Heat is it ſelf alter'd inſtead of over-maſtering that, in order to Aſſimilation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:66371:110"/>The Fifth ſaid, That the Queſtion is to be determin'd by the difference of Wines and Stomacks. Strong Wines, ſuch as are ſweet and piquant, are improper for Hot and Cholerick Stomacks which muſt have only ſmall green Wines, or other beverages of neer quality to common water. On the contrary, Phlegmatick and Cold Stomacks, and Melancholy Tempers, are ſtrengthened by Wine, but prejudic'd by water and other cold drinks; not that Heat is the cauſe of Digeſtion, (for the hotter a Fever is, the more it hinders the ſame) but becauſe 'tis a <hi>Medium,</hi> whereof our Natural Heat ſerves it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid. That indeed the diverſity of Subjects makes ſome change in the Hypotheſis, yet hinders not but we may pronounce upon the Theſis; whether Wine helps or hurts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. I believe the latter; becauſe Digeſtion cannot be perform'd, unleſs all the Meats of one meal be digeſted at the ſame time; elſe the Chyle will be, part well elaborated (namely, that made of the Food which hath had a convenient ſtay in the Stomack) and part too much concoct and aduſt, made of that which ſtay'd in the Stomack too long and after Digeſtion; and part alſo too little, proceeding from Meats requiring more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and yet hurried away with the reſt. Now 'tis certain, that Wine being ſooner digeſted than other Aliments, by the authority of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> (who hold, that it aſſwages Thirſt, and is diſtributed ſooner than they) it will produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and hotch-potch in the nature of the Chyle, which ſhould be uniform. But Water ſerving only for a Vehicle, agrees better with variety of Meats, being like the Menſtruum of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and the Uniting <hi>Medium</hi> of the <hi>Lulliſts,</hi> which ſerves to re-unite all different Bodies into one alone, patiently attending their diſpoſition without corrupting, (as Wine and Vinegar doth) and without leaving behind in the Kidneys the tartar, or lee of Wine, which is the ſeed of the Stone, where-with Water-drinkers are not ſo commonly troubled; partly, for the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid reaſon, and partly, becauſe that tartar is not dry'd in them, as having leſs Heat than others.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="153" type="conference">
            <head>CONFERENCE CLIII. Why 'tis colder at Day-break than at any other time of the Night or Day.</head>
            <p>IF Cold be a real quality, then the greater diſtance there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be between it and the Source of Heat and Light, (the Sun) the greater muſt the Cold be. And if it be only a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heat, then mid-night is darker then either the Evening or Morning, becauſe oppos'd directly to the Light of the Sun, it may ſeem that the Cold ought be greater likewiſe at that time,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66371:111"/>
becauſe the ſame is oppoſite to Noon, when the Sun's Heat is greateſt; yet the cool of the Morning argues the contrary, being ſo ordinary that it fore-tells Day-break more certainly, than the crowing of the Cock. Unleſs you will attribute the cauſe to this, that at Morning before Sun-riſe 'tis longer ſince the Sun in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned the Horizon, than at mid-night; at which time the Air and other Elements, ſtill retain ſome of the preceding Day's Heat, which tempering the Cold, occaſion'd by the Sun's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, renders the ſame leſs perceptible during the thickneſs of the Nocturnal Air, leſs ſubtile than that of the Day; when the Light coming to diſſipate thoſe Clouds, ſubtilizes the Air by its inſinuating beams; whence the Cold thereof more eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates into our Pores by the help of that weak Light, which is not ſtrong enough to heat the Air. Juſt as Vinegar, though hot and biting of its own Nature, yet mix'd with much water, cooles the part whereunto 'tis apply'd more than water alone doth.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That poſſibly the compariſon of the Heat of our beds, (out of which we ariſe in the Morning) with the cold of the outward Air, makes us guilty of a miſtake; unleſs you had rather refer this Effect to the Oblique Aſpect where-with the other Celeſtial Bodies of our Hemiſphere are regarded by the Sun at his riſing. For at mid-night when he is directly under the Horizon, the little bulk of the Earth hinders not, but he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly darts his Rayes upon thoſe Stars which are above us, the Pyramid of the Earth's ſhadow not paſſing beyond the Moon; ſo that then the vaſt and incredible magnitude of all thoſe Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bodies perpendicularly reflects upon us the Heat and Light of the Sun, which thus reflected may calefie the Air, as the Sun doth in the ſame poſture; but not at all at Sun-riſe in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Aſpects: Whence though the Sun be nearer us in Winter, yet he warms us leſs. If it be excepted, that the Evening, when the ſame Oblique Aſpects return, is not ſo cold as the Night; 'tis anſwer'd, that this difference proceeds from the Heat of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Day, remaining in the Earth, Water, and Air, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame, till by the abſence of the Sun the ſupervening Night wholly diſſipate them.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Matutinal coolneſs proceeded from the approaching Suns driving the Clouds before him, which agitation raiſeth a wind (as there is always one at day-break) whereby the ſame coolneſs is effected in the Air that a Fan cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to a Lady. For all things here below having their motion from Eaſt to Weſt, 'tis reaſonable that the Air be ſo mov'd too, and acquire the conſequent of its agitation, namely, coldneſs. That all things come from the Eaſt, ſundry inſtances manifeſt; Mankind was from thence diffus'd into the other Quarters of the World; Rivers run generally Eaſtward; And the greater ſpeed of Navigation from Eaſt to Weſt, than contrarily, argnes the Sea to have the ſame motion; as is chiefly obſerv'd under the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66371:111"/>
Equinoctial, the greatneſs of which Circle renders that motion more manifeſt. This rule the Winds keep, when not diverted to a contrary courſe by Exhalations: And as for the Heavens, experience ſhews us, that their ordinary and beſt-known courſe is from Eaſt to Weſt: So that 'tis no wonder if they hurry the neighbouring Air with them, and by a Mathematical contact and natural conſecution, all the other Elements. I ſpeak not of Sciences, Arts, Policy, and other things which the more curious may find to have been deriv'd from the Eaſt. It ſuffices that the Sun taking this road drives the Air befor him; the wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from which motion, cauſeth the coolneſs we feel chiefly at day-break; when the vapours between us and the Sun being by his heat violently driven (as the water of the <hi>Aeolipila</hi> is turn'd into wind and driven forth by the ſubjacent fire) the coolneſs is more unacceptable, in that it ſucceeds and multiplies (inſtead of diminiſhing) that of the night, as the diurnal heat in likelihood ought to do.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, He attributed the increaſe of cold at day-break to the ordinary action of all natural Agents, which is ſtrongeſt when they arrive at the period or utmoſt point of their declination. So a Candle juſt upon extinguiſhing caſts forth a ſmarter flame; the violence of a Diſeaſe is greateſt at its criſis, when 'tis towards ending; a Stone moves ſwifteſt as it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Centre. And to compare the Year to the Day, the cold is commonly greater and more inſupportable in <hi>February,</hi> the laſt Moneth of Winter, than in the beginning thereof; though in reaſon it might ſeem rather to be ſo at the end of <hi>December,</hi> when the Sun is further from us, and that the cuſtom of the two firſt months cold ſhould render this laſt more tolerable; as on the contrary, the heat is greater alſo in the dog-days, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, than at the Summer Solſtice, when the Sun is elevated higheſt above our heads. So alſo in Summer 'tis hotter two hours after noon, than at noon it ſelf; not ſo much through any diſpoſition already received in the Air and Earth, as by reaſon of that Rule, That Natural Actions are ſtronger at the end than the beginning; whereas violent actions, as the motion of a Stone upwards, is ſwifter in the beginning than the end.</p>
            <p>The Fifth referr'd this effect to the Antiperiſtaſis of heat and cold. For as fire ſeems more ſcorching upon the approach of a great froſt, ſo by a contrary reaſon cold muſt become more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement at the approach of the Sun's heat. Moreover, the like combat is obſerv'd between the thickneſs of the darkneſs of the night, and the rarity of the day, when the Sun's light rendring the illuminated Air more ſubtle, what was groſs in the dark Air cannot be expell'd in an inſtant without ſome conflict and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the part condens'd by darkneſs with the rarefi'd by light; from which agitation ariſeth a wind commonly at day-break, which is probably the cauſe of the cold at that time. Now of that tenebrous part condens'd is made the Dew and Froſt in our
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66371:112"/>
Climate, and the <hi>Manna</hi> in Southern Countries; as the cold which we feel redoubled in Winter in the ſpace between a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring fire (but out of its Sphere of Activity) and the reſt of the Air, is a familiar example of this Antiperiſtaſis of heat and cold redoubled upon the approach one of the other. For as 'tis much colder then elſewhere, between that fire which is too diſtant to warm us, and the Air left in its natural frigidity; ſo at day-break our Air being too far off from the Sun to be heated by it, augments its coldneſs upon his approach.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, Air hath no natural quality but ſupream hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, whereby 'tis ſupple, movable, and pliant; heat and cold being impreſs'd upon it by outward agents: Otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general medium and mediator of motions local, natural, vital and animal (for the Spirits are of an aerious nature) and the Factor of all Agents by whoſe intervention they communicate their influences, it would act againſt the qualities impreſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, ſometimes hot and ſometimes cold, and deſtroy them by its own. Which indeed its humidity doth, but to the profit of animated bodies; dryneſs being their enemy. Hence cold and dry <hi>Saturn</hi> hath under him, hot and moiſt <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who tempers his hurtfulneſs and ſutes him to living things. Now the Sun having at the declining of the day rais'd many aqueous, and conſequently ſupreamly cold, and the heat whereby they were rais'd abandoning them upon his abſence, the natural cold of thoſe vapours becomes predominant, and returns them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into their firſt ſtate. Which refrigerating the Air makes the night the colder, the further the vapours are from their extraneous heat, that is to ſay, the nearer day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="154" type="conference">
            <head>CONFERENCE CLIV. Whence the whiteneſs of Snow proceeds.</head>
            <p>THe firſt attributed the cauſe thereof to the deſiccation of water; for experience ſhews in all ſublunary Bodies that dryneſs whitens, as Sea-water becomes white when dry'd to Salt, the ſtalks of Corn, Pulſe and the leaves of all other Plants wax white as they wither and dry. The ſame happens to the Bones of Animals, and grey Hairs, on no other cauſe but ſiccity, ſince the extremity expos'd to the Air is white, but not the root. Hence water by its tranſparence already partaking much of light (but which its rarity reflects not to our view) is no ſooner deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated into Ice, Hail, or Snow, but it acquires this pure white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which humidity again deſtroys. So the high ways white with duſt grow black upon rain; a wet cloth appears darker then a dry; and that ſome things become black by drying (as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66371:112"/>
Coal) is becauſe there was heat enough to draw the humidity, which was at its Centre, to the Circumference, but not enough wholly to dry it up, as appears in that the ſame heat continu'd reduces the coal to white aſhes which would be as perfectly white as Snow, did not the Tincture imprinted thereon by the Salts withſtand it; for if you urge them further by fire, you will make them of a perfect whiteneſs; as appears in Chalks, which are made not only of grey and black ſtones, but even of Metals, as Ceruſe is made of Lead.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Whiteneſs is not a real Colour, ſince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all bodies depriv'd of preceding Colours, of all which 'tis indifferently ſuſceptible. But 'tis otherwiſe with real Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, a ſubject imbu'd with one of which is not apt to receive all others but ſome only; as Nature hath fram'd the Organs of Senſe naked of all ſenſible objects, to the end they might be ſuſceptible of the ſame. Wooll dy'd into a ſadder colour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive a lighter, and black Wooll admits none at all; but white, being natural to every ſubject that hath no colour, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving all: So when you waſh off the blew or dirty colour of a Band, it becomes white. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Whiteneſs hath the ſame reference to Colours that Unity hath to Numbers whereof 'tis the beginning, but is none it ſelf. And as 'tis the Emblem of Innocence and Purity, ſo alſo it proceeds from them. The Air, which is the pureſt of our Elements (for Fire is only in Mixts) and water refin'd into vapours, which follows the Air in purity, hapning to acquire viſibility by condenſation into Snow, cannot repreſent the ſame under any other out-ſide but Whiteneſs. Now that Whiteneſs is an effect of purity, is manifeſt by the Stars, which are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us only under the ſpecies of Whiteneſs, and cannot be painted but with white in their light, which de-albating what it irradiates, and leaving the ſame elſewhere black, ſhews that 'tis as the pureſt, ſo alſo the whiteſt thing in the world. Likewiſe Metals are whiter according to their purity; Lead is worſe then Tin, and this then Silver only upon account of their impurity; the ſole perfect mixture of the yellow incombuſtible Sulphur of Gold not permitting it to be alter'd and ſpoil'd of its yellow colour which neareſt approacheth whiteneſs. Wherefore Snow being a moſt pure Body, compounded only of two colour-leſs elements, namely, Air and Water, 'twas neceſſary either that it ſhould have no colour, or if any (whereby to become viſible) the principle and origin of all Colours, namely White, in the perfection with which Nature makes all her Works.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the ſame difference which appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Stars and their Orbs, is found between Water and Snow, ariſing only from Denſity and Rarity. As the Star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears white, and the reſt of the Heaven darker by reaſon of its rarity; ſo likewiſe Water ſeems obſcure upon account of its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Snow white upon that of its denſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:66371:113"/>The Fourth ſaid, If that reaſon were good, then Ice ſhould be whiter then Snow, becauſe 'tis more ſolid; and yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears. Beſides Snow is ſo far from being more denſe and ſolid then Water, that on the contrary, there is leſs Air in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in Ice, which is more cloſe and compact then Snow; the ſwimming of Ice upon the Water arguing ſome aerious parts included in it at the time of its congelation, which is not and cannot be made without air, Wherefore Snow differs from Water only by its figure or accidental form, which reduceth it into flocks congealed by cold in a cloud (not as it is reſolv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rain, for then 'twould prove Hail) but whilſt yet a vapour in the region of the Air. So then in this figure alone is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the whiteneſs of Snow to be ſought; which is not found in water, partly by reaſon of its tranſparence, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its ſmooth ſurface gives no hold to the viſual ray. Which is the reaſon why Water is pictur'd with a blew and darkiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Thus burniſh'd Silver as that of Looking-glaſſes ſeems dark if compar'd to rough Silver, which doth not diſſipate our viſual Spirits as that former doth. Hence Ice is much whiter then water, as being leſs ſmooth.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That 'tis proper to cold to whiten, as 'tis to heat to blacken. Thus Southern People are either black, or tawney; Northern, white: and the Hair of both grows white with old age by reaſon of the coldneſs thereof. All the cold parts of our Body are white; as the Brain, Bones, Cartilages, Membranes, Fat and Skin. Linen and Wax are whitened by the coldneſs of the night. For the ſame reaſon, not only Snow but Hail, Froſt, Ice, Rime, and all other cold Meteors are of the ſame colour.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That though the whiteneſs of Snow was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed by <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Armenia</hi> produces red by mixture of the exhalations of Vermillion with the ordinary vapors which the Sun raiſes from the water; yet this whiteneſs is as manifeſt as the cauſes are hid, no leſs then thoſe of light, which is the colour of Celeſtial Bodies, as colours are the light of Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. However, this whiteneſs ſeems to proceed from a mixture of Air and Water, as appears in froth, whoſe conſiſtence is like that of Snow, the whiteneſs whereof, poſſibly, is increas'd by the Spirits wherewith Snow abounds, which are luminous Bodies, whereof the fertility caus'd by Snow is an Argument; to which Spirits, (which Froſt hath not) may be aſcrib'd what <hi>Galen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, namely, that Fiſh cover'd with Snow become more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for to the Moon it can with no more reaſon be referr'd than to the Sun.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, That an univocal and certain cauſe of whiteneſs cannot be found in the firſt or ſecond Qualities: Not in Heat or Cold; ſince Snow, Sugar, and Salt are equally white, though the firſt is cold, the ſecond temperate, and the third hot: Nor in Siccity or Humidity; ſince humid Milk is no leſs white
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66371:113"/>
than dry Chalk and Plaſter. The denſity and weight of Silver, the rarity and levity of Snow, the ſweetneſs of Sugar, and the acrimony of Salt; in ſhort, the examen of all other Second Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of white things, ſhews that it depends not on them. Nor yet on the third: for white Agarick is purgative; white Starch, and flowr of Beans, aſtringent. Laſtly, what ſome call Fourth Qualities, or Properties of the whole Subſtance, depend as little upon Colours, ſince the ſame whiteneſs which is in the Meal that nouriſhes us, is alſo in the Sublimate that kills us. It remains to inquire the reaſon of Colours, and conſequently, of Whiteneſs in the proportion between the Sight and the Surface of the colour'd body. When therefore it happens that the Viſual Ray, which iſſues forth pure and white, that is to ſay, colour-leſs, finds no Colour in a Surface; if the ſame be Diaphanous, it takes it for a <hi>Medium</hi> not an Object; (as is ſeen in Glaſs, Cryſtal, Air, and Water); if opake, it ſtops at the ſaid Surface; and finding no Colour thereon, returns with the Species of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to make its report to the Common Senſe that it ſaw nothing; and this is what they call Whiteneſs. Hence, White ſo little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights the Sight, that it diſgregates and wearies it; as a falſe ſtroke doth that brings nothing. Now to apply this to Snow, the Viſual Ray is indeed ſtopt by its condens'd Surface; but whence ſhould it have Colour, ſince 'tis compos'd of Air and Water, both colourleſs? The Truth is, ſutably to its Principles, it muſt neceſſarily remain without Colour, that is, White, whereby it ſo diſgregates the Viſual Rayes that ſometimes it blinded a whole Army.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLV. Whether Courage be natural or acquir'd.</head>
            <p>COurage being the Contempt of Danger, which we naturally fear, we cannot be naturally courageous; for then two contrary Effects ſhould proceed from the ſame Cauſe. But the Truth is, our Nature is indifferent to every thing whereunto it is lead and faſhion'd. Thus, ſkittiſh Horſes are made ſober by inuring to the noiſe of Muſkets, which before they could not endure. On the contrary, brave Courſers kept in a dark Stable and unemploy'd, become reſty and jadiſh. Moreover, ſince there is no true Courage without Knowledge of the Danger, (whence Fools and Drunkards cannot be ſtyl'd courageous) this argues that this Virtue hath need of Rules and Precepts, as without which, our Knowledge cannot but be very imperfect. Nor did any thing render the <hi>Romans</hi> more valiant than the Nations they ſubdu'd, but Military Diſcipline; wherein the Roman Legion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66371:114"/>
under-went his Apprentiſage, as other Artificers do in their Trades: Which Inſtruction, ſome of their Deſcendents deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, have ſhewn thereby what difference there is between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Anceſtours, and determin'd this Queſtion to the advantage of Induſtry. At this day our Souldiers are not more ſtrong and courageous than Town-people; and the Officers whom alone we ſee perform all the brave Actions, ſurpaſs not in Courage ordinary Souldiers, ſaving that theſe have not been ſo well inſtructed as they, and reflect not ſo much upon the ſhame and loſs which they incurr by Cowardize. And becauſe that Courage is greateſt, which makes us contemne the greateſt dangers; hence that which leads us to the Contempt of Death, the moſt terrible of all things, is, undoubtedly, the greateſt. But the Hiſtory of the Mileſian Virgins is remarkable, who, upon the perſwaſions of a certain Orator, were, contrary to the natural timidity of their Sex, carry'd to ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Death, that nothing could reſtrain them from killing themſelves, but the example of their Self-murder'd Companions drawn forth-with naked about the ſtreets. Whereby it may be judg'd, how powerful Perſwaſion is to encourage us: Which Captains and Generals of Armies are not ignorant of, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their Rhetorick to impreſs Audacity in their Souldiers breaſts, upon an aſſault or a battel; and thoſe that have been in ſuch encounters, affirm, that nothing conduces more either to inflame the Courage of Brave Men, or infuſe it into ſuch as have none, than an Exhortation well apply'd and ſuted to the Minds of thoſe that are to be encourag'd; ſometimes by the Memory of their former Gallant Actions; ſometimes by thoſe of their Enemies Cowardice; ſometimes by the greatneſs of the Danger, and the inevitable ruine they incurr in caſe of turning their backs; but commonly, by the ſalvation of their Souls, and the good of their Country; and always by the fair ſpur of Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Conſiderations directly oppoſite to thoſe dictated to us by Nature, which tend onely to preſervation of the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, If Inſtruction made Men valiant and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageous, than all that receive the ſame Education, learn in the ſame Academy, and fight under the ſame Captain, ſhould be equally courageous. Yet there is ſo notable a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that it cannot be imputed to any but Natural Cauſes; ſuch as are the ſtructure of the parts of the Body, the temper of the humors, the nimbleneſs or heavineſs of the Spirits, and eſpecially the diverſity of Souls which inform our Bodies; which diverſity is apparent even in Infancy, before the Corporeal Organs can be ſuſpected to be the Cauſe thereof. One Child is more timorous than another, and no ſooner begins to go, but he beats his Companions, who ſuffer themſelves to be beaten by one weaker than themſelves; the firſt, not quitting his hold for the rod, for which another will do more than you would have him.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66371:114"/>
The truth is, if the Soul be the Architect of her habitation, to her muſt be imputed the Principal Cauſe of the variety found therein, upon that of our Actions viſibly depends. For as every one readily addicts himſelf to thoſe employments and exerciſes of body and mind whereunto he is moſt fit, and which he performs with moſt eaſe; ſo he is more eaſily lead to Actions of Courage, whoſe Organs are beſt diſpos'd for the ſame. And becauſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren commonly have ſome-what of the Habit of Body, and Temper of their Parents, hence Courage ſeems to come by Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; which poſſibly renders our Gentry ſo jealous of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of their Families, in which they had rather find a Man beheaded for an Action that ſpeaks Courage, than a Burgeſs who had not liv'd in a noble way. Moreover, to judge well of Courage, we muſt not conſider it ſolely in Man, ſince 'tis found ſo reſplendent in Animals incapable of Diſcipline and Inſtruction, that the certaineſt Phyſiognomical Rule whereby to judge of a Valiant Man, is taken from the ſimilitude or reſemblance he hath with the Lyon, Bear, or other Beaſts of Courage. Which ſhews that the true and original Valour being in Animals, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts rather alter and pervert, than produce it in us. Hence the moſt learned are oftimes the greateſt Pultrons. For which reaſons the <hi>Romans</hi> caus'd the warlike people whom they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd, to deſcend from the Mountains into the Valleys, that by that means they might change their Nature. Indeed, theſe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were better diſciplin'd than the Nations whom they call'd barbarous, and by that means more eaſily overcame them; but they were not the more courageous for that, he who is vanquiſh'd abating nothing of his Courage thereby: witneſs King <hi>Porus,</hi> whoſe Courage <hi>Alexander</hi> more admir'd for his refuſing to eat, that ſo he might by dying avoid the ſhame of being overcome, than for the ſingle fight to which he had challeng'd him. Officers out-do common Souldiers, becauſe they have more to loſe than they, and their Puſillanimity would be more taken notice of. And the Speeches of Generals in a day of battel are not for the truly courageous, who need them not, but for the Cowards, who are encourag'd againſt the fear of Death, by falſe ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the Enemies paucity, and their own number. Whereas true Courage, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> is not in thoſe that fear not, becauſe they ignore the danger, but in thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it great, yet judge their own ſtrength greater and thereupon preſume of ſurmounting it; which Reſolution is never learnt by Books or Precepts, but is inherent in the Mind.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That he was of the Opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> in the ſame <hi>Xenophon,</hi> namely, that as ſome Bodies are more robuſt, ſo alſo ſome Souls are better to undergo dangers. That never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs Inſtruction ſerves greatly to perfect Nature: Whence certain Nations cannot ſuſtain the aſſaults of others better train'd and accuſtom'd to manage ſome ſort of Arms. All the kinds whereof, both offenſive and defenſive, proceeding from
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66371:115"/>
Humane Induſtry, Nature alone muſt not arrogate the advantage we have over other Animals; whoſe Courage being by the help of Art ſurmounted by that of Man, as Art can do nothing without Nature; ſo the Courage which leads us to attaque and vanquiſh them, muſt be aſcrib'd to Art, without which, Man durſt not attaque them.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, We muſt diſtinguiſh Courages according to the diverſities of Subjects whereon they are employ'd. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Claſs is that of perſons, who freely offer themſelves to certain death for their Religion, whether true or falſe. So did amongſt the <hi>Romans, Q. Curtius,</hi> who threw himſelf into a Gulph to appeaſe the anger of the Gods; <hi>Metellus,</hi> who ran into the fire to fetch out the Statue of <hi>Minerva</hi>; and of Hereticks a great number, of whom Books are full. But this Martyrology ſhews us a greater number in the true Church; yet the Courage of ſo many Martyrs cannot be aſcrib'd to Nature alone, but to Perſwaſion, and to Faith. Next comes the Courage of thoſe great Heroes, and illuſtrious Men of Antiquity, as <hi>David</hi> and his nine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, the three <hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Curiatii, Caeſar, Cato,</hi> and many others, whom none can ſay would have done thoſe brave Actions, unleſs they had been lead thereunto by a noble deſire of Glory, to which our Minds are carryed onely by Reaſons, Precepts, and Examples; and conſequently, their Courage may be judg'd rather acquir'd than natural. Laſtly, Courage is found in all Callings and Employments. A Miniſter, or Counſellor of State, a Divine, and a Judge, acquire the Title of Courageous, when they reſolutely perform the Office where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are call'd. This is not taught any perſon by Nature, and therefore I find more effects of acquir'd than of Natural Courage, which (beſides) how great ſoever, is perfected by Induſtry.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLVI. Whether Men, not having learn' d of others, would would frame Language to themſelves.</head>
            <p>NAture having given Animals a Voice for mutual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at diſtance, and that diſtinguiſh'd into as many ſeverall Tones and Accents as they have different Paſſions and neceſſities; 'tis not credible that ſhe hath provided worſe for Man, as to what was more neceſſary to him, as being ſubject to more paſſions and neceſſities than any other Animal, which oblige to a Society, no-wiſe imaginable without Speech; which conſequently, two Children would frame to themſelves, as ſoon as the moiſture of their Brain and Organs ſerving to Speech, being dry'd by Age, permitted free motion to their Tongue; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:66371:115"/>
by imitation of voices or ſounds which they hear, and giving names to things ſutable to the voices or ſounds they render'd. In defect whereof they would frame other articulate words, firſt Monoſyllables and Simple, as thoſe of the Chineſes are, and afterwards compounded: by which they would expreſs all their other conceptions, if not with ſuch facility as other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which time hath enrich'd, yet at leaſt after their own Mode, uſing the moſt conformity they could to the nature and property of each thing. And where reaſon fail'd them, they would be help'd by hazard; our Nature being ſo ſtrongly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd to imitation, that he of the two, who firſt apply'd a word to ſome thing, would be follow'd by the other without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For the mind of Man being an Act, inceſſantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; his greateſt pleaſure is in communicating thoſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as a Torrent or River without ſhore, take their courſe every way, ſo Man's conception being deſtitute of terms to imitate, would frame new according to his phanſie, which coming to be receiv'd by others, would acquire the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection whereunto other Languages arrive in time. Yea when the Organs of Speech fail, dumb perſons move their members a thouſand ways to make themſelves underſtood; and that ſo happily, that when Monſieur de <hi>Sancy</hi> was Embaſſadour in <hi>Turkie,</hi> he hapned to ſee two Mutes, the one a Turk and the other a Perſian, who not underſtanding one another becauſe they had different ſigns, there was found a third Mute who ſerv'd them for an Interpreter. Which being harder then to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate a voice, argues, that Nature would much ſooner teach Speech then expreſſion by geſtures. For no body is ignorant that it is eaſier to ſpeak then to do.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Speech being only an imitation, he that ſhould never hear another ſpeak could never ſpeak himſelf. Hence perſons born deaf are always dumb, though they have all the Organs fit for formation of Speech: and yet none will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they have not all the ſame faculties and neceſſities of expreſſing themſelves that other men have, yea and greater too, being depriv'd of all inſtructions which are aquir'd by the ear, and other benefits proceeding from the ſame. Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verifi'd by the examples of all ſavage Men that have been found; even by that of the Satyre, who by the report of S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> in his Epiſtles appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> in the Deſart; all which inſtead of words pronounc'd only inarticulate voices, liker ſounds and bellowings then words; theſe men being like one ignorant of playing on the Lute, who though he hath fingers yet cannot make it ſpeak as he can who is ſkill'd in that Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Reaſon why perſons born deaf are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo mute, is, that he who ſpeaks muſt firſt hear himſelf ſpeak before he be heard by others; otherwiſe he knows not whether him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſpoken or no, much leſs can others know: and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66371:116"/>
doth he remember the voice which he made uſe of to expreſs this thing or another: which is abſolutely neceſſary to being able to employ the ſame voice when he would ſignifie the ſame thing. But the caſe is not the ſame with him that having a good ear and intending to cauſe himſelf to be underſtood endeavours to expreſs his conceptions of things by his voice which he arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates by the judgment of his ear, as a Lutiniſt doth the ſtrings of his Inſtrument, which indeed is more artificially touch'd by a ſkillful then by an ignorant perſon, yet ceaſeth not to ſtrike the Ear, as the Language invented by ſuch men without Precepts will not be leſs audible though more diſagreeable then another. Moreover, Speech being as proper to man as Reaſon (whereof 'tis the Image, whence poſſibly the Greeks denote both by the ſame word) it may ſeem, that one remote from all commerce would not ceaſe as to reaſon ſo neither to ſpeak; but might as well do the one as the other. If there be any obſtacle, it muſt proceed from ſome cauſe: not from the material, to wit, the ſpecies of things, which it imports not whether they be introduc'd by one ſenſe or another; Nor from the efficient, the Organs of Speech being ſuppos'd intire; nor from the Formal, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail, ſince 'tis neceſſary for Speech to follow as often as the breath is ſtrongly driven out of the Lungs through the ſharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery into the Mouth, organiz'd by the Epiglottis, modifi'd by the Tongue, minc'd by the Teeth, and form'd by the Lips. As for the final, which is Communication, 'tis not leſs beneficial to one then to another. Wherefore all the cauſes of Speech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring and being ſupply'd to man by nature, the effect muſt neceſſarily follow. And if Beggars, particularly thoſe call'd Gipſies, make to themſelves a particular jargon, which they call <hi>Bleſche</hi> or <hi>Narquois,</hi> it will not be harder for thoſe we ſpeak of to do as much. Yea they will not find more difficulty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then occurs in the inventing of new Characters by ſuch as write in Cyphers: which is alſo confirm'd by the judgment of the Fathers who hold that the alteration of Tongues at the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> was nothing but the total abolition in each man's memory of the ſpecies of his maternal Language; which Memory being thereupon become a ras'd table and like a white paper, it concern'd men to agree together about new terms ſignificative of their conceptions. Otherwiſe (they ſay) if God had then infus'd an actual knowledg and habit of ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in all thoſe Workmen, this had not been a puniſhment but a reward of their arrogance, and in ſome ſort parallel to that famous gift of Tongues by the Holy Ghoſt at <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That ſince nothing can be in the Intellect which was not before in the Senſe, the Species of Voice cannot be introduced into the Underſtanding but by ſome outward ſenſe: Not by the Hearing, which is the right ſenſe of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſince none ſpeaks to the Children of whom the queſtion is: Nor by the Eyes, whoſe ſole object is the viſible Species: nor
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66371:116"/>
by the other Senſes, whoſe objects are alſo different from thoſe of the Hearing. Moreover, a Language being comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grammar, which is a Science, it cannot be underſtood much leſs practis'd without either Precepts or Examples. For want of which the memory of Children (of whom, we now ſpeak) not being furniſh'd with any Idea, can dictate nothing to the Muſcles and Nerves, the inſtruments of voluntary motion, which therefore can form no Speech; juſt as he that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to other exerciſes of the body no more then to thoſe of the mind, produces them not. That God created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with Speech, and that (as 'tis reported) ſome Children have ſpoken at their birth, yea ſome in their Mothers bellies; theſe are things purely ſupernatural, and from which nothing can be inferr'd.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That Women have ſuch a facility of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if two Children eſpecially of different ſexes were bred up together, 'tis likely the female would ſpeak firſt, not only as the more forward but as the greater tatler. Which was the reaſon of the miſcarriage of the King of <hi>Egypts</hi> trial, which he made only with Boys. And yet this habit of Speech is ſuch in men that in our age the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi>'s Brother being born deaf croſt the Rule, that perſons deaf by birth are always dumb; (as alſo hapned to many of the ſame Family of <hi>Velaſco</hi>). For he was taught to Speak, Write, Read and Underſtand Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, by putting a cord about his neck and ſtraitning or looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame to advertiſe him, when to open or ſhut his mouth by the example of his Teacher, that ſo he might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xpreſs the things which were repreſented to him at the ſame time: nor was there other difference found between his ſpeech and that of other men, but only that he did not regulate his voice, ſpeaking commonly too high: which hath alſo ſometimes been done by making the deaf man bite the Inſtrument upon which the ſound they would have him hear was form'd, becauſe the impreſſion which the Brain receives thereby anſwers in ſome ſort to the Senſe of Hearing.</p>

Beſides, every one is more ardent and zealous for the preſervation of his own Land, Wife and Children, yea and his own Life too, then for making deſigns upon the Life and Goods of others; in which caſe, beſides the dubiouſneſs of the event, the Souldiers are not ſure that what they ſhall conquer ſhall remain their own; but they are certain that what they defend well will remain ſo, ſince it belongs to them already.

Beſides, Defence carrying more juſtice with it then Invaſion doth, it muſt alſo beget more confidence and boldneſs in the Defenders, and more diffidence and fear in the Invaders, who cannot fight with ſo good a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for what is poſſeſt by, and therefore juſtly preſum'd to belong to others, whatever ſubtilty may be us'd to ſet up and colour a falſe title.</p>
            <p>The Second compar'd him that invades an Enemies Country, and him that expects him in his own, to two Gameſters, one whereof having begun to win will no longer venture any thing of his own, and the other begins the Game with his own money. For the Aſſailant hazards nothing of his own, ſince he makes his Enemies Country the ſeat of the War and of the hazard which follows it. And whether you place the benefit and end of this War in the conqueſt of the Enemies Country, or in a juſt defence only, 'tis always more commodious, profitable, and glorious to attaque him at home, then to expect him at your
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66371:117"/>
own doors. For, if you deſign to conquer, you muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enter into his country to get poſſeſſion; if only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your ſelf, then (as wiſe men chuſe rather to divert and prevent diſeaſes then to repel them already form'd, and as a Fire is more eaſily quencht in its firſt flame than when it hath ſeiz'd the roof and walls, ſo) 'tis eaſier to defend your own country by making a diverſion upon that of the enemy than to expel in your own all the deſolations that attend war, which you muſt ſuffer at home unleſs you remove it further. Beſides, in forreign Counties the war almoſt pays its ſelf, the Soldier lives as he liſt, enriches himſelf with the pillage of taken Towns, and ſo is leſs charge to his Prince. Yea, he becomes more valorous there too. For, as Antiperiſtaſis redoubles the force of Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, ſo the approach of an enemie's country gives heart to the moſt cowardly, and renders others more diſciplinable, as well knowing that they muſt look for help only from themſelves. Hence Armies have proſper'd better in a ſtrange Country than in their own. The Romans were always victorious out of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but often beaten at home, and reduc'd to great extremities by the Gauls and Carthaginians; who likewiſe were always overcome in their own Country. Hence <hi>Alexander</hi> conquer'd more Kingdoms and Provinces by carrying his Arms into <hi>Aſia,</hi> then his Father and all his Lieutenants won Towns in <hi>Greece</hi>; the Engliſh have been more fortunate in <hi>France</hi> then at home; and the Turks almoſt ever gain upon the Chriſtians by aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtendom. Yea Reputation, by which Kings reign, and Terror which half gets a victory, are always on the Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor's ſide, whereas on the contrary nothing abates the courage more then to ſuffer the invaders to come to our houſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the alacrity and promptitude of Soldiers is uſually great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt when acccompani'd with great hopes.</p>
            <p>The third ſaid, 'Tis impoſſible to determine any thing in this or any other political Queſtions, which are variable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to diverſity of Circumſtances; The frontier of one State may be ſo ſafe that there is nothing to be fear'd at home from the enemy, againſt whom therefore all the ſeditious and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſons may be ſafely ſent: Forreign War ſerving as a Sanctuary to bad Citizens, who fear the puniſhment of their crimes; in which reſpect it ſerves for a purgation and bleeding to the body Politick. Other States, there are which (like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Perſons, whoſe bodies are ſtrong enough to ſupport themſelves, but not to aſſail other) no ſooner take the field but diſcord and diviſion ariſes at home, and ſo they incurr the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Aſtrologer who fell into a ditch whilſt he was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on the sky. Wherefore 'tis not more eaſie to reſolve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis beſt to make war, neer-hand or afar off, without ſaying in what time, in what place, with what means and againſt what enemies, than to counſel a Tradeſman whether he ſhould keep or get, without knowing why and whether he hath money in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66371:118"/>
his purſe or no. The Examples alledg'd on either ſide reſemble the ſound of thoſe bells which accord with all Notes. Thoſe that have proſper'd in conquering would poſſibly have got more if they had put themſelves only upon the Defenſive; and thoſe that have been worſted in defending their own, perhaps did it too late, and (as it moſt frequently happens) when their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were impair'd. But it may be ſaid of the French and all other warlike Nations that they are much fitter to attaque their enemy afar off then to ſupport his irruptions in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; becauſe the firſt requires ſuch an ardor and impetuoſity as is natural to them; and the ſecond hath need of much patience, in which we have always been ſurmounted by Strangers, till that grand Genius of the State which animates it at this day mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted that Conduct doth all both in war and peace.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLVIII. Whence diverſity of Opinion proceeds.</head>
            <p>TIs no wonder if every cauſe produces a different effect, and that there is diverſity not only between things of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind and ſpecies, but alſo between each individual, ſo that two eyes are not perfectly alike. Which variety, had we ways of diſtinguiſhing, would appear to us everywhere elſe, as it doth (for example) to the Dog, who, of two Hares which we judg alike, knows which he ſtarted firſt. But that one and the ſame thing appears divers according to the diverſity of thoſe that judg of it, this ſeems as ſtrange in the inquiſition of its cauſe as 'tis common in practice. For ſince that the Intellect judges of things according to the report of the outward ſenſes, without whoſe miniſtry nothing is introduc'd into it; and that theſe ſenſes and their mediums being well-diſpos'd agree all in their reports, the whiteneſs of this paper, the blackneſs of this ink, and the truth of all other objects being faithfully repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us; Why ſhould not all men, that hear one and the ſame propoſition, and the reaſons whereby it is backt and oppos'd, make the ſame judgment for, or againſt it, without being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as they are, into ſeveral opinions. The cauſe hereof I aſcribe to the ſeveral diſpoſition and habitude of the Organs which render the ſoul's operations different. A ſucking child being at a Sermon, underſtands nothing at all of it; one ſix or ſeven years old carries away a confus'd knowledg of it, and thinks it enough to ſay that the Preacher ſpoke of God; the young man and the old man judg thereof according to their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the cholerick haſtily, the melancholy with more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and almoſt all ſeverally. Again, if the matter be ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical, the Peaſant who underſtands it not, judges thereof with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66371:118"/>
admiration, the Scholar eſteems it, the illiterate Tradeſman blames it, and preferrs a point of morality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in brief every one judges of it after his own way. In the mean time 'tis one and the ſame Sermon, as one and the ſame liquor pour'd into different veſſels, which give it the taſt wherewith they are already imbru'd.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, 'Tis true, Nothing is in the Intellect but what was before in the Senſes, yet many times the Intellect is ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with prejudice that all ſupervening reaſons ſignifie nothing; and when ſome Paſſion, as Love or Hatred, biaſſeth it, there is no room for equal conſideration. Hence condemned perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accuſe their Judges unjuſtly; though indeed a friend's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation makes them look upon cauſes with other eyes then they ſhould do.</p>
            <p>The third ſaid, This variety of judgments proceeds not only from the diverſity of the ſpecies introduc'd by the common ſenſe into the Intellect, but from the different conjunction which the Intellect makes of thoſe ſpecies; juſt as the ſame alphabet is written and read variously by ſeveral Writers, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpeak the ſame language, yet both their pronunciation and phraſe is different. Whence their expreſſions being ſo different, 'tis no wonder if the concluſions of their reaſonings prove not the ſame.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſaid, He conceiv'd that there are ſome qualities in the ſoul which ſhe derives not from the body. Otherwiſe we ſhould not ſee ſome people extremely opinionative and obſtinate, whoſe temper hath nothing of melancholy; nor others ſo light and mutable, though their conſtitution be not cholerick; and yet theſe two humors are commonly reputed the cauſes of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs and inconſtancy. But to what ſhall we aſcribe it except to the ſoul alone that ſome men are naturally ſo given to devotion, that in an affair wherein religion is never ſo little concern'd they account nothing equitable againſt Eccleſiaſts; and in the mean time there are others to whom what ever this ſort of people propoſe is ſuſpected. And who can think that the reſolution of thoſe that have been burnt for Hereſie proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the temperament of the body.</p>
            <p>The fifth ſaid, That Opinions are to be diſtinguiſht into Practical and Speculative. The firſt whereof, wherein we find our ſelves intereſſed, and which we promote upon that account, 'tis probable follow the temper and conformation of the Organs. Thus the melancholy man, who fears even imaginary dangers, cannot be perſwaded to prefer trading at ſea before that at land, but is alwavs fixt to hazard nothing. If he muſt chooſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, he takes the Gown before the Sword, and then too he had rather be ſilent then advance any new propoſition lyable to rejection. But if his birth or fortune command him to the war; he is rather for corrupting the enemies forces then fighting them, and in caſe of the latter he chooſes an ambuſcade before a pitcht battel. On the contrary, the hot cholerick perſon preferrs a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66371:119"/>
courſe, whereby he may ſooneſt compaſs his deſign, though with the hazard of his Life, (which he will not believe, or at leaſt not fear) before the tedious progreſſes of other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which afford not their proſecutor meat till his teeth be out. And the Sanguine eaſily agrees to this Advice, provided it requires no pains, or be ſweetned with ſome paſtime; but the Phlegmatick cares neither for one nor the other. On the other ſide, in things conſiſting onely in Contemplation, I ſee not why I ſhould be rather of the Opinion, that the flux and reflux of the Sea is caus'd by the Moon than by the Sun. And hence it is that perſons of different Tempers, Sexes, Climats, and Ages, agree more readily in a point of Philoſophy, than in their particular Inclinations and kind of Life. Indeed the main Source of this Diverſity of Opinion, is, the Vanity and Ambition of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Mind, which judging it ſelf as well ſtock'd with Capacity and ſufficiency as any other, and above all things, loving Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſeems diſparag'd by conſenting to an Opinion advanc'd by another; this Conceit, together with the dubiouſneſs of all things not demonſtrable, carries us to ſeek ſome new Light, which cannot be ſo ſmall, but we love it more than that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as people commonly do their own Children. Hence ariſe the ſo different Opinions of the Ancients, about all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Philoſophy and other Sciences, not excepting Divinity it ſelf even amongſt Catholicks; amongſt whom we ſee <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> diſagreeing with Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> doth in Phyſick with <hi>Galen, Copernicus</hi> with <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in Mathematicks, <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Lully</hi> and <hi>Ramus</hi> in Scholaſtick Philoſophy with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and in Civil Law <hi>Caſſius,</hi> with <hi>Labeo,</hi> and the Sabinians with the Proculeians.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, 'Twere a greater wonder if all Men were of one Opinion, than that they imitate in this diverſity all other things of the world: At leaſt 'tis harder to aſſign the cauſe why one and the ſame Man is to day of one judgement, and to morrow of another, then to ſee as many ſeveral Sentences as Heads. But to me this variety ſeems to ariſe from the various conception of things. As appears by the example of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who being purpos'd to deſtroy King <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> no ſooner heard <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeak in his defence but he pardon'd him; not to ſpeak of many other Effects, both of his and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>'s Eloquence. Whence it comes to paſs, that though the ſame Fact be related with the ſame Reaſons, yet the Diverſities found in the manner, and in all the ſenſes, imprint in us different ſpecies; upon the report whereof we alſo make a different judgement.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, This Variety proceeds from the Principles of Knowledge, as appears in thoſe of Mathematicks., which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain and known to all, cauſe every one to aſſent to their infallible Conſequences. And ſo in a perſon ſeen at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of whom having a confus'd Knowledge, one ſaith, 'Tis a Tree, another, a Beaſt or a Man; but when his nearer

approach makes him better known, all agree that 'tis <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>James.</hi>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLIX. Why there is more Wind at Sea than at Land.</head>
            <p>THe experience of leſs Wind and more Rain on Land than at Sea, makes their Opinion queſtionable, who hold, Exhalations to be the matter of the former, and Vapours of the latter: unleſs we will ſay, that Winds, to whom the Poets rightly attribute the Empire of the Sea, drive the Clouds over the Land, where being leſs agitated, they reſolve into Rain. But to continue my reaſoning with the ſame Poets, I ſhall ſay, that having plac'd <hi>Aeolus</hi>'s Palace in the caverns near the ſea, they have ſufficiently proved, why the Sea is more troubled with them than the Land. For theſe Winds viſibly iſſue from deep Caverns fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent on the Coaſts of the Sea, whoſe continually agitated waves inceſſantly ſtir them up. 'Tis no wonder then if they diſplay their violences on that ſide which is freeſt to them: Which is experienc'd in great Lakes adjacent to high Mountains; as in that of <hi>Comum,</hi> and <hi>de la Garde</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> whoſe waves and roarings reſemble thoſe of the Sea; and alſo in that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which is troubled extraordinarily. Not but that Winds are generated in other Subterraneous places too, none of which is exempt from them; as appears in Wells and the mouths of Caves. But the openings of ſuch places being commonly ſtrait upwards, the Wind that come out of them is not ſo perceptible as that which iſſues out laterally from high Caverns upon the Sea-ſhore; and they differ, in that the Sea Wind is dryer and leſs corrupting, poſſibly by reaſon of the ſaltneſs of the water, upon which it paſſes.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid. That the difference in Queſtion proceeds from the vaſt extent of the Sea, which gives the Air once agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, more liberty to continue its motion; which, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is ſtraitned and repreſs'd on Land by the occurſe of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Trees, Houſes, and other obſtacles: By the ſame reaſon that the waves of a Pool or little Lake, are much leſs than thoſe of the Ocean, beſides, that one and the ſame Wind hath much greater effect in a ſmooth and liquid plain, which yields to it, than upon a rough ſolid Body, upon which burdens are not mov'd but with more force than there needs upon the water; as they experience who endeavour to draw a ſtranded Ship on the Land, which they ſaw move almoſt of it ſelf whilſt it was upon the water. The Mechanical Reaſon whereof is, that the water breaking into infinite points, ſcarce makes any reſiſtance to its Agent; but the Earth preſs'd with the ſame load, reſiſts it in infinite points.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:66371:120"/>The Third ſaid. He that defin'd Wind to be Agitated Air, rather ſpoke its Effect than Cauſe, which is ſome middle thing between a Vapor and an Exhalation, driven violently according to all the differences of place. For an Exhalation, which always mounts upwards, and the Vapor which refrigerated deſcends downwards, cannot ſeparately be the matter of Wind. Hence as ſoon as the Vapor of a Cloud is reſolv'd into Rain, the Wind ceaſeth; the Exhalations not being ſufficient to produce it alone, as neither the Vapor is. Otherwiſe, Winds ſhould be greateſt in hot weather, when Exhalations are moſt plentiful. Wherefore the Sea having in its Four Qualities the materials of theſe two Meteors, and being otherwiſe more capable of emitting them through its liquid ſubſtance, than the Earth is through its hard and ſolid ſurface, though both be equally heated as well by the Sun, as by Subterraneous Fires, Evaporations and Exhalations, are ſooner and oftner made at Sea than at Land.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the thickeſt Air being oftimes the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the cleareſt the moſt windy, 'tis doubtful whether Vapors and Exhalations produce Winds; which, beſides, preſuppoſeth actual heat in the Sea, which yet is never felt there, but onely on Land. It ſeems therefore that the Element of Air being very ſymbolical to that of the Air by their agreement and moiſture, they follow the motions one of the other. Hence the Air conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Sea, is agitated by it; whence ariſeth a Wind, which again agitates the Sea; it being well known, that when there are no Waves there is no Wind. On the contrary, when the Wind is to change, the billows turn firſt. And ordinarily, the Winds change with the Tides.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid. There are two ſorts of Winds upon the Sea; Particular, which reign in our Seas, blowing indifferently from all Coaſts; and General, which blow continually from the ſame quarter, without giving place to their Contraries. Such is the Oriental Wind in the Torrid Zone, which was call'd by the Latins, <hi>Subſolanus,</hi> and by Mariners at this day, South-Eaſt. For it conducts Ships ſo conſtantly over the whole extent of <hi>Mer du Nord, &amp; du Sud,</hi> that without diſcontinuing Day or Night, it exempts the Sea-men from touching their ſails, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they are near the Aequinoctial. Indeed in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> this Rule alters, for this Wind holds there but ſix moneths, leaving the other ſix free to its Antagoniſt. The Cauſe whereof, is aſcrib'd to the repercuſſion of the capes and coaſts of thoſe Seas, as that firſt Wind is to the motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> which, together with the inferior Spheres, draws the Air along with it in this place, where the circumference of its motion is largeſt. There is another general Wind, which blows between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, or twenty fourth Degree on this ſide the Line, and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth becoming Occidental with the like conſtancy that the aboveſaid Oriental doth. This ſome attribute to a contrary motion, which all things have when thoſe neareſt them are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66371:120"/>
violently; as the ſtream of water running impetuouſly in the midſt, makes that near the ſhores recoil backwards.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That as Vapours make Miſts and Fogs, and Sulphureous Exhalations make igneous Meteors; ſo the Nitrous make Wind, which keeps the air from corruption as the Earth is kept from it by Nitre, and the Sea by Salt. Moreover, both the Wind and Nitre dry, and are the cauſes of fecundity; as is prov'd (on the behalf of Nitre) by the Nitrous ſand of <hi>Nilus,</hi> whoſe greater or leſſer overflow promiſes to the Egyptians a year proportionably fruitful; which is alſo ſaid of the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> abounding with Nitre. And as for the Wind, beſides that all flatuous Meats provoke luſt, 'tis ſaid that the Mares of <hi>Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> conceive by the Weſt-wind alone which alſo is ſtyl'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Flowers. In Brief, if Wind be impetuous, the effects of Nitre in Gun-powder and Aurum fulminans, manifeſt that Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is no leſs. Now Nitre being mix'd with the Air, where it is volatile; with the Earth, where it is fix'd; and with the Sea, where it is barely diſſolv'd; no wonder if it exhale more eaſily from the Sea then from the Land, and conſequently if more winds be there. Whence the reaſon may be drawn not only of the Sea-winds but alſo of the tempeſts and commotions of that vaſt Element; a Tempeſt being nothing but the rarefaction of the Sea; Nitre, and the inflation of the Waters at Full Moon in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> only the fermentation of the ſame Nitre in the ſeaſon proper for generation. As for that inflation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the time of the Dog-ſtar, when the Eteſian winds reign, it proceeds from the heat of the Air then inflam'd by the rays of the Sun, like the ebullition of Honey and Syrups impregnated with much Salt, as appears by their diſſolution and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they acquire over the Fire.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, That the coldneſs of Vapors ariſing from waters giving more body and conſiſtence to winds, makes them ſtrike a more ſenſible blow then when they are deſtitute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; whence they are greater in Winter then in Summer, and in the Morning then at Noon. Thus the ſame quantity of water will cauſe more alteration in the body being drunk cold then warm, becauſe the impreſſion of the latter is much leſs upon our bodies. And the Providence of the Author of Winds is remarkable too, in that they are miſchievous at Land but uſeful at Sea; hurtful things being by a ſecret of his power as much diminiſh'd, as profitable are augmented.</p>
            <p>The Eighth ſaid, That not only Wind-mills but alſo the Wind-wagons invented lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> ſhew that wind well manag'd is no leſs profitable at Land then at Sea. Therefore I ſhould refer the cauſe to the poroſities, overtures, and caverns of the Earth, into which the wind entring is by that means leſs at Land; whereas the ſurface of the Sea giving it no ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, 'tis left to its freer courſe upon the ſame; whence when thoſe pores of the Earth are ſhut up by froſt, the wind
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66371:121"/>
becomes more impetuous then it is in Summer when they are open.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLIX. Whether it be eaſier to procure obedience by Gentleneſs then by Terrour.</head>
            <p>THe moſt plauſible vertues are not always the nobleſt: as they depend upon external things which encreaſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh their value, ſo oftentimes they yield to thoſe obſcure and private vertues, whoſe beauty being only internal, without borrowing any recommendation from abroad, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more to be eſteem'd. Gentleneſs or Manſuetude is of this nature, though it make not ſo great a noiſe as Fortitude, which is irreſiſtible by the terror it impreſſes upon the oppoſers of its deſigns, yet oft-times it accompliſhes its enterpriſes with the more facility in that it makes not uſe of any extraneous help, but only of what this vertue it ſelf affords; which inſinuating ſweetly into their minds whom it would lead by the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own good, more eaſily procures obedience then fear doth; which indeed may conſtrain them to do what they would not voluntarily aſſent to, but is a violent motion, and ſo harder to be impreſs'd then that which is voluntary. For when once the reaſon is perſwaded of the juſtice of the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, there is no more obſtacle in the Will, which then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns it ſelf to be lead by that light of the Underſtanding; much leſs in the inferior Powers, which move only by the orders of thoſe upon which they totally depend.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Did men leave themſelves to the guidance of Reaſon more then of their Paſſions, it would be eaſier to procure obedience by Gentleneſs then by Terror, which then would be uſeleſs; ſeeing 'tis not neceſſary to oblige ſuch men by denunciation of penalties to their duty, who addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it voluntarily upon the knowledg they have of right Reaſon. But ſince very few follow this Rule, in compariſon of thoſe that have none but that of their diſorderly Appetites, therefore ſeverity is more expedient then mildneſs for reducing them at any rate whatever to their duty. For their obedience though conſtrain'd is nevertheleſs exemplary, and draws others to do the like, and ſo maintains that mutual correſpondence which gives ſubſiſtence not only to States but alſo to all other civil Societies, and which conſiſts chiefly in a certain depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance between the parties deſtinated to obey and to command. So that as the latter ought to ſtudy to maintain the Authority and Superiority which they have, whether by Nature (as Fathers
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66371:121"/>
over their Children) or by Love (as Kings and Magiſtrates over their Subjects, and Maſters over their Domeſticks) ſo when thoſe under them fail of what they are oblig'd to render to them, there is no ſurer nor eaſier way to bring them to it then Terror, which propoſing a ſenſible penalty to them in caſe of miſcarriage is incomparably more powerful to make them obey, then ſweetneſs; which indeed hath ſome charms to win more rational ſpirits, but being accompany'ed with ſoftneſs and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, becomes at length odious and contemptible by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confuſion which follow impunity of crimes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, 'tis certain that as States are maintain'd by the exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Laws, ſo their deſtruction ordinarily happens only by the relaxation which Superiors ſuffer of the puniſhments due to ſuch as tranſgreſs them.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Poets who feign men formerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd in divers parts of the Earth without Religion, Laws or Diſcipline, to have been gather'd together by the melodious conſort of muſical Inſtruments, with which <hi>Orpheus,</hi> (as they relate) attracted even Beaſts and Rocks, ſeem to conclude ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Gentleneſs then Terror, this latter cauſing thoſe that uſe it to be hated as much as the former doth to be lov'd. But ſetting aſide fabulous authorities, the moſt ſedulous inquirers into the cauſes of the foundation of States attribute the ſame to the charms of their Eloquence of theſe men, who being found fitteſt to inſinuate to them the advantages of living in ſociety, reduc'd them thereunto by impoſing Laws upon them, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing wherewith they reſerv'd themſelves as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe that voluntarily ſubmitted to their Government; which having taken its riſe from Gentleneſs cannot better be preſerv'd then by the ſame, if the Philoſophers Maxime be true, That things are preſerv'd by the ſame principles which ſerv'd to their eſtabliſhment.

            <p>'TIs the part of the ſlothful and ſuch as live by the ſweat of others to blame Induſtry. 'Twere tolerable indeed to reject out of the rank of liberal Arts ſuch as have any thing of baſeneſs or ſordidneſs, but to do the like by an Employment ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable alone to enrich States, furniſh them with all neceſſaries, and maintain them in Amity and good Intelligence with their Neighbours, is too great a piece of Niceneſs, the reſult where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is that then the Gentry muſt either remain poor or elſe live by robberies and other unlawful courſes. For notwithſtanding
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66371:122"/>
the precaution of moſt places in adjudging almoſt the whole eſtate to the eldeſt ſons of Gentlemen, (which would not be neceſſary if they were left in a condition of getting, as all other ſorts of perſons are) yet the cadets of either Sex cannot have ſo ſmall a portion, but the ſucceſſion which before was able to ſupport the dignity of the name, at length either comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or ſo ſmall that the principal Heirs are forc'd either to dye of hunger, or to ſuſtain their lives by ſome exerciſe, the choice whereof is not ſo freely left to them as to their Predeceſſors. For the benefit alliances bring them is oftentimes not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; the Daughters being by the ſame cuſtoms very ill provided, and that benefit commonly accompani'd with new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. Indeed ſome Legiſlators have abſolutely forbidden Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi>; others have only permitted it to the inferior people, as <hi>Romulus,</hi> which induc'd <hi>Plato</hi> to found his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth far from the Sea-ports, for fear it ſhould be corrupted by the delights ordinarily introduc'd by ſtrangers, and his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens getting their livelihood by Merchandize ſhould learn to lye and deceive, the common vices of Merchants, which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith likewiſe of the Carthaginians, that being good of their own nature, they learn'd by the converſe of Merchants to addict themſelves to frauds and lyes, out of their great deſire of getting. But as Trading begets diſſimulation, ſo it makes men more prudent by the knowledge of ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons manners. Whence <hi>Homer</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>Odyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> makes this remark of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> that he had ſeen many Cities, which is proper to Merchants: but every body knows that one may lye, diſſemble, and deceive without being a Merchant, nor ought the abuſe of ſome hinder all from the uſe.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the reaſon why Trading is interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Gentry, is, leſt the ſweetneſs of gain ſhould retard them from the Wars for the ſervice of the King and defence of the State, whereof they are the ſupport and the right hand. And Gentlemen having no other exerciſe but Arms muſt needs be better ſkill'd therein then if their Minds and Bodies were ſhar'd amongſt ſeveral Occupations, and upon occaſion they are more ready and free from other employment to execute the orders they receive, then if they were in ſome long Voyage, or buſied about examining an Account-Book; an errour wherein, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imports their whole eſtate. Beſides, Souldiers more cheerfully obey him who they ſee leads a life far from all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This was the practiſe of the Romans, among whom 'twas not lawful for a Citizen to exerciſe Merchandize; but only for freed Servants, or others of the low vulgar. Much more was it forbidden to the Senators, who for that reaſon had the Port of their Ship limited, leſt they ſhould Trafick under pretext of tranſporting their Fruits and Rents; all profit ſeeming to them diſhoneſt. And the Thebans admitted no man to any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, unleſs he had diſcontinu'd Trading at leaſt ten years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66371:122"/>
The reaſon is given by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; becauſe Merchandize is an enemy to Vertue. Hence all acceſs to Honours hath been by the Laws interdicted to Merchants, or ſo much as to bear Arms; ſo that Gentility and Merchandize ſeem inconſiſtent. Add hereunto, that God forbids his people to have any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant amongſt them; becauſe, ſaith the Wiſe man, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant can hardly have his hands clean from ſin: And ſo <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> adventures to ſay, that a Merchant cannot pleaſe God, by reaſon of his perjuries and frauds; qualities directly contrary to true Gentility.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That ſeeing this life needs Action more then Contemplation; therefore good Polititians invite, by all ſorts of Honors and Priviledges, thoſe that are able to contribute moſt to the benefit, quiet, and increaſe of the State. But, ſo are Merchants; who bring plenty of all kinds of Goods to the moſt deſolate places, and enrich the more fruitful by diſtributing their commodities, which otherwiſe would be poor amidſt their abundance. Nor are they oblig'd to Trade in Perſon, ſo that they are not hindred from paying the perſonal Service they owe to their King and Countrey; for whoſe good they are oft-times beſt advertis'd by their Forreign Correſpondences, and give the certaineſt Intelligence of an Enemies Deſigns: beſides that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving travell'd into his Countrey in time of Peace, they the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know what way to mannage a War againſt him; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney wherewith they abound more then Gentlemen, gives them large Credit amongſt the Souldiers. The Roman Law that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Senators to Traffick, was extinct in the dayes of <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> as he complains: whereby it appears to have been lawful not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them, but alſo for the <hi>Equites,</hi> or Knights to negotiate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themſelves or by others; as at this day the Nobles of <hi>Spain, England, Venice,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Florence</hi> do. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Lucius Pretius</hi> an illuſtrious Roman Knight that Traffickt at <hi>Panormus,</hi> and of Q. <hi>Mutius</hi> of the ſame quality at <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> That God forbad his people Traffick, 'twas probably to keep them from being corrupted by the Idolatry of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and 'tis no more to be drawn into conſequence for us then abſtinence from Swines Fleſh and their other Ceremonies: But ſhould all that hath been ſaid againſt Merchants be admitted for good, it muſt be onely againſt Merchants by Retail, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that Trade in Groſs, who have alwayes been except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the rank of others.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Utility is not more incompatible with Honeſty then Trade is with Nobility, which nevertheleſs is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, according to the ſeveral ſentiments of Nations, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by extraction amongſt Chriſtians by warlike exerciſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Turks, by learning amongſt the Chineſes; as alſo the Nobles live in the Countrey in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> but in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>; from which circumſtances Nobility receives ſeveral Eſtimations, according to the ſeveral opinions of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66371:123"/>
But in general, Commerce, as 'tis the exerciſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo it hath been more honor'd in popular States then in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, where the power of Sovereigns ſhines brighteſt in War (which is oppoſite to Merchandize) and the fear of Monopolies (which would eaſily prevail here) renders odious the trading of Grandees, who incurre the peoples envy as ſoon as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the employments belonging to them. Moreover, the gain of Merchants is contrary to the liberality of a Gentleman, whoſe donations are interpreted in Law more extenſively, when there is queſtion about them, then thoſe of Yeomen. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſo gentle towards other ſinners, whipt the Tradeſmen out of the Temple, calling them Robbers, and their Shops Dens of Thieves. As accordingly, Pagan Antiquity aſſign'd them for their Patron <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Patron of Thieves, and the moſt infamous of the Gods. And the Emperours forbad Merchandize, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Senators by the <hi>Lex Clodia,</hi> but alſo to Nobles by extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>L. Nobiliores. C. De Comerciis &amp; Mercat.</hi> to Officers <hi>Leg. Ne quis C. de dignit.</hi> and even to Souldiers, <hi>L. Milites C. Loca, &amp; L. eos C. ne milites negotientur.</hi> And if ſome Nations, confounding Utility with Honeſty, have authorized the Trading of Nobles, 'tis but as baſe Money is, upon ſome neceſſity, allow'd current in one Countrey, and rejected in all others. And their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors agree, that the Splendor of ſuch Nobility is much diminiſht by negotiation; the diſtinction of Groſs and Retail, not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Species of the Queſtion, any more then more and leſs do in all others. Nor is it material whether they negotiate by the intervention of others, ſince 'tis not lawful to do by another what we may not do our ſelves; beſides, that ſuch intervention draws in the Honor of a Gentleman to vouch anothers Fact. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the poverty intended to be avoided thereby, is oftentimes met with inſtead of Riches; and were it otherwiſe, yet Poverty commonly ſerves for a ſpur to Virtue. Hence ordinarily Cadets are more courageous then Elder Brothers; and the poor <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> were the more Warlike; but <hi>Craſſus</hi> the Rich was overcome and ſlain by the Parthians.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXI. Why the French are ſo much incenſed with the Lye.</head>
            <p>TRue and Good being reciprocal; hence to call a man Lyar, is as much as to ſay, that he is of no Value; and becauſe the paltery Fellow is unworthy of Honour, whereof the French is more covetous then any other Nation (as appears by the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage wherewith he runs upon hazard to the danger of his Life, teſtifying thereby that he priſes Life leſs then Honour, to which moſt other Nations need to be incited by infinite Artifices)
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66371:123"/>
hence it comes to paſs that the French are more ſenſible of the Lye than they.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That all Mankind make eſteem of Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Courage towards men: the former having been a means us'd by the greateſt Princes and Legiſlators to gain the minds of their people; ſo powerful, that ſome even with the apparence of it alone have produced ſtrange effects, (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the dotages of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the Eaſt, and many others elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.) The other, namely Courage, being the vertue moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd amongſt men, and eſteem'd by women, who commonly favour the moſt valiant. Now Lying is a Vice oppoſite to both theſe Vertues, implying Impiety towards God, and Cowardize towards men. For he that lyes cannot be ignorant, that God the Father of Truth knows, and will ſooner or later puniſh his Crime, if he have power to do it, (as cannot be denied without manifeſt irreligion.) And ſince Truth comes of it ſelf to the Tongues end, unleſs it be detained Captive by Fear, or ſome other ſervile conſideration; hence a Lye preſuppoſes Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and Fear of him before whom it is ſpoken. So that it is no wonder if the reproach of theſe two crimes trouble us ſo much, the French Nation being the moſt glorious of the World.</p>
            <p>The third ſaid, That the Lye cannot but have ſomething in it more hainous then the reproach of Coward and Impious, ſince theſe are repayed only with the Lye, but the Lye it ſelf with blows; probably becauſe Lying is a ſervile Vice, and the French are very jealous of preſerving their Liberty. But we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between lying and telling a Lye; for in this latter caſe people are not readily offended, as in the former. Thus an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate pleading upon a Breviate, the matter whereof is fictitious, takes it not for an injury if the Adverſaries Advocate is falſe; but replies only, that he will juſtifie it. The Philoſopher main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an erronious opinion, which he believes good, will not be angry at its being impugned of falſhood. But when one is ſurpriſed in a Lye, which ſeems invented purpoſely to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Company, the diſcoverer of the falſhood ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him not only of knavery but alſo of ſottiſhneſs, in that he could not utter it dexterouſly enough to make it believ'd. As therefore Theft was not puniſhed, but eſteemed among the Lacedemonians, when it was well concealed, and received not chaſtiſement except the Thief were taken in the fact; ſo a Lye ſeems to offend only when it is diſcovered; but if handſomly told, inſtead of being blamed, is authorized by Rhetorick and Poetry, (which are arts of handſomly feigning things that are not) by Complements, which are fair Diſguiſements; by diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, common enough everywhere; by ſtratagems of War. Hence when we give the Lye to any one, we add, ſaving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Company; intimating thereby, that we intend not to reproach them of little judgment in letting paſs ſo groſs a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66371:124"/>
falſhood for a truth. For I ſee not that the French are greater Lyars then other Nations, unleſs you will bring under Lying their reſervedneſs and modeſty in not telling their deſigns to all the world.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the French being the moſt civilized of the world, have reaſon to take for the greateſt affront the Vice which moſt deſtroyes civil Life and Converſation; which being founded upon Communication, whereof Speech is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter: if there be no aſſurance in this, then Humane Society is deſtroyed. All other things are known for what they are by the ſpecies which they ſend to our ſenſes (as the ſpecies of a Dog and a Horſe never fail to repreſent them to us ſuch as they are) our intentions and thoughts alone are committed to ſpeech; which, if it ill repreſent them, is no more to be eſteem'd then a falſe Looking-glaſs which repreſents objects quite other then what they are; or then a copy not at all reſembling its original; or laſtly, then a thing which is nothing leſs then what it is taken to be. Hence a Lyar ſeeing himſelf diſ-believed, and every one upon their guard when he ſpeaks or negotiates; he hath reaſon to be ſharply offended with him that gives him ſuch a repute: and becauſe being accounted a Lyar, he that accuſes him would not believe his bare affirming the contrary; therefore he gives him a box on the ear, as the moſt ſuitable reply that can be made to the Lye; which being the higheſt affront, the blow is the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of it, which the uncover'd parts of the body (namely the hand and face) preſent to the offended perſon; which blow is eſteem'd the greater out-rage, in that it teſtifies the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the receiver, and is onely meant to provoke him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment: Therefore a thruſt with a Sword at an enemy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to deliver ones ſelf from the fear of him by killing him, is accounted much leſs injurious then an affront done purpoſely for the affronts ſake. But, beſides the foregoing reaſons, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome (which oftentimes hath none) in <hi>France</hi> authorizes the greatneſs of the injury of the Lye.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the refiners of Honor are like thoſe that ſharpen the points of Needles ſo much till they break. The French, inſtead of intereſſing their Honour (as moſt other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do) onely in things of importance, and of fairly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they ſpeak true when they are told that they Lye, are as much incens'd upon the ſole pronunciation of theſe words, as if they were ſo many magical terms forcing the hand to give a blow, or draw the ſword; and, which is ſtrange, 'tis not enquir'd whether the thing be true or falſe, the Lye being judg'd alike offenſive in both: yea, ordinarily they are the greateſt Lyars that are moſt offended with the Lye: the reaſon whereof may be, That the reproach of true Vices offends us more then that of falſe and ſuppoſitious, and thoſe of the minde more then thoſe of the body, as being more reprehenſible in us, in that 'tis our own fault that they are not amended: for a reproach made to one
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66371:124"/>
for a Vice he cannot remedy, ſerves more to ſhew the malice of the Reproacher than the fault of him that is blam'd But 'tis not ſo with a Lye, which preſuppoſes either ignorance or malice. Whence the terms of Sot and Ignorant are alſo moſt cutting even to thoſe that are not ſo. Beſides, a Lyar (unleſs he repel the injury; a vowing himſelf the Diſciple of the Father of Lyes, this Reproach is very odious to good men, eſpecially to the French, who ſo affect that Title from all Antiquity, that our Anceſtors have transferr'd it to Valour, (which they eſteem'd the chief of the Vertues) ſaying, that ſuch as have defended themſelves well, have done <hi>en gens de bien,</hi> like good men.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That the Lye is offenſive only upon account of the intention; ſince moſt of our Diſcourſes, Anſwers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies (wherein conſiſts one of the greateſt pleaſures of life, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which our Converſe would have no agreeableneſs, as appears by thoſe that ſpeak not to one another, or agree in every thing) are no other but fair givings of the Lye; yet are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offenſive, that they cauſe us to deſire the company of ſuch as know how to make handſom Reparties. Thus many of our Generals, whoſe venturouſneſs upon the greateſt hazards ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtifies their deſire of Praiſe, yet ſhew diſpleaſure at the hearing of their own Commendations; a Diſſimulation, which carries them ſometimes ſo far, that when any Hiſtory of theſe times publiſhes ſome brave Action perform'd by them, they ſcruple not to blame the Hiſtorian, who by concealing the like another time, may ſecure himſelf from ſuch Complements, if he take them not in the right ſenſe.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXII. Why every one thinks himſelf well enough provided with Wit; and ſome, better than others.</head>
            <p>AS the Eye ſeeth it not it ſelf, ſo the Intellect, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not it ſelf; but judging only of the parts of all others finds ſomething in them to diſcommend; and having a better conceit of its ſelf, arrogates the preeminence in the compariſon. For the reflexion of the Intellect upon it ſelf is never ſincere, but disguis'd and falſifi'd by the falſe reports and prejudices of Self-love, which makes us think our ſelves better then our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Hence thoſe that take not pains to conſider their own Wit, care not to make a juſt compariſon of it with that of others; ſince a right Compariſon is between two things known; and thoſe that can do it, do it through the clouds of Intereſt, which like Optical Glaſſes magnifie Objects, and make an Elephant of a Fly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:66371:125"/>The ſecond ſaid, 'Tis not univerſally true that every one is contented with his own wit; for there are many no leſs diffident then others are confident of themſelves. Hence ſome eloquent Tongues, fit either for the Chair, or the Bar, are kept from both by timidity and diſtruſt of their own abilities, and (as ſome great animals ſuffer themſelves to be lead and govern'd by a Childe) ſo their good wits, not underſtanding their own ſtrength, permit themſelves to be rul'd by thoſe that have worſe. Thus we ſee there are Apprentices in all Trades and Profeſſions more knowing then their Maſters; and many times in that of War, a brave experienc'd Souldier obeyes a cowardly and ignorant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain: And in Religious Houſes, ſome excellent Spirits glorying not to repute themſelves ſuch, ſuffer themſelves to be guided and ruled by thoſe of an inferiour Degree. Yea, the moſt preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous are ſeldom ſatisfi'd with their own firſt conceptions, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the frequent connexions and expunctions in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of their Writings, to which even after publiſhing they never ceaſe to adde or diminiſh. Of which number are many, who making a review of their precedent actions, alwayes finde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein to diſlike. But as for others who have a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own wit then that of others, this defect ſeems to proceed from the want of knowledge of themſelves, ſo much recommended by the Delphian Oracle; ſuch people reſembling the old Hag who put her eyes up in a Box when ſhe came home, and took them out onely when ſhe went abroad; or thoſe that have a Wallet upon their necks, whereof they never ſee but the forepart into which they put the affairs of their Neighbours; the other being behinde, into which they put all that concerns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Which our Saviour alſo reprov'd in Hypocrites, who ſee not the beam in their own eyes, yet ſpy a mote in that of their Neighbour.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That there being three ſorts of Goods, namely, of the Minde, the Body, and Fortune; the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are ſo expos'd to the eyes of every one, 'tis impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spectators in the judgement thereof. But 'tis not ſo with thoſe of the minde, which not appearing to all are like ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Records of a Law Suit, the extract or coppy whereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the honeſty or diſhoneſty of the reporter; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Judge and Party, 'tis no wonder if he award the Cauſe to himſelf; as thoſe that give their Voices to themſelves excuſe it by ſaying, That having ſworn to chooſe the moſt capable, they judg'd themſelves ſuch: Whereunto the evil cuſtom of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending one's ſelf much contributes, by turning into Nature, and ſo perſwading us of what we would make others believe. So alſo do flatterers, whom all the world delights to hear (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is pretended to the contrary) and who may ſpeak more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the gifts of the minde, becauſe they are not perceptible of themſelves, and ſo leſs ſubject to contradiction.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That 'tis ſo far from being true, that every
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66371:125"/>
one eſteems his own genius becauſe he ſees it not; that on the contrary he eſteems it more then others, becauſe commonly he ſees none but it; not in its ſubſtance, but in its effects. For if we value a Friend whoſe preſents we frequently behold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, how great reaſon muſt every one finde to prize his own ſpirit, whereof all the actions are in a manner preſent to him? He beholds himſelf in himſelf morning and evening, ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waking; and finding not external objects enough to compare with the multitude of internal ſpecies which his paſs'd actions furniſh to him, he makes the concluſion to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. If he be a Poet, all his Senſes are fill'd with his Rhimes; or with his ſquare Periods, if an Orator. The memory of his exploits inceſſantly returns to him, if he be a Souldier; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being reviv'd by ſome Sore or old Hurt, makes him eaſily preſume that he is as good as a Captain; or if he be a Captain that he could better perform the office of Field-Marſhal then he that hath it. In brief, there is no profeſſion wherein the minde findes not wherewith to content, yea, to admire it ſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to abate the value of others; compariſon being like a balance, one ſcale whereof cannot be rais'd without depreſſing the other.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the reaſon why every one is contented with his own Wit, is becauſe we are never brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our own errours, unleſs by conſtraint or conviction. And the minde never fails of a ſubterfuge and a pretenſe to lay the fault other-where then upon it ſelf. If haply ſome one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that he wanted fore-ſight, judgment, and good mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his affairs; yet he will alwayes turn the fault from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and rather recurre to cauſes that are not, ſaying, That he was bewitch'd, or at leaſt deceiv'd, even ſo far as to accuſe the truth of the moſt general Maxims, when they prove not to agree with his own falſe Principles. Whereas we are forward enough to condemn others magiſterially both in preſence and abſence.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That what is receiv'd, being according to the form and capacity of the recipient, 'tis impoſſible for the mind to conceive any thing greater then it ſelf: if it do, 'tis by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Eye ſees night when it ſees nothing, and as the moſt perfect Souls conceive the Deity, namely by conceiving that they cannot conceive it, which is no knowledge at all. Hence the Sky, Houſes, Trees, and other great viſible Objects enter into the Eye onely by a viſual ſpecies proportional to the bigneſs of the pupil which diminiſhes them. So likewiſe the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or minde of Man, being to judge of that of another, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts ſuch intentional ſpecies thereof as are correſpondent to its own capacity, and ſuch alone as it is able to comprehend. And as the continent is bigger then the thing contained; ſo this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional Species, which repreſents the image of anothers minde, being leſs then the minde which conceives it; 'tis no wonder if that which is conceived appears leſs then that which conceives it.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66371:126"/>
For otherwiſe, ſince the underſtanding is conform'd to the thing which it underſtands, if it ſhould conceive an Idea of a minde greater then it ſelf is, it ſhould become greater then it ſelf, which is abſurd. Beſides, as things neareſt us appear greateſt, and nothing is nearer us then our ſelves, 'tis not to be marvell'd at if we paſs judgement to our own advantage.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, That the reaſon of this difference is becauſe the ſpecies which concern others are not ſo deeply ingraven as thoſe which the underſtanding inceſſantly traces in it ſelf; whence it is that the diſpoſitions of that firſt rank are not ſo well imprinted as the habits of the ſecond. Now that the Species re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to others are more lightly engraven than thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves, appears by the example of the Graver, which paſſing but lightly over the Copper makes a little ſtroke almoſt imperceptible; whereas by its repaſſing ſeveral times upon the ſame place, (as is done by the frequent repetition of the ſame thoughts upon what regards our ſelves) it makes more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lines. Perhaps alſo this pleaſing Error is left to Man, to comfort him for the unequal ſhare of all other Goods; which otherwiſe would bring him into Deſpair, or at leaſt very much increaſe the unhappineſs of his Life.</p>

This laſt is the drawing forth of the Natural by ſome Extraneous Heat, as that of the moiſt Ambient Air, which inſinuating into the corrupting body, plays the part of an Agent therein; and not onely alters its qualities, but alſo either increaſes or diminiſhes its quantity; as is ſeen in the Fermentation of Medicaments, and in Leven which makes paſte riſe, in which motion the Local is likewiſe obſerv'd. Thus the matter being wrought and agitated by all ſorts of motions, is diſpos'd in a manner ſuitable for receiving ſome form, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enſues upon ſuch diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That in Equivocal Generation; (which the Queſtion relates to) Salt holds the place of the Maſculine Seed; and the Humidity, it corrects that of the Feminine; as appears by a pot fill'd with common earth, which moiſtned only with Rain produceth Stones, Plants, and Snails: But after you have depriv'd it of its Salt, by waſhing it with hot water, (as the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter-men
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66371:126"/>
do) it remains barren: Nature employing its fixt Salt for the Formation of Stones; the volatile with its Mercury, for Plants; and the ſame with its Sulphur for Animals, whoſe diverſity, poſſibly, comes from that of theſe Salts; amongſt which, Nitre contributes marvellouſly to Fecundity. Hence Excrements, being almoſt wholly nitrous, ſo ſoon produce Beetles, Flyes, Worms, and other Inſects: Sweat, beings of the ſame Nature, makes Lice; and Urine, Fleas; the ſlime of Marſhes, which is nitrous, (as the turfs we uſe for fewel mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt) produces Frogs; Boats of Salt ſwarm with Rats, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others by licking the Salt: Wheat alſo, being very ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, generates Field-mice, and other Inſects: And all this in the unctuous moiſture of its ſelf, or which it renders ſuch by its Heat, which reduces the ſame to a viſcouſneſs fit for retaining the form to be introduc'd; and as the Ebullition of Syrrops and Muſt, is a ſpontaneous Motion proceeding from their ſalts, ſo the ſame being rais'd by the heat without to a more eminent degree cauſes the progreſſive Motion in an Animal. The outward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Cauſe is the Diſpoſition of the Matter, which that double heat finding diſpos'd for a certain Form, faſhions and extends for that purpoſe. Thus the marrow of the Back-bone being near the Reins, which are full of Salt, may become a Serpent; a Woman's Hair laid in a Dunghil produceth Worms or little Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; Caterpillars retain the colour of the ſap of the Tree through which the Humour that produces them paſs'd, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſeveral colours of the Flowers about which they are bred; as is ſeen in the mothy colours of the ſame Caterpillars eſpecially when they become Butter-flies. The internal, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, or formative Cauſe is an inviſible Character graven in the ſaid Salts, which determines every thing to its Species, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that which is found in the Seed of each Plant and Animal, and which the Chymiſts hold cannot be extinguiſht in the ſalts of ſome Plants, affirming, that the aſhes of Sage or Roſemary ſown bring forth Sage and Roſemary. The Final Cauſe is the Perfection of the Compound; whereunto Nature always aſpires; it being certain, that an Animal is more noble than a Body inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, whence ſome prefer a Fly above the Sun. Upon which account ſhe changes Mixts into Plants, and theſe into Animals.</p>
            <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſaid, That the Univerſal Spirit of the World acts in this caſe like a General of an Army, who, ſeeeing an Enemy ready to fly, and none of his own party preſent to ſeize upon him, though his Imployment be not to take Priſoners, but only to give Orders, yet for this time he condeſcends to play the part of a common Soldier: ſo the aboveſaid Univerſal Spirit not ſeeing any Form diſpos'd to keeps its rank in the Order of Nature, and finding the matter fit to receive the form of a Rat, Mouſe or Frog, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſupplies the ſame to it by its own ſole approach. Hence ſuch Inſects as need feweſt parts, are ſooneſt and moſt eaſily ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of Putrefaction, perfecter Animals never.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:66371:127"/>The Fourth ſaid, That Nothing being made of Nothing, ſome Matter is requir'd to every Generation, which being barely alter'd in Animals which produce their like, is corrupted in thoſe which are generated of themſelves; the internal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity which ſerv'd to conjoyn the dry parts together, being drawn out; whence Carcaſes become duſt. And becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is never idle, therefore when She finds part of that Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity full of a ſeminal Vertue and a Vital Spirit, and cannot make a Plant or an Animal of it like what it was before, then ſhe forms imperfect Creatures. Which effect is not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Elements being full of ſouls, nor to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intelligence which <hi>Avicenna</hi> ſaith is deſtinated to the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Forms, nor to Heaven, call'd by ſome, The Parent Forms; but to the eſtabliſh'd order of Nature, That when Matter is indu'd with all the Diſpoſitions requiſite to ſuch or ſuch a Form, the ſame muſt be introduc'd into it; which conſtitutes not a different Species from the Animals generated of Seed; though the particular end of thoſe bred of corruption ſeems to be the purgation of the Elements, all whoſe impurities they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and are nouriſht therewith.</p>
            <p>The fifth ſaid, That theſe Generations muſt be attributed to the Sun, who tranſmits not only his Influence upon the ſurface of our Elements, but alſo his Influence and Vertue to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth, where it concocts, digeſts, prepares, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vifies Metals, and makes mineral Waters boil. For, beſides that ſuch Generations happen chiefly when he approaches or makes himſelf moſt fell upon our Horizon; ſome have obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, That Rats, begotten of Corruption without the help of Male and Female, are diſtinguiſh'd from others; in that, being expos'd to the Sun after death, they have little or no bad ſmell, but are conſum'd and become in a manner no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; that Planet reſuming what it had contributed to them: whereas the ſmell of other produc'd by ordinary generation is intolerable.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That both in Univocal Generation (which is compar'd to one fire kindling another) and in that by Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which hath ſome Analogy with fire excited by a Steel) the ſame difficulty occurrs; namely, What imperceptible Chain and Link attracts Forms, and makes them neceſſarily deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Compound, to give it Being ſo ſoon as fit Diſpoſitions concur therein; whether theſe Diſpoſitions are awaken'd by the Seed, as when you ſow a Plant in well-prepared ground, or whether they ſpring out of the earth without ſowing, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Plants do, which are more vigorous, and leſs need cultivation than others: by the Gardener's reaſon, that Mothers have more care of their own Children than Nurſes have of thoſe of others. Hence Rats bred of Corruption, are more ſprightly, and long-liv'd, and multiply more than others. As for the manner of their Generation, it muſt have ſome proportion with that of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66371:127"/>
perfect Animals, which are as little underſtood; there being no Philoſophy that can tell why a Horſe begets rather a Colt than a Calf; nor why a Pear-tree rather produces a Pear than a Plum.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXIIII. Of Zoophytes or Plant-Animals.</head>
            <p>THe comprehenſiveneſs of this Univerſe appears in that in the diviſion of Entity and Subſtance, not onely each Member anſwers to as many things as are in Nature, but there are as many others as there can be ſeveral combinations made of the Members of this diviſion. Thus in the diviſion of Souls into vegetative, ſenſitive, and rational, there are found middle ones not onely between ſenſe and reaſon, but alſo between Vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Senſe: Examples whereof may be ſeen in the Families of Animals and Vegetables. Some Plants have no Root as <hi>Miſleto</hi> and <hi>Muſhrooms</hi>; others nothing but Root, as <hi>Trubs</hi> and <hi>Truffles:</hi> ſome have onely leaves, as <hi>Duckmeat</hi>; others neither flowers nor ſeed, as <hi>Ferne</hi>; ſome want leaves, as <hi>Venus-Navil</hi>; others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly put forth the Fruit before the Leaf, as the Fig-Tree; and laſtly, ſome Flower without bearing Fruit, as the Flower-Cherry-Tree: Of Animals, ſome are bred of putrefaction, and of others, ſome remain a while without motion or life (to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) as the Silk-Worm in its bag, and Snails in Winter; others remain alwayes immoveable, as Oyſters: And becauſe this manner of being nouriſh'd and growing without any progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motion is proper to Plants, and yet by opening and ſhutting their Shells they teſtifie ſome ſenſe; therefore they are call'd Plant-animals, in which the Soul ſeems to be compounded, and to reſemble changeable colours, which conſiſt of two extreams, as Gray doth of White and Black, being wholly neither, but both together. So alſo a Zoöphyte is ſomething leſs then an Animal, and more then a Plant.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Forms and particularly Souls are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. Indeed one may be comprehended in another, as the Vegetative is in the Senſitive, and this in the Rational (which comprehends all eminently) but it cannot enter into the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of another, much leſs be divided, informing a body that is half Plant and half Animal; otherwiſe by the ſame reaſon there might be others half Men and half Beaſts, which is not imaginable, but under the form of a Monſter. Moreover, ſuch diviſion would proceed to infinity, there being a Latitude and Degrees without end between one extream and another; of one whereof that which partakes moſt, would conſtitute a new Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or rather a new genius, which is abſurd, and contrary to

Philoſophy; which admits not multiplication of things without nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſity.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That by the ſame reaſon Plants and Animals being of the ſame ſpecies there can be no doubt but theſe two at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes might be found in the ſame Subject. For Vegetation and Senſe being onely ſeveral operations of the ſame Soul, which acts differently, according as it findes the Organs of its Subject diſpos'd; hence the multiplication of Souls is unneceſſary, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are all but one. And as in Brutes the ſenſitive faculty ſupervening to the vegetative in their generation, adds no new form to the former; ſo the vegetation of Plants is nothing leſs then the ſenſitive: the diſpoſitions of the matter being the ſole cauſes of this diverſity. An Animal depriv'd of the uſe of ſome ſenſes, is no leſs an Animal then another that hath all: why then is a Tree leſs an Animal, becauſe it exerciſes fewer operations of its ſoul then Animals do? Nor is it a concluſive reaſon that Plants are wholly deſtitute of the faculties of ſenſe, becauſe the ſame are not perceptible to our Senſes, which yet finde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſatisfie themſelves in the ſenſitive Plant, growing (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others relate in <hi>Zanolha,</hi> a part of <hi>Tartary,</hi> where the Inhabitants ſowe a Grain like that of our Melons, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer; from which grows an Herb which they call <hi>Borra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metz,</hi> that is, a Lamb, whereof it hath the whole figure, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Feet, Hoofs, and Ears, yea, all the Head excepting the Horns; inſtead whereof it hath a tuft of Hair upon the Forehead. 'Tis cover'd with very ſoft Hair, employ'd by the Natives to make Caps of. Its Fleſh reſembles that of Crevices, and being wounded, ſends forth blood, being alſo of a very ſweet taſte: It adheres to the earth by its root, which ſends forth a Stem or Stalk which is inſerted into its Navil. To all which wonders they adde, That it lives as long as there is any green Graſs about it, and dyes when the ſame is wither'd either by time or purpoſely. And to make the compariſon full, they ſay that of all devouring Animals Wolves alone deſire to feed of it, We finde alſo ſome example of this double Life in the Wood of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which being humected in water is turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ducks: as alſo in the Leaves of another Tree like that of the Mulberry, which <hi>Anthony Pigafet</hi> reports to have two little feet, on which they run away as ſoon as one touches them, and live onely of Aire. Such likewiſe are the Mandrakes of upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> which grow in the axact ſhapes of Men and Women; The <hi>Baraas</hi> mention'd by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which ſhines in the night, and whoſe flight cannot be ſtopt but by the menſtrual blood of a woman. The Balſam-Tree which <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms to tremble at the approach of the Iron that is to make inciſion in it; and that other Tree which <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith grows about eight foot high in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Pudiferam,</hi> and upon the approach of a man or other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal contracts its boughs, and extends the ſame again upon their departure, whence it took the name of <hi>Arbor Pudica</hi>: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66371:128"/>
and dilatation is alſo attributed to the Spunge. In all which effects we obſerve powers and faculties near of kin to thoſe of Animals. The ſame uniformity of nature between Plants and Animals is prov'd alſo, in that, both the one and the other live and dye, have their nutrition, augmentation, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. If Animals have their time of being ſalacious, Plants have theirs of being in Sap. They have dictinction of Sex, as appears particularly in the Cypreſs, Hemp, and the Palm, which beareth not fruit unleſs planted near the Male, or at leaſt ſome branch thereof be faſtned to it. They ſeem too to have ſome kinde of reſpiration; for beſides that they love the free Aire, towards which they encline when planted near a high Wall, or under great Trees; their Root, which is their mouth, hath ſome diſcernment of taſte, eſchewing hurtful ſoils, and ſpreading freely into good ground, and not imbibing all ſorts of liquors indifferently, but onely ſuch as are convenient for them. Hence their parts have names common to thoſe of Animals; as the Marrow, Fleſh, Veins, Skin: In a word, they ſeem to want one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly local-motion, which yet, beſides the foregoing examples, is found in the <hi>Herba Viva</hi> of <hi>Acoſta</hi> which folds up it leaves and flowers when it is toucht; as likewiſe Tulips do in the evening, and open the ſame again in the morning; Marigolds follow the Sun, and thence have gotten the Latin name <hi>Solſequia</hi>; but more manifeſtly the Sun-flower, and the white Carline Thiſtle, call'd the Almanack of Peaſants, who therefore hang it at their doors, becauſe it folds up its flowers when a Tempeſt is at hand. 'Tis notorious that the <hi>Bon-Chretien</hi> Pear-Tree, and the Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Tree languiſh in places not frequented by men; and on the contrary, teſtifie by their vigour and fertility that they delight in their converſation. Hereunto might be added the experience of Wood-Cleavers who finde that a wedge enters further at the firſt blow then for many following; as if the ſubſtance of the Tree clos'd it ſelf upon the firſt feeling it hath of its enemy. But the bending of Hazle-rods towards Mines of Gold and Silver, ſeems to denote ſomething more in them then in Animals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In brief, the motion of creeping Herbs may be call'd progreſſive: amongſt others, that of the Gourd and Cucumber which follow the neighbouring water, and ſhape their fruit in length to reach it.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXV. Of Trubbs or Truffs, and Muſhroms.</head>
            <p>AS there is ſome middle nature between a Plant and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal, partaking of both ſo; there is alſo between a plain Mixt Body and a Plant, to wit, thoſe Exuberances which grow ſometimes on Trees, as Agarick; ſometimes only out of the Earth, as Muſhroms and other ſuch fungous Productions, which are driven forth by the inward heat of the earth helpt by that of the Sun. The matter of them is a ſlime, or unctuous or viſcous moiſture fit to receive a ſutable Form, which is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous according to the ſtrength of Nature, and the Diſpoſition of the places through which it is driven; as the Water of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Fountains puts on the ſhape of the pipe through which it paſſes. And as for Trubbs, 'tis <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Opinion, That melted Snow ſinking into the ſurface of the Earth, and finding fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there, produceth this Plant. Which the plenty of Spirits found in Snow, makes me willing to aſſent to; becauſe they may ſerve for Seed to its Production.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That he lik'd the common Opinion, that Trubbs proceed from Thunder; whoſe agitation of the Air, and ſo of the Earth, awakens the hidden Seed of this Plant, as well of many others that grow of themſelves; or elſe perhaps the Rain that follows Thunder being full of Celeſtial Vertue, proper for this Production, is the Seed thereof. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Nature ſometimes ſupplies by an Univerſal Efficient the Defect of particular Cauſes deſtinated to the production of other Plants, which in moſt Trees and Herbs is the Seed, which this wants, as alſo all the ordinary parts of other Plants; becauſe 'tis of the Nature of thoſe Animals who have not their parts diſtinct one from another, having neither ſtalk, nor leaves, nor flower, nor root, unleſs you will call it all root; becauſe it hath more appearance of than of any other part of a Plant: which perhaps is the cauſe of its excellent taſte, which is neither ſweet as moſt roots are, nor ſowr as moſt leaves are, nor of any other kind of taſt obſerv'd in the other parts of Plants, but mix'd of all taſts together, being very pleaſant, after coction hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd what was terreſtrial and aqueous in it. As for Muſhroms, both their Nature and Cauſe is different; but all proceed from an excrement which the Earth caſts forth of it ſelf, and which was bred therein by the perpetual tranſcolation of the Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the earth; whence they are more or leſs hurtfull accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the greater or leſs malignity of ſuch Humours, but always of bad juice ſutable to its Source and Material Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, 'Tis the Rain of Autumn that makes the Muſhrom; the too great cold of Winter, and that which yet re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66371:129"/>
in the Spring not permitting that Excrement to come forth, but ſhutting it up (as 'tis the property of Cold) and the heat and drought of Summer conſuming the Matter that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them as faſt as it comes out of the Earth. But in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, when the Earth is cleft and chopt in many places by the foregoing heat of Summer, the Showers and rainy Seaſon ſupply excrementitious matter proper for this Production. The ſame might be ſaid of Trubs, if we ſaw not their generation to be made as 'twere in the turning of a hand, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Thunder: whereof the clefts of the upper cruſt of the Earth are a manifeſt evidence; not in all ſoils, but only in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and leſs cultivated; in which, culture would diſſipate the matter before it could acquire the preparations requiſite to this generation.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the ſtory of <hi>Martius Licinius</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Praetor of <hi>Rome</hi> and Governour of <hi>Spain,</hi> who in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thago Nova,</hi> biting a Trub or Tuber found in it a Roman peny of the value of ſeven Engliſh, ſhews that this lump is made of earth hardned together, as Stones and other mixt Bodies are, which grow naturally by the ſole appoſition of matter without being either ſown or planted. For 'tis found in the earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either root or fibres: yea it may be call'd an imperfection of the earth, becauſe 'tis never found in good ground but only in gravelly places near woods and buſhes, and hath no certain bigneſs; ſome being very ſmall, and others of the bigneſs of the fiſt and of a pound weight; ſome, full of ſand; others not, which are the beſt. They are alſo of divers colours, according to that of the Soil, namely Red, Black and White, of a very ſavory relliſh, but hard of digeſtion, and windy. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhape is round, but <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions ſome horned ones brought from <hi>Thrace,</hi> which therefore he calls <hi>Ceraunia</hi>; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo addeth, that in ſome places (as particularly at <hi>Mitylene</hi>) the torrents produce them, and carry them along with their ſtreams; that they laſt but a year, and are more tender in the Spring then at any other ſeaſon. Some hold that they grow not at all, but are produc'd in an inſtant of their full bigneſs; and their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe they have no organs of Nutrition, without which they cannot grow; and indeed they do not generate. This opinion would be the more probable, if what <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith were true, namely, that there is no ſign of cleft or chink in the earth which covers them. But experience ſhews the contrary, Swine (who are greedy of them) being lead by the ſmell they exhale through thoſe clefts, to find them and root them out of the ground.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That Muſhroms are to Plants, as Inſects are to Animals; for both are generated of corruption, and that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; both want diſtinct parts, and have ſomwhat of a hurtful or venemous quality (for the moſt part). But Muſhroms are either Medicinal, as Agarick; or Alimental; or abſolutely
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66371:130"/>
poyſonous; which two latter ſpecies oftentimes differ only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſoil. For ſuch as grow in Meadows are the ſafeſt, and the Orange-colour'd are as good and delicious in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> as they are poyſonous in <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> where they are ordinarily employ'd to kill Flyes, and where they cauſe viſions. Such were thoſe which kill'd the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> Father-in-law to <hi>Nero,</hi> who therefore term'd them <hi>the food of the Gods,</hi> becauſe the Roman Emperours were deifi'd after their death. They are alſo ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by the colour and ſmell: The blackiſh or livid, whoſe juice is yellowiſh and which ſmell like Copper, being deadly; but the white, the greyiſh, and thoſe that are red underneath with a black juice and a pleaſing ſmell, being alimental. The leaſt to be ſuſpected are thoſe which grow by Art in dunged places, or Melon-beds enrich'd with Hogs-dung rotted for the ſpace of two years. 'Tis ſaid alſo that the good have a thicker ſtem then the bad, and alſo a circle or crown on the top. If any malignity remain in them, <hi>Cato</hi> adviſes to correct the ſame by ſetting a Colewort near them, which (he ſaith) draws to it ſelf all the impurity of the earth; wherein, if ſoft, are bred Muſhroms; if hard, Trubs; but both without ſeed: juſt as Yellow-Gilly-flower and Pellitory grow ſpontaneouſly upon walls made with Lime and Sand; Silver-weed, in Brooks; Creſſes, in Springs; the Earth containing in it ſelf the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible ſeeds of many animated bodies. To the Production whereof Nitre alone (by its above mention'd fecundity) ſuffices; for finding no ſeed to determine it to any other production, it ſpends it ſelf in generating of Trubs. For beſides their taſte and moſt uſual inward colour, (which is white or grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh) their flatuoſity and aptneſs to provoke Luſt (which two qualities are proper to Nitre) teſtifie the ſame; as alſo doth their Nativity during the Thunder or Rain of Autumn, and of the end of the Spring; which ſeaſons are full of Nitrous exhalations. The ſame may be ſaid of Muſhroms, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpring out of Nitrous ſubſtances, as dung and earth where Salt-Peter grows.</p>

            <p>'TIs hence forward lawful to doubt of every thing, ſince a Problem is made of an Axiom. For Man being a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, renounces that quality when he ſeeks Solitude; in which not only Speech, Courteſie, and Civility, but all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Arts, yea almoſt all Virtues become uſeleſs to him, and leave him by little and little to put on Beaſt and beaſtial proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

to wit Silence, Rudeneſs, Ignorance, and in one word Brutality it ſelf; (though there is ſome ſociety even amongſt many irrational Creatures, as Cranes, Bees, Ants, and divers others.) Conſider one of thoſe ſolitary dumpiſh perſons right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtyl'd by the Vulgar <hi>Loups-garoux</hi> (or Men-wolves) enemies of mankind; they are commonly of extravagant minds, whoſe dotages paſs in their own weak judgment for divine thoughts beyond thoſe of the reſt of men; but when brought forth they ſerve for nothing but laughter, which is oftentimes the reaſon why their Authors keep them ſo very ſecret. Examples whereof are ſeen in all thoſe melancholy Doters who build Caſtles in the Air. If they make profeſſion of Arms, they are meer <hi>Don Quixots</hi>; if of Divinity, Hereſiarchs; if of Phyſick, Empericks and people void of other ſkill ſaving that they have ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable ſecret. On the other ſide, conſider ſociable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and you will find nothing in them but what is agreeable and pleaſing. If they have any buſineſs in hand, they adviſe with others about it, and knowing that two eyes ſee not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things at once as four may do, they polliſh their reſolutions by the mutual colliſion of their own Opinions with thoſe of others; and conſidering that the way to do well is to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by many, they ſubmit themſelves to their judgment. Moreover, make an induction of all good things, and you will find them all in Society; without it the World would be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated in leſs then one Age, whereas 'tis perpetuated by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Species. There is nothing to be got in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though one ſhould imitate the humor of an indefatigable Gameſter of theſe times, who finding no body to keep him company, plays at Cards and Dice all alone in his Cloſet, which he ſaith is ſome divertiſement to him: but the Trades-men, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer and Merchant gain nothing without Commerce, which cannot be but between many perſons. Pleaſure is not ſo much as imaginable, whilſt. a man is alone by himſelf. Your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks and other fools cannot conceive any delight but by their fancying themſelves converſing with others. Then for Honour, it ſuppoſes one perſon honoured and another honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo it conſiſts not with ſolitude, which conſequently is an enemy to all ſorts of Good. But to purſue the induction on the other ſide; we ſee that Balls, Comedies, Revels, Feaſts, and all Ceremonies both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical are perform'd in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which, the greater it is, adds the more ſplendor thereunto. Wherefore if you take away company, you at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive men of all the means of employing the Goods which they have gotten by their labours, and alſo of the honour they aim'd at in enjoying the ſame, the hopes whereof was the onely thing that ſweetned their pains. Let a man be alone, and he needs no cloaths but to cover his nakedneſs, or keep off the cold; whereas the magnificence of Courts is the moſt glorious token of the ſplendor of a State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:66371:131"/>The Second ſaid, Though it be hard to praiſe ſolitude in ſo good company, yet it hath three ſorts of goods in it, which are endeavour'd to be aſcrib'd to Society: For, in caſe it had no other benefit but ſilence, of the obſerving whereof none ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented (but of ſpeaking often) the perfection of a Chriſtian is found in it. For of the three manners of ſinning, Solitude hath none to avoid but thoughts; and thoughts themſelves ariſe only from the former frequentation of company: upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, thoſe that have moſt ſought Innocence, have retir'd from Companies and Towns. Thus did the Prophets in the old Law, and afterwards Hermites inhabited the Deſarts of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſtricteſt Religions have liv'd the moſt ſolitary. Then for the delight it affords, there is no pleaſure like that of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Meditation, and Contemplation, which are not conſiſtent with Company: and man being more eſſentially reaſonable than ſociable, who doubts but a man reaſons better in ſolitude then in the turmoil of company? Nay, not only the ſpeculative Sciences are beſt poliſht by it, but alſo the civil and popular, as Eloquence and Poetry; the one was learnt by <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> in his Cloſet, and on the Sea ſhores; the other is a great friend of ſolitude, and makes its followers ſeek it. On this account the Greeks built the Temples of the Muſes in Woods and places remote from Towns; and night, the mother and companion of ſolitude, was by them ſtyl'd <hi>Eufrone,</hi> Wiſe. This was alſo the reaſon why the Pythagoreans enjoyn'd five years ſilence before the hearing of their Philoſophy: yea, thoſe that have received moſt honour and contentment in converſation have moſt lov'd Retirement; witneſs <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who long'd to diſengage himſelf one day from publick affairs; <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> who went to ſeek it in <hi>Slavonia</hi>; and in the laſt age <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in <hi>Portugal.</hi> 'Twas not therefore without reaſon that the Roman people cry'd that onely <hi>Vatias</hi> alone knew how to live, becauſe he retir'd from the City into a ſolitary and deſart place. For though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and publick Calamities had occaſion'd his retreat at that time; yet the contagion of company, the common depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of manners, and the contentments attending peaceful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, are charms ſtrong enough to attract any conſidering man; beſides, that honour too follows it, being compar'd to the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which flyes its purſuers, and follows thoſe that avoid it. Accordingly, all thoſe that have affected ſolitude, as amongſt the Pagans <hi>Empedocles, Apollonius, Num,</hi> the Gymnoſophiſts, and our Druydes, have been moſt eſteem'd by men for ſo doing. And they are weak mindes which cannot ſupport themſelves, but want the converſation of others; herein reſembling Ivy and other climing Plants, which onely creep upon the ground, if they be not propt up by ſome other; whereas great Oakes and Elmes maintain themſelves alone againſt the outrages of the windes. So alſo the moſt generous Beaſts are ſolitary, as the Lion and Elephant in Deſarts; the Eagle in Rocks and high Mountains; contrary
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66371:131"/>
to Pullen and other timid Animals, which are call'd Gregarious. Hence it may be inferr'd, that Fear caus'd men to build Towns; and that (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) onely the multitude of ſeveral faces deſerves not the name of a company, which made <hi>Diogenes</hi> go about at noon in the Market with a Lanthorne to finde a man; and makes me conclude, that as the wiſe Man ſhould take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment only in himſelf, ſo he ought to ſeek onely his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. For being never leſs alone then when he is ſo, ſolitude indeed hath its ſociety, but ſociety is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onſiſtent with ſolitude.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That indifferent things are diſtinguiſht from good and bad, in that they are ſometimes good and profitable, ſometimes not; but the two latter are alwayes determin'd to one end. Now no body will maintain that company is either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good or alwayes bad. It muſt therefore be indifferent, and like the water of rivulets in Gardens, which is converted into the nature of the Plants it irrigates. For, is there any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety more authorized by God then Marriage? and yet 'twere a bold propoſition to prefer it before the contentment of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, but becauſe this is not alwayes ſolitary, after the mode of Carthuſians and Hermites, company is to be preferr'd or poſtpon'd to ſolitude, according to the ſeveral circumſtances of the one and the other.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That according to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> ſaying, There are two ſorts of ſolitary perſons; the firſt, above the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, as the Heroes and Demigods of Antiquity, who frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not men becauſe they found them unworthy of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: the other ſort are below men, and avoid converſe, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable thereof, like thoſe Peaſants whom their ruſticity keeps from appearing or ſpeaking in company. But becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are fewer then the latter, hence ſolitude is more commonly a ſign of a mans defect then excellency, and conſequently compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is to be preferr'd before it.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXVII. Whether Birds, or four-footed Animals, or Fiſhes be moſt Intelligent.</head>
            <p>THe Aire, having moſt affinity with the Spirits whereby all the functions of the ſoul and body are exercis'd, and both are conjoyn'd; it may ſeem ſufficient to give the advantage to its Inhabitants the Birds, though they had not the teſtimonies upon which men value themſelves above their fellows, to wit, more advantages of nature, and a greater apitude to diſciplines then others. For they have the ſame priviledges of walking upon the earth that other Land-Animals have; yea, ſome of them, as the Plongeon or Ducker go upon the waters; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:66371:132"/>
they have this particular Gift of Nature, that they cleave the Air with a motion ſo ſwift, that the Holy Scripture hath expreſs'd the ſpeed of Angels by aſſigning them wings. Nor can you imagine any action, without excepting even virtuous ones, which is not found in a Bird. The Swallow is ſkill'd in Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture; the Halcyon is able to divine how far the <hi>Nile</hi> will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, and knows that out of Nature's reſpect to her, there will be no Tempeſt at Sea while ſhe is building her Neſt; the Gooſe is ſo ſafe a Guard, that it ſometimes ſav'd the Capitol to the ſhame of the Sentinels; the Wren ſerves for a guide and a ſcout to the Crocodile; the Crow and the Turtle are patterns of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal amity; ſo are the Storks of piety; and even the ſwarms of Bees, are models of Common-wealths; and the Piſmires, when Age and Experience has render'd them more adviſed, acquire wings. The Silk-worm is nothing but a Caterpiller till its wings appear; and then fluttering about it, perpetuates its ſpecies with ſuch prudence, that it doth not lay its Eggs in heaps, which would hinder their hatching, but diſperſes them in ſeveral places, in order to being more commodiouſly animated by the heat of the Sun. Then, as for Art, we ſee no Animals beſides Men capable of ſpeech (the firſt of Diſciplines) but Birds. And the particular Examples of the Elephant, and a few other Beaſts that have ſhewn ſome ſhadow of Judgement, are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the Eagle which flew into the fire, wherein her Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Body was burning, and many other Inſtances too numerous to be mention'd.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the little head of Birds, in compariſon of the reſt of their Body, their drineſs and abounding Choler permit them not to be ſo intelligent as other Animals; their chattering jargon as little deſerving the name of a Language, as their other actions do that of Virtue. Moreover, their ſleep being not ſo ſound and deep, as that of Terreſtrial Animals, which by ſucking their Dams are more humid; and ſleep being the reſtorer of Spirits, Birds cannot have ſuch plenty as other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Whence they ſuffer themſelves to be more eaſily taken than Land-Animals, whoſe Bodies being more ſymbolical with ours, they muſt alſo have greater aptitude for exerciſing ſome functions correſpondent to thoſe of our Mind. For the cavities of their head and brains more reſemble ours, than thoſe either of Birds or Fiſhes; particularly, that of the Ape, which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is the moſt intelligent of all Animals next Man; with whom all will agree, that no other Animal can diſpute the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of Judgement with the leaſt ſhew of Reaſon; if any ſhould, it would never gain the Cauſe, in regard Man muſt be the Judge.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, Man hath no more reaſon to award this Cauſe to himſelf, than to pretend to the advantage of flying better than Birds, or ſwimming better than Fiſhes, who exceed all Creatures in point of Health, even to a Proverb, which is a thing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66371:132"/>
altogether neceſſary to the functions of the Soul. Moreover, they are of a very long Life, which begets Experience, as that doth Underſtanding. Their Health is manifeſted by their Fecundity; and ſince coldneſs is the Complexion of the wife, and Salt is reckon'd the Symbol of Wiſdom, Fiſhes, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Sea, and the coldeſt of all Creatures, muſt have a ſhare thereof. Beſides, if ſoftneſs of Fleſh be a ſign of goodneſs of Witt every where elſe as 'tis in Man, (and Phyſiognomy teaches us to draw conſequence from other Creatures to him) Fiſhes have this advantage above all the Inhabitants either of the Air or Earth; both which, were indeed made for Man, but the Sea was primarily made for Fiſhes; its other conveniences being only accidental. Silence, the common diſtinction between the wiſe and the fooliſh, is natural to them; whereas the voices and chantings of Birds and other Animals, is oftentimes the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their ruine. Yea, they are ſo ſubtle, that Fiſher-men cannot take them but with a white line, of the colour of the water; otherwiſe, if it be groſs and viſible, they will not come near it. Diffidence, the Parent of ſafety, is more common to them than to all other Animals, and their vigilance is greater. Land-Animals have no ſleight equall to that imperceptible charm, whereby the Torpedo chills the arm of the Fiſher-man; or to that of the Cuttle-fiſh, which when ſhe is in danger of being taken, moils the water with her Ink to keep her ſelf from being ſeen; or to that of the Polypus, who becomes of the Colour of the Rock upon which it holds, to void being perceiv'd. And though the Element of Water ſo ſeparates us from the commerce of its Inhabitants, that the hundreth part of what concerns them is unknown to us; yet there is none but obſerves, that Fiſhes need more ſleights to ſecure themſelves from the ambuſhes and hoſtilities of others, than the beaſts of the field have, which are alſo more eaſily taken. The Fiſh call'd the Mullet, ſtrikes off the bait of the hook with her tail, inſtead of being taken by it; and if ſhe cannot do ſo, ſhe is contented to bite it round about; and the Sea-wolf finding her ſelf taken, ſhakes her head this way and that way with much pain, till ſhe have caſt out the hook again; and for the ſame purpoſe, the Sea-fox turnes her inſide outwards. The Loubine and Sea-dog finding themſelves ſurrounded with the Net, make a hole in the ground and ſculk therein, till the Net be drawn over them; but the Dolphin rejoyces in the Net, becauſe he may with eaſe fill himſelf with his fellow-priſoners; yet when he perceives he is drawing near the ſhore, he bites the Net; which if he cannot do quick enough, the Fiſher-men knowing him a Friend to Man, pardon him the firſt time, and only thruſting a bul-ruſh through his ſkin let him go; if he be taken again (which ſeldom happens, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, out of whom moſt of theſe Relations are taken) he is beaten. Yea, they are ingenious not only for themſelves, but for others; for when the Gilt-head hath ſwallow'd the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:66371:133"/>
hook, his companions bite the line, and if one of them fall into one of the Meſhes, they lend him their tails to bite and draw him through; and when the Barbles ſee one of their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons caught they get upon him and with the indented ſpine they have upon their backs cut it aſunder. <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s Lamprey would take bread out of his hand, and was bewail'd by him when it dy'd: The ſtory of <hi>Arion,</hi> and that of the Fiſh call'd <hi>Manaro</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> which was delighted with praiſes and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick carry'd nine or ten perſons upon his back, and having been wounded by a Spaniard diſappear'd; the Raye which <hi>Olaus</hi> writes defended a man from Dogs upon the ſhore of <hi>Denmark</hi>; and the Sea-Eele which the Indians carry behind their Boats to let him play about the Tortoiſes and other Fiſhes which they take; are abundant inſtances that Fiſhes are both ſociable and docible. This alſo is juſtifi'd by the <hi>Pinatere,</hi> which pricks the Oyſter to advertiſe it when its prey is within; by the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gothere, which performs the ſame office for the Spunge; and by the Whale's guide whom ſhe ſuffers to ſleep in her throat, and without whom ſhe would daſh againſt the ſhore; by the Pike, which keeps company with the Tench, whoſe ſlimineſs ſerves to cloſe his wounds; by the Tunnies, who always ſet their good eye toward the ſhore, and move well order'd in a cubick ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron; by the Sea-Urchins, which preſaging a tempeſt, lade themſelves with ſtones for fear of being carry'd away by the waves; and by all Fiſhes in general, which ſwim againſt the wind, leſt it ſhould open their ſcales, excepting one whoſe ſcales are ſet the contrary way.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXVIII. What is the cauſe of the Criſis of Diſeaſes.</head>
            <p>CRiſis (if you conſider its derivation from a word which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies either to <hi>judge</hi> or to <hi>ſeparate</hi> or to <hi>encounter</hi>) agrees in ſome ſort to every of thoſe ſignifications; for a Diſeaſe is judg'd by it, it ſeparates the good humors from the bad, and that after a combat between Nature and the Diſeaſe. But 'tis commonly defin'd a mutation of a Diſeaſe either to Health or Death, for better or for worſe. We muſt firſt conſider in it, the term of its commencement, which is the Augmentation of the Malady, whence acute ones have their Criſis ſooner then Chronical; the very acute being ſometimes judg'd in four days, in which time very malignant Fevers ſweep men away, but commonly within ſeven days; acute Diſeaſes are judg'd by the 14th or 20th day, and ſometimes not before the 40th. Chronical Diſeaſes extend to the 120th; after which term they count no longer by days but by moneths and years. The term it ends at,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66371:133"/>
is either Health or Death, or the change of one Diſeaſe into another. The term through which it paſſes is the ſpace of time employ'd by Nature in the coction, ſeparation and excretion of the peccant Humours. The Agent or Motor is Nature, which muſt be aſſiſted in imperfect Criſes, not in ſuch as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made. Laſtly, we muſt conſider what is mov'd, namely the Humors; for Criſis hath place only in humoral Diſeaſes. A perfect Criſis judges the Malady perfect either to Health or Death, and hath had its indices of coction the fourth day for the Criſis on the ſeventh, the eleventh for that on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and the ſeventeenth for that on the twentieth; it muſt alſo be manifeſt either by evacuation or abſceſs (for thoſe that mend without apparent cauſe relapſe) and fall upon critical days, without any dangerous ſymptom: and after ſuch evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the Patient muſt be manifeſtly better, eſpecially if it be univerſal and ſutable to his Nature, Age, and Malady. Long Diſeaſes are judg'd by Abſceſſes; acute, by Evacuation. In young perſons Fevers are judg'd commonly by Haemorrhage or ſome flux of blood; in old men, by that of the belly. Now beſides thoſe Critical and Indicative days there are others call'd Intercidents which judge imperfectly, and others alſo Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, becauſe in them purgatives may be adminiſhed; which days are ſometimes Critical, but always unfaithful, and commonly miſchievous; which will better appear by this general appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The firſt day is reckon'd from the hour of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion felt by the Patient in acute Diſeaſes, and from the time of his decumbiture in Chronical. Yet in women newly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd we begin not to reckon from the time of parturition, unleſs it were precipitated, but from the time of the Fever; and this firſt day judges no other Diſeaſe but a <hi>Febris Ephemera,</hi> or one-day Fever. The ſecond day is vacant and without effect. The third is Intercident, call'd by ſome <hi>Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> becauſe it irritates and provokes Nature to make excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before the time; for being odd, it cauſes ſome motion in the morbifick matter, but imperfectly, as not following the order of Nature mention'd hereafter; nevertheſs tis Critical in very acute Maladies, and ſuch as diſorder the Laws of Nature. The fourth is an index of the ſeventh, and ſhews what is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that day by either the Concoction or Crudity of the Urin and other excrements; no laudable Criſis hapning without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction precedent. Which holds good not only in continual Fevers, but alſo in the fits or acceſſions of Intermitting ones: for the fourth day being the middlemoſt between the firſt and the ſeventh, it foreſhews the deſign and ſtrength or weakneſs of Nature, and what ſhe is able to do on the ſeventh. The fifth reſembles the third, being likewiſe provocatory in Diſeaſes wherein Nature hath made an unprofitable attempt on the third, which ſhe then endeavours to repair; but unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully too, this Criſis being moſt commonly imperfect. The
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66371:134"/>
ſixth is alſo Intercident but ordinarily very badly critical: Whence <hi>Galen</hi> compares it to a cruel and faithleſs tyrant, which precipitates the Patient into evident danger of life, if it do not kill him. It hath place chiefly in cholerick Diſeaſes, for in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine ones ſalutiferous Criſes happen on this day, which is even; the Blood being obſerv'd to move on even days. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ſeventh reſembles a juſt and gentle King or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for neither precipitating nor deferring too long the judgment of the Patient, it gives him time of conſideration, judging him after its Indices fully and perfectly, ſafely, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without danger. 'Tis call'd Radical, as being the root and foundation of all the other Critical Days, and the end of the firſt week. The eighth is of kin to the ſixth, but not quite ſo dangerous. The ninth is the greateſt Intercident and comes neareſt to the nature of the Critical, though it be not of their number. The cauſe whereof is, its being compos'd of odd numbers, wherein we have ſaid that morbifick humors are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly mov'd; or elſe becauſe 'tis equally diſtant from 7 and 11. The tenth reſembles the eighth in danger and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The eleventh is an index of the fourteenth, to which it hath the ſame reference that the fourth hath to the ſeventh; ſaving that the ſecond week is leſs active then the firſt, and the third then the ſecond. The twelfth is not of any conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, he never obſerv'd any Criſis, good or bad, on it. The like of the thirteenth. The fourteenth follows the ſeventh in dignity, and judges thoſe Diſeaſes which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth did not, being the end of the ſecond week, and in this conſideration, odd. The fifteenth and ſixteenth are not any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remarkable. The ſeventeenth is an index of the twentieth, till which the intervening are inſignificant, and this twentieth is taken by Phyſicians for the end of the third week, becauſe they make the ſame begin from the fourteenth incluſively. From the 20th to the 40th, (which is the end of Criſis in acute diſeaſes) every ſeventh day is critical. But after the 40th, Diſeaſes are call'd Chronical, and have their Criſis every 20th day to 120, ſo much the more obſcure as they are diſtant from the beginning. Of all which changes the Moon ſeems rather to be the cauſe then the other Planets, or the vertue of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as being more active by reaſon of her proximity and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparitions.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the reaſon upon which Aſtrologers attribute Criſis to the Moon, <hi>viz.</hi> her moving by quaternaries and ſeptenaries, (her notableſt changes hapning every ſeventh day) is too general. For though ſhe rules over Moiſtures or Humidities, and a Criſis is only in Humoral Diſeaſes; yet ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not introduce any change in the above-mentioned Critical Days rather then in others; becauſe then ſhe muſt have this power either from her ſelf or from ſome other, and the ſeveral Aſpects of the Sun. Not from her ſelf; for then no change would
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66371:134"/>
happen in the Moon her ſelf, nor conſequently in us by her means, ſince things which are of themſelves in ſome ſubject continue always the ſame. Not from the Sun; for then theſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Diſeaſes ſhould happen onely at certain poſtures of the Moon and not in all. Now, ſuppoſe <hi>Alexander</hi> fall ſick to day, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to morrow, yet neither of them ſhall have a Criſis but on the ſeventh day. Beſides, the oppoſition of the Moon being leſs at the ſeventh then at the thirteenth day; the Criſis ſhould be rather on the latter then on the former. And the ſame effect of the Septenary in the Conception, Life, Nutrition, and Actions of Animals, which is not obſerv'd hitherto; the ſtomach digeſting not better on the ſeventh day, and the ſeed not being ſtronger that day in the matrix then on any other: and the eighth day wherein the Moon is further from the firſt then ſhe was on the ſeventh, ſhould cauſe the Criſis, and not the ſeventh. In brief, the ſeptenaries of diſeaſes rarely agree with the Septenaries of the Quarters of the Moon; whoſe motions being unequal according to the different elevation of her Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicle, would render Criſis uncertain. Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reckoning hit with the Lunar Motion, feign'd a Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Moneth conſiſting of ſix and twenty days and ſome hours; but he hath had no followers therein. <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> went a better way, attributing the cauſe of Criſes to the motion of Melancholly, which is on the fourth day: but as the bilious humor moving alone on the third day without melancholly, doth nothing, ſo melancholly alone produceth not any Criſis on the fourth day. The fifth hath alſo the motion of Bile alone, and conſequently is without effect. The ſixth is quiet in reference to theſe humors, being the day of neithers motion: but on the ſeventh, theſe two Biles concurring together make a great critical agitation. But if the matter be not then ſufficiently fermented and concocted, the Criſis will not come till the fourteenth, when the ſame motion of thoſe two humors is again repeated.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That this opinion of <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> makes Criſes fall upon dayes not critical, as the tenth, thirteenth, ſixteenth, ninteenth, and two and twentieth, contrary to all antiquity and daily experience: and is founded in an errour, namely, that one humor cannot putrifie in the body whilſt the reſt remain pure; ſeeing Quotidian Fevers are caus'd by Phlegm alone, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians by Choler alone, and Quartans by Melancholly alone; and that no other reaſon can be given of the regular motion of Criſis, but that of the motion of the Heavens.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXIX. What Bodily Exerciſe is the moſt healthful.</head>
            <p>WHat motion is to the Aire and Water, yea, and to Fire too (which it maintains) that is it to our Bodies; Eaſe makes them heavy, and of the nature of the Earth, which of all the Elements alone delights therein: For the Body conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Elements, it neceſſarily without motion falls into the corruption which Reſt introduces into them: and the excrements remaining after nutrition, either recoile back into the maſſe of Blood, or elſe reſting in that part of the body which is ſatiated with them, overcharge the ſame, and cauſe that plenitude which is ſo much ſuſpected by <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> On the contrary, Motion awakens the natural heat, drives out the excrements collected by eaſe, ſtrengthens the Members, and renders all the Faculties more vigorous; provided onely that it be us'd after evacuation of the groſſer Excrements, and before meat, becauſe then reſt is neceſſary; otherwiſe the food in the Stomach will be ſubverted, and the motion of the outward parts will too ſoon attract from the inward the food undigeſted; whence many diſeaſes ariſe. And this right uſe of Exerciſe is ſo neceſſary to health, that the Athenians purpoſely dedicated a place for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, call'd <hi>Gymnaſiun,</hi> to <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of Phyſick; for which word the Art which treats of exerciſes is call'd <hi>Gymnaſtica</hi>; and the Sorceries of <hi>Medea</hi> may be better underſtood of Exerciſes, which make young, and ſtrengthen bodies formerly ſoft and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, than of Herbs wherewith ſhe ſtuffed the bodies of old men whom ſhe had jugulated; an Art, without which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought a Commonwealth could not be good, and to which chiefly is to be attributed the difference found between our modern Souldiers, and the Roman Legionaries; yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the good habitude of their bodies, and the weakneſs of ours, who have ſo intermitted their exerciſes that onely the names of many are left. Now, ſince motion, which to deſerve the name of exerciſe muſt alter the reſpiration of the Animal, is violent to it, and of violent things we cannot take too little; I conceive that ſuch exerciſe as holds the mean between reſt and extream motions, is the beſt. As Riding, or going on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, which giving us motion, diminiſhes the labour thereof, and ſtirs all the parts of the body; which happens not when on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one part of the ſame body is exercis'd, and the reſt remain unmov'd.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Exerciſe, which is a voluntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and agitation of the Body with reſpiration increas'd (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis diſtinguiſht from the labour of Artiſans and Labourers, and from Actions accompany'd with no ſtriving, as playing on

Inſtruments) was transferr'd to the uſe of Phyſick by one <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus</hi> according to <hi>Plato</hi> in the third Book of his Republick, and 'tis taken two wayes, either for that which is made by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion of the Body, or for ſuch motion as is external to it, as Swinging (the <hi>Petaurum</hi> of the Latins) Navigation; going in a Coach, or Litter: As for thoſe made by the Body alone, they are of three ſorts; Athletical, Military, and Ludicrous or Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. The Athletick, though the ancienteſt, yet to me ſeem the moſt unprofitable, ſerving onely to harden the ſurface of the body and the extream parts, as the Armes and Legs: ſuch were Wraſtling, (which is ſtill in uſe among our Britains, and at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> before the Grand Seignior's Gate amongſt ſome Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars whom they call <hi>Pluyanders</hi>) Acrochiriſm, which conſiſted onely in keeping the fingers interlac'd one within the other; Fifty-cuffs, call'd anciently <hi>Pugilatus,</hi> and imitated at this day by the Gondoliers at <hi>Venice; Cae'ſtus,</hi> wherein the hands were arm'd with plates of Copper; and <hi>Pancratia,</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Wraſtling and Pugilate. Of this ſort were alſo, Running, commended by <hi>Seneca</hi> in his fifteenth Epiſtle for the Chief of Exerciſes, and by <hi>Plato</hi> in the eighth Book of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; Leaping on high and in length, either on both Feet, or on one (as that of the Aleman) the hand and body being void, or elſe laden with counterpoiſes of Lead which they call'd Halteres (as our Morrice Dancers oftentimes wear leaden Pumps, that they may be the more nimble when the ſame are lay'd off) or with a Pole to balance themſelves in leaping: whereunto may be added the Art of Vaulting. Military exerciſes belonging either to the ancient or modern way of Militating, and are perform'd either on foot or on horſe-back. To the former belongs Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, anciently the Art of the Gladiators, and at this day much practis'd with Sword and Dagger: to which may be added ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Pike, Halbard, and Quarter-ſtaff, caſting of Bullets, the Spaniſh ſport of running at Bulls, and the hurling of the Zagaye or Lance in Turkey, and ſhooting with a Bowe or a Gun at a Mark. Military Exerciſes on Horſe-back are fighting at Barriers, running at the Ring and Quintin: to which may be referr'd all ſorts of hunting. The laſt kinde of Exerciſes which relate to ſport are Dancing, the dangerous Tricks of Tumblers, who ſeems to practiſe the Cubiſtick Art of the Ancients; the Diſk or Coiting, which ſeems common to them with us; and the Ball, of which among the Greeks there were four ſorts, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering according to the greatneſs or ſmallneſs of the Ball and the Inſtruments wherewith they ſtruck. Adde to theſe our modern paſtimes of Pail-Mail, Tennis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Next to which you may reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Shouting, or the exerciſe of the Voice, which opens the Breaſt, excites Heat, and cur'd the infirmity of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>'s tongue; whence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> allows Children to cry, becauſe it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Humidities of their Brains. But of all Exerciſes I think none equal to Walking; as that which comes neareſt natural
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66371:136"/>
motions, is eaſie, conſumes ſuperfluities, helps reſpiration, ſtrengthens the ſtomach, recreates the Senſes and Spirits, and appeaſes the commotions of the Soul: upon which the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick Philoſophers choſe it as an exerciſe ſerviceable to the minde and body both together.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That he was of <hi>Galens</hi> opinion, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Book concerning the Exerciſe of the little Ball, which he preferrs before all other for ſix principal reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe it exerciſes and delights the minde as well as the body; which pleaſure is the greater in that it is not diſhoneſt; this kinde of play being of the rank of the honorable. Secondly, Becauſe Hunting, which may be alledg'd to be of that rank, needs a great train of nets or hays, horſes, dogs, birds, and other ſuch equipage; whereas the Game of Ball, even as it was practis'd in <hi>Galen</hi>'s time, when they play'd with the palm of the Hand without ſtick or racket, may be exercis'd by all ſorts of perſons; and this every one knows, that a Good is the better for being the more common. Thirdly, Becauſe Hunting requires much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of which only rich and idle perſons are capable; whereas a Scholar or Tradeſman may, without much prejudice to their ordinary Employment, divert themſelves at this play: Which (in the Fourth place) exerciſes all the parts of the Body almoſt equally; which moſt other motions do not, ſome exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing only the upper, ſome only the lower parts, and that to exceſs: Which (in the Fifth place) happens not ſo commonly in this, wherein you may play as faſt or as ſlow as you pleaſe; the exceſs which ſome commit therein, proceeding only from the irregularity of their Mind, from which the more diſcreet are free, retiring upon the firſt ſweat, if they have no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the Sixth place, it hath no danger as Hunting hath, where the Boar's tooth, the Stag's horn, and the caſualties of falling from the Horſe, at leaſt exceſſive toil and wearineſs, are more certain oftentimes than the pleaſure expected from it; as Running alſo cauſeth breaking of the Veins; and Wraſtling. diſlocation of Members. Whereto it may be added, that the Body acquires dexterity by the Game of Ball.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That that Exerciſe ſeems moſt healthful, which is ſuitable to every one's Nature. Walking is not for the lame, nor running for the Phthiſical. Above all, every one's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is conſiderable, in which regard the Exerciſe of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion leaves us leſs Exerciſe than thoſe of others. Wherefore I conclude, for Exerciſes which beſides the motion of the Body, and the divertiſement of the Mind, leave ſome profit behind them; as when a Man of Affairs gives his diſpatches and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as, he is walking, and the Vine-dreſſer by exerciſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in digging his Vineyard, finds in the Evening, beſides the good Stomack he hath gotten, the end of the taſk which he had propos'd to himſelf.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXX. Whether Vertue conſiſt in Mediocrity.</head>
            <p>'TIs the property of every thing deſtitute of Reaſon, to be carried to Extremities; the Stone to the Centre; Fire to the Circumference; the Earth imbibes as much water, and an Animal eats as much food as it can; the Spider weaves as long as it hath where-withall, the Nightingale ſings oftentimes till ſhe burſts; every Paſſion guided by it ſelf alone, is carry'd to the utmoſt point. 'Tis reaſon alone that preſcribes bounds to theſe Extremities, which are every where found vicious. On this account, <hi>Daedalus</hi> in the Fable enjoyn'd his Son <hi>Icarus</hi> not to take his flight neither too high, for fear leſt the wax of his wings ſhould melt at the approach of the fire, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd was in the Sphere of the Sun; nor yet too near the Sea, for fear of wetting them: But to take the middle way in the Air, which courſe all have held that have been happy. And as that Man is inſupportable, whoſe Avarice ſpares his Wine at the firſt pint; ſo Thrift is too late, when you are come to the bottom of the veſſel. The Prodigal by doing good to others, does hurt to himſelf; the Miſer does no good to others, and much leſs to himſelf; he alone that keeps a meaſure in his Gifts, deſerves the name of Vertuous, and makes his Liberality eſteem'd. Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does oftentimes as much, and more miſchief as Cowardiſe; but Valour, holding a mean between both, prevents it. The ſame may be ſhewn by Induction in all the Vertues, which have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been conceiv'd to conſiſt in the middle. In conſideration whereof, the Wiſe-man prayes for neither plenty nor want, that he may eſchew the inconveniences of both; but for a Mediocrity, to which the Ancients, to ſhew their eſteem thereof, gave the attribute of Golden.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Mediocrity is an Invention of mean and irreſolute Souls, who in expectation what ſide to take, would keep themſelves indifferent to any choice; and ſo long as they do ſo, they ſhew their want of Maſculine Virtue, which alone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes great deſignes, though with great pains, which are the rate for which in old time the Gods ſold every thing; nor is there a clearer market now-a-dayes, wherein we ſee none thrive that are neither Fiſh nor Fleſh, and are alwayes to ſeek for a Maſter, but only ſuch as have found a good one. Aſk thoſe who ſo much extoll Mediocrity, Whether they would make choice of an indifferent Friend, and do not eſteem a zealous one above a luke-warm one; ſo hated both by God and Men, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, God will ſpew the luke-warm out of his month, they being, in truth, no better than Hypocrites. Moreover, Charity, the ſublimeſt Vertue, and which muſt ſurvive Faith and Hope,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:66371:137"/>
(perfect Fruition admitting only Love) ought to be ſo extream, that it can never be too much; ſince we are oblig'd to endanger our ſelves for others, and to love God more than our ſelves, and our neighbours as much as our ſelves, whom we always love too much. Let us ſee now, whether Juſtice loves Extremities beſt; concerning which matter, we find it ſaid, that the higheſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is the higheſt Injuſtice. Then for Chaſtity, Is it fit for a Woman (think you) to lend one port of her honor to a Friend, and to keep the other? In brief, Do we not ſee that a too cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Captain deſerves not the Name of valiant, but quits it for that of prudent? And in the practice of Prudence, he who bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances too long, and takes not a ſpeedy Reſolution to purſue the ſame yet more courageouſly, is abandon'd by all the World. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Laws of the <hi>Athenians</hi> puniſh'd thoſe that would ſwim between two waters, taking no ſide in a publick Sedition; as judging it better to fail in the choice of the one or the other of ſuch parties, than to take none at all. If you have to do with a Prieſt about a Caſe of Conſcience, is any thing more inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than to find an unreſolv'd Mind? The ſame may be ſaid of an Ambiguous Lawyer and Phyſitian, who ſend back their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Patients more diſſatisfi'd than they came. He that ſeeks Employment under Grandees, muſt not boaſt of Mediocrity in his abilities to ſerve; Diligence will not admit diviſion, much leſs fidelity; nothing pleaſes but what is extream: Which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly hath brought Hyperboles into ſuch credit at Court, and made nothing more uſual in commendations, than the word Extreamly.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid. That ſince a Defect and an Exceſs is incident to all Humane Actions, Reaſon requires that we aſſign the middle place to Virtue, which is defin'd by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> An Elective Habit conſiſting in a Rational Mediocrity: And if any be found that ſeem to be only in Exceſs, as Humidity in an extream Abaſing of of our ſelves; Magnanimity in Courage rais'd above the greateſt things; yet their ſeveral circumſtances, eſpecially thoſe of their End, ſerve to qualifie and determine them. This Chaſtity which ſeems uncapable in exceſs (ſince a Virgin cannot be too chaſte) yet was vicious in the Veſtals, becauſe they had an Evil End in Paganiſm, as it is virtuous in our Nunns.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid. That Virtue being high and ſublime, this argues that it conſiſts in extremity; as alſo do all the Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Virtues; Charity, as is above declar'd; Faith, the leaſt doubtings wherein are criminal; and Hope, which never wavers. So likewiſe do the Cardinal Virtues, amongſt which the inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Juſtice of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> far ſurpaſſeth in dignity the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodements and wayes of Accord of Arbitrators, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes need a ſupream Authority to be authoriz'd and executed. Hence a ſevere Judge of theſe times having remitted a little of his ordinary ſeverity, to comply with the Humors of the Age, was ſaid, To have become a Man; as if he had been Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66371:137"/>
As for Temperance, Chaſtity which is a Species thereof, is more laudable and better merits the name of Vertue in a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then in a Wife; and the abſtinence of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who is ſaid to have faſted from the Nurſe's Breaſt, or that of S. <hi>Simon Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> was much more vertuous than ordinary Faſtings. In brief, Prudence, though it teach us to keep the middle every where, yet is deſpis'd when accounted indifferent. Moreover, by the Reaſon of Contraries, Vertue muſt conſiſt in extremities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Vice does ſo; and if Vertue ſhould conſiſt in the middle (which partakes of the nature of the extreams) it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two extream Vices; which is abſurd. So the Earth, the vileſt part of the World, is in the midſt; and Heaven, the nobleſt, at the extremities, which are the circumferences. Otherwiſe we might with ſome probability render the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that a Satyre of theſe times did, why there are ſo few vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons now-a-days; Becauſe, ſaith he, Envious Antiquity plac'd Vertue in the middle which is a point, and a point is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be found.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid; That we muſt diſtinguiſh Moral vertues from Theological. The former conſiſt in mediocrity, but not the later; and are therefore call'd ſupernatural as not only attaining but ſurpaſſing the bounds of Nature; yet every moderate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral action is not vertuous, nor every extream vicious. For ſome are always Vice how little ſover you take of them; as Adultery, Homicide, and Theft; others, always Vertue in whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity they be found; as Temperance and Fortitude. And becauſe Action, wherein Vertue conſiſts, is of particular things, this is beſt verifi'd by examples. Thus Liberality is a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Avarice and Prodigality; the Avarous being exceſſive in receiving and defective in giving; the Prodigal, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, exceſſive in giving and defective in receiving. Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hath the ſame reſpeſt to great expences that Liberality hath to leſs. The regular deſire of moderate Honors hath for its extreams. Contempt of Honor and Ambition; Magnificence hath the like, in reference to great honors. Manſuetude or Clemency is between Choler which is offended with every thing, and Stupidity which is offended with nothing: Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, between Boaſting and Diſſimulation; Facetiouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bouffonry and Ruſticity; Amity, between Flattery, Moroſity and Pratling; Modeſty between Fear and Impudence. Indignation to ſee the wicked abuſe Fortune, between Envy which is troubled at the proſperity both of good and bad, and Malevolence which rejoyces at the harm of both; Sufferance, between Softneſs and Inſenſibility; Prudence, between Stupidity and Craft. In ſhort, all Vertues will be found thus, and have their extreams, although their names are not always eaſie to expreſs.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXI. Whether the Imagination be able to produce and cure Diſeaſes.</head>
            <p>AS Health is a natural Diſpoſition fit for performing the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral operations of the Bodie's Organs, and conſiſting in the due temper of the Similar parts, the Symmetry of the Organical, and the union of both together; ſo a Diſeaſe is a diſpoſition contrary to nature, hindering the ſame Functions by deſtroying the Temperament of the firſt Qualities, the proportion and laudable conformation of the Organs; and the Union of both; whence ariſe three ſorts of Diſeaſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Intemperies, ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and Solution of Continuity. Now the Queſtion is, Whether the Imagination can of it ſelf hinder the ordinary Functions of the Similar parts, by deſtroying the harmony and temper of the four firſt Qualities, which is the principle of their actions; as alſo thoſe of the Organical parts, by changing the natural Figure, Magnitude, Number and Situation of theſe Parts, and the action of both by the diſſolution and divorce of them aſunder. Diſeaſes of bare Intemperature, which is either ſimple or with matter, the Imagination may produce by moving the Spirits and Humors; which it hath power to do. For the Spirits being aerious and naturally very hot, when they are ſent by a ſtrong Imagination into ſome part, they may ſo heat it as by the exceſs of their heat to deſtroy the temper of ſuch part; as Anger ſometimes heats the Body into a Fever. And as the too great concourſe of theſe Spirits makes hot intemperatures, ſo their abſence from other parts cauſes cold Diſeaſes; as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and indigeſtions, familiar to ſuch as addict themſelves to Study and Meditation after Meat; the Spirits which ſhould ſerve for Concoction being carry'd from the Stomack to the Brain. In like manner, the Imagination having dominion over the Humors, which it moves by mediation of the Spirits; as Joy, Shame, and Anger bring blood and heat into the Face and outward parts; and Fear and Sadneſs give them a contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it appears that it hath power to produce Maladies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies with matter by the fluxion or congeſtion of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors into ſome part, and out of their natural ſeat. But if the Phanſie can diſorder the work of Conformation in another body then its own (as that of an Infant, whoſe marks and defects wherewith he is born, are effects of his Mothers Phanſie) much more may it cauſe the ſame diſorder in its own Body, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is more nearly conjoyn'd. Wherefore, ſince it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the temper of the Similar parts and the harmony of the Organs, it may alſo cauſe Diſeaſes, and by the ſame means
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66371:138"/>
cure them too: for if contraries be cur'd by their contraries, then it may cure a cold diſtemper by producing a hot one; and if it hath power to cauſe by motion of the humors an obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſome part, it may by the ſame means return them to their natural place, and cure ſuch obſtruction. 'Twas to the Phanſie that the cure of thoſe Splenetick perſons is to be attributed, who were cur'd by the touch of the great Toe of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s left Foot; and we ſee many Cures wrought by Amulets, Periapts, and other like Remedies; which having no vertue in themſelves to produce ſuch an effect, the ſame muſt be referr'd to ſome other cauſe. Now none hath more empire then the Imagination over the Spirits and other Humours, wherein almoſt all Diſeaſes conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the Imagination being a ſimple Cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcitive Power cannot of it ſelf produce the effects that are aſcrib'd to it. For all Cognition is Paſſion, and to know is to ſuffer and receive the Species of the thing that is to be known, whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion made upon the Organs of Senſe is by them carry'd to the Imagination, which judges thereof upon their report. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there is this notable difference between the Senſitive or Cognoſcitive Powers, and the Vegetative or Motive which are deſtitute of all Cognition, that the latter are active out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and operate upon the Members, which the Motive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty moves with full power, and upon the aliments which the Vegetative Faculties (as the Nutritive and Auctive) alter and turn into the nature of the parts. But the Senſitive Faculties and all other Cogniſcitive Powers have no real ſenſible action. They are active indeed ſo far as they are powers iſſuing from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfect Forms, but their actions are immanent and produce nothing beyond themſelves, and conſequently can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence abroad. So that the Imagination cannot immediately and of its own nature produce either a Diſeaſe or Health in the Body, but only by means of the Motive Power or Senſitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the Paſſions whereof are acknowledg'd by Phyſitians to be the external cauſes of Diſeaſes. If the Phanſie could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing, it ſhould be by help of the Species it is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated withall; which being extracted from things, ſome think that they eminently contain the vertues of the objects from whence they iſſue and whereof they are Pictures, and that hence it is that the Teeth are ſet on edge upon the hearing of grating ſounds, that the ſight of a Potion purges many, and that of ſalt things makes the Stomack riſe in others, and that the thought of the Plague oftentimes propagates it more then the corruption of the Air. Nevertheleſs theſe effects proceed only from the various motion of Heat and the Spirits caus'd by the Appetite and the Motive Power, which are diſtinct from the Imagination. For if the Species had the ſame power with the objects from which they iſſue, they would not be perfective but deſtructive of their Organs; the Species of Heat would burn
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66371:139"/>
the Brain, that of Cold would cool it, both would deſtroy it, which is contrary to experience. For though Heat and Cold are contraries in Nature, yet they are not ſo in the Underſtanding, but rather friendly; the one contributing to the knowledg of the other; and the end of Intentional Species is not to alter, but onely to repreſent the objects whereof they are copies.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath built his Phyſiognomy upon the great connection and ſympathy of the Soul with the Body, which is ſuch, that the one cauſeth conſiderable changes in the other: To which purpoſe the Soul employes no other more effectual inſtrument then the Imagination. Which power of the Soul upon the Body is evinc'd by the mighty effects of the Paſſions, eſpecially of Fear, Love, and Anger; Fear ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kill'd many, as particularly St. <hi>Valier</hi> before the ſtroke of the Executioner: On which account it is alſo that Mirth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for one of the beſt preſervatives from the Plague. And we ſee that Fear and Sadneſs are no leſs the cauſes then the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſigns of the Diſeaſe call'd Melancholy. The ſame is further verified by the ſtrange Hiſtories of thoſe, who being become ſick by Fancy, could not be cur'd but by curing the Fancy firſt; the Remedy being to be of the ſame kinde with the Diſeaſe. Thus he who fancy'd he had no head, could not be reſtor'd to his right ſenſe till the Phyſician clapping a leaden Cap upon him, left him to complain a while of the Head-ache. And another, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtudy'd Phyſick a little, and took up a conceit that he had a prodigious excreſcence in his <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum,</hi> could not be cur'd till the Chirurgeon had made ſemblance of cauterizing it. Another Gentleman who durſt not piſs for fear of cauſing an univerſal Deluge, was cur'd of his conceit by the Countrey peoples crying out, Fire, and deſiring him to quench it. In like manner another believing himſelf dead would not eat, and had dy'd in good earneſt, had not his Nephew (who was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dead) come into his Chamber in a winding Sheet, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to eat before his Uncle, who thereupon did the like. And to go no further, the tying of the Codpiece-point is accounted an effect of the Fancy, and is cur'd by curing the Fancy alone. So likewiſe a Lord of Quality falling ſick accidentally in a poor Village, and complaining leſs of his Malady then that he ſhould dye without a Phyſician: no other expedient was found but to cloath his Cook in the Curates Gown; upon which he preſently became half cur'd: but cauſing the Curtains to be undrawn that he might the better ſee to thank his Doctor, he diſcover'd the deceit, and fell ſick again more dangerouſly then before: his imagination thus producing the effects both of ſickneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXII. Of Faſcination, or Bewitching.</head>
            <p>FAſcination or Bewitching is the doing of hurt to one by ſight, without Contact mediate or immediate; to deny which, is to deny common experience, the verdict of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, of the Learned, and of the Holy Scripture it ſelf. The manner of it is vulgarly thought to be this, namely, when one, maliciouſly, and with a dangerous eye beholding ſome fair Child, (whoſe tenderneſs of body makes it more ſubject to hurt then a ſtronger perſon) hurts it by commending it; which Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery is thought to be render'd ineffectual by making Children wear about their Necks ſome preſervatives, ridiculous indeed, yet much in uſe, particularly amongſt the Spaniards; ſuch as the figure of a thumb between the two fore-fingers in the form obſerv'd in making a fig for one; 'tis alſo a practice to make ſuch a fig when they riſe in the morning, and to ſpit three times in the boſom. Now this kinde of Faſcination the Poet extends even to Beaſts, in the common Verſe,

Some refer it to Antipathy, as they do the Baſilisk's killing at a diſtance, and the hoarſeneſs caus'd by ſight of a Wolf. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the fifth Book of his <hi>Sympoſiacks</hi> ſaith, That ſome hurt their Parents and Friends with their Eyes alone; and he relates a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of one <hi>Entelidas,</hi> who (like a ſecond <hi>Narciſſus</hi>) perceiving himſelf handſome in a Fountain, thereupon loſt both his health and his beauty: whence he concludes, that ſuch Faſcination proceeds not alwayes from Envy, but he refers the cauſe to the perverſe cuſtom ſome get of doing miſchief, which being turn'd into nature, becomes as neceſſary to them as 'tis to a bowl to roll. Others think it an effect purely natural; as a Blear Eye infects the beholder with the ſame evil; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, He ſaw certain ancient people call'd <hi>Thibii,</hi> who by their aſpect hurt not onely Children, but perfect men: the viſual rayes being render'd more active by the evil habit of thoſe that have intention to hurt out of envy, which is diſcern'd commonly by frequent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the proſperity of a hated perſon; whence comes the word <hi>Invidere.</hi> An example whereof is ſeen in the little Bird call'd a Witwal, which becomes ſick by the ſight of one that hath the Jaundies; whereof the Bird being preſently conſcious ſhuts its eyes upon ſuch a perſons approach. For the poiſon is communicated onely to ſuch as are fit to receive it, even at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance then fire reacheth <hi>Babylonian Naptha.</hi> And they hold that Envy, or ſome other paſſion, increaſes its activity, the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:66371:140"/>
ſoul promoting the operations of the body; as the imagination excites love, and eager Dogs ſometimes become blinde through the violence wherewith they purſue their Game. This opinion is backt by the obſervation of menſtrous women, whoſe aſpect alone taints a Looking-glaſs; and alſo by the effects proceeding from the paſſion of Love, the cauſe whereof is attributed to the Eyes, which are ſometimes ſo diſorder'd by erotical Folly, that they ſee not the objects before them, which cannot be attributed to beauty alone, conſidering that the faireſt women have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leaſt power to attract Lovers by their looks; whence ſome are found more dangerous to behold then others. Beſides, <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> who confirm this Faſcination, (which is deriv'd from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to Envy</hi>) in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.56. This word is us'd and tranſlated by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Faſcination; and the Chaldeans call'd it an evil-Eye, as elſewhere that Eye of the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hireling is ſo term'd. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks plainly of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. aſking the Galatians, <hi>Who hath bewitched or faſcinated you not to obey the Truth?</hi> Which St. <hi>Anſelm</hi> interprets thus, <hi>Who hath hurt you by a livid and envious beholding of your perfection, or (like Enchanters) hath deluded you and made you ſee one thing for another?</hi> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, That Faſcination, which ſo followeth Praiſe, that the one is taken for the other, is a work of the Devil, and ſometimes alſo a puniſhment of God upon ſuch as forget themſelves through vanity.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Faſcination in the vulgar ſenſe, is not onely poſſible but natural, though the cauſe be occult; as alſo are magnetical and electrical attractions. Thus maleficiated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons infect by inſenſible tranſpiration what they wear about themſelves: whereunto the eye's ſtructure and temper renders it the fitteſt part of the body; whence, beſides Diſeaſes of the eyes, we ſee Tears eaſily draw others from thoſe that behold them ſhed. <hi>Pliny</hi> relates that the Tribalians and Illyrians when angry, kill'd people by their aſpect alone. And <hi>Olaus,</hi> That the ſame is done at this day in ſome Northern Nations. 'Tis read of <hi>Tiberius</hi> that his eyes ſparkled in the night, inſomuch that a Souldier dy'd by beholding him. And <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſo terrifi'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, who came to diſpatch him, that onely by looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he render'd him unable to touch him: For, whether vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be by Emiſſion (as the Platoniſts hold) the Rayes will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them the qualities of the Eye that emits them; or by Reception (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will have it) the colours reſulting from the impreſſion of the qualities of a viſible object will not be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſame qualities; or partly by emiſſion, and partly by reception (according to <hi>Galen</hi>) the rencontre of both ſorts of Rayes cannot but be of great efficacy, eſpecially when animated by the Paſſions of Choler, which enflames them, or of Envy, which envenoms them.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That there are two ſorts of Faſcination, the one natural, performed by natural means, as venomous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66371:140"/>
qualities, which are ſent from one body to another, and infect the ſame by their malignity; the other ſupernatural and diabolical, perform'd by ſecret means, whereby the vulgar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Witches can make ſick whom they pleaſe by touching, beholding, and ſpeaking to them; which three wayes they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to bewitch thoſe to whom they deſire miſchief. The firſt ſort of Faſcination is poſſible, and is founded upon the Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and Contrariety which is found between almoſt all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſo that even the ſhadows of ſome Trees are noxious to ſome Animals, as that of the Yew to Man, and that of the Aſh to Serpents. The Fig-Tree appeaſes the madneſs of the Bull when he is ty'd to it, by emiſſion of certain vaporous ſpirits, which entring into him temper and reduce him to moderation: and from the ſame reaſon meat hang'd on a Fig-Tree becomes more tender and delicate, to wit, by attenuating its groſſer parts. For the heat of every living body inceſſantly raiſing, and ſending forth vapors and ſpirits, when theſe ſpirits meet others like themſelves, they ſerve them inſtead of a recruit, and increaſe the good diſpoſition of the body wherein they are. And 'tis this way that old women prejudice the health of Children, whilſt their vapid ſpirits are imbib'd by the tender ſkin of the Infants, and ſo corrupting the humors, diſorder their natural functions. Hence alſo conſumptive perſons give their diſeaſe to ſuch as breathe near them; and ſo likewiſe all contagious and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult maladies are communicated by one morbid ſubject, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other diſpos'd to receive the ſame affection. But the latter ſort of Faſcination, whereby common people think that not onely men and Animals may be kill'd, but alſo plants dry'd up, ſtreams ſtopt, ſtones broken in pieces, and the like; is no-wiſe in the power of nature, whatever the Arabians ſay, who aſcribe all theſe effects to imagination, whoſe power they equal to that of Intelligences, who are able to move the whole Univerſe. For if it doth nothing of it ſelf in its proper body, where it ſimply receives the ſpecies of things, it muſt do leſs without its precinct. Moreover, 'tis impoſſible for a ſound man to make another ſick, becauſe he cannot give what himſelf hath not; they, in whom by an extraordinary corruption the blood, ſeed, or other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors have acquir'd a venomous quality, being neceſſarily ſick. So that 'tis a pure work of Devils; who knowing the properties of things, apply the ſame really to the parts of the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our privity, whilſt they amuze our ſenſes with other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as the aſpect of another perſon, or ſome ſuch inſignificant thing. Beſides that, children being apt to loſe their fleſh upon unapparent cauſes, ſuch a change may be purely natural, whilſt it is by miſtake charg'd upon a ſtrangers praiſes of the Infant, who muſt neceſſarily grow worſe, becauſe it cannot become better.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXIII. Of Amulets; and whether Diſeaſes are curable by Words, Tickets, or other things hang'd at the Neck, or applyed to the body of the Diſeaſed.</head>
            <p>THis Queſtion depends upon the Precedent; for if 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to make a perſon ſick by the Aſpect alone, it may ſeem alſo poſſible to cure him by Contact alone. In the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining of the matter, we muſt diſtinguiſh, as elſewhere alſo, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural cures from thoſe which come to paſs according to the courſe of nature. Of the former ſort are all the Miracles of the Holy Scripture, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, thoſe which Gods power manifeſts in all times by his Saints, and the cure which he hath reſerv'd to our Kings by their ſole Touch. Some cure may likewiſe happen naturally by the pronouncing of words, when the Patients Fancy is ſo ſtrong that it hath power enough over his body to introduce ſome notable change therein; whence that Phyſician cures moſt, in whom moſt confide. Thus I have ſeen ſome perſons eas'd of the Tooth-ache, upon ſticking a knife in a Tree, and pronouncing ſome barbarous words. But it falls out oftentimes, that the effect of one cauſe is attributed to another. Such was the cure of a Gentleman of the Ligue, whom the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. ſurprized in the Town of <hi>Loges</hi> as he was ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering with a Quartain Ague, and the King in Railery ſent him a Receipt againſt his Ague; the ſight whereof preſently cur'd him, through the fear he had of that unexpected approach. So alſo many remedies act by ſome occult property, as Paeony hung about Childrens necks againſt the Epilepſy; and Quick-ſilver ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd upon the Breaſt, or hung in a Quill, is believ'd a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt the Peſtilence: all precious ſtones are thought to have ſome vertue againſt ſome indiſpoſition of the body or minde: The Eagle-ſtone apply'd to the Arm retains the child in the Womb; and to the knee, facilitates Delivery: Coral and the Jaſper ſtop Blood: the Nephitick Stone is conceiv'd to void the Gravel of the Kidneyes; the hinder foot of a Hare carry'd in the Pocket cures the Sciatica of the ſame ſide from which it was taken. For, Remedies whoſe ſole application cures by their penetrating and ſenſible vertue are not of this rank. Thus, if Quick-ſilver apply'd cures the Pox by cauſing a Flux at the mouth, it muſt not be term'd an Amulet; nor Cantharides, when apply'd, as a veſicatory, they cauſe Urine; nor Epithemes apply'd to the Heart or Liver: but herbs and other things laid to the Patients wriſt may be ſo ſtyl'd, when they have no manifeſt qualities proper againſt an Ague. The Queſtion therefore is, Whether ſuch Applications, Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Wearings, have any Natural Effect; I conceive, they
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:66371:141"/>
have not. For a Natural Action requires not only ſome Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical or Phyſical Contact, but alſo a proportion between the Cauſe and its Effect. Now what proportion can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Prayer or other Speech (moſt commonly inſignificative) and the Cure of a Diſeaſe, much leſs between a little Ticket, or other ſuſpended Body; and an Ague? what is ſaid of the weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve, being either fabulous or diabolical, and alwayes ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; as the Phylacteries of the Jews were. Although this Error is ſo ancient that the Greek <hi>Athletae</hi> were wont to arm themſelves with ſuch things againſt ſluggiſhneſs, of which trifles, their Adverſaries alſo made uſe to overcome them in Wraſtling; and at this day, ſome wear certain Chracters about them, that they may win at play. In like manner, the Romans hung Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets about their Children's necks, which they call'd <hi>Praefifcini,</hi> and <hi>Faſcini,</hi> and made of Jet; as the Spaniards make them at preſent. To which, to attribute any power upon the account of their Form, Number, or other regard beſide their Matter, is an Error as great in Philoſophy, as it would be impiety and contempt of the Church to extend his concluſion to <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, Reliques, and other ſacred things, whoſe ſo continual Effect cannot be queſtion'd but by the prophane and heretical.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That by the Doctrine lately publiſh'd in the Treatiſe of <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> it appears, that not only Matter, but alſo Figure, Number, and other correſpondences with the Celeſtial Bodies have ſome efficacy; which to queſtion, becauſe we know not the manifeſt Cauſe, would be too great preſumption. Yea, I would not call all ſuch Effects Supernatural, ſince there are ſo many things feaſible, whereof we know not the Cauſe. And as to the Supernatural Effects of Amulets, they are of two ſorts: For either they are perform'd by the favour and bleſſing of God, who redoubles, yea, heightens to a ſeemingly unpoſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Effects of Natural Cauſes, or elſe changes them: Or they are effected by help of the Evil Spirit, who is the Ape of Divine Actions. As then, in conſequence of the Sacraments, God's Graces are conferr'd upon Chriſtians, ſo the Devil agrees with the Sorcerer or Magician, that as often as he ſhall make ſuch a ſign, or ſpeak ſuch a word, ſuch an Effect ſhall follow; whence 'tis no wonder if the Devil, though inclin'd ſolely to Evil, ſometimes does good, as healing a Diſeaſe by applying true Natural Agents to Patients, thereby to accuſtom the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer to give credit to his words. Thus an Italian having ſold a familiar Spirit, bethought himſelf to put a great Spider in a box, and yet he that bought it found the ſame uſe and benefit of it which he deſir'd.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That without recurring to good or bad Angels, whoſe powerful Effects cannot be queſtion'd but by Miſcreants, we find ſomething in the ordinary courſe of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things that makes for Amulets, the Antiquity whereof is teſtifi'd by that ſaying of a Roman, who being ſick, and aſk'd
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66371:142"/>
how he did, anſwer'd his Friend, thus: You may ſee how ill I am by this Ticket, which I have ſuffer'd to be put about my Neck: intimating that he muſt needs be very ſick to ſuffer it, ſince he gave no credit to it. And yet Confidence is a neceſſary condition for the making Amulets efficacious. For as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ſickneſs oftentimes makes people ſick indeed; ſo an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they ſhall be cur'd by ſuch an Action, Writing, or Word, is capable to work a Cure in thoſe whoſe Minds have great power over their Bodies: Which Opinion, being founded only upon the Word, Writing, or the applying of an Herb to the Patient's Wriſt, or other ſuch Conceipt, the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be term'd other than an Amulet. Beſides, 'twere a great raſhneſs to conclude, that there is no Connexion or neceſſary Conſequence between Words and Effects; ſince the ſame is found by Experience: And Words are the ſignes and images of things, and conſequently, have ſome proportion between them. Whence poſſibly, they that hunt the Hyaena cry continually, I do not ſee her, till ſhe be enter'd into the toil, which ſhe doth boldly upon Confidence of that Speech; and when they cry, I do ſee her, ſhe endeavors to fly and get out of the Net, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles her ſelf further therein: And in old time Gardners curs'd Parſley as they ſow'd it, to make it ſpring up the ſooner. Hence alſo the very naming of filthy things, eſpecially when we are eating, turns our Stomacks; and the mention of heinous Crimes makes us frown. And leſt this ſhould be attributed to Phanſie alone, which is prov'd before not to be active, but only cognoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, we find that Serpents are charmed by words; and <hi>Heſiod</hi> hath a Verſe to drive away <hi>Cantharides</hi>; and Shepherds affirm, that according to the diverſity of certain Words, breeding Mares bring forth either Males or Females.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXIV. Whether Fruition diminiſhes Love.</head>
            <p>THe Ignorance of the Definition of Love, ſeems to have occaſion'd this Queſtion. For ſince the Paſſions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd only by the various apprehenſion of Good and Evil; Hope, reſpecting good abſent; Love, that which is preſent; (whence 'tis ſeldom without ſome inward joy, and Lovers would not be freed from their Paſſion, though they complain of it) to queſtion, Whether we love what we poſſeſs, is to queſtion, Whether Love be Love. Beſides, Love being not of things unknown, it follows that the more we know, the more we love that which is amiable (as we do by poſſeſſing it) for we cannot judge of that which we poſſeſs not, but by the report of others, which is commonly lyable to fallacy, according to the ſeveral intereſts of the Reporters: Which will appear better by the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66371:142"/>
compariſon of one that prefers a Picture before what it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. For what proportion there is between the Picture of a Miſtreſs, and the Miſtreſs her ſelf; the ſame is found between ſuch Miſtreſs whilſt ſhe permits her Servant no privacy, and her ſelf when ſhe is married to him; the Actions of the one being but the ſhadow and Picture of thoſe of the other, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in their ſimplicity by fruition. We may ſay therefore, that the Paſſion before Enjoyment, is Deſire; but Poſſeſſion alone is capable to produce true Love. Beſides, the perfection of each thing compleats it, and places it in its higheſt point, inſtead of deſtroying it; ſo likewiſe Enjoyment, which is the perfection of Love, and the ſole Butt it aims at, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it. As one delightful meal may appeaſe preſent hunger, but with-all it incites us rather to deſire another than to diſguſt it.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, Did we not converſe with things altogether imperfect, Poſſeſſion would encreaſe Love, becauſe it would ſee new perfections in the thing belov'd: But on the contrary, common Experience teaches us the imperfection of what, before Enjoyment, we accounted highly of; and ſo our Love of it comes to be diminiſh'd. Beſides, difficult things being the faireſt, and contrarily brave things, whoſe acquiſition is eaſie, contemn'd, (witneſs the Orders of Knight-hood and other Honors, which have been made rare, only that they might be the more amiable) it follows that we leſs love what we have in our power, than what we have not; Humane weakneſs being ſoon weary of every thing, and naturally carry'd to change: But we cannot be weary of things not in our power, and, conſequently, we muſt eſteem them more than what we poſſeſs, the familiarneſs whereof, is apt to breed Contempt of it in us: Beſides that, the Mind is prone to ſeek what it wants, and to eſteem the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of another above its own. Thus the Ox would fain gallop like the Horſe, who on the other ſide envies his labour at the Plough; and every one takes more pleaſure in ſpeaking of what he leaſt underſtands, and about the profeſſion of others, than about his own. Yea, Experience ſhews us, that Lovers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh both the thing and name of Servants, as ſoon as they are marry'd. Whence a late Poet ſpeaking of his Miſtreſs, ſaid, He knew no way to moderate the exceſſive Love he had for her, but by marrying her.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That true Love muſt be diſtinguiſh'd from falſe; this latter decreſing by fruition, whereas the former is encreas'd by it; as alſo we muſt diſtinguiſh of Subjects that are lov'd. Thoſe that deſerve not to be ſo, are like coarſe Pictures which require to be beheld at a diſtance and in a certain ſtation, becauſe neerneſs diſcovers their defects; whereas the nearer an excellent and well drawn piece is beheld, the more it is eſteem'd. Beſides, a difference muſt be made between what is practis'd and what ought to be practis'd. The defects of the perſon lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66371:143"/>
are not to be imputed to the thing loved; and therefore the Queſtion ſhould not be whether Enjoyment diminiſhes, but whether it ought to diminiſh Love; as indeed it neither ought nor doth in things truly amiable; for the more they are known, the more they endear themſelves. As therefore the more the Sun ripens a Grape, the ſweeter it is: and yet one in a Fever thinks it bitter and prefers Verjuice before it; which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, makes us not conclude Verjuice the ſweeter of the two: So the diſguſt of a Lover is not to be imputed to the thing lov'd, but is indeed an argument of his own imperfection.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, If the diminution of Love upon enjoyment were a ſign of weakneſs of judgment, Women would not be (as they are) more conſtant then Men after the ſame: as we ſee, more Men deſert the Love of Women, then on the contrary. Witneſs the ſtory of <hi>Demophoon</hi> after enjoyment of the King of <hi>Thrace</hi>'s Daughter, who fell into deſpair upon his departure, as <hi>Medea</hi> did upon that of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> upon that of her <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The cauſe whereof ſeems not imputable to feminine Pudor, as if having yielded themſelves to one man they could not keep their honour unleſs they keep their affection: but the reaſon is, becauſe Men are more perfect then Women and find more cauſes in them for change. Yet I conceive that the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or diminution of Love ariſeth not from enjoyment; as appears by Friendſhip, which is contracted only after long converſe, and the eating of many buſhels of Salt together (as the Proverb ſpeaks) ſo far is a thorough knowledg, ſuch as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment gives us, from diminiſhing it. Not to mention the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many married couples, who if occaſion were offer'd, would not ſtick to imitate the noble contention of <hi>Gracchus</hi> and <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and chuſe to dye one for the other.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That if Fruition diminiſhes Love, it muſt be the fault either of the Lover, or the thing lov'd. Not the firſt; for he is always the ſame perſon, and fruition renders his object more ſenſible, and conſequently more amiable to him. Nor the latter; ſince the very imperfections of the thing lov'd ſeem ſo many perfections to him that loves it,
<q>Balbinumque ſuae delectat polypus Agnae.</q>
Thus alſo the imperfections of Children diminiſh not their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents love, but by the help of compaſſion augment the ſame; Grandfathers commonly love their Childrens Children more tenderly then their own; and amongſt their own, the youngeſt. Which holds not only in this kind of work, but in all others; bad Painters having no leſs kindneſs for their own pieces then <hi>Apelles</hi> could have for his.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That the Queſtion may be determin'd by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the ſorts of Love. Impetuous Love, ſuch as is found in Youth and the Poets deſcribe, ſwells (like Torrents)
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66371:143"/>
by reſiſtance, and languiſhes by liberty. Regular and ſober Love, ſuch as is found in ripe years, towards deſerving ſubjects, and eſpecially divine things, encreaſes (like Rivers) by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of new Notions, as ſo many new Springs, till it end in a boundleſs Ocean. Either ſort receives augmentation or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution according to the diverſity of the minds affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; the weak, as leſs capable of underſtanding the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of this impetuous paſſion, (which maſtering all the reſt, deprives them of the uſe of Reaſon, and renders them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to other actions of life) continue longer before they come to themſelves and quit this trouble. Hence Women, and of them the leaſt judicious, are conceiv'd to retain this paſſion longeſt, even after poſſeſſion of what they lov'd. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happens in the other love, wherein the more we enjoy, the more we are enflam'd to further purſutes of knowledg.</p>

         <div n="175" type="conference">
            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXV. Whether 'twere better to know all that men now know, or all that they ignore.</head>
            <p>NOne doubts but there are ſtill things to be known, and conſequently Sciences to be attained. But if we will ſtand to the wiſeman's ſentence, That all known Sciences are vanity (that is to ſay, Nothing), the Queſtion will ſoon be voided, there being no compariſon between Nothing and Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Moreover, there being no Science without Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and very few or no Demonſtrations in any Diſcipline, which themſelves are founded upon Principles not demonſtrable, which nevertheleſs ought to be known; it follows that there is no Science, and that we know but one thing with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> to wit, That we know nothing. And <hi>Pyrrho</hi> went further; not allowing that men know themſelves ignorant, but that they muſt be contented to doubt of it, yea and to doubt of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubting. Accordingly we ſee that no reaſon is ever ſo ſtrong but ſome other may be found that thwarts it; and in all Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines the moſt ſkillful are the moſt unreſolv'd and furtheſt from that Scholaſtick temerity; which boaſts of knowing every thing, and never doubts of any thing; like thoſe young Captains that make head upon every occaſion, whereas your veterans are more ſober. So likewiſe the moſt ſkillful Phyſicians are always leaſt haſty in their Judgments and Preſcriptions; and Lawyers the more practiſe and experience they have, the more contrary preſidents they find in the ſame caſe. If you aſcend to Divinity there you will find more ignorance than any where elſe; yea Ignorance is the firſt degree, and one of the conditions requir'd
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:66371:144"/>
to it, which was the reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much blames Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and our Lord choſe the ſimpleſt and moſt ignorant, ſuch as poor Fiſhers, not Doctors of the Law nor Scribes and Phariſees, who were the moſt learned of his Country. And at this day when matters of Religion ſeem moſt refin'd, there's none ſo raſh but acknowledges that one ſingle moment of the Viſion of God gives more knowledg then the whole <hi>Sorbonne</hi> hath, and that there is no more compariſon between what all the men of the world together know of God, and what Beatitude will teach of him, then there is between finite and infinite, that is, none at all. Whereby it appears that the knowledg of men is infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by what they ignore. I ſhall inſtance further in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Arts, wherein if you compare the things our Artificers are ignorant of with thoſe they know, the moſt excellent amongſt them will confeſs himſelf very unſkilful and ignorant; whereof the ſole ancient Inventions now loſt may ſerve for a proof. For in ſome Roman Monuments lately diſcover'd there have been found Lamps which burnt twelve or fifteen hundred years, and were not extinguiſh'd but upon letting in of the Air; particularly in the Tomb of <hi>Tullia Cicero</hi>'s Daughter at <hi>Padua.</hi> The invention of a perpetual Motion which animated <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> Sphear, dy'd with him; that of malleable Glaſs, with its Inventor, who was wretchedly ſlain by <hi>Tiberius</hi>; that of melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones or making artificial ones, or at leaſt of tranſporting and managing them, whereby the Romans built thoſe great Piles of Amphitheaters, and other Works inimitable by us, is not known at this day; yea, to go no further, the goodneſs of building with moſt of the materials of the Ancients is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd with them. So that 'tis no wonder that at this day many of their Hiſtories are accounted Fables; ſuch as the teaching of an Elephant to Dance upon the Rope, which <hi>Suetonius</hi> affirms was ſeen in a Spectacle given to the Roman People; the care and induſtry of Men being much diminiſh'd in this lee of times, wherein they deſire to obtain every thing without pains. For the new Inventions of later Ages, as the Compaſs, Guns, Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Teleſcopes, and ſome others, were before Chance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them, or at leaſt gave ſome hints to their Inventors, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us in the ſame Nothing wherein are all other poſſible things not yet effected. So that 'tis eaſie to conceive that there are infinite ſuch ſecrets, or more excellent (as the Philoſopher's Stone, the Quadrature of the Circle, the Fountain without end, and many other things whereof we have only confus'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) which he that ſhould know would be as much higher then all other men, as the Intelligences are above them. For Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whether good or bad produce none of their Marvels but by this Science of things to us unknown; whence we oft-times term that miraculous which is purely natural. As may appear by the few Secrets found in the hands of men, which make them admir'd by all others, and anciently advanc'd them to the rank of Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:66371:144"/>The Second ſaid, This Opinion (that what we ignore is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then what we know) is founded upon the maligne envious nature of ſome who ſlight what is their own, and eſteem only what is anothers, meerly becauſe they want it: as thoſe that aſcend up a Ladder, trample on the ſtep that upholds them, ſtill aſpiring to that which is above them, but only to trample on it alſo next. So he that knows not ſome new thing, deſpiſes all he knows already, to learn it; and having learn'd it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes it alſo. For 'tis likely our firſt Parents who had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things, preſerv'd the memory of what deſerv'd it beſt; yea, that for ſo many Ages as the World hath laſted, men have retain'd the moſt profitable Sciences and Inventions that Art or Chance hath taught them. If they have let ſome be loſt, 'tis becauſe they found them unprofitable. And as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, we ſhall ſee nothing in the future but what hath been already: Should the World laſt as long again as it hath done, it would be but a continual repetition of the ſame things. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſpoken, but it hath been ſpoken formerly. The terms of all Sciences have been ſo often mixt, that as few or no new words are produc'd in any Language, ſo there cannot be many productions of Wit but what are repetitions of old ones, cloth'd in a new mode. For, to inſtance in the Liberal Sciences; is it poſſible to Read, Write, and Speak either in Proſe or Verſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then men do at preſent? Can the Demonſtrations of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks become more certain by time then they are now? Will it be more true to morrow then 'tis to day, that the whole is bigger then its part? Have the Chymiſts and other pretended reformers of Phyſick, ſucceeded better then others? Can the Laws be better underſtood then they are? And for Divinity; is it poſſible to know more of it in this world then is known at preſent? whilſt experience teaches us that the multitude of Books doth not leſs perplex then profit us, both in this and all other Sciences? But, ſuppoſe this old Errour had ſome likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to examine the certainty of it we muſt compare what we know with what we ignore; becauſe both the terms of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ſought, ought to be known. Now we are conſcious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of what we know, but it implies a contradiction that we ſhould know what we know not. Wherefore if we ſhould quit the Sciences and Arts known and practis'd by men for what we know not, we ſhould have the ſame fortune with <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Dog, who let go his morſel of fleſh for the ſhadow of it which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd greater in the water, where indeed there was nothing at all. The truth is, thoſe that have employ'd moſt time, labour, and money in the ſearch of Secrets, confeſs that they have met with nothing but ſmoak. Whence if there be any curious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, he is always unproſperous, becauſe he never attains his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That from what hath been ſaid of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the knowledge of <hi>Daemons</hi> and ours, the reſolution
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:66371:145"/>
of the queſtion is apparent. For ſince our knowledge is much ſhort of theirs, it follows that we have more things to learn then we know; the having a habit, not being neceſſary for knowing its privation. Thus one born deaf and blinde, yet knows that he wants more knowledge through his defect of Hearing and Sight, then he hath by his remaining ſenſes: and though I ſee not Night becauſe it is not viſible, nevertheleſs I conſider by it the beauty of the abſent day. Yea, he that hath no Science, commonly values it higher then the Learned themſelves do.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXVI. Whether Muſick doth more hurt or good.</head>
            <p>OUr Soul being a proportion, loves what partakes thereof; whence the Rules of Architecture ill-obſerv'd, and the Geſtures of Clowns diſpleaſe the Eye, and diſorderly ſounds hurt the Ear. For though there is proportion in the Senſes of Touching, Smelling, and Taſting (which is the reaſon why cold hands are ſo pained upon immediately approaching a hot Fire; and moderate ſmells and relliſhes pleaſe us better then exceſſive) yet onely two ſenſes are well capable of judging of this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; namely, the ſight, and the hearing. And the ſame reſpect that there is between Beauty and Deformity, in reference to the Sight, is found alſo between Harmony and Diſcord in regard of the Hearing. Wherefore Muſick being the Art of Harmony, they who love it not, are as extravagant as they that make no difference between a fair and an ugly face, proportion being the chief difference of both. Hence ſome are not contented to account this Art as a Rule and Touchſtone whereby to diſcern well temper'd ſpirits from others, but have ventur'd to aſſert the hatred thereof a mark of reprobation. Moreover, the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Conteſts, were about the prerogative of Muſick, every one pretending to be maſter thereof. Witneſs that of the Muſes with the Syrens, of theſe with <hi>Thamyris,</hi> of <hi>Apollo</hi> with <hi>Marſyas, Linus,</hi> and <hi>Pan,</hi> (who puniſht <hi>Midas</hi>'s in judiciouſneſs with Aſſes Ears) and that of <hi>Nero</hi> with all the Muſicians of his time. Yea, it cures ſome Diſeaſes, (as the biting of the Tarantula and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly) and aſſwages the raving of Daemoniacks, (as we read in the ſtory of <hi>Saul.</hi>) The crying of new-born Children is quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the jingling of Keyes or a Baſin, and when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bigger they are diverted with the ſinging of their Nurſes. Youth particularly delights in Muſick; whence the Cretians made their Laws to be more eaſily learnt by their young people by cauſing them to ſing them; and we ſee the Rules of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar are for the ſame reaſon contriv'd into Verſe. <hi>Caius Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:66371:145"/>
when a man made uſe thereof to regulate the tone of his voice, never making an Oration but with his Servant behinde him; who twanging a Muſical Inſtrument, took him down when he was too high, and rais'd him when he was too low. And <hi>Achilles</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> diverted himſelf with his Harp when he was at leaſure from his Military Employments. Artificers ſweeten the tediouſneſs of their labour with Songs. Shepheards chear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it, and it makes Maids ſpin more nimbly. <hi>Theodul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> the Biſhop redeemed himſelf out of priſon with a Hymne which he compos'd, beginning <hi>Gloria, laus, &amp; honor.</hi> The ſtory is known of <hi>Arion</hi> caſt into the Sea by Pyrats, and carry'd ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhore by a Dolphin, whom he raviſh'd with his Voice and Harp, which was firſt inſtituted to honour the Gods. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians perform'd their Worſhip by Dancing to Songs, <hi>Cybele</hi>'s Prieſts with Cymbals, the Curetes with Drums and Trumpets; the Romans ſung Spondaick Verſes, whilſt they offer'd their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and <hi>David</hi> danc'd before the Ark, all his Pſalms being fitted to the Harp, and other harmonious Inſtruments of that time. And in this, ſee what power Organs have to enflame the zeal of the devout, and how melodious voices are with it; ſo that the chief difference of Divine Service is in the Singing. And as for publick or private Feaſts and Ceremonies, nothing renders them more compleat then Muſick; whence the Verſe,
<q>Convivii citharam quam Dii fecêre ſodalem.</q>
'Twas the cuſtom to preſent a Lute to the Gueſts; and to him that could not play, a branch of Bayes, which oblig'd him to a Song. But above all, the uſe of Muſick is effectual in War, whence the Spartans march'd to the ſound of Flutes in a kinde of Dance, to the end that by the motion of their Souldiers they might diſcern the valiant from the poltrons. The Pythagoreans themſelves were lull'd aſleep with the Harp, to appeaſe the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of their minde. In ſhort, Muſick accompanies us to the Graves, where people ſing Elegies for the deceaſed. Thus the Phoenicians added Flutes to their mournings, and the Romans had their <hi>Siticines</hi> who ſung at their Funerals. For Muſick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites both ſadneſs and mirth. And juſt as Phyſick either quiets or purges the humors of our bodies, ſo doth Muſick the Paſſions of the minde. <hi>Plato</hi> conceiving that it was given to man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tickle his ears, but alſo to maintain the Harmony of the Soul with the Body, and to awake our ſleeping vertues. Thus of divers modes, the Dorick makes prudent and chaſte, the Phrygian excites to War and Religion, the Lydian abates pride and turns it into lamentations, the Ionick excites to honeſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and recreations. Hence <hi>Aegyſthus</hi> could never corrupt the chaſtity of <hi>Clytemneſtra, Agamemnons</hi> Wife, till he us'd the help of the Poet and Muſician <hi>Demodocus</hi>; and the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being ready to deſtroy the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> was diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66371:146"/>
and wrought to mercy by the melodious Sonnets of little Children, inſtructed thereunto by <hi>Flavianus</hi> their Biſhop. Yea, the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> recommended this Art, when he commanded a Harp to be played on before him, and then Propheſi'd to <hi>Joram</hi> the overthrow of the Moabites. And <hi>Michaia</hi> did the like in the preſence of <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Samaria,</hi> refuſing to propheſie till one had played before him upon a Muſical Inſtrument. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> in the 12th. Book of his Daniſh Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, concerning <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who being told of the excellent Muſick of the Violin, deſir'd to ſee the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it; which were ſuch, that at firſt it put him into a deep melancholly, and afterwards chearing him up again, rais'd his ſpirit to ſuch a degree of rage, that he ſlew four of his Guard, and at laſt it return'd him to his firſt temper; ſerving onely to ſhew the excellence of Muſick when it is rightly us'd.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Muſick effeminates mens courage, whilſt it ſweetens; like that of Wine taken to exceſs, intoxicates them, and tranſports them out of themſelves: which hurtful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gave juſt cauſe to the fable of the Syrenes, who allur'd Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots by their melodious voices, to ſplit againſt the Rocks. But above all, it excites to filthy pleaſures, and blindes the eyes of the Underſtanding, as <hi>Mercury</hi> did thoſe of <hi>Argus.</hi> And its great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation, through the diſſipation of the Animal ſpirits which the ſweetneſs of the ſound attracts by the ear, leaves us leſs refreſht then wearied, and incapable of ſetting about any ſerious matter. Its eaſing the Sciatica (as 'tis reported) is common to it with every thing that cauſes great attention, whereby the ſpirits, and with them the humors being ſuſpended, the fluxion muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ceaſe; and the Rabbins attribute the driving away <hi>Saul</hi>'s evil ſpirit, not to the Harmony alone of <hi>Davids</hi> Harp, but to the vertue of the Characters of the Divine Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon it. What did the Sybarites get by training their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the Pipe, but this, that the Crotonians cauſing Minſtrels to play at the joyning of a Battel, render'd their Horſes uſeleſs to the Fight, becauſe they did nothing but Dance. Moreover, <hi>Orpheus</hi> one of the moſt ancient Muſicians was torn to pieces by women, becauſe he debauch'd their Husbands. Whence alſo <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſaid that <hi>Iſmenias</hi> was either a Fool, or a bad Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, becauſe he could play ſo well upon the Flute; and <hi>Philip</hi> was angry with <hi>Alexander</hi> for ſinging too well; and <hi>Antigonns</hi> his Governour broke his Harp. Therefore the Egyptians ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Muſicians as corrupters of Youth, and the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were ſo afraid leſt they ſhould grow into credit amongſt them that they expelled <hi>Timotheus</hi> out of their City for adding a ſtring to his Lute. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo places this Art amongſt the Ludicrous, and blames Painters for repreſenting the gods ſinging and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Inſtruments; whoſe goodlieſt effect is to break ſilence, and waſte time, leaving no permanent action after it, more then the play of Cards, Dice, and Tennis doth; which laſt is much

more profitable for health, and is accounted as honourable to be perfectly ſkill'd in by perſons of quality, as 'tis ſhameful to be an excellent Muſician. In fine, we read not that our Lord ever Sung, nor yet <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Original Righteouſneſs; but one <hi>Jubal,</hi> the firſt Bigamer and ſecond Murderer of the world, is ſaid to have been the inventer of it.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXVII. Whether Barrenneſs is moſt commonly tht fault of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands or of Wives.</head>
            <p>AS Fruitfulneſs is a power whereby every living thing is able to produce its like, ſo Barrenneſs is an impotence in it to re-produce is ſelf by the way of Generation; by means whereof mortal individuals acquire immortality in their Species: to which purpoſe nature hath furniſh'd every one with neceſſary Organs. The generation of perfect Animals requires three things; diverſity of Sex; matter or ſeed, which flows from both Male and Female, and contains in it ſelf the Idea and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the parts from which it iſſues; and laſtly, conjunction of both together, without which nothing is produc'd. And though the defect of Generation may be ſometimes on the mans part as well as on the womans; yet ſhe is more ſubject to ſterili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is an impotence proper to a woman, who, after the knowledge of a man in an age and time convenient, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. For thoſe that conceive not after the 50th. year, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 12th. are not term'd barren: Conceptions beyond the former, or before the latter term, being ſupernatural or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; as thoſe of the Manandri and Calingi, and that of one mention'd by <hi>Savonarola,</hi> whom he ſaw big with Childe at nine years of Age; as alſo the miraculous conception of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after ſhe was ſeventy years old. The cauſe of Barrenneſs is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd by ſome to the diſproportion between the ſeeds; whence ſhe that is barren with her firſt Husband, is fruitful with her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Thoſe of the woman are either internal or external. The internal depend partly upon the ſeed and menſtrual Blood, and partly upon the temper of the Womb, and the habit of the body. The ſeed of a woman, as well as that of man, muſt be of a laudable temper, quantity, and conſiſtence, and provided of ſpirits enough. If the maternal blood, which concurs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to generation, be too plentiful or too little, no effect follows, any more then if it were corrupted or wanted other requiſite conditions, The Womb (which is like the ſoil to corn) may be hurt either in its temper, or its conformation, or in the ſolution of continuity; all which diſorders hinder gravidation. As for the habit of body, we obſerve that fat women are barren, either
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66371:147"/>
becauſe the matter of Seed, which is the purer portion of the Blood, is turn'd into fat; or becauſe the Epiploon of fat Women preſſing upon the Orifice of the Womb, hinders the Seed from entring into the bottom of it. Nor are Women too lean fit for Children, by reaſon of their dryneſs, and the tenuity of their Womb, although they are far more fit than fat Women; but this leanneſs is to be underſtood of ſo great an extenuation, that it leavs the parts dedicated to Generation, deſtitute of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and due temperature. Neither are the very tall, or very low much fitter; but thoſe that are of a moderate Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Stature, whoſe Breaſts are firm, and their lower parts larger than their upper. Now ſince Conception is an Action proper to the Womb, which quickens the Genitures, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought rather to be ſaid the Cauſe thereof than the Man, and (by the reaſon of contraries) the Defect thereof muſt likewiſe be charg'd upon her.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That to blame Women for being more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently barren than Men, is to deprive them of their chief Glory, which is Fruitfulneſs. For Nature form'd them chiefly for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as the Conformation of their Bodies ſeems to prove, in which the parts ſerving to that purpoſe, as the Womb and Breaſts, have direct communications not only between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo with the nobleſt parts of the Body. Whence the Civilians reckon not Praegnation amongſt Diſeaſes, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all its inconveniences) but, with Phyſitians, as a ſign of health and good diſpoſition. Whereof <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> l. 14. <hi>ff. de aedilit. edicto,</hi> gives this Reaſon, Becauſe their greateſt and peculiar Office is to receive and preſerve the fruit. And therefore Woman, having been in Nature's firſt intention de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for Generation, ſhe muſt be alſo much more fit for it, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature never fails of her end) than Man, who being born for Command, Labour, Contemplation, and other more ſublime Employments, is deſign'd for Generation, but in the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote intention of Nature. For not to ſpeak of the deſire of Coition, which might renew the old quarrel that coſt <hi>Tireſias</hi> his Eyes, Women ſeem far more deſirous to be Mothers, than Men do to be Fathers; and Nature gives no deſires in vain. Beſides, Man is naturally Hot and Dry; a Temper leſs proper for Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and he inoreaſes the ſame by Hunting, Warr, Exerciſes, and other violent Labours; not to ſpeak of buſineſs and ſtudy; On the contrary, Women living alwayes at eaſe, have a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution both of Body and Mind more calm, and, conſequently, more fit for this Action, or rather Paſſion. As therefore 'tis more eaſie to ſuffer than than to act; ſo Women muſt find leſs difficulty in Generation; and, conſequently, have leſs impediment to propagate than Men. I ſay nothing of Exceſſes in Dyet, wherein Men are alwayes more licentious; yet 'tis the Exceſs of Wine that ſome alledge as the chief Cauſe, why ſome Northern Countries are at this day almoſt deſart,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:66371:147"/>
whereas anciently they were ſo populous, that Hiſtorians call'd the North the Shop of Men, and the Magazine of Nations. Witneſs the frequent Colonies iſſu'd from thence, and the great inundations they have upon other parts of the world. And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, the reaſon why the Hebrew Law oblig'd a Man to marry the Relict of his iſſuleſs Brother, was, becauſe it ſuppos'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to proceed from the Huſband, and not from the Wife; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why ſhould the Siſter of a Wife deceas'd with iſſue ſucceed in her ſtead too? But this Sex is reckon'd alwayes fit for ingend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and, indeed, is ever ready for it (as the other is not); which is the reaſon (as a late Lady ſaid) why Men make ſute to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, rather than theſe to them. Perhaps alſo upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, barrenneſs under the Old Law was accounted by Women ſo great a reproach; becauſe being very rare, 'tis a kind of a monſtrous thing in their Sex to be barren. Moreover, we hear many Women complain to the Judges, which is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſes of unfruitfulneſs. But Hiſtories afford ſcarce above three or four Women, of whoſe inability their Huſbands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd. And to ſpeak truth, as fertility is imputed to the field, and not to the grain, ſo it muſt alſo be to the Woman alone, who is the field of Nature, and not to the Man.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That beſides the Internal Cauſes of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and barrenneſs, there are alſo External ones which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Air, Dyet, Exerciſes, Paſſions, and the abuſe of the other things call'd Not-natural. The Air by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual alteration it cauſeth in the Body, (which attracts the ſame by Reſpiration and Tranſpiration) ſometimes occaſioneth either fruitfulneſs or ſterility, according to the variety of its Subſtance, Temper, and Qualities; two whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Exceſſive Heat, and Cold, are great Enemies to Generation; the one melting; the other congealing the Humors; but the exceſs of Heat leaſt hinders it, eſpecially in Women; the coldneſs of whoſe Temper, is corrected by the warmth, and increas'd by the coldneſs of the Air; whence they are more amorous in Summer than in Winter: Whereas the greater heat of Men is weakned by that of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and augmented by the coldneſs of Winter; during which, therefore they are more prone to Love. So Dyet too, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much to render our Bodies fruitful or barren, not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, but making them of the ſame Temper with it ſelf. Thus the waters of <hi>Nilus</hi> are ſo fertile, that they make the Egyptian Women bring forth three or four Children at once, by reaſon of the Salt-Nitre wherewith that River is impregnated; and, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chymiſts place the principle of Fecundity, becauſe Aſhes and Earth depriv'd of their Nitre, produce nothing. But cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, even ſuch as have the Virtue to petrifie, render Women (eſpecially) barren, as moſt Women in <hi>Spain</hi> are, through their frequent uſe of Ice and cold waters; though ſome lay the fault upon the rarity and tenuity of their Bodies, and the exceſs of Heat; which alſo is the reaſon why the African and Southern
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66371:148"/>
people are not ſo fruitful as thoſe of the North. Dyet, hot and moiſt, eaſie of digeſtion, nutritive and full of good juice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth much to render Women fruitful. On the contrary, the frequent uſe of food hot and dry, groſs, and of bad juice, may render them barren, as Leeks and Garlick do; and amongſt other Plants, Mint, which was therefore forbidden to be eaten, or planted in time of war; wherein 'tis needful to repair by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity, the loſs of Men it cauſeth. In like manner, want of Exerciſe, by the heaping up of ſuperfluous Humors, and too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and continual Exerciſes, by deſiccating the parts, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occaſion ſterility. Amongſt the Paſſions, Sadneſs is the greateſt Enemy to Generation; whence <hi>Heſiod</hi> forbids marry'd people to ſee one another after a Funeral, but only at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Bath, or from places of Mirth. In fine, what ever is capable to impair the goodneſs of the Temper, is contrary to Fruitfulneſs and Generation, which above all other Natural Actions requires an exact harmony of the qualities, and a perfect diſpoſition of the noble parts, which ſupply Matter and Spirits fit for this Action. And although Men and Women are alike expos'd to External Cauſes, yet Women being leſs vigorous, are ſooner wrought upon by them. For, to Internal Cauſes, which are the moſt conſiderable, Women are, undoubtedly, more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſince beſide Seed, which they ſupply as well as Man, (who to deſerve the name of fruitful, ought only to ſupply the ſame in requiſite quantity, quality, and conſiſtence, and place it in convenient Recepticles) the Woman muſt alſo afford Blood, and alſo a place for receiving and preſerving both the Seeds and Blood, namely, her Womb, the leaſt diſorder where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is ſufficient to marr the whole work of Generation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince ſhe contributes moſt to Generation, and there are more Cauſes in her concurring thereunto; if it take not Effect, ſhe is more in fault than the Man, who hath not ſo many ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences in the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Cauſes of ſterility being either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Adventitious, and equal in the Man and the Woman, nothing can be determin'd upon this Queſtion. For in either Sex, there are both univerſal and particular deficiences of right Temper, and as many Effeminate Men as Viragoes, (the one not leſs unfit for Generation than the other, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) Caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is practis'd in both, and diſorderly living is equal as well in Male as Female in theſe dayes. For if Men exceed in drinking, Maids and Women are as bad in Gluttony and Lickeriſhneſs. If there be any difference, 'tis from the diverſity of Climate; Women being found more fruitful in hot Countries, and leſs in cold, but Men contrarily; the intemperies of either Sex being corrected by an oppoſite conſtitution of Air. Hence ſuch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as have been long barren, ſometimes become fruitful by change of Air, Places, manner of Life, and eſpecially of Age, by which the temperament of the Body being ſenſibly alter'd,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66371:148"/>
it acquires the Fruitfulneſs it wanted, by acquiring the Qualities and Conditions neceſſary to Generation. Many likewiſe upon the ſame reaſon, become fuitful after the uſe of Mineral Waters or Baths, and being thereby deliver'd from ſeveral Diſeaſes, to which barren Women are more ſubject than ſuch as have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom Parturition rids of abundance of Excrements peculiar to that Sex, and occaſioning many diſorders in the barren.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the obſervation made by <hi>Bodin</hi> in his Republick, and ſeveral other famous Authors, [that the number of Women much exceeds that of Men] ſeems to void the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; Nature having thereby ſufficiently given us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That fewer men are as fruitful as more women. Which obſervation is verifi'd, not only in the Eaſt and other Countries, where plurality of Wives hath places; but alſo in <hi>France,</hi> where there is no Province wherein Virgins remain not unmarry'd for want of Huſbands. Moreover, one man may beget abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Children in the ſpace of nine moneths, during which a woman breeds but one or two; and therefore Man ſeems more fruitful then Woman, who beginning to be capable of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but two years before Man doth (<hi>viz.</hi> at 12 years old at the ſooneſt) ends 23 years ſooner then he; for men generate at 70 years of age and more, but women end at 50. During which time alſo they are ſubject to far more infirmities and maladies than men; who have not above four or five, whereof women are not capable; but women have fifty or threeſcore peculiar to themſelves.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXVIII. Whether Complaiſance proceeds from Magnanimity or Poorneſs of Spirit.</head>
            <p>COmplaiſance is a habit oppoſite to Roughneſs; the firſt being a Species of Civility, the latter of Ruſticity. Now ſince we are complaiſant either in good or bad things, to be ſo muſt be commendable or blameable according to the nature of the object. But becauſe no body doubts that we ought to be complaiſant in vertuous actions, and that they are as culpable who connive at vice as they that commit it; It remains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of Complaiſance in indifferent things, as 'tis in common practiſe amongſt men; and as <hi>Juvenal</hi> repreſents it in a perſon that falls a weeping as ſoon as he ſees his friends tears, and when he ſmiles laughs aloud; and if you ſay, you are very hot, he ſweats; if cold, he runs to his Fur-gown. Now the Queſtion is, whether ſuch a man hath more of courage or baſeneſs, I conceive he ſhews himſelf a very pitiful fellow. For this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66371:149"/>
differs not from that ſervile Vice, Flattery, which is near akin to Lying, and eaſily turns from an indifferent to a vicious action. Thus Courtiers varniſh vices with the name of ſuch vertues as have moſt conformity therewith, calling Avarice, Frugality; Laſciviouſneſs, Love; Obſtinacy, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; and ſo in other caſes, till they render themſelves ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous even to thoſe they praiſe; who how vain ſoever they may be, yet cannot hear their own praiſes without bluſhing at them, being conſcious that they diſpleaſe all the hearers. Indeed when I am complaiſant to any one, 'tis for fear to offend him; and fear was never an effect of Magnanimity. To which all that can be excepted, is that it belongs alſo to Prudence to fear formidable things. But Fortitude and Courage are never employ'd in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of this vertue, which therefore is very much ſuſpected, and oft-times ſerves for an excuſe of cowardice. Hence old men, whom their cold blood makes leſs courageous, are eſteem'd the moſt prudent; and if they be not the moſt complaiſant, 'tis to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the ſullenneſs attending that age, as jollity doth youth. Moreover, as Courage leads us to act without fear of danger what we conceive good and juſt; ſo it teaches us to call things by their proper names, as <hi>Philip</hi>'s Souldiers did. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Complaiſance teaches people to admire beauty in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed woman, to commend a bad Poets Verſes, and deſire a copy of them from him; to give fair words to ſuch as we will not or cannot do any kindneſs to; in brief, to diſſemble all things and to diſguiſe our words, contrary to the frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs prohibition of God in holy Scripture, which calls it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a heart and a heart: ſo that no perſon of ſound judgment can think ſuch demeanor conſiſtent with true Courage.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That there is as much difference between Ruſticity and Complaiſance or Civility, as between a Beaſt and a Man; the former leaving us to the guidance of our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Senſes, and to ſay and do whatever they dictate to us; the latter over-ruling them by that power of Reaſon, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conteſt remains victorious over the body and ſenſuality. A cholerick man ſuffering himſelf to be tranſported by his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, utters whatever the violence thereof ſuggeſts to him; whereas one of a more ſedate temper maſters his anger, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he have as good reaſon for it, and by this prudent action he reduces his friend ſtray'd out of the rode of reaſon; as he that inſtead of retorting the ill language his friend gave him, aſk'd him what the Diamond upon his finger coſt him. Which put the other into ſuch confuſion, that having anſwer'd the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he ran to embrace him and aſk'd his pardon. Whereby it appears how much more courage is requiſite to ſurmount ones ſelf thus, (which is an effect of Complaiſance) then to obey the ſwing of choler, as vulgar people do: For Complaiſance forces our nature and conſtrains us to ſpeak, and do things contrary to our firſt inclinations, and conſequently is of more difficulty then
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66371:149"/>
'tis to obey them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates how one <hi>Telerus</hi> anſwer'd his brother, who aſk'd him how it came paſs that he was leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd then himſelf, who had been made one of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Ephori,</hi> whereas he was treated with great contempt? The reaſon is (ſaid he) becauſe you are not complaiſant, and cannot bear any injury. As therefore it requires greater courage to bear then to revenge an injury (as 'tis obſerv'd in the life of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who hindred his Scholars from revenging an affront which was done to him) ſo 'tis more difficult to be complaiſant then rude. And as the ſame Author ſaith, Complaiſance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in ſpeaking pleaſing things, and in doing good offices; both which require a good reſolute Spirit, for our Gallants falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account it courage to run into the Field upon the leaſt ſlip of an ambiguous word: Which perverſe phantaſtry hath coſt many a brave mans life, who for want of not having attain'd to that high point of Magnanimity which teaches us not to place the point of Honor in every triflle, but only where it ought to be, have really loſt the life both of body and ſoul for an imaginary folly which carry'd them away with the torrent of the popular errour of this Age.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That we may as well place Continence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous places, as reckon Complaiſance an effect of Courage; the reſpect being alike of both. For all the actions of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant perſon are ſo many marks not only of reſpect, but alſo of a ſervile fear, ſuch as was that of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Courtiers, who held their necks awry and hung down their heads in imitation of their Maſter, who was forc'd to do ſo by reaſon of a wound; and thoſe of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who ſtumbled at every ſtep, becauſe this Tyrant was pur-blind. So when ſome perſon begins a tedious old ſtory, I pray, who ſhews moſt courage, he that tells the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator 'tis an old one, or he that ſuffers himſelf to be tir'd with it? Beſides, that there is nothing more dangerous then this Complaiſance. Certainly a Confeſſor that is complaiſant to his Penitents, and a Preacher that is ſo to his Auditory, will damn both; and ſo alſo a General that yields to every advice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not ſuch as deſerve it, will infallibly ruine his Army. A Phyſitian of this temper, that to comply with his Patient nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleeds nor purges him becauſe of his unwillingneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, will be the cauſe of his death; as the Apothecary dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the vertue of the Medicine whilſt he ſtrives to make it agreeable to the taſte, and a pitiful Surgeon makes the ſore. A Lawyer that uſes the ſame courſe with his Client, thruſts him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many needleſs and unhappy Sutes. In brief there is nothing ſo dangerous, nor which argues more weakneſs then Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, which like too ſweet Sauces makes us nauſeate it, and leaves us as far to ſeek for Counſel as before: Whereas plain and vigorous Counſel oftentimes ſaves the State from ſhipwreck.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, If you conſider all the kinds of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66371:150"/>
they have need of conſtraint, which employs more force and courage then is requiſite for following ones inclination. Thus, he that is more thirſty then his neighbour and yet tenders the firſt glaſs to him, does this violence to himſelf out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, which likewiſe obliges him to put his hand laſt to the diſh though his Stomack be never ſo ſharp; if he meet with an occaſion of anger, he only ſmiles to himſelf, and with diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation gives the upper hand to his inferior. On the contrary, a rough-hewn perſon had rather go to the Gallies then commend Verſes which to him ſeem not good, and (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>) eat nothing ever but Coleworts, than comply with the Ceremonies and Modes of great perſons. Thus he that ſpares his diſarmed enemy, ſhows greater courage then if, leaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be guided of his hatred, he ſhould ſlay him, which yet is no more then a teſtimony of his having overcome him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in ſparing him he overcomes himſelf, which is the greateſt victory a man can obtain. To conclude, Praiſe is the reward of Vertue, and becauſe it follows complaiſence, as ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt doth ruſtick opinionaſtry: this is an evident ſign that the latter is leſs vertuous becauſe leſs commendable then the other.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXIX. Touching the means of re-eſtabling Commerce.</head>
            <p>MAn being born ſociable, and ſociety not poſſible without Commerce, the ſame ſeemeth one of the main Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mankind, who are generally troubled, when the ſame is either interrupted by War with ſtrangers, or extinguiſh'd by the negligence of Natives; whereby it appears to be of two ſorts in general, <hi>viz.</hi> between thoſe of one State, and with Strangers. Now this difference is ſo eſſential, that each of them hath its contrary Maxims. Forreign Trade is exercis'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the truck or exchange of one Merchandize for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, (the tranſportation of Gold and Silver being prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Laws of the State, as alſo ſome Merchandizes, call'd Contre-band are) or in caſe the Forreign Merchants like not the permutation of commodities, they make their payment by Letters of Exchange, which was come to be taken up upon the prohibition of tranſporting money. On the contrary, Natives of the ſame Country commonly make all their Bargains for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, either ready or upon Credit till a ſet time. And as the Prince endeavours to promote and facilitate Trade amongſt his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for their accommodation, ſo he ought to be circumſpect to hinder Strangers from carrying away the Materials, and (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially unwrought) Commodities about which his own Subjects ſhould be employ'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:66371:150"/>The Second ſaid, That the dignity of Merchandize is prov'd from its Antiquity and Utility. As to the former, we read in Holy Writ of Iſmaelite Merchants, who bought <hi>Joſeph</hi> as they were going from <hi>Galaad</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> to Trade; and in the Poets of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> whom they feign to have voyag'd with his Ship <hi>Argos</hi> for conqueſt of the Golden Fleece, inſinuating thereby that Travelling and Trading by Sea and Land is the way to grow rich. As to the latter, all Arts would be unprofitable to men without diſtribution of their works, which is done by Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, whereby that becomes uſeful and known in one place, which was uſeleſs and unknown elſewhere; and the Proverb is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that every Land beareth not all things; ſince a Countrey of Trade abounds with every thing, and the four parts of the world are brought together by Commerce. 'Tis Merchandize that enricheth States, all which acknowledge Money; which ariſeth by it, the ſinew of War, and the key of all political En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes. 'Tis that which ſupplyes Princes with Metals, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, Marble, and other magnificences, whereby the ſplendor of their Perſons, Courts, and Palaces is advanc'd; and both in Peace and War 'tis the ſureſt foundation for Impoſitions, which maintain the expence of either. 'Tis that which ſupports the neceſſities of Souldiers, and ſupplyes them with proviſions both for war and ſuſtenance; whence among the Eaſtern Nations, the Pedlers and Victuallers are the moſt conſiderable Officers of their numerous Armies. In ſhort, Commerce affords Lawyers the ſubjects of their Pleadings, Sentences, and Arreſts; and not onely Sugar, Cinamon, Cloves, and other Spices for our Tables, but alſo moſt Drugs for Phyſick, as Rhubarb, Agarick, Sena, Caſſia, Tamarinds, Guaiacum, Muſk, Ambergreece, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is rare; beſides, Books to all theſe Profeſſions; and to God himſelf, Incenſe to perfume his Altars. Nor is this employment more profitable then delightful in reference to the variety of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, perſons, and things; a divertiſement which alone ſufficeth to induce Travellers to adventure the dangers which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them. As for the dignity of it, I ſhall onely adde to what hath been ſaid in a former Conference concerning the ſame, That they, who deſpiſe Merchandizing as if it had ſomething of baſe and abject in it, are more worthy of pity for their groſſe error, then of an anſwer. Do they know better wherein Dignity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts then thoſe ancient Roman Senators, who fraighted and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Trading Ships; the gain whereof was their beſt revenue? and are ſo many other States and Republick ever the leſs noble for Trading? Is there more honour in the idleneſs of a half Gentleman, who for want of other employment uſeth no other Trade in time of Peace but to aſſiſt one of his Neighbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another in a quarrel of his own making, then in the care and vigilance of a good Merchant which redounds to the benefit both of the publick and himſelf. Beſides, the diligent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant raiſes his Family, whereas the idle Gentleman deſtroyes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:66371:151"/>
his; being driven at laſt either to go in a pittiful garb, or elſe to be cloath'd upon the credit the Merchant gives him. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the duty of good Legiſlators to countenance what is moſt profitable to the State, and on the contrary to depreſs and expel whatever brings damage to the ſame. Methinks 'twere fit ſome new marks of eſteem were added to the eſſential honour of Merchandizing; as either Titles of Honour or Priviledges, which would invite the mindes of our youth to that good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, who are otherwiſe apt to be drawn aſide by popular error to looſeneſs and debauchery, and thereby commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from the way their predeceſſors trac'd out to them. Whence a Merchant that hath got a good eſtate, inſtead of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Son to ſucceed his Credit, lets it fall, and puts him to ſome new profeſſion, to which he was not born, as to the former.</p>
            <p>The Third alledg'd as an argument of the utility of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that Cities deſtitute of it can neither increaſe nor grow rich; whence the ſub-diviſion made of the eſtates of families ſoon impoveriſhes the Citizens, unleſs they ſupply that defect by their induſtry, as many rich Nations do. Thus <hi>England</hi> was for a long time enrich'd by the free trade it enjoy'd with all the neighbouring States, who were at Wars one with another. Thus moſt States of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Venice, Genua,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> have been augmented by Traffick. But no place more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets forth the excellent profit of Commerce then <hi>Holland,</hi> where, as their beſt Authors acknowledge, and experience ſhews the countrey, which almoſt their induſtry alone hath made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable, hath nothing but Trade and Commerce, whereby they have enricht it. For the Soil is not onely bad, as being almoſt all Sandy; or all Marſhy, eſpecially at <hi>Amſterdam</hi>; the water is unwholeſome, and the Air thick and noxious; not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Turffe firing, which fills the head with vapours. So that though they have all the elements contrary to them, yet they ſcruple not to diſpute the Sovereignty with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> having made War upon him for four and twenty years together with more gain then loſs: which they could not have done without the great treaſures they draw from Commerce.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That ſince Trade conſiſts in Negotiations, things ſold or exchang'd, and their value, the perſons muſt be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt that exerciſe it, the Commodity underſtood, and the price certain; otherwiſe 'tis not Trafficking, but meer cheating; whence of all forms of Juſtice, none ought to be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, and equitable, and conſcientious then that concerning Merchandizing, which would be no leſs ruin'd by falſe judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and long ſuits then by injury and open force. The way therefore to re-eſtabliſh Commerce is to re-eſtabliſh fair dealing, to remove frauds and ſophiſtication of commodities, whereby he, that thinks he buyes one thing, buyes another of worſe value; and above all, to fix and make immovable the ſtandard of current
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:66371:151"/>
money; for want whereof no man knows what he hath.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the firſt condition requiſite to Traffick, is the ſafety of wayes. The ſecond, that of payment, which is remitted to a ſet term. The Third, The capacity of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, which keeps him both from being deceived in the worth of Commodities, and in the ſorts of ready payment, though this kinde of payment be leſs us'd amongſt whole ſale Merchants, which is the true way of Merchandizing, that of Retail deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the name leſs, and being alwayes accounted more ſordid. Moreover, 'tis the former that enricheth States, ſupplying what they want, and carrying abroad what they abound with. 'Tis the nurſe of Arts and Manufactures, as appears in the Cities of <hi>Lions, Tours,</hi> and divers others, where ſome one Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant employes three or four hundred Artificers in Silk, Wool, and other ſuch works. Amongſt which Merchants thoſe that beſt know how to practiſe the Maxims of buying and ſelling cheaper then others, that is, who content themſelves with leaſt profit both in buying and ſelling, drive the greateſt trade, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently thrive moſt: whereas they that endeavour to grow rich in a day, diſcredit themſelves for the reſt of their lives. I think alſo 'twere fit to remedy the evil cuſtom of ſome who ſet ſo high a rate upon their Commodities, that they frighten thoſe that otherwiſe reſolv'd to buy, or elſe affront them with half the juſt price. And if after the manner of ſome Countreys, the prices of all wares were regulated, much more would be vented, and the time taken up in bargaining would be employ'd in other parts of Traffick, beſides that, by this means we might ſend even any childe for any commodity whatever; in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſet price and the aſſurance of not overbuying would make make cuſtomers buy the ſooner, their firſt conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being concerning what money the thing will coſt them: whereas now many forbear meerly out of ſhame to higgle and beat the bargain.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That indeed the ſole wealth of a State is Traffick, there being onely two ſorts of goods, moveable and immoveable. The latter increaſe and diminiſh onely by War, which is troubleſome means and a kinde of game, wherein he that wins one time loſes another: whereas moveables are us'd and conſum'd though they be of Iron: whence onely Traffick remains for increaſe: but 'tis not ſufficient to know the dignity and profit a thing brings; to put it well in practice, all its obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles muſt be remov'd; as in the firſt place the idleneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, which is natural to ſuch as live in a good Soil; whence the Proverb, <hi>Bona terra, Mala Gens.</hi> Yea, in ſome people, as in the Iriſh, 'tis contradicted by ill cuſtom; for that people being nouriſht in ſloathfulneſs, choſe rather to cover their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with a Mantle, then take the pains to cut it into Cloathes. Secondly, the want of Materials and Inſtruments proper for Trade, as Merchandizes, Ships, and other means: beſides the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66371:152"/>
defect of ſafe Ports. Thirdly, The danger of tranſportation by reaſon of Thieves at Land, and Pirates at Sea. Fourthly, the want of Companies, both for undertaking great negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for aſſurances, as 'tis in <hi>Holland</hi> and elſewhere, where they have found wayes to aſſure even the lives of perſons under good cautions. Fifthly, the falſe dealing of this age, directly oppoſite to the fair dealing of Merchants, which is incompatible with brangling. Laſtly, that great proceſs not yet ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Dantſickers, about the impoſt he would lay upon the Baltick Sea, ſhows apparently that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions alſo are a notable hinderance of Trade: All which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles and inconveniences may be thus remedy'd in <hi>France.</hi> The firſt needs not much to be ſpoken of, more French living by their induſtry in Forreign Countries then Forreigners here, which is a certain evidence that our Nation is none of the ſloathfulleſt. But 'twere to be wiſht that the Youth deſign'd to the honeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Merchandize were not leſs careful to learn the Map and the Countrey, then our Gentry is ſo for the war. Nor do I think the Tongues, eſpecially the Latin, leſs neceſſary for them then for Lawyers and Phyſicians; ſince theſe may in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity learn their Art in their own mother Tongue: But Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants cannot make themſelves underſtood in ſtrange Countreys but by the Latin Tongue, which ſerves to interpret all others; and for want of which 'tis in the power of an Interpreter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. Neither do we want wares that are both as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and as good as elſewhere, as Wheat, Wool, Hemp, and what ever is made thereof, as Cordage and Linen; Salt, Wood, and other ſuch things; much leſs materials to build and equippe Ships: and we have the beſt Havens of the world. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Robbers and Pyrates is much more conſiderable; but the former may be remedied in Cities, by an exact knowledg of all the Houſes in each Street; by many clear lights ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which will coſt leſs then Lanthorns, whereof there is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any benefit; by a Night-Watch plac'd in each Street, and by other means to be mention'd in due place. In the Countrey it may be redreſs'd, if Merchants Travel together in Caravans, and get the aſſiſtance of the Provoſts or Sheriffs, who are bound to ſecure the High-Wayes, and as well by Land as by Sea, by the erection of Companies.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh ſaid, That the only way indeed of improving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, is to eſtabliſh Companies. For both Nature and Art teach us, that as heavy burthens cannot be mov'd by little ſtrength; ſo Affairs of great importance, which need a great ſtock and attendance in ſeveral places, cannot be manag'd by one ſingle perſon; who alſo ſufficeth not alone to remedy ſoon enough the inconveniences foreſeen and unforeſeen, which neceſſarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in all enterpriſes. Whence the firſt loſs that befalls a ſolitary Merchant, dejects, and almoſt breaks him, becauſe he hath not where-with to recover himſelf; whereas in Companies, a loſs is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66371:152"/>
equally diſtributed, and more eaſily ſupported by all the Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates; amongſt whom, if the timorouſneſs of one propoſes the ſafeſt means, the Courage and Experience brings a Temperament thereunto; and ſeeing every one contributes his counſel no leſs than his endeavors in the common cauſe, it is in the leſs danger by reaſon of the many that mind it. Moreover, Companies are beſt able to ſolicite and procure the recovery of prizes unjuſtly taken at Sea, obtain Letters of Mart, and put them in execution. But as theſe Companies are abſolutely neceſſary, and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing States furniſh us Examples thereof; ſo care muſt be taken that they do not degenerate into Monopolies, and ſet exceſſive prizes upon Commodities.</p>
            <p>The Eighth ſaid, That beſide what hath been remark'd, the conjunction of Rivers ſo frequently propos'd and not yet execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (through want of Spirits conſtant enough to accompliſh their deſigns) would much facilitate Commerce; the tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Commodities ſucking up the main of the profit, by reaſon of the Exactions of Inns, which laugh at the regulated Rates of Proviſions, for want of an Eye to keep them up. All which might be remedied by an able Company, by appointing places of baiting and lodging for their Factors, to be kept by ſome of the Aſſociates, who being thereby intereſſed in ſome portion of the profit, would look more narrowly to the ſecurity of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; for want of which care, the moſt famous Meſſengers are often rob'd. It would be of great uſe alſo to have good and certain Intelligence of the Affairs of the world in general, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the inclining to ruine, delays and failings of Bankrupts, who oftentimes break in one place whilſt their Factors are taking up Commodities in others; as alſo of the beſieging and taking of Cities by an Enemy, or their danger of being ſo; in which Caſe the Merchant will haſten to with-draw his ſtock from thence, and hinder others from ſending thither to trade; there being no Sympathy between War and Merchandize. But above all, in this Occurrence 'tis neceſſary for him to know the certain prizes of the Commodity he intends to deal in: Which hath gain'd great Credit to this Aſſembly, by the printed Bills it hath ſometimes ſent abroad, containing the currant prizes of all Wares for every week, in imitation of the City of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> For by this means, the Merchant needs only diſcount the charges of tranſportation, and make a Reduction of Weights and Meaſures, to ſee his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent profit; yet alwayes carefully obſerving to draw a line with ſome imaginary ſumm for hazards and contingences which may happen unexpectedly; it being impoſſible, what-ever care be us'd, to regulate exactly the gain of Merchandize, as depending, partly, on Chance, and, partly, on the Will and Phanſie of Men; ſo that a Commodity, which, for being to day in faſhion, or otherwiſe in credit, would yield twenty in the hundred profit to the Owner, ſometimes leaves him a loſer, or he is forc'd to keep it long in his Ware-houſe.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXIX. What are the moſt common Cauſes of Law-ſuits; and why they are more now than heretofore.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PLato</hi> deſigning a Common-wealth, whoſe Citizens might live in good intelligence, juſtly excludes out of it the words of Mine and Thine; conceiving, that ſo long as there was any thing to be divided, there would ever be Male-contents; becauſe Self-love (the root from whence the too great deſire of keeping and acquiring ariſes) acts variouſly in Men; by main force and ſtrong hand in time of War, and in Peace by Law-ſuits. Now the deſire of Getting, having never been ſo great as at this day, nor ſo much countenanc'd and rewarded, (ſince in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of wealth moſt Offices are diſpos'd of) 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Law-ſuits be more numerous at this day than in times paſt.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Community of Goods, feign'd by the Poets, and exemplifi'd in the Primitive Church, (bating the Charity which produc'd it) would cauſe as many miſchiefs, and, conſequently, Law-ſuits, as there are at preſent. For every one would endeavour to appropriate what ſhould be common, and deſpiſe it if not able to compaſs it; as we ſee common Cauſes are neglected, and commonly loſt, for private intereſt. Whence appears the impertinence of ſome Legiſlators, and of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> who, that the Children might be lov'd the more, would have Wives common; for common Wives and Children would be own'd by no Body; and if ſuch Women as belong but to two or three, keep them alwayes in jealouſie, and many times ingage them in a Law-ſuit, what would thoſe do that belong'd to all the world? Wherefore, I conceive, that if contrary Effects have contrary Cauſes, 'tis Plenty, and its Daughter, Pride, that cauſeth Law-ſuits; and Poverty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility makes Peace and Agreements. Which the French <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> intimates, where he introduces an old man reconciling two Adverſaries, but 'tis after they are both undone. Thus alſo the Circle of Humane Life repreſents Labour holding Wealth by the Hand, Wealth holding Pride, Pride holding Contention, which cauſeth Poverty; this, Humility; which again produces Labour; that, Wealth; and ſo round again. For of fifty Law-ſuits, not one would begin between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (or at leaſt it would ſoon be determin'd) if either would humble themſelves as much one to the other, as they do to their Judges; yea, oftentimes to their Council. Wherefore Vanity being greater in this Age than ever it was, (although with leſs reaſon in moſt) 'tis no wonder if our times abound more with Law-ſuits than the former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:66371:153"/>The Third ſaid, That ſuch as are at their eaſe have no mind to Law-ſuits; and therefore 'tis not Plenty that begets them, but Neceſſity, yet not an abſolute one; for he that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cannot go to Law; but ſuch, that the one cannot pay what he owes, and the other cannot be without it: In every other Caſe, Accommodements are poſſible. 'Tis from this Source that ſo many Seiſures and Sentences proceed, which the indebted would never ſuffer, had they wherewithall to pay, conſidering that the whole charges muſt fall upon themſelves. Now as there were never ſo many rich, ſo there were never ſo many poor, as there are at this day in <hi>France</hi>; becauſe every body labours out of the vanity above-mention'd, to diſable themſelves every day more and more, laughing at the Conſtitutions which are made to reduce us to frugality, and aſcribing all inconveniences both publick and private to any other Cauſe but themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That though the Ages paſt having had the ſame viciſſitudes of Peace and War, and of Poverty and Riches, yet had they not ſo many Law-ſuits as there are at preſent; and therefore ſome other Cauſe thereof muſt be ſought, which poſſibly is this; That the Spirits of Men are become more refin'd and ſubtle in the ſeveral Ages of the world, and conſequently, advanc'd to a higher pitch of maliciouſneſs, whence many difficulties and conteſt ariſe in ſuch matters, wherein the goodneſs and ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Anceſtors found none at all. Nor hath the multitude and diverſity of Laws been a ſmall occaſion of this bad event. For (beſides the Roman Laws which lay long in oblivion, and were reſtor'd to light by <hi>Veruher,</hi> in the year 1127. and the Canons compil'd by <hi>Gratian,</hi> (whence came the judicial forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities) our Cuſtoms and our Ordinances; and amongſt others, thoſe made ſince <hi>Charls</hi> VIII. with long preambles and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in imitation of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> have ſtirr'd up more Law-ſuits, than there were in a thouſand years before. So that hath been good work for ſuch as were minded to draw profit thereby, to make ſo confus'd and intricate an Art of the Law, that there is almoſt no Caſe wherein they cannot find ſome trick to multiply a Suit, and render it immortal) Moral Reaſon (the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law) admits a thouſand different faces, not only in circumſtances of Fact, but alſo in matter of Law; whence there are few Laws but have their contraries.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the multiplicity of our Law-ſuits is to be attributed to the humor of the French Nation, which is deſirous of change, and naturally ſubtle and eloquent. Whence a Latine Poet ſtills <hi>France</hi> the Nurſe of Lawyers. Likewiſe the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning in this laſt Age, hath contributed much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And the ſight of great Eſtates gotten by the Law, hath induc'd many Parents to put their Children to that profeſſion, as the readieſt way to advancement. Such as could not be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, have been made Attornies, Solliciters, Sergeants, and this great number of people employ their inventions to get a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:66371:154"/>
livelyhood, which they cannot do without Law-ſuits. And therefore 'tis no wonder if they adviſe, continue, multiply, and eterniſe them as much as they can; egging on the Plaintiff by the motive of Profit, and the Defendant by that of Self-preſervation; and refuſing to the more ſimple their writings and other ſuch helps as might bring them to accord.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That Law-ſuits increaſe or diminiſh according to the diverſities of proportions kept in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. For ſome meaſure them by the Law of Nature, (whereby all Men are born equal) and proceed by Arithmetical Proportion. Thus the <hi>Medes</hi> turn'd Juſtice into Equality; whereas (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> told <hi>Cyrus,</hi> reproving him for awarding the coats to his Companions, according to their ſtature, and not according to the right and propriety) the <hi>Perſians</hi> made Juſtice equal. This Arithmetical Proportion was obſerv'd by <hi>Draco, Solon, Lycurgus,</hi> and all popular States; where every thing was put to the balance. Such alſo was the Law of Retaliation among the Jews; Eye for Eye, and Tooth for Tooth. But this equality having ſo many inconveniences, that many times the higheſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is the higheſt Injuſtice; <hi>Plato</hi> made Juſtice arbitrary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Laws but thoſe drawn from the proportion of the great to the ſmall, and other circumſtances, which he call'd Equity, or Geometrical Proportion. Yet this Juſtice being alſo too vagous, and left to the diſcretion of Magiſtrates, who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corruption; therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> choſe a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Extreams, regulating Commutative Juſtice, which judgeth of the right of private Men by Arithmetical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and Diſtributive, which is for publick Affairs, by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Proportion. And our uſage hath approv'd an Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical proportion; the Supream Magiſtrate uſing both Law and Equity, and tempering the too great ſtrictneſs of the former, and the much liberty of the other; which courſe is obſerv'd in good Monarchies, where the Chief Courts being above the Law, and yet having Equity in their Power, make an agreeable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of Juſtice with Reaſon, being impower'd to reverſe the Sentences of Subordinate Judges, who are ty'd to the Letter of the Law; as the Royal Authority is above both. Whence it reſults, that there are few Law-ſuits where Arithmetical Juſtice, that is, the inflexible rigor of the Law is exercis'd; ſomewhat more, where Geometrical Proportion hath place, becauſe 'tis requiſite to uſe Reaſons; which being alwayes the ſame, cannot be alter'd, as it happens in Harmonical Proportion, in which the point of right (which is indiviſible in it ſelf) being variouſly balanc'd between Law and Equity, and drawn from each ſide according to the intereſt of the parties, the Deciſions of ſome Caſes cannot be wholly ſuted to others, by reaſon of the diverſity of circumſtances. But as Diametrical Proportions having no connexion of their quantities together, though they quiet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conteſts, yet they cauſe a dangerous reflux into the body
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:66371:154"/>
of the State, by the indignation of the Nobles againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, and the People's Envy againſt the Nobility; ſo Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical Proportion, ſuch as ours, is much more prejudicial to private perſons, which it entertains in Suits, than to the State, wherein it employes turbulent Spirits to diſcharge their Choler upon paper againſt their Adverſaries. But in Anſwer to the Queſtion, Why we have more Law-ſuits now-a-days than formerly, I believe the Reaſon is, becauſe the common-people have got too much Knowledg of the Laws and Statutes, and Legal Pleadings; for whilſt theſe remain'd in Latin and were not underſtood, Men were not ſo apt to commence Litigious Suits one againſt another.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXX. Whether more hurt or good hath proceeded from ſharing the parts of Phyſick between Phyſitians, Apothecaries, and Chirurgions.</head>
            <p>THis Queſtion being of the greateſt moment of any that hath been diſcuſs'd in this Company, requireth alſo moſt caution; becauſe there is none of us knows how ſoon he may come to be at the Mercy of ſome one of that Profeſſion which his Sentence ſhall diſoblige. Now all the parts of Phyſick were practis'd of old by one perſon; yea, in <hi>Aegypt</hi> it was no ſet Profeſſion, but the Prieſts of <hi>Memphis</hi> were bound to write in the Temples of <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Iſis</hi> ſuch Remedies as any Man came and declar'd to them, that himſelf had found benefit by; to the end others might uſe the ſame. So likewiſe the Greeks writ in Parchment, and hung at the Porch of the Temples of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> thoſe Receipts that had cur'd them; which the Prieſts took from thence to pronounce to others, as if they had been Oracles; authorizing Medicine by Religion. Afterwards, this Science augmenting by degrees, (as all things do) ſome were found that reduc'd thoſe Experiences to an Art; the ancienteſt of whom was <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> the Son of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Ariadne,</hi> to whom in time ſuceeded another <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> the third of that name; who (as <hi>Cicero, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Natur. Deor.</hi>) was the firſt Tooth-drawer, and undertook firſt to looſen the belly, leaving for his Succeſſors his Children, <hi>Podalirius</hi> and <hi>Machaon,</hi> who were at the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> the former of whom profeſs'd the curing of Inward Diſeaſes, the other of Outward by manual operation; from which time, the Art of Phyſick began to be divided into Pharmacy and Chirurgery, which were practis'd joyntly by <hi>Chiron,</hi> who took his Name from the dexterity of his hand in operations, and was feign'd a Centaure, becauſe he was always on Horſe-back to relieve remote Patients. And for that the operations of Chirurgery are more apparent than thoſe of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:66371:155"/>
other parts of Phyſick; <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that the ancient Phyſick was only Chirurgery. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who firſt ſpoke worthily of Medicinal Matters, exercis'd the three parts of Phyſick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly; and ſo it was practis'd till <hi>Galen</hi>'s time, to wit, 600. years after. Moreover, 'Tis an Argument, That Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery was exercis'd by the Phyſicians, That they were expell'd <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe one of them had cut off a Roman Citizen's leg with bad ſucceſs. So alſo <hi>Darius</hi>'s foot diſlocated by a fall from his Horſe, and reſtor'd by <hi>Democedes</hi> a Crotonian Phyſician, then his Priſoner at <hi>Sardis,</hi> (after the vain attempts of his Aegyptian Phyſician) and is an evidence that he was both a Chirurgion and a Phyſician. But ſince, Phyſicians have done like the heirs of Merchants, they have thought fit to avoid the pains, and enjoy both the honor and the profit; they have reſerv'd ſolely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the authority and power of preſcribing, and left to the Apothecarie's honeſty and ſkill, the choice, diſpenſation, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and compoſition of medicaments; and to the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all manual operations: Nay, many of theſe too, out of heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, have left to Barbers and Stews-keepers the Art of trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hair; to others, the dexterity of drawing Teeth; and again, to others the Reduction of Luxations and Fractures; all Appendances of Phyſick. Now to determine, Whether this Diviſion hath done more good or hurt, ſeems to me to depend upon the capacity of thoſe employ'd in this Art.. For if the Phyſician hath not ſkill enough, or ſtrength of Body to attend all thoſe functions, he ought not to undertake them. But he that judges himſelf able to diſcharge them all, will be very heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when he ſees the whole honor or blame muſt fall to himſelf alone; whereas the diviſion of ſucceſs amongſt many, makes each perſon more negligent: Beſides that, every one can anſwer better for his own deed, than for another's; and agrees better with himſelf, than with a ſecond or third; between whom 'tis ſeldom but ſome Claſh happens, and that to the detriment of the Patient. Laſtly, the Phyſician repreſents the Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the Chirurgion the Animal, and the Apothecary the tal; ſo that to divide them, is as much as to ſeparate the Liver, Heart, and Brain of one and the ſame Man; and Theory being never well underſtood without practice, 'tis no wonder if their diſ-union hath occaſion'd the ſetting up many Ignorants and Empericks.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, If Man's Life be ſhort, in reſpect of the Art of Phyſick (according to the ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Prince thereof) then 'tis the way to ſhorten it more, even by two thirds, to aſſign it three Arts and Exerciſes, each of which requires the whole Man. The Egyptians were of another Judgment, not only diſtinguiſhing Phyſicians from Operators and Preparers of Medicaments, but alſo having particular Phyſicians for each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of Man; as for the Eye, Ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which render them more expert; becauſe we do nothing well, but what we
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66371:155"/>
do often; and what difference there is between one that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes more Arts, and him that is contented with one, appears by comparing Country-Apothecaries and Chirurgians, who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all three parts of Phyſick, and thoſe of great Cities. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the alliance between the Body and the Soul is ſuch, that while the one is employ'd about ſome work, the other cannot intend its cogitations elſe-where, as it ought to do in this Caſe. And therefore to require a Phyſician to let blood, ſet a bone, or prepare a medicine, is all one as to expect that a General ſhould both give Orders, and perform the Office of a common Souldier. For if the Mind that is at reſt be eſteem'd the more wiſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reaſoning, (whence our Judges ſit, Phyſicians conſult, and the Greeks would have adoration perform'd in that poſture) what good advice can be expected from a Phyſician who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways out of breath with his preparations and operations? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis not ſeemly for a Phyſician to viſit his Patient with his Hands ſmelling and dy'd with drugs, and the confidence of the Patient in him being much conducive to the Cure, it cannot but be better truſting to three perſons than to one. And indeed, ſuppoſing a Phyſician were ſo wicked as to have ill intentions againſt his Patient's Life, (which yet is hard to imagine, and there are very few Examples of ſuch) it would be harder for him to execute them when others prepare his remedies, than when he prepares them himſelf. As likewiſe the Apothecary may play the Villain more ſecurely, when he hath not the inſpection of the Phyſician over him. Wherefore 'tis beſt that Phyſick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main diſtributed into three Profeſſions, which, like an Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trade, aſſiſt and uphold each other; the Phyſician being as the Head, and the other two as his two Hands. All the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, is, that this Harmony and Proportion be ſo well obſerv'd, that the Hands think not themſelves to be the Head; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but too frequently, to the great diſhonor of Phyſick, and damage of the ſick.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXI. Whether there be any Real Evil beſides Pain.</head>
            <p>THings have either an abſolute Eſſence, or a Relative; the former are Real, as to be a Man; the latter which have no Being but from the Reſpect they have to our Phanſie, depend upon the ſame, as to be glad or troubled at certain News. Theſe two Heads contain all Entities; but becauſe the weakneſs of Humane Judgement often confounds them, taking an imaginary thing for a real, hence the inquiſition of their difference hath furniſh'd the Schools with various Queſtions. That of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> was ſo far from admitting any other Real Evil beſides Pain, that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:66371:156"/>
it allow'd not Pain it ſelf to be an Evil. On the contrary, <hi>Epicurus</hi> held, there was no other Evil but Pain; nor any other Good but Pleaſure, its oppoſite. Indeed by adjoyning Vertue to that Pleaſure, and aſſigning the pre-eminence to the pleaſure of the Mind, it will be eaſie to make Good and Pleaſure conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: whence it will alſo follow that Evil and Pain muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Evil being the Privation of Good, and Privation no real Entity; to enquire whether there be any real Evil, is the ſame as to aſk whether a Privation be a Habit. But to comply with the terms of the Queſtion, which ſeems to be, Whether there be any other ſufferings of that kind which the Vulgar calls Evils, cauſing ſenſible diſpleaſure in us as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily as bodily Pain doth? In anſwer whereunto, I ſay; Firſt that there is both a ſpiritual and a corporeal grief or pain; of either of which ſome perſons are more or leſs ſenſible then others. Secondly, That all people deſire pleaſure as a good, and ſhun pain as an evil (for even the inflictions of ſome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons upon themſelves, are done in hope of a future good) and laſtly, that both the one and the other are excited by ſeveral and oft-times contrary ways and means. For as the bitterneſs of Succhory, hurts and diſpleaſes ſome but is agreeable to others; ſo alſo the ſame accident may cauſe pleaſure in ſome minds and ſadneſs in others; this variety proceeding from the different temper of Minds. Beſides, corporeal and ſpiritual pain differ, in that every one is a capable judge of the former, but not of the latter; whence, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, all run after pleaſures of the Body, becauſe they ignore thoſe of the Soul; and ſo likewiſe moſt only reckon their bodily pains true Evils, becauſe they have no experience of griefs of the Mind. But he that well weighs how infinitely the Intellect excels the Body, eaſily finds that the evils that attaque the ſame are alſo far greater; ſince 'tis that by which the Body is render'd ſuſceptible both of pain and pleaſure, and receives impreſſions of both upon the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; wherein particularly the Eye is term'd the Mirror of the Soul, for no other reaſon but becauſe it repreſents her Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Affections. And to ſhew how much grief and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Mind ſurpaſſeth that of the Body, we ſee ſome redeem the loſs of their Honour with that of their Lives, which cannot be without ſuffering the pain of death.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, 'Tis not the Queſtion, whether the griefs of the Body or the Mind be greateſt ſince every one judges vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thereof according to his humor. As the Miſer prefers his profit before the pains of Hunger and Thirſt; and the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon ventures his life in the Field rather than endure the Lye. But the Queſtion is, Whether there be any reality in the Evils which the Mind of man undergoes beſides Pain, of which alone we ſee all other Animals are ſenſible, Nature teaching Man thereby that ſhe hath left it to his own conduct, how much
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:66371:156"/>
his natural condition is worſe then theirs, whilſt he is not only lyable to the ſame bodily evils, but becomes ingenious to his own hurt, and an expert Artificer of his own bad fortune. An inſtance whereof we have in the Swine that was eating his food peaceably in a Tempeſt, whilſt all the Paſſengers fearing every moment to ſplit againſt the Rocks, dy'd as often of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as they thought of that ſad fate. Which fear ended with the Swine's meat, and the Ship's arrival at a ſafe Port; where it appear'd that that vile Animal had felt none of that trouble which the Tempeſt had caus'd in the more unhappy men; and conſequently that their Imagination was the ſole cauſe of it. The like may be ſaid of all other afflictions which men give themſelves, call'd therefore deſervedly by the Wiſe-man, <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vexations of ſpirit.</hi> For moſt of the inductions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which the Mind draws from events prove falſe, and nevertheleſs they give us real ſorrows; we ſee frequently that a great Eſtate left by a Father to his Children makes them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and worthleſs, and degenerate from the vertue of their Parent, who having receiv'd no inheritance from his own was conſtrain'd to labour, and by that means attain'd Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Whence it appears that the trouble of a Father leaving a ſmall Eſtate to his Children at his death hath no foundation in the thing but only in his abus'd Imagination, and conſequently cannot be a real Evil, and yet this is the moſt general Evil of all with the Vulgar. Thus two men, lodging under the ſame roof loſt both their Wives not long ago: one of them was ſo afflicted therewith that he dy'd of ſorrow; the other receiving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory viſits of his friends, could not ſo well diſſemble his joy but that it was perceiv'd; and yet their loſs was equal. So that the ſadneſs of the one, and the joy of the other depended only upon the different reflection they made upon this accident. Thus alſo the ſame affront that made one of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Diſciples draw his ſword, made the Philoſopher himſelf laugh at the ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs of his enemy: and every thing which the Vulgar calls Good or Evil, (Pain excepted) is a Medal, which hath its right ſide and its reverſe.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXII. Whether Man be the moſt diſeas'd of all Creatures, and why?</head>
            <p>A Diſeaſe being a preternatural diſpoſition hurting the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, every living Body capable of action may become ſick by ſome cauſe impeding its actions. Hence not only Men but alſo Animals, and even Plants have their Diſeaſes, which
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:66371:157"/>
               <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> diligently deſcribes. Amongſt Beaſts, though ſome are ſubject to particular Diſeaſes, as the Dog to Madneſs, the Swine to Leproſie, the Goat and Lyon to Fevers; yet there is none ſo invaded with all ſorts of Maladies as Man, who is not exempt from any; the leaſt of his ſimilary parts that is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd being ſubject to twelve ſorts of Diſeaſes, namely, when they attract their aliment, either not at all, or but weakly, or otherwiſe then they ſhould, or when they are defective either in retaining or concocting it, or in voiding ſuperfluities. But if ſuch part have ſenſe too, it may have fifteen; if motion alſo, eighteen: And if it not only be nouriſh'd it ſelf but labours alſo for the publick, 'tis lyable to twelve more, according to the three ways that its Functions may be offended, in attraction, retention, concoction and expulſion. The Eye alone is ſubject to almoſt 200 infirmities; and, as if there were not ancient Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes enough, we ſee daily new ones unknown to former Ages. Now the reaſon hereof lyes in the nature of Man, who being the moſt perfectly temper'd and beſt compounded of all Animals (becauſe deſign'd to the greateſt actions) is therefore apt upon the leaſt occaſion to loſe that evenneſs of proportion, which as it requires a great train and concurrence of many things, ſo alſo there needs but a little thing to ſubvert it by defect of the leaſt of thoſe requiſites. Indeed, there are but two cauſes of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, to wit, Internal and External; and man is alike ſubject to both; to the former, by reaſon of his hot and moiſt temper which is prone to putrefaction, and the more upon account of his variety of Food; whereas other Animals never change their Diet; which is the moſt probable cauſe of their health and good conſtitution: For diverſity of aliments incommodes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, weakens the natural heat, produces Crudities, the Sources of moſt Diſeaſes; which alſo are frequently caus'd in Men by the internal Paſſions of Anger, Fear, and Joy. The moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary external cauſes are the evil qualities of the Air, peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial vapours and malignant influences, whereof Man's body is the more ſuſceptible, by reaſon of the tenderneſs of his Fleſh, and the poroſity of his ſkin; which on the contrary, in other Animals, is hard and cover'd with Hair, Feathers and Scales, and renders them leſs ſubject to the impreſſions of external bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as alſo to Wounds, Contuſions, Fractures, and other ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of continuity.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That ſuch perfections or defects of things as we know moſt exactly, ſeem to us the greateſt; as the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences and defects of Pictures are not well obſerv'd but by thoſe that are ſkill'd therein; and he that is unacquainted with ſome certain Nation cannot know its Vices ſo as they that converſe with it do. Now Beaſts being unable to ſignifie to us the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of their pains and the other circumſtances of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, hence we judge them to have fewer, although the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears in the Horſe, in whom obſervant Farriers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:66371:157"/>
a great number of Diſeaſes, to which we are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. So that other Animals may have as many, or more than Men, who being leſs concern'd therein, leſs underſtand them. 'Tis true, the parts of Animals reſemble ours, ſaving what ſerve to diſtinguiſh their outward ſhape; as appears by the Diſſection of Apes, whereby <hi>Galen</hi> learnt Anatomy; and no difference is found between the Ventricles of a Man's and a Calfe's brain. If their blood and other humors differ, ſo do thoſe of one Man from thoſe of another. Moreover, Beaſts have the ſame inward Cauſes, Fear, Anger, and the other Paſſions; in ſhort, all the other Non-natural things, and not at their diſcretion as Man hath. If a Dog hath the harder ſkin, yet man is leſs lyable to blows, and the injury of the Air. In fine, who knows but it may be with theſe Animals as 'tis with ruſticks, who, though Men as well as we, and ſubject to the ſame inconveniences, yet all their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are reduc'd to a few Heads; ſince the true and ſpurious Pleuriſie, the Aſthma, the Cough, the Palſie, and other Maladies, whereof we make ſo many branches, are all reckon'd by them only for a hot or a cold Rheume.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, The nearer Nature promotes Bodies to their utmoſt perfection, the more frail ſhe renders them. And as in Mixts, Glaſs, which is her utmoſt atchievement, is weaker and brittler than Stones; ſo in Animals, Man the moſt excellent and perfect, is the moſt frail and weak, by reaſon of the part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he abounds more than they, and which advances him, to wit, the Brain, the root of moſt Diſeaſes. And as the moſt nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Meteors, are form'd in the coldeſt Region of the Air, ſo thoſe that have a moiſt Brain are ſoft and leſs vigorous, as Women and Children; whence amongſt the old <hi>Spartans,</hi> and at this day amongſt the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> (as <hi>Alvarez</hi> reports) 'tis a ſhame to blow the Noſe or ſpit, becauſe it ſignifies Effeminacy; and the <hi>Thracians,</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> records) freed themſelves from many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, by cutting the Nerves behind the Ear, whereby all fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Brain were ſtopt. On the contrary, Animals having a dry and leſs Brain, ſleep in the open Air without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That as Man exerciſes the greateſt variety of Actions, ſo he is liable to moſt Diſeaſes. Animals which reaſon not, have no <hi>Delirium</hi>; thoſe that ſpeak not, are not ſubject to be dumb. But the truth is, Men conſider not remote things fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their intereſt reaches. Hence more Diſeaſes are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Bee and Silk-worm, than in the Elephant. Unleſs we had rather ſay, that there being ſo great a variety of diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tempers requir'd to the Health of all the parts, humors, and faculties of a humane body, it happens very rarely that they are all as they ſhould be. As 'tis harder to make good Muſick with a Lute, or other many ſtring'd Inſtruments, than with one that hath fewer ſtrings and accords, as Animals have in reſpect of Man.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXIII. Of the Greenneſs of Plants.</head>
            <p>COlours being the illuminated ſurface of Mixt Bodies, alter according to their various mixture; and becauſe the leſs a body is diſtant from its ſimplicity, it partakes the more of light; hence as ſoon as water becomes conſiſtent and ſolid, it puts on Whiteneſs, which is ſo near akin to Light, that the latter cannot be painted but with the former. For this reaſon new-ſprung Plants, iſſuing out of the Womb of their Elements, retain a White Colour; till having thruſt their ſtem out of the Earth, the nouriſhment they attract adding to their compoſition, they aſſume a new Colour, which ſutably to the Temper of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, (whoſe upper part is heated by the Sun-beans, and lower part nouriſh'd with the juice and vapors of the Earth) becomes Green, upon the ſame reaſon that Blew and Yellow make a Green; the Blew proceeding from condens'd Moiſture, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in deep Seas) and the Yellow from the Sun-beams. Hence a Plant depriv'd of the Sun's aſpect, looſeth its verdure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Colour-leſs by the privation, which is always Harbinger to ſome enſuing Generation, it appears white; as we uſe to make Succhory and Thiſtles white by burying them, or covering them in a Veſſel whereinto no Air can enter. Greenneſs therefore is the firſt mixture of the Sun-beams with corrupted humidity, (as putrid waters wax green) and the firſt aſſay of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Soul, and conſequently, an evidence of their Life; as, on the contrary, Yellowneſs ſhews that the Sun hath dry'd up the humidity wherein the life reſided, and left only the Colour of Feüille-morte. But when this humidity is ſo unctuous and adherent to the compact and ſolid body of a Plant that it cannot be exhal'd, (as Oyle is not evaporated by the Sun) than the outward Cold ſhutting the Pores, retains the Greenneſs longer and brighter, whilſt other Herbs and Trees are deſpoil'd of their verdure. And therefore 'tis no wonder if the leavs of ſuch Plants, as the Laurel, Holly, Box, Ivy, and many others, feel no injury from great Cold and great Heat.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the production of Vegetables proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the reſolution of Minerals, (as appears, not only in the order of Generations, which proceed from ſimple to organick bodies, but alſo in the ſympathy of the Oak with Copper, of the Beech with the Load-ſtone, of the Hazel with Gold and Silver) 'tis probable that Vitriol, (the commoneſt of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and found in moſt grounds) gives Plants their Verdure; which many of them alſo teſtifie by their acidity. For I cannot attribute the Cauſe to Light, which is indifferent to all Colours, and hath none in it ſelf; the Gold Colour of the Sun not inhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:66371:158"/>
in him, but proceeding from the reflexion of bodies he irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates. But if we are to find ſome mixture of Yellow and Blew to make this Green, I ſhould rather aſſign the Yellow to the Earth, which is moſt commonly of that Colour; as the Air and Heaven are Blew. And perhaps too, this Greenneſs is but a ſign of imperfect Generation, ſince 'tis loſt when Plants are mature; and we find it again in mouldy Bread, which is in a tendency to corruption.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That all Bodies muſt have ſome Colour or other, and a Plant being the firſt living thing, ought to have the moſt agreeable, as being equally temper'd of the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, Black and White; for at its firſt iſſuing out of the Earth, whilſt it is yet full of earthy humidity, it is of a dark Green, which becomes lighter as the Plant ſhoots higher; till at length the more volatile particles are excluded in a Flower which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows its Colour from the various qualities of the ſap; then comes out the fruit, which keeps its verdure till the Sun have fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted its juice.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That 'tis not poſſible to give the reaſon of Colours, ſince we ſee Tulips change theirs almoſt every year; and there are Black, White, Red, and other colour'd grapes, equally ſweet, and good for Wine; as alſo Apples, Pears, and other fruit. Nor is Greenneſs inſeparable from the leavs of Plants; for we have not only red Coleworts, but alſo Roots, and ſome leavs of Rapes, Purple, Violet, and of other Colours. All that can be ſaid in this matter, is, That Colour is nothing but a reſultance of the External Light from the Surface, whoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are ſo, or ſo modifi'd and poſited. Hence Blew appears Green by Candle-light; the necks of Doves ſeem of divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours by diverſity of ſituation; and Wool appears whiter when compacted together, than whilſt it was in flocks; whereas Water, which hath no Colour, ſhews white when Particles are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Air, and reduc'd into Snow. So alſo when Humidity is digeſted by Heat, (which is inſeparable from Light) it puts on the firſt of Colours, which is Blew; (of which Colour thickned Air appears to us) and the prodominant earthineſs of Plants, makes that Blew incline to a darker degree, thence ariſeth Green; which is the general Colour of all Plants. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament contributes leaſt to this Colour; for we ſee <hi>Semper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivum,</hi> which is cold, of the ſame Colour with Leeks and the Aloë-Plant, which are Hot. Juſt as Sugar and Salt are both White, and yet differ much in Taſte and other qualities; ſo are Chalk and Snow; Honey and Gall are Yellow, the juice of Aloes and that of Liquerice black. Yea, in Animals too, the diverſity of their Colour, Hair, and Plumes is deceitful; whence came the Proverb, Of every Hair a good Grey-hound. And whereas Phyſicians reckon the Colour of the Hair a ſign of the Temper, 'tis not always true; ſince we ſee perſons of the ſame Hair totally different in Manners and Humors; and others of different Hair,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:66371:159"/>
perfectly agreeing in temper; wherein conſequently we muſt not ſeek the reaſon of colours.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXIV. Of the Cold of the middle Region of the Air.</head>
            <p>THe common Opinion attributes the coldneſs of the middle Region to the Antiperiſtaſis of the heat of the upper and lower Regions, which ſtreightning the cold on either ſide leave it no other place but the middle, whither the vapors rais'd by the Sun-beams aſcending, and no higher by reaſon of their weight and the thinneſs of the air there; it comes to paſs that the neighbourhood of theſe vapors returning to their natural cold, encreaſes that of the middle Region. But many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences invalidate this Opinion. Firſt, if this Element were hot and moiſt, as is ſuppos'd, it would ſhew ſome effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but 'tis quite contrary. For he were a fool that ſhould go into the Air to warm himſelf; and the Air hath ſo little humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it dries all Bodies. Secondly, many Mountains ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the middle Region of the Air, and retaining figures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the aſhes of a Sacrifice for a whole year, which ſhew that in all that time no Wind or Rain was rais'd there to deface them; it would follow that ſuch Mountains reflecting the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams by their ſolidity, ſhould cauſe heat in the middle Region of the Air, and yet they are commonly cover'd with Snow. Laſtly, this Antiperiſtaſis being only in Summer, not in Winter when the cold of the lower Region ſymboliſes with that of the middle, this reaſon ſhould then ceaſe; and yet 'tis in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that cold Meteors manifeſt themſelves. Wherefore we muſt recur to ſome other cauſe; which <hi>Cardan</hi> takes to be the natural coldneſs of the Air, not regarding the combination of the four firſt qualities. For if cold be natural to the Air, it will be eaſie to conclude, that it muſt be coldeſt in the middle, which is leſs alter'd by the contrary quality of heat; being moſt diſtant from the Element of Fire (if there be any) and from the heat which neceſſarily follows the motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sphears.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Cold being no poſitive Quality, but a bare negation, it follows that Bodies deſtitute of Heat are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily cold. Now the Air cannot have heat or any other quality, becauſe 'tis to ſerve for a medium not only to all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Bodies, but alſo to the heavenly influences, whoſe nature would be perverted and alter'd by the qualities of the Air; as a colour'd medium imparts its colours to objects. It happens therefore that vapours cool not but are cooled by the Air, ſo that they become colder in the middle Region then whilſt they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66371:159"/>
were in their natural ſeats. Yea they are ſo far from rendring the Air cold that they abate its ſharpneſs, which is never great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then in clear weather; cloudy and miſty weather being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more warm and accompany'd with leſs piercing cold. For being rais'd rather by the ſubterraneous heat then by that of the Sun, they warm our air (which reaches not above a league from the Earth); then being gradually deſerted by the heat which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd them up they meet in thoſe higher ſpaces which are void of all heat, and begin immediately to condenſe and congeal them. What people talk of the higher Region of the Air is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe the Element of Fire being but an Opinion cannot counter-balance the report of <hi>Acoſta,</hi> who affirms that divers Spaniards were kill'd by the cold in their paſſage upon the Mountains of <hi>Peru</hi> which he judges the higheſt of the World and within the upper region.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That if we were to be try'd by experience alone, the Earth (which in Winter is hot at the Centre, and in Summer on its Surface) would not be judg'd cold and dry (as it is) no more then the Water always cold and moiſt, ſince the Sun's heat warms it, and the ſaltneſs of the Sea renders it heating and drying. But accidental qualities muſt be carefully diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from eſſential; becauſe theſe latter are hard to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd when any impediment interpoſes. As the ſight cannot judge of the ſtraitneſs of the ſtick in the water but by having recourſe to reaſon; which teaches us that all light Elements are alſo hot. Now the lightneſs of the air is indiſputable; and its heat is prov'd by its ſubtlety, whereby it penetrates bodies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable by light it ſelf. Yet this heat is eaſily turn'd into cold; becauſe the air being a tenuious body and not compact, retains its qualities no longer then they are maintain'd therein by their ordinary cauſes. So that 'tis no wonder if not being hot in the higheſt degree (as Fire is) but in a remiſs and inferior degree, it eaſily becomes ſuſceptible of a more powerful contrary quality. For the Sun-beams, which ſome hold to be the true Element of Fire, heat not unleſs they be united by reflection; and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection being limited cannot reach beyond our firſt Region; the higher Regions muſt neceſſarily remain cold; unleſs upon further inquiry it be thought that the motion of the air carry'd about with the Sphear of the Moon and the Element of Fire plac'd under the ſame, are capable to heat it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That if we may judge of thoſe higher Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Air by thoſe of the Earth and Water which we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, each of theſe Elements hath three ſenſible differences; its Surface, Middle and Centre. Thoſe that frequent Mines, tell us that the heat which ſucceeds the exterior cold of our earth penetrates not above a quarter of a league in depth; about the end of which ſpace, cold begins to be felt again, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes more and more towards the Centre. In like manner 'tis probable that the Water follows the qualities as well as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:66371:160"/>
of the Earth. That it is hot at the bottom (whither therefore the Fiſh retire in Winter) proceeds from the nearneſs of that middle Region of the Earth. So that it being proper to theſe Elements to have different qualities in their middle from thoſe of their extremities, the ſame may be true alſo of the Air; poſſibly becauſe a perfect identity of temperature would not have been convenient for the generation of Mixts, to which end all the Elements were deſtinated. And it being the property of cold to cloſe and re-unite the looſeneſs and diſſipation of the Air, it was therefore highly neceſſary to be predominant in the middle Region thereof.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXV. Of the Generation of Males and Females.</head>
            <p>DIſtinction of Sex is not eſſential, but conſiſts only in the parts ſerving to Generation; Nevertheleſs <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes Male and Female differ, as Perfect and Imperfect; and ſaith, That Nature's intention is always to make a Male; and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the default of ſome requiſite condition ſhe produces a Female, whom therefore he calls a Miſtake of Nature, or a Monſter. <hi>Galen</hi> likewiſe acknowledging no other difference ſtyles Man a Woman turn'd outwards, becauſe Woman hath the ſame Organs with Man, only wants heat and ſtrength to put them forth. Now indeed this heat and ſtrength is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly greater in Males then Females even from the firſt concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the former are compleatly form'd by the 30th day, the latter not before the 40th; the former move in the third moneth, the latter not till the fourth; thoſe are born in the ninth moneth, theſe ſome days after; and beſides live not if born in the ſeventh moneth, as Males do, whoſe periods are therefore reckon'd by Septenaries, and thoſe of Females by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venaries. After birth, we ſee the actions of Males are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with more ſtrength and vigor then thoſe of Females, who are actually colder and ſuffer more inconveniences from cold. They are never ambidexters, becauſe they have not heat enough to ſupply agility to both ſides; and their right ſide is peculiarly deſtinated to the Generation of Females, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spermatick Veſſel on that ſide derives blood from the hollow Vein which is hotteſt by reaſon of the proximity of that Vein to the Liver; whereas the left Spermatick draws from the Emulgent, which carrying Seroſe humors together with the Blood, 'tis no wonder if the Seed of that ſide be crude and cold, and conſequently fitter for generating Femals then Males: Hence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, that if as Peaſants tye a Bull's left Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle when they deſire a Bull-calf, and the right when a Cow-calf,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66371:160"/>
the ſame be practis'd by Man, the like effect will follow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis manifeſt that whatever makes the Seed more hot and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous both in Male and Female, furthers the Generation of Males, and contrarily; and conſequently that the Morning, when 'tis beſt concocted, is more proper then the Evening, for begetting Boys; and the Winter then the Summer (at leaſt on the man's part.)</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That as to the production of Males rather then Females, or on the contrary, no certain cauſe hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been aſſign'd thereof; ſince we ſee that the ſame man, in all likelihood without alteration of his temper, hath only Girles by his firſt Wife, and only Boys by the ſecond, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and ſome that could get no Children at all in their youth have had only Boys in their old Age. Others have Males firſt, others Females, and others have them alternatively. Whereof no other reaſon can be aſſign'd by Chance, or rather the Divine Pleaſure alone, in the impenetrable Secrets whereof to ſeek for a cauſe, were high temerity. If heat and ſtrength caus'd the difference, young marry'd people would not have Girles firſt, as it happens moſt often; and decrepit old men ſhould never get Boys, as daily experience ſhews they do. Moreover, ſome men depriv'd of one of their Teſticles, have nevertheleſs begotten both Sons and Daughters; which could not be, if the faculty of begetting Children of one determinate Sex were affix'd to either of thoſe parts. And as from a falſe Principle nothing can be drawn but falſe Conſequences, ſo alſo is it in the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That Woman is but an occaſional Creature. For then Nature ſhould produce far greater abundance of Males then of Females, or elſe ſhe would erre oftner then hit right (which is inconſiſtent with her wiſdom), and yet in all places more Girles and Women are found then Men; as appears in that we every where ſee plenty of Maids that want Huſbands, and in Countries wherein Polygamy is lawful, there are Women enough to ſupply ten or a dozen Wives to each Man. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Nature's deſign is mainly for preſerving the Species; as that of every individual is to preſerve it ſelf; and the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat or cold in the Seed being but an accident of an accident cannot effect a formal change in the ſubſtance. Only defective heat may occaſion an effeminate man, and abundant heat a Virago. Beſides this Opinion deſtroys the common and true one, <hi>viz.</hi> That Generation is one of thoſe actions which proceeds from a juſt proportion and temperature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; whence exceſſive or feveriſh heat deſtroys the Seed in ſtead of furthering Generation, and is an enemy to all the other functions. Wherefore 'tis beſt to ſay that the ſame difference which is obſerv'd between the Seeds of Plants, is alſo found in that of Animals, though not diſcernable therein but by the effects: and as the exacteſt prying cannot obſerve in the kernel of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond or Pine any difference of the Trunk, Leaves and Fruit
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66371:161"/>
of thoſe Trees, although theſe parts be <hi>potentially</hi> contain'd therein, ſo alſo the Seed of an Animal contains in it ſelf even the leaſt differences of Sex, albeit imperceptibly to the eye. Which the Rabbins being unable otherwiſe to comprehend, conceiv'd that our firſt Parent was created an Hermaphrodite, becauſe both Sexes came from him, his own and that of <hi>Eve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the ſole ignorance of things occaſions the aſcribing of them to Chance, which hath no power over the wiſe, becauſe they underſtand the reaſons thereof. As for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cauſes, as the Divine is, they concur indeed with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ones; but as they are becoming in the mouths of Divines and of the Vulgar, ſo Naturaliſts muſt not ſtop there, ſince by the right uſe of external cauſes the internal may be corrected; by which correction not only Seeds formerly barren, or which fell in an ingrateful ſoil, are reduc'd to a better temper and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd prolifick, but ſuch as were deſtinated to a female produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction through defect of heat, are render'd more vigorous and fit to generate Males. Now that young married people hit not ſometimes upon this latter Sex, 'tis becauſe of their frequent debauchery, which cools the Brain, and conſequently the whole habit of the Body. Which happens not ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to men of more advanc'd age, who uſe all things more moderately.</p>
            <p>The Fourth attributed the cauſe to the Conſtellations and Influences of the Stars which reign at the time of Conception; Males being generated under Maſculine, and Females under Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Signs.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXVI. Whether the French Tongue be ſufficient for learning all the Sciences.</head>
            <p>A Language is a Multitude or Maſs of Nouns and Verbs which are ſigns of Things and Times, deſtinated to the explication of our thoughts. There are two ſorts; the one perfect, call'd Mother-Languages, the other imperfect. The Mother-Languages are the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect thoſe which depend upon them. Now the French being of this latter ſort, we cannot learn the Sciences by it alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being particular, and the Sciences general, the leſs is not capable to comprehend the greater. Moreover, our Language being not certain in its Phraſes, nor yet in its Words (not only Ages, but alſo a few Years changing both) whereas the Sciences are certain and immutable, it will follow that they cannot be taught by it. Beſides, there may be Inventions for which our
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66371:161"/>
Language hath no expreſſion, or at leaſt not ſo good as others; and to buſie our minds in the ſearch of words is more likely to retard the mind in the acquiſition of Sciences then to further it. The truth is, 'twere well if things were generally expreſs'd by the moſt proper and ſignificant words, but they are not ſo in any Language much leſs in the French, which is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich enough of its ſelf that it borrows from the Greek and Latine to expreſs the moſt common things, and conſequently is not ſufficient to teach all the Sciences.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, The French Tongue is deriv'd from the Greek, Latine, and Gothick, which are Languages much more copious then it; and therefore they that will recur to originals will find thoſe Tongues more adapted for teaching the Sciences then the French, and yet not any ſingle one of them ſufficient for it; ſince the Romans, to become and deſerve the name of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were oblig'd to learn Greek. Moreover, ſince Books are the chief inſtruments for attaining the Sciences, the ancient Latine and Greek ones (which yet were not ſufficient for it) are much more numerous than the French, and by conſequence the French Tongue is not capable to teach every Science: and had it more Tranſlations then it hath, yet theſe are but ſmall Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets deriv'd from that grand Source of Sciences which is found in the original Languages.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If we regard the order of times and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of the Creation when all things were in their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and purity; 'tis moſt likely that, that Language which took birth with <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the Sciences, is more fit to teach them then the much more Novel French, and ſince there muſt be a proportion between Inſtruments and the Matters upon which they act; and this proportion is not found between the French Tongue lately invented and the Sciences which are as ancient as the World, who can think it ſufficient to teach them? and the Cabaliſts hold that the Language fit to teach the Sciences per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, muſt have words adapted to ſignifie the Vertues and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of things, which ours hath not.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That all the Language of <hi>Adam,</hi> who gave names ſuitable to the nature of every thing being loſt except the the name of God (for that reaſon ſo much eſteemed by the Jews); The Cabaliſts in imitation of that Tongue, invented one whereof I ſhall give you a taſte. It hath five Vowels <hi>E, A, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>, I, O,</hi> which anſwer to the Elements and the Heaven; <hi>E,</hi> to Earth; <hi>A,</hi> to the Water; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>,</hi> to the Air; <hi>I,</hi> to the Fire; and <hi>O,</hi> to Heaven. <hi>E,</hi> produceth in pronunciation <hi>c, d, f, g, l, m, n, p, r, ſ, t, z</hi>; foraſmuch as theſe Conſonants cannot be produc'd without it; <hi>A,</hi> produceth <hi>h,</hi> and <hi>k; v,</hi> produceth <hi>q; I,</hi> produceth nothing, becauſe pure and ſingle Fire doth not. <hi>O,</hi> likewiſe produceth nothing, becauſe the Heaven only moves and excites Generations: whereas <hi>E</hi> produceth abundance of Letters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Earth which produceth every thing in its boſom,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:66371:162"/>
being the Centre of Heaven and the Matrix of the Elements. Now, to form words according to the Elementary Qualities, they will have the Vowels which compoſe ſuch a word anſwer to the Elements which compoſe ſuch a mixt body. And to ſpecifie degrees, becauſe the Vowels, whereby they are denoted meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together would ſpoil the pronunciation, therefore they make foure orders of the ſixteen Conſonants, <hi>viz. b, c, d, f,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the four degrees of Fire; <hi>g, l, m, n,</hi> thoſe of Air; <hi>p, r, ſ, t,</hi> thoſe of Water; <hi>x, z, ſſ, ſt,</hi> thoſe of Earth. Upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation they build the compoſition of all their Words, which they compoſe of Vowels according to the Elements predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in things, and of Conſonants according to their degree. But who ſees not the abſurdity of this invention, which by this means would extend only to corporeal mixts, whereof the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and very degree is known: Concerning which Naturaliſts are ſo far from being agreed, that many attribute moſt natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to other cauſes, as to Occult Properties, ſo call'd in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Elementary. 'Tis beſt therefore not to rove from the common tract which teaches us the Sciences by real Languages; amongſt which thoſe call'd Dead ones, to wit, the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, and others now diſus'd, ſuffice not for teaching the Sciences, becauſe they are not pronounc'd well, and the learned agree not about the importance of many Letters and Syllables. Beſides, the moſt eloquent expreſs not themſelves ſo naturally in thoſe antick obſolete Tongues as in their own. And all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that in order to obtain the perfection of a Science, too much plainneſs cannot be us'd, either on the Teacher's part in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing their Rules and Precepts, or on the Learner's in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding their difficulties for reſolution.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXVII. Of diverſity of Colours in one and the ſame ſubject.</head>
            <p>THe diverſity of Colours is commonly deduc'd from the mixtion and proportion of the Elements; but more truly from the ſeveral degrees of Sulphur, which produces them, as Salt doth Sapors, the moſt certain indications what degree the quality of a Plant is of: For if Colours had relation to the Elements, then all red things ſhould be hot, and white things cold; which is not true in Poppy, and Roſes, on the one ſide, nor Orange-flowers and Jaſmin on the other. So alſo green things ſhould be always moiſt, becauſe this colour proceeds from an indigeſted humidity mixt with a part of putrifi'd earth; as appears in ſtanding waters; and yet the greenneſs of Lawrel and Mint hinders them not from being hot and dry, nor that of Ranun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus from burning. But Colours are either natural, or artificial;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66371:162"/>
which latter as we find it in Stuffs and Silks, is neither the cauſe nor the effect of their temperament. But natural colour, ſuch as that in the parts of living Animals, is an effect of their Life, and alterable after their death. Wherefore I conclude, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and its varieties proceeds from the different degrees of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in the ſubject; but that one and the ſame ſubject is of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colours, the cauſes may be: Firſt, for that ſome of its parts are more compact; others, more looſe, and ſo differently receive the impreſſion of the Sulphur and the Internal Fire. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Sun ſhining more upon one part than another, draws the internal colour from the Centre to the Circumference; as Apples are colour'd on the ſide next the Sun. Thirdly, the ſame difference which is found between the Root, Trunk, Leavs, Flower, Fruit, and other parts of Plants and Animals, is alſo found in each portion of thoſe parts; as the lower part of the Roſe is green, the middle part whitiſh, and the top red; and the Tulip variegated, is compounded of as many ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; which variety of places and matrices, ſerves to determine the colour which Sulphur paints thereon, being guided by the pencil of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That this diverſity of colours proceeds only from the divers aſpect of light which varies the colours of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bodies to our Eye, as in the Rain-bow, the Camelion, and the necks of Pigeons, in things expos'd to the Sun, which ſeem far brighter than before: To which you muſt add the diſtance and ſtation of the beholders; ſo water ſeems black or blew afar off, but near hand colourleſs; Turpentine, Cryſtal, and the whites of Eggs in ſeveral ſituations do the like.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That there are four colours anſwering to the Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Black to Earth, White to Water, Yellow to Air, and Red to Fire. For diſcovering the Cauſes of whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, the ancient Philoſophers prepar'd a Matter, which by the degrees of fire, they paſs'd through all the colours of Nature, and perceiv'd ſometimes in their veſſel what they call'd the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's tail, repreſenting all colours in one ſingle Matter; whence they concluded the variety of colours to proceed from that of External Fire, moving the Matter leſs in one part than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus Antimony, which is at firſt Black, is rais'd into White, Yellow, Red, and mixt Flowers, according as they are ſublim'd more or leſs. But you can draw no conſequence from hence to the Colours of Plants, ſince redneſs, which, in works of Art, argues perfect Digeſtion, and Fire predominant, doth not ſo in Simples.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXVIII. Whether we are more perſpicacious in the Affairs of others, or our own, and why?</head>
            <p>IT may ſeem ſuperfluous to make this a Queſtion, ſince by the enumeration of all ſorts of Affairs, it appears that we are Moles, yea, perfectly blind in the Judgement we make of our ſelves, and more clear-ſighted than the <hi>Lynx</hi> in thoſe we make of others. Which alſo the Goſpel teſtifies, by the compariſon of a mote which we eſpy in the Eye of a Neighbour, not ſeeing the beam which is in our own; for, (according to the direction of the Lawyers, who are to be believed in point of affairs) in the firſt place in reference to perſons, every one underſtands himſelf much leſs either in Mind or Body than he doth another; moſt eſteeming themſelves more capable and worthy of praiſe for Witt than they are; and (as the Eye ſees not it ſelf, but every other viſible thing ſo,) he that hath any perfection or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, cannot conſider the ſame in its true Latitude, but eaſily adds ſomething to the firſt, or diminiſhes from the ſecond; whilſt the various bent of our Paſſions always exalts and depreſſes the balance, and keeps it from that <hi>aequilibrium</hi> which is neceſſary to a right Judgement. Hence Phyſicians, although they ought to know themſelves better than they can be known by others, yet, when ſick, permit themſelves to be treated by their Companions; and never ſucceed ſo well in the Cure of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their domeſticks, as they do abroad elſewhere. In the ſecond place, we are leſs quick-ſighted in things that concern our ſelves, than in thoſe of others: whence commonly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Lawyers leave the affairs of their own Houſes more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled than others. Which was the cauſe that the Wife of <hi>Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the famous Lawyer of our time, ſent to him to aſk his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice concerning his own affairs under fancied names, making him pay a Solicitor with his own Money. In the third place, Actions are in a very evill hand when they are to be managed or defended by their Authors; either Modeſty on the one hand extenuating them, or Thraſonical pride dilating them, and adding thereunto more than is fit. Laſtly, the Laws ſhew ſufficiently what hath been the opinion of Legiſlators upon this matter, when they forbid Advocates and Procurators to plead and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in their own Cauſe; and when they injoyn Judges to forbear, not only their own, but alſo from all thoſe wherein their kinred or alliances may have any intereſt. Thus much for the firſt Head of the Queſtion. The Reaſon, which is the ſecond, ariſeth hence; That the Eye as well as all other Organs of External and Internal Senſes (ſuch as the Judgement is) muſt be ſerene, and not prepoſſeſſed by any tincture or Prejudice. Now to require
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:66371:163"/>
this ſerenity and indifferency in our own affairs, is to demand an impoſſibility. The Cauſe whereof may come from the pureneſs and ſubtilty of the Humane Spirit, above that of other Animals, compared to the Elements of Earth and Water, which contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves round about their own Centre, move not but in queſt of their food; others more ayerious, riſe a little higher, but yet have a bounded Region; ſuch are the ſpirits of Women, whoſe Knowledg and Curioſity is limited to the affairs of their houſwifrie, or at moſt to thoſe of their neighbourhood. But the Mind of Man reſembling Fire, which hath no other bound but Heaven, penetrates even to the Centre of the Earth, carries its point every where, and is like flame in a perpetual agitation, oftentimes reſembling our natural heat in Summer, which abandons the Internal parts to carry it ſelf to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, There is as great diverſity of Judgements and Witts, as there is of Eyes amongſt Men. As there are ſome blind; other Eyes from which the Objects muſt be ſet at diſtance to become viſible; ſome alſo to which they muſt be approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, laſtly, others which require a moderate diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Viſible Object and the Organ: Iin like manner, there are ſome Judgements abſolutely blind; others, which judge not things too near, but require to have them removed, or ſet at a middle diſtance; there are others alſo, which judge them better near hand than a far off; and this truly is the cuſtom of the beſt Judgements, and of ſuch as leaſt ſuffer themſelves to be prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd. Indeed, what is more abſurd than for us to remove far from Objects in order to judging of them, after the manner of old men, and of thoſe that are ſhort-ſighted; and if the ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be true, The Species of the thing to be known muſt be not only introduced into, but alſo made like the Mind; Is the diveſting our ſelves of it away to know it well? By this reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning we ſhall never ſee clear in any affair: not in our own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis ours; nor in thoſe others, in regard of the Envy Men bear to the proſperity of their Neighbours, which makes them think that their Vines are more fruitful, and their afflictions leſs ſevere. If ſome Phyſicians reſign themſelves to the cure of others of the ſame profeſſion, 'tis becauſe they believe them as able as themſelves, or, perhaps, becauſe their own Judgement is diſturbed by the diſeaſe; otherwiſe, ſince the particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of every one's Temper is the condition moſt requiſite to a good Phyſician for curing his Patient, and every one knowing his own better than another can in along time, none can be a better Phyſician of another than of himſelf; and if domeſtick cures be effected with leſs notice, yet they are not leſs ſure and remarkable to him that would conſider them. That Lawyers are not admitted to plead in their own Caſe, is rather from their too much, than too little Knowledge; the Court foreſeeing that they would be too prolix and hot in the proſecution thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:66371:164"/>
the greater temptation to diſhoneſty in diſguiſing their own actions. Nor is exception againſt Judges in the caſe of their kinred allowed, becauſe they ſee not clear enough into the affair in queſtion; but becauſe intereſt, which is inſeparably fixed in humane minds, might lead them to relieve their Relations to the prejudice of a third. Which yet hath not place in all, there being found good Judges who would condemn their own Child if he had a bad Cauſe. But to attribute to ſelf-love, the defect of clear-ſightedneſs, is to ſpeak too Poetically; ſince the Prince of Poets believes it not poſſible to deceive a Lover; and the knowledge we have of others affairs, hath no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but that which we have of our own, juſt as ſelf-love is given us for a rule of that of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That which happens moſt frequently being the rule, and the reſt the exception; and the greateſt part of Men reſembling that <hi>Lamia,</hi> who being blind at home, put on her Eyes when ſhe went abroad; it muſt be agreed, that we are leſs clear-ſighted in our own than in others affairs: Which is the meaning of the Proverb of the wallet, in the forepart of which the bearer puts other Mens matters, caſting his own into the part behind upon his back. Moreover, to ſee clear, is to ſee without clouds or miſts, ſuch as are thoſe of the Paſſions, Fear, Hope, Avarice, Revenge, Ambition, Anger, and all the reſt which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not the Species to be calmly repreſented to the Intellect, which receives the ſame as untowardly as ſtirred water, or a Looking-glaſs ſullied with inceſſant clouds, or vapors receive an Image objected to them; 'tis true, the Paſſions have ſome effect upon it in affairs without; but as themſelves, ſo their trouble is leſs, and he is the beſt Judge who gives them no admittance at all; which cannot be in our own affairs, where, conſequently, we are no leſs clear than in thoſe of others.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CLXXXIX. Of the Original of Mountains.</head>
            <p>GOD having created the world in perfection, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite there ſhould be Plains, Mountains, and Vallies upon the Earth, without which agreeable variety, there would be no proportion in its parts, wherein nevertheleſs conſiſts its principal ornament, which hath given it the name of world; no other beginning of Mountains ſeems aſſignable but that of the world. Nor is there any poſſibility in attributing another Cauſe to thoſe great Mountains, which ſeparate not only Provinces and States, but the parts of the world; all the Cauſes that can be aſſigned thereof, being unequal to ſuch an Effect: Which the diſcovery of the inequalities of the Celeſtial Bodies, obſerved in our dayes
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:66371:164"/>
by <hi>Galileo</hi>'s Tubes in ſome ſort confirmed; for by them Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are diſcerned in ſome Planets, eſpecially an eminent one in the Orbe of <hi>Mars</hi>; which Mountain cannot reaſonably be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to any cauſe but his primary conſtruction. The ſame may likewiſe be ſaid of the Mountains of the Earth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides having neceſſarily its ſlopeneſſes and declivities which are followed by Rivers and Torrents, there is no more difficulty to conceive a Mountain then an elevated place in the Earth; ſo that to ſay, that from the beginning there was no place higher in one part of the earth then in another is to gain-ſay Scripture which ſaith that there were four Rivers in <hi>Eden,</hi> each whereof had its current; which could not be, unleſs the place of their riſe were higher then that whereunto they tended.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the proportion from which the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World reſults is ſufficiently manifeſted in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of the four Elements with the Heavens, and of the Heavens with themſelves, yea in all compounds which reſult from thoſe Elements moved by heat and the Celeſtial influences, without fancying a craggy Earth from the beginning, to the prejudice of the perfection which is found in the Spherical Figure, which God hath alſo pourtray'd in all his works, which obſerve the ſame exactly or come as near it as their uſe will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; as is ſeen particularly in the fabrick of Man's Body, his maſter-piece, whereof all the original parts have ſomewhat of the Spherical or Cylindrical Figure, which is the production of a Circle. And if the other Elements of Fire, Air, and Water, are abſolutely round and cannot be otherwiſe conceived, though their conſiſtence be fluid, and as ſuch more eaſily mutable in figure; 'tis much more likely that the earth had that exactly round figure at the beginning; otherwiſe the Waters could not have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it as they did, ſince not being diminiſhed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World till this time, they are not at this day ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of covering it. 'Tis certain then that God gave the Earth that Spherical form, it being to ſerve for the bulk and Centre to all the other Elements, by means of which roundneſs the Water covered it equally, but when it was time to render the Earth habitable to Animals, and for that end to diſcover a part of it, it was to be rendered more hollow in ſome places and more elevated in others, ſince there is no Mountain without a Valley, nor on the contrary. Afterwards it came to paſs that the Rain waſhed away whatſoever was fat, and unctuous in thoſe higher places, and carrying it into Brooks and Rivers, and thence into the Sea, this Sea by the impetuoſity of his waves makes great abyffes in ſome places and banks of ſand in others; but the great and notable change happened in the univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge when the many Gulfs below and Windows on high, as the Scripture ſpeaks, overflowed the whole Earth for forty days and forty nights together; the Earth being thus become a Sea was in a manner new ſhaped by the torrents of the waters, and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:66371:165"/>
the violence of the ſame waves, which made Abyſſes in ſome places and Mountains in others, according as the Earth happened to be more or leſs compact, and apt for reſiſtance. Which is yet eaſier to be conceived of Rocks which being unapt to be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by either that univerſal rovage of waters, or torrents ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perven'd in four thouſand years ſince, they remain intire and appear at this day as ſupercilious as ever over the more depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed parts round about.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That ſome Mountains were produced at the Creation, others ſince, partly by Rains and Torrents, partly by Winds and Earth-quakes, which have alſo ſometimes levell'd Hills and reduced them into Valleys; ſo that you cannot aſſign one certain or general cauſe of all. For there is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that the ravages of waters have produced Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, then that they have levell'd and filled Valleys with their ſoil; as 'tis ordinarily ſeen that the fatteſt portion of Mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous places is waſhed away by Rain into Valleys, and fertilizes the ſame. And the ſmallneſs of the Earth compared to the reſt of the world permits not its inequalities to make any notable diſproportion in it, or hinder it from being called Round; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Eclipſes cauſed by the ſhadow of the Earth, which ſhe ſends as regularly towards Heaven as if ſhe were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the waters of the Sea, from which, according to the Scripture, all waters iſſue and return thither, impetuouſly entring into the caverns of the Earth go winding along there till they find reſiſtance, whereby their violence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled makes the Earth riſe in ſome places and ſo forms Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; which therefore are more frequent on the Sea-coaſts then elſewhere, and ſeldom further from the ſame then a hundred and fifty Leagues. Now that the Sea is higher then the Earth the Scripture notes, and thoſe that travel upon the Sea obſerve the truth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> which ſaith that the waters were gathered together on a heap. For being remote from a Port at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as would otherwiſe ſuffer the ſame to be ſeen, the riſing of the interpoſed waters intercepts the view thereof.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, 'Tis eaſie to conceive how waters running underground make breaches and abyſſes, ſuch as that at <hi>Rome,</hi> into which <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> caſt himſelf, and alſo in many other places even in our time wherein a Town of the Griſons was totally involved in the ruines of a neighbouring Mountain, whoſe foundations the torrents had undermined. And what is found in digging up the ruines of Buildings, paved ſtreets, and other footſteps of mens habitations ſo deep that the cauſe thereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attributed to a bare raiſing of the ground in building by ſome humane artifice, ſhews that theſe changes happen'd by the depreſſion and ſinking of the ground whereon ſuch Towns ſtood, and by the overturning of neighbouring Mountains, which in this caſe turn Plains into Valleys and Valleys into Plains
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:66371:165"/>
or elſe into Mountains, as alſo theſe Mountains into Levels: all theſe changes which to us ſeem prodigious, being no more ſo to Nature, whoſe agents are proportional to their effect, then when we cover an Ant-hill with a clod of Earth. But 'tis not likely that ſubterranean waters, whoſe violence is broken by their windings can raiſe Mountains, or ſo much as ordinarily Hills; much leſs can they raiſe higher the cavities of Rocks which are the ordinary Baſis of ſuch Mountains; ſince our Vaults are ruined by the ſole defect of one cliff or ſtone which joyns and knits the reſt together; the ſand Hills which the winds heap up in <hi>Lybia,</hi> as the waves do the banks in the Sea, pertaining as little to the Queſtion as they deſerve the name of Mountains. Wherefore 'tis probable that Mountains are as old as the Earth, which was formed uneven by Gods command, that ſo its declivities might ſerve for aſſembling the waters together; for to ſay that the ſituation of the Sea is higher then the Earth, is not only contrary to the experience of Dreiners who find the declivity of the Land by no more certain way then by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the waters, but alſo to the belief and manner of ſpeech of all the world, who uſe the term of going downwards when people paſs along with the ſtream of Rivers, which run all into the Sea whoſe ſurface muſt therefore neceſſarily be lower then that of the earth. Whereas it is ſaid that all waters come from the Sea, this is meant of vapors exhaled from it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Rain and Springs, from whence ariſe Rivulets, Brooks, and at length Rivers, which terminate again in the Sea.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, In purſuance of <hi>Copernicus</hi>'s opinion which makes the earth turn about the Sun, that the ſeveral concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it receives from that motion may poſſibly elevate one place and debaſe another.</p>

            <p>THe Soul being the principle of all the actions, we need go no further to find the cauſe of Geſtures, and Poſtures. 'Tis true, that as this Soul is but a general cauſe, being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion of moſt Divines, alike in all men, it muſt like melted Metal borrow its form from the Mould whereinto it is infuſed; ſo the Soul follows the model of the Body and as ſhe formed it, ſo in ſome ſort be modified by it exerciſing her fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions variouſly according to the diverſity of its Organs. Whereunto alſo the humors and their mixture or temperament
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:66371:166"/>
contributes very much. Hence a man of ſmall ſtature and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick hath quick and haſty motions; the tall and phlegmatick, more heavy and ſlow; the Sanguine and middle-ſized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both. Nevertheleſs the principal reaſon is drawn from the conformation of the parts; whence, the Lame halts; he who hath the Muſcles and Ligaments of the hinder part of the Neck too ſhort, holds his Head too upright; He who hath a great Mouth and a large Breaſt is a great talker; and ſo of all the other parts, from the diverſity whereof even that of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages is ſaid to have come. Theſe Geſtures are either univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, as we ſee ſome geſticulate with the whole body; or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, one contracting his Forehead, another ſhrugging his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, beating of meaſures with his Foot like a good Horſe, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing his Hands as if they were ſcabby or to be waſhed, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſpeak to any one without touching him, pulling his Button, or puſhing him upon the Arm or Breaſt. Where alſo is but too obſervable the troubleſome way of ſome, who never end their diſcourſe but by an Interrogatory, whether you hear them? or at leaſt by an hem! which they continue till you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them; yea, others interlard their ſpeech with ſome word ſo impertinent that it takes away the grace from all the reſt: all Geſtures words and vicious accents, to which may be oppoſed others not affected or repeated too often, becauſe 'tis chiefly their frequent repetition which renders them tedious and as blamable as the ſaying over and over the ſame word: as on the contrary, their ſeldomneſs ſerves for an excuſe to thoſe who have no other. Above all it muſt be endeavoured that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſuit, or at leaſt be not wholly oppoſite to that diſcourſe which they accompany; as that ignorant Comedian did who pronouncing theſe words, O Heaven! O Earth! look'd down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the firſt, and caſt up his Eyes at the laſt. Whence one and the ſame Geſture may be good or bad in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereunto it is applied, and according to its ſeldomneſs or frequency. As for ill looks, they are always diſagreeable, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring the proportion of the countenance and proceeding alſo from the firſt conformation of the parts, For as the Arm is bowed only at the Shoulder, Cubit and Wriſt, and the Leg at the Knee and Ancle, though the Soul which makes the flection be alike in all other parts, but the articulation is only in thoſe parts: ſo the motion is carried alike to all the Muſcles; but only thoſe diſpoſed by their conformation to receive the figure of ſuch grimaces, are ſuſceptible thereof. They likewiſe ſometimes happen upon Convulſion of the parts, which cauſe the ſtrange bendings we obſerve therein, though never without a precedent diſpoſition which may be called their antecedent cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That we ought to aſcribe to the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Motions and Geſtures of the Body, which are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or diſpleaſing according as they ſuit with that of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:66371:166"/>
Hence Fools and Children whoſe judgment is irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are pleaſed with ſeeing ſuch geſticulations and the grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Jack-puddings, which diſpleaſe the more judicious. So that as there is one beauty abſolutely ſuch and another reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and in compariſon of thoſe who judge differently thereof according as they find it in themſelves (whence the Africans paint the Devil white becauſe themſelves are black, and the Northern people paint him black becauſe themſelves are white:) ſo there are Geſtures and Motions purely and ſimply becoming, honeſt and agreeable; others ſuch only by opinion of the beholders, as are the Modes of Salutation; and laſtly, others abſolutely bad as Frowning, Winking, biting the Lip, putting out the Tongue, holding the Head too upright or crooked, beating of meaſures with the Fingers; in ſhort, making any other diſorderly Geſture. All which defects (as they are oppoſite to perfections which conſiſt in a right ſituation of all the parts without affectation) proceed from the Phanſie either ſound or depraved. Which happens either naturally or through imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt caſe hath place in Children who from their birth are inclined to ſome motions and diſtortions of their Muſcles; which being double, if one become weaker and its Antagoniſt too ſhort it draws the part whereto it gives motion out of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeat, as is ſeen in thoſe that ſquint. The ſecond is obſerved in Children ſomewhat bigger, who beholding ſome Geſture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, render the ſame ſo familiar to themſelves, that at length it becomes natural to them. Hence the prohibition of Mothers give their Children not to counterfeit the vices their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions bodies, is not void even of natural reaſon; becauſe the Phanſie is ſtronger in a weak Mind, and when the Memory is unfurniſhed or other ſpecies; whence the Phanſies of Women are more powerful then thoſe of Men. The Minds of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being weak, and reſiding in ſoft pliant Bodies, more eaſily admit any idea's once conceiv'd: And as a Language is more eaſily learn'd by Uſe then by Precepts, ſo example is Extreamly prevalent, and ſweetly inſinuating into the Phanſie by the Senſes diffuſes its influence over the whole Body.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That if the Soul be an harmony as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it takes therein ſeems to intimate, we need ſeek no other cauſe of the ſeveral motions and cadences of the Body which it animates. 'Tis the Soul which moves all the Nerves of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and carries to all the parts ſuch portion as ſhe pleaſes of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits proper to move them, whereby like a player upon a Lute or ſome other Inſtrument ſhe makes what ſtring ſound ſhe pleaſes, ſtretching one and looſening another. And as Muſick is ſuch as the Quirreſter pleaſes to make it, delighting the Ear if it be proportionate thereunto and procuring the Muſitian the repute of ſkilfulneſs; if not, the contrary happens: ſo the Soul imprints upon the Body one figure or another which make a good or bad grace, inſomuch that oftentimes gracefulneſs is
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:66371:167"/>
more eſteemed than Beauty, unleſs it may be better ſaid to be part thereof; for want of which, beautiful perſons reſemble inanimate Statues or Pictures. But as true Beauty is wholly natural, and an Enemy to Artifice, ſo the Soul ows to its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and firſt temper, the good or poſture which it gives its Body; and there is as much difference between natural gracefulneſs and affected poſtures, as between the Life and the Picture, truth and appearance; yea, the ſole ſuſpicion of affectation offends us. Moreover, a Clown ſeldom becomes Courtly, and whatever pains be beſtowed in teaching him good Carriage, yet ſtill his defects appear through his conſtraint; as on the contrary, amongſt Shepherds moſt remote from the civilities of the Court, we ſee gentileneſs and dexterities; which manifeſt that good carriage, or Geſtures are purely natural.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That in the Geſtures and Motions of the Body, two principles muſt be acknowledged, one natural and the other accidental. The former is founded in the ſtructure and compoſition of every one's Body, the diverſity whereof produceth, with that of the ſpirits, humors, and manners, all the Actions and Paſſions which depend thereon, the true motive cauſes of our Geſtures and Carriages. Hence he that ſuffers pain frowns, he that repents bites his Lip or Fingers; he that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires ſomething, and dares not expreſs it, ſhrugs his ſhoulders; he that muſes deeply turns his Eyes inward, and bites the end of his Pen or Nails. The accidental principle is imitation, which, next to Nature, is the moſt efficacious cauſe, and acts moſt in us; Man being born for imitation more than any other Creatures, as appears in that ſcarce five or ſix Species of Birds imitate our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Ape alone our Geſtures; we, on the contrary, imitate not only the voices of all Animals, but alſo all their Actions: And therefore as it cannot be denied that Nature contributes to our Geſtures, ſo neither can it be doubted that Imitation hath a power therein.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCI. Which is moſt proper for Study, the Evening or the Morning.</head>
            <p>IF Antiquity had not had Errors, the cauſe of thoſe who prefer the ſtudy of the Evening before that of the Morning, would be very deſperate. But Reaſons having more force here than the Authorities of Pedagogues, who hold <hi>Aurora</hi> the friend of the Muſes, only to the end that their Scholars riſing betimes in the Morning, themſelves may have the more time left after their exerciſes; I conceive the Evening much more fit for any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66371:167"/>
of the Mind, than any other part of the day; the Morning leaving not only the firſt and more common wayes full of Excrements, but alſo all the Ventricles of the Brain wherein the Spirits are elaborated, and alſo the Arteries and Interſtices of the Muſcles full of vapors; whence proceed the frequent oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, contortions, and extenſion of the members upon our awaking, to force out the vapors which incommode them. On the contrary, the Evening even after repaſt, finds thoſe firſt wayes full of good Aliments, which ſend up benigne and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vapors which allay and temper the acrimony of other more ſharp and biting, found by experience in Men faſting, who for that reaſon are more prone to Choler. Moreover, Study con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Meditation, and this in reflection upon the Species re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Phanſie, 'tis certain that the report of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced all the day long, ſerves for an efficacious Leſſon to the Mind, when it comes to make review of the things offered to the Intellect, for it to draw conſequences from the ſame, and make a convenient choice: but in the Morning all the ſpecies of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, are either totally effaced, or greatly decayed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the melancholy humor, which is moſt proper for Study, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires conſtancy and aſſiduity, which ordinarily accompanies this humor; and it is predominant in the Evening as Bloud is in the Morning, according as Phyſicians allot the four humors to the four parts of the natural day; as therefore the Sanguine are leſs proper for Study than the Melancholy, ſo is the Morning than the Evening. Hence the good Father <hi>Ennius</hi> never verſified ſo well as after he had drunk, which ſeldom happens in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the conceptions of faſting perſons are commonly more empty, and leſs agreeable than thoſe of Authors well fed. For the Spirits repaired by Food are carried much further, as being more vigorous when their continual flux and deperdition finds matter proper for their reſtoration, as they do after Supper, having then the ſame advantage that an Army hath, which ſees at its back another Auxiliary one ready to recruit it. On the contrary, in the Morning nothing remains in the Body of all the Aliments of the foregoing day, but only a maſs of liquid blood, which is preſently diſtributed into all the parts, having its ſelf need of reſtoration: Whence the other animal-functions are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed leſs vigorouſly in the Morning than in the Evening, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after Supper; Which is juſtifi'd alſo by the experience of thoſe who when they would learn any thing by heart, ſtudy it in the Evening and ſleep upon it, committing the ſame to thoſe vigorous Spirits newly produc'd by the food, to be more deeply engraven in the Memory. And your nightly Students ſleep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the Morning, which is the fitteſt time for it, and beſt refreſhes the forces both of Body and Mind; whereas Evening ſleep is lyable to muſings and tumults. Which alſo is confirm'd by the practice of Courtiers, who beſt of all Men underſtand the delights of Life; eſpecially Ladies, who by long ſleeping in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66371:168"/>
the Morning, preſerve themſelves fair and in good plight; which is an infallible ſign of health, without which, the functions of the Mind cannot be rightly perform'd.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That a veſſel which is to be fill'd, muſt firſt be empty'd, and the Organs of Senſe muſt be free from all Species, that they may be ſuſceptible of thoſe whereof we deſire to inform them. For which purpoſe, the Morning is far fitter than the Evening, when all the Idea's of the day paſt, throng into the Phanſie, and ſhut the door to new Objects. The Spirits like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are then more pure from the vapors, which ariſe from meats while undigeſted; which vapors are very prejudicial to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as appears in thoſe that have drunk too much, who reaſon but very ill; and they that apply themſelves to ſtudy after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, find a manifeſt difference in themſelves from what they were before it; their Animal Spirits being clouded by multitude of vapors which fill their Heads, and leave no longer free paſſage to the Spirits: Beſides that, Attention hurts Digeſtion, calling the Spirits to the Brain from the Stomack, where they ſhould be to concoct the food; whence follows imperfect ſanguification, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by paleneſs of Complexion of hard Students. Moreover, the Soul being Light, delights more to exerciſe its functions in the day than in the night, whoſe darkneſs ſaddens it, and repreſſes its beams; whence our conceptions are much more dull in the night, whoſe coldneſs is an Enemy to all Actions, as heat (which is greater in the day) is a friend to them. And the Cuſtom of the moſt ſtudious is back'd with Reaſon, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that the Soul, Man's chief part, begin to take its food of Knowledge at the chief and firſt part of the day. And our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws ſeem to favor this Opinion, whilſt they prohibit the judgement of Criminal Cauſes after dinner, as requiring more attention than Men are commonly capable of at that time; and certainly they muſt be much leſs capable thereof after Supper.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Queſtion cannot be determin'd but by diſtinguiſhing of Complexions, Ages, Cuſtoms, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Studies. The Cholerick commonly find themſelves fitteſt for ſtudy in the Evening, when the Acrimony of their predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humor is allay'd by the recent vapors of meat. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Phlegmatick muſt not ſleep much, and to be early is both moſt healthful for him, and the fitteſt time for his ſtudy; but the Sanguine requires more ſleep. And for Cuſtoms, though bad ought to be reform'd, yet if an Evening Student changes for the Morning, or on the contrary, it will be with leſs ſucceſs. If it be asked, What Cuſtom then is beſt to be contracted, we muſt come to the conſideration of Ages; wherein, Children after ſeven years old, when they begin to be capable of regular diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, muſt not be confin'd to leſs than eight or nine hours ſleep; after the Age of Puberty, Morning Studies are moſt profitable for them. The Evening is fitteſt for the Studies of Youth and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:66371:168"/>
Manhood, in whom Choler predominates, as leſs diſturbing their Morning repoſe, which is neceſſary to repreſs the boylings of their hot Blood; whence if they riſe too early, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly troubled with the Head-ach. Laſtly, Old-age being more phlegmatick, and its humors ſharper, 'tis good for them to go to bed betimes, to the end to temper that Acrimony by the gentleneſs of the vapors riſing from the lately taken Supper; and alſo 'tis moſt profitable for them to riſe early, whereunto they are guided by Nature, awaking ſooner than any other Age.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCII. Who are the moſt Ingenious of the World.</head>
            <p>BY Ingenious are meant inventive, ſubtle or acute perſons; He that underſtands, diſcourſes and exerciſes the functions of the Soul more ſubtly then another is ſtyl'd Ingenious. Thus <hi>Apelles</hi> when diſguis'd was diſcover'd by a third line which he drew upon two others, ſo ſmall, that none but he could have drawn it: And in a diſpute, he that beſt diſtinguiſhes a term confounded by the Antagoniſt, paſſes for the moſt ſubtle and ingenious; ſo alſo doth an Artificer that makes the moſt ſubtle pieces of work, as chains for Fleas, Nine-pins with a Bowl ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſmall, Knives and other Inſtruments, not weighing above a grain of Wheat. For as they that can perceive the leaſt objects are the moſt clear-ſighted, ſo minds not contented to conceive common and groſs things, are the moſt ingenious. This being premis'd, I conceive that the Cholerick are ſuch; and for the ſame reaſon Southern people, whoſe Climate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that humor moſt. Hence thoſe that govern people in thoſe parts trouble not themſelves to reaſon with them, becauſe having to do with refined ſpirits, it were to no purpoſe; there being no reaſon ſo good but a contrary one might be invented amongſt them: But they relye upon nothing more then Faith and Religion, whereby they accompliſh their ends upon their people, who elſewhere are govern'd by force of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That if Ingenuity conſiſted only in ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there would be none in making <hi>Coloſſus</hi>'s and great Piles of Buildings, wherein nevertheleſs there is far more then in little Trinkets, which like ſome Iron mechanick-Inſtruments are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by being too fine. And as he that diſtinguiſhes pertinently in a Diſpute is reputed ingenious, ſo is he no leſs who entangles the reſpondent by confounding things which ought to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. In the practiſe of Affairs, things too ſubtle paſs for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's, and are never put in execution; nor is he accounted the beſt Painter that draws the fineſt ſtrokes. Moreover, the Eyes that diſcern the leaſt object are not always the beſt; but
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66371:169"/>
'tis a ſign of weakneſs of ſight to ſee things out of their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate diſtance. Much leſs probable is it that the Cholerick are more ingenious then the Melancholy, ſince reflection is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the making of a ſolid concluſion, which the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Choler cannot endure; and indeed, never was there ſeen a man of great parts who was not penſive. And accordingly, Northern people, being more cold and reſerv'd, will carry it above other hotter Nations.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That as to Nations, he conceiv'd that as not only the Plants, but alſo the Pearls and Jewels of the Eaſt, are more excellent and purer than thoſe of other parts of the world, ſo alſo are their Witts: The Reaſon whereof, is, That the Sun coming from the Eaſt beſtows the Firſt-fruits of his own and other Celeſtial Influences upon the Orientals; which Influences, like the impreſſion of Perfumes, are moſt vigorous in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Moreover, we ſee that God made uſe of the excellence of the ſpirits of thoſe people to make the firſt and greateſt Law-givers and Sages. If Authors of new and untrue Religions have been found there, this fortifies rather then deſtroyes this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more Witt being requiſite to maintain a bad than a good cauſe. As for Temperaments, the Sanguine hath the advantage. Firſt, becauſe 'tis the moſt healthful Complexion, and Health is the principal condition of a good Witt, which cannot diſplay it ſelf perfectly in a ſick body. Secondly, becauſe Blood is the proximate matter of ſpirits, and he that hath good Blood muſt have plenty of ſpirits. Thirdly, becauſe this is the Complexion of the amorous, who are the moſt ingenious people of the world. Whence the Poet ſaid, <hi>Quis fallere poſſit amantem?</hi> But if the Queſtion be, What Exerciſe or Employment hath the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious people, 'tis harder to be detemin'd; ſo great Witts being found at this day of all ſorts of profeſſions, that 'tis diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to judge, of which there are moſt. Some will prefer the Scholaſtick Devines for their ſubtle diſputes and nice diſtinctions; others, the Rational Phyſicians, for their diſcourſes and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon the cauſes of hidden diſeaſes, others, the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians for their curious ſearches into Heaven it ſelf; or the Lawyers who manage their affairs ſo advantageously above others.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That, abſolutely ſpeaking, there is no quarter of the world more Oriental or Occidental than another; theſe words having been invented only in reſpect to Men themſelves, to ſome of whom one and the ſame people is Oriental, and yet Occidental to others; ſince the world is round, and all the parts of a Sphere are of the ſame Nature. What differences there are, muſt be taken from ſomething elſe than the four parts of the world, and, particularly, from Cold and Heat. Thus thoſe that live under the Poles, are of a different Complexion both of Body and Mind, from thoſe that are between the Tropicks. According to which difference, the Inhabitants of the temperate
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:66371:169"/>
Zones muſt be the moſt ingenious: Cold being too much an Enemy to Life, to advance the Wit; and exceſſive Heat burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Humors no leſs within than without, as the woolly hair and black ſkin of the Nations expos'd to it, manifeſt. So that 'tis no preſumption in the French and other Nations under the ſame Climate, to award the preheminence to themſelves in this matter. For the operations of the Mind, as well as the digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other natural operations of the Body, require a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not an exceſſive Heat. And the levity imputed to our Nation is a proof of it, ſince commonly the moſt ingenious are leaſt ſtedfaſt in executing the things they have devis'd. But amongſt the French, I account none more ingenious than the Lawyers, who confute the Philoſophical Maxim, which ſaith, That whatever hath a beginning hath alſo an end, ſince they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Suits immortal. Inſtead of the four cauſes taught by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, they create others without number; and in ſpight of the Maxim, which ſaith, There is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> they make one at length in the purſes of their Clients.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That ſince there are good and bad, ingenious and ſots in all Lands, to be the one or the other, dependeth not upon the Climate; Heaven, from whence the Soul deſcends, being alike in all places. Nor is it likely that profeſſions render Men more or leſs ingenious, ſince thoſe to which people are lead by natural inclination, are rather Effects than Cauſes of good or bad parts. As for thoſe to which we are perſwaded or forc'd, nothing can be inferr'd from them, having no affinity with our Nature. Laſtly, nor doth Temper always contribute to render Men ingenious, ſince there are ſome ſo of all Tempers, Ages, and Sexes. The true Cauſe is the proportion which happens to be between the Soul and the Body at the firſt conformation. Whence the ſureſt ſigns of good parts, are taken from the figure of the Body, and chiefly of the Head, which if ſharp, never makes a wiſe man; as on the contrary, great Heads, and broad Fore-heads, are always ingenious, of whatever Country, Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Temper they be.</p>

            <p>I Find that theſe Brethren being aſſociated in <hi>Germany</hi> two or three hundred years ago, ſware mutual Fidelity to obſerve the Laws of their Fraternity; the chief of which was Secrecy, never to ſpeak or write but in the Allegories of their Cabal, whoſe pretenſion is to re-eſtabliſh all Diſcipilines and Sciences, eſpecially Phyſick, which, they ſay, is ignor'd and ill practis'd by all others; themſelves alone having the Knowledge of ſo

many Secrets that they hold the Philoſopers Stone for one of the leaſt, and profeſſing to imitate ſundry other Societies of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time; as firſt, that of the Kings, Prieſts, and Philoſophers of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> under the names of <hi>Iſis, Oſiris, Apis, Anubis,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> the myſteries whereof they hid under their Hieroglyphical Letters, leaving the uſe of the common way of writing to the vulgar: For proof whereof they alledge, that the firſt Prieſt of this Fraternity being urg'd by <hi>Alexander</hi> to diſcover to him the Secret of <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſiris,</hi> told him for the whole Secret, that they were not gods but men whom they worſhipt. With which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo well ſatisfied, that he writ word thereof to his Mother <hi>Olympias,</hi> deſiring her to burn his Letter as ſoon as ſhe had read it, for fear of Scandal. The ſecond Society which they alledge, is, the College of the <hi>Eumolpides,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Eumolpus</hi> its Author, an Eleuſinian Prieſt at <hi>Eleuſis</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> in imitation of that inſtituted in <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Orpheus,</hi> to the honor of <hi>Baochus</hi>; of which <hi>Eumolpides,</hi> the ſupream Sacrificer carry'd a golden key in his mouth to mind him of keeping the Secret, which was not communicated to all the initiated in this Order, but only to ſuch as were of approv'd diſcretion. The Third (they ſay) was that of the <hi>Samothracians,</hi> who were never troubled with ſickneſs or poverty, the two grand ſcourges of Life; maintaining themſelves in perpetual Health by repairing the radical humidity, and by Aſtrological Application of Specifical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies deriv'd to them from their Predeceſſors; and having by their great work ſecret means of ſupplying the common neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Confreres and Aſſociates. Then follow the <hi>Magi</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where, <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, it was required as a Condition of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any to be King, that he were ſkill'd in natural Magick, that is, in the moſt profound and admirable ſecrets of Nature; to learn which, <hi>Empedocles</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> purpoſely ſail'd into <hi>Perſia.</hi> Of this Magick they make <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> the Author, who liv'd ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſpent twenty years in a Deſart in ſtudying the works of Nature, trying the Effects enſuing upon the Application of Actives to Paſſives; whence he got the name of Necromancer, as if he invok'd Devils. Next they quote the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Brachmans</hi> in <hi>India</hi>; both ſorts vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by <hi>Apollonius,</hi> to whom <hi>Hyarchas</hi> the Moderator of the Eaſt ſhew'd a Well four paces broad, by which they ſwore, having near it a Cup full of fire, which perpetually burning, never ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the brims of the Veſſel, and two Hogſheads, the one of wind, the other of rain, both which infallibly follow'd upon open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame.

They tell further of one <hi>Aucarſus</hi> who did many wonders, appearing in ſeveral places at the ſame time, killing with one word a Serpent
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:66371:170"/>
that deſtroy'd a whole a Country; and laſtly, they mention a Colledge of <hi>Arabians</hi> in the City of <hi>Damcar,</hi> where the Author of this Brotherhood of the Roſie-Croſs had his Academy, after the eſtabliſhment whereof he went to <hi>Fez</hi> to inſtruct the <hi>Moors,</hi> where his progreſs was ſuch, that the Society came to be diffus'd into <hi>Germany, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the riſe of this Fraternity is by <hi>Mayerus</hi> referr'd to the year 1378, when a German Gentleman (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itial Letters of whoſe name were <hi>A.C.</hi>) of the Age of fifteen years, was ſhut up in a monaſtery, where having learnt Latine and Greek, in his ſeventh year he began to journey to the Holy Land; but falling ſick at <hi>Damas,</hi> he heard ſo much talk of the Sages of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> that recovering, he went to <hi>Damcar</hi> the City of theſe Sages, who ſaluted him by his proper name, and telling him that they waited for him a long time, diſcover'd to him many Secrets; after he had learnt their Language and the Mathematicks, he travell'd into <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; then return'd into <hi>Germany,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying his expences by the invention he had of making Gold, with which he built and liv'd magnificently for five years; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be thinking himſelf of reforming the Sciences, which he had deſign'd from the beginning, he aſſociated to himſelf three Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whom he communicated his Secrets. Theſe four not ſufficing for the great number of Patients which flockt to them from all parts to be cur'd, they took four more who enacted among themſelves theſe Rules of their Society. I. None ſhall make other Profeſſion but of curing the ſick <hi>gratis.</hi> II. None ſhall be ty'd to any particular Habit, but left to conform therein to place and time. III. Every Brother ſhall aſſemble once a year on a ſet day, in their Houſe call'd the Houſe of the H. Ghoſt, or ſignifie the cauſe of his abſence. IV. He ſhall chooſe a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and fit perſon to ſucceed him after his death. V. Theſe two Letters <hi>R. C.</hi> ſhall be their Symbole, Signet, and Character. VI. The Fraternity ſhall be kept ſecret for a 100. years. Theſe Articles being ſworne to, he retain'd two of the Brothers with him, and ſent the reſt about the world. This founder, they ſay, liv'd 106. years, was buryed ſecretly by his Confreres in the year 1484; after which time, theſe Brothers ſucceeded one another, every one of them living no leſs than a 100. years; and in the year 1604. one of them finding a ſtone in a wall pierc'd through with a nail, which denoted ſomething more than ordinary, pull'd it out with great difficulty, and diſcover'd a Vault; wherein, amongſt other ſtrange things, he found the Sepulchre of this Founder with this inſcription in Latine, <hi>I ſhall be manifeſted after ſix ſcore years</hi>: And at the bottome, <hi>A, C, R, C,</hi> In my life time I made this Abridgment of the Univerſe for my Sepulchre, with many deviſes, one a ſide, and four in circles. The Body held in its Hand a parchment-book written with Golden Letters, at the end of which was his <hi>Elogium,</hi> containing among other things, that after having heap'd up more riches than a King or Emperor,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66371:171"/>
of which he judg'd his own Age unworthy, he left them to be ſought for by poſterity, and built a little world anſwering to the great one in all its motions, by which he had compendiouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the Knowledge of all things paſt, preſent, and to come; and after he had liv'd above a 100. years, he render'd his Soul to his Creator amidſt the embraces and laſt kiſſes of his Brethren, not by reaſon of any diſeaſe, (which his own Body never felt, and he permitted not others to ſuffer) but God with-drew from his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the illuminated Soul of this moſt beloved Father, moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Brother, moſt faithful Maſter, and intire Friend. The ſame <hi>Mayerus</hi> ſaith, that the place of theſe Roſie-Crucians Colledge is ſtill unknown, but yet they repair to it from all the parts of the world. In the year 1613. News came that one of theſe Brethren nam'd <hi>Mulley om Hamet,</hi> having aſſaulted <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi> King of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Marocco</hi> ſtrongly arm'd, defeated him with a handful of unarm'd men, and ſeiz'd his throne; from whence theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors were to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> where at the ſame time ſome Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards taking upon them the title of <hi>Illuminati,</hi> fell into the hands of the Inquiſition. This report oblig'd the Society to publiſh two Books, intitul'd, <hi>Fama &amp; Confeſſio,</hi> wherein, after refutation of wrongful reputations, they ſet down their Maxims, and ſay, That the great Knowledge of their Founder is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, ſince he was inſtructed in the Book <hi>M,</hi> which ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Book of the World; others, the Book of Natural Magick, which he tranſlated out of Arabick into Latine: out of which, they affirm, that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> afterwards learnt all his Knowledge; which being new, 'tis no wonder, they ſay, that both he and they be derided and hated by the reſt of men. And that the above-ſaid Founder caus'd to be collected into another Book for his Diſciples all that man can deſire or hope, to wit, both Celeſtial and Earthly Goods; theſe laſt conſiſting chiefly in Health, Wiſdom, Riches, to acquire all which, they ſhew the means. In brief, that their main end is, by Travells and Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with the Learned, to obtain the Knowledge of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in the World, and relate them to their Society, and to none elſe.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That there have ever been ſpirits extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, irregular, and incapable of all Diſcipline both Political and Eccleſiaſtical. Hence have riſen in the Church Hereſiarchs and Schiſmaticks; in the State, Rebels and Mutineers; in the Sciences, Innovators and preſumptuous perſons, who wanting Ability and Conſtancy to undergo the pains of Study neceſſary for obtaining the ſkill requiſite to the right exerciſe of the leaſt Diſciplines and Profeſſions, take upon them to blame what they underſtand not; and as the vulgar eaſily cloſe with Calumnies, to which the faults of the Profeſſors, not the Profeſſions, give but too much occaſion; ſo they readily prepoſſeſs the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Hearers. For which there is more matter in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick than there is in any other Profeſſion, becauſe the vulgar, who
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:66371:171"/>
judge thereof, conſider only events, which are not in our power but only the application of cauſes; the reſt being the work of Nature. Hence <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and others of that gang, ſtarted up in the world, eſtabliſhing new Principles, and vaunting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the authority of imaginary antiquity. And as no Opinion is ſo erroneous but hath its followers; ſo there have been found people enough of that ſort to make a Colledge, who forgetting that one of the faults they charg'd upon the Rational Phyſicians, was, that in their preſcriptions they made uſe of a ſtrange Language and Cyphers unknown to the vulgar, have imitated thoſe above-mention'd Prieſts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who made an outſide ſhew of brave Ornaments, which being lifted up, you ſee nothing but a Cat, or an Ox at the ſtall. Thus all their diſcourſe is only of <hi>Aurum Potabile, Mercurius Vitae,</hi> Magiſtery of Pearls, Quinteſſences, Spirits, Extracts, which they denote by Cyphers invented at pleaſure, and apply (as they ſay) only according to the mind of Heaven, all the cadences whereof they obſerve and meaſure for that purpoſe: But if you look to the bottome of all, you will ſee their Hands foul'd with coals or dung, their Faces diſcolour'd by the Arſenical Exhalations of the Minerals they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare in their furnaces; and yet the moſt pitiful wretch of them all will ſwear that he knows the great work. Indeed, this were no great matter, if the ſucceſs of their Practiſe made amends for the defects of their Theory. But ſeing chief remedies conſiſt in vomiting or purging violently, whereof few Bodies are capable; no wonder if people uſe them only in deſperate caſes. Nor is their impertinence ſufferable, whilſt, to credit themſelves, they pretend to be deſcended from the Gymnoſophiſts, from whom, 'tis to be fear'd, they inherit at laſt nothing elſe but their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For what better title have they for their ſucceeding to all thoſe ancient Societies, (I mean ſuch as were commendable and worthy of imitation) than our Faculties have, which are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd by the Laws of the Prince, by poſſeſſion immemorial, and a conformity of all Nations, which renders their right as ſtrong as that of Nations. Wherefore I adviſe theſe Brethren, if they will not betake themſelves to ſtudy as as others do, to render themſelves altogether Inviſible, (as they pretend to be) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the Commerce of the reſt of Mankind.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, Who openly profeſs'd himſelf one of this Fraternity, ſaid that Doctor <hi>Flud</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had ingeniouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted theſe three Letters; <hi>F. fide, R. religione, C. charitate,</hi> though the common opinion prevails, which will have them ſignifie, <hi>Fratres Roſeae Crucis.</hi> But neither of theſe interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can paſs for a great Secret; wherefore it appears upon further ſearch, that the Croſs is truly ſignificative there, but in another ſenſe, which is, that in this † the word <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>X</hi> is includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whence ſome think that theſe Brothers took in <hi>Spain</hi> the title of <hi>Illuminati</hi>: I ſhall venture further, and add that <hi>Ros</hi> (Dew) which is the moſt powerful diſſolver of Gold amongſt natural and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66371:172"/>
not corroſive Bodies, is nothing elſe but Light condens'd and render'd corporeal, which being concocted and digeſted artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in convenient time in its proper veſſel, is the true <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of the Red Dragon, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Gold, the true matter of Philſophers. Of which Secret, this Society deſiring to leave Poſterity intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Name, ſtyll'd themſelves Brethren of the Roſie Croſs. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi>'s bleſſing upon <hi>Eſau,</hi> contain'd only theſe two mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>De Rore Coeli, &amp; pinguedine Terrae det tibi Deus.</hi> Whereas this Society is charg'd with pretences of being inviſible, they mean only that it hath no viſible marks to diſtinguiſh it from others, as other Societies have, namely, ſeveral colours and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of habits, but 'tis known and viſible only to thoſe of the Society it ſelf.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCIV. What <hi>Paracelſus</hi> meant by the Book M.</head>
            <p>I Shall not ſtand to conſider whether it be true, as ſome ſay, that more perſons beſides <hi>Theophraſtus ab Ohenheim</hi> bore the name of <hi>Paracelſus</hi>; my preſent purpoſe is only to conſider a paſſage lately recited here out of his <hi>Archidoxa; At<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> haec omnia</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>parùm vulgaria de Medicina ſupernaturali &amp; Magica, ex libro ſecreto ex Arabico idiomate in Latinum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo qui pro titulo habet Literam M.</hi> In which words we may obſerve how remote this Author's manner of Writing is from that of the Doctors of theſe times; yea, and of former too, (if you except the Chymiſts) who mainly aim to ſpeak clearly, and to render themſelves intelligible, many of them profeſſing to wiſh that things themſelves could ſpeak. From which practiſe this Author is ſo far, that he conceals even the Book's name wherein he ſtudied, by a kind of <hi>Plagium,</hi> hiding his Theft, leſt others ſhould trap him; and the ſame Jealouſie runs through all his Works. However, for Curioſitie's ſake, let us conſider what Titles will ſute to this Letter. Me-thinks the fitteſt is <hi>Mundus,</hi> that great Book, open to all that are minded to read in it; that to which <hi>Job, David,</hi> and many other Authors ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſo frequently refer us; each Element whereof is a Tome, every Compound a Book, and every part thereof a Letter. All other Books are only Copies of this Original, to which if they happen to have conformity, they paſs for good; if not, they are meer Chimera's, having no foundation in the thing. Hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that ſo remarkable difference between the Theory and the Practiſe of Arts; for almoſt all Books being falſe Copies of this of the World, no wonder if Book-doctors are moſt commonly ignorant of Things, whoſe ſolid Contemplation produces other ſatisfaction in the informed Intellect, than do the empty Phanſies
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66371:172"/>
of thoſe who either never underſtood what they writ, or had not the gift of right expreſſing it. And certainly we may have more exact and natural information from the ſpecies of things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than either the Writing or Speech of another perſon can give us.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That this Book M. is the Book of Magick; whence many have believ'd <hi>Paracelſus</hi> a Magician, and the rather in that they find him teaching in many places of his Books to cure diſeaſes by words, and to produce men by inchantment in a great bottle, with other ſuch abominable propoſals, not to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd but by Diabolical aſſiſtance. Moreover, we ſeldom ſee any perſons ſo bold as to attempt to overthrow ſo ancient an Inſtitution as Phyſick, both in Theory and Practiſe, but who are led to that enterpriſe either by God or the Devil: And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual calumnies and detractions, whereof this evil ſpirit is the Author, and for which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his followers ſo ſignalize themſelves, give farr more probability of the latter than of the former. Whence, poſſibly, to diſguiſe the matter, moſt Magicians pretend to have learnt their Characters out of ſome Book, as, particularly, that which they call <hi>Clavicula Solomonis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That it may be Magick, and yet lawful, to wit, true and Natural Magick, ſuch as was profeſs'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>Magi,</hi> three of whom having diſcover'd our Saviour's Birth, came to worſhip him; the other black and infamous Magick, no more deſerving that name, than Empiricks and Mountebanks do that of Phyſicians. Now Natural Magick is the knowledge of the nature and properties of all things hidden to the vulgar, who take notice only of manifeſt qualities, and reduce all to generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to avoid the pains of ſeeking the particular virtues of each thing; and therefore 'tis no wonder if they ſee only common effects and ſucceſſes from them. Thus Plants bearing the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or reſemblance of a diſeaſe, or the part diſeaſed, as Lung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Liverwort, Pepperwort, cure by a property independent on the firſt qualities, though few underſtand ſo much. Of this kind are many excellent Secrets, whoſe effects ſeem miraculous, and as much ſurpaſs thoſe of ordinary remedies, whoſe virtues are collected only from their appearing qualities, as the Soul doth the Body, and Heaven Earth.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That by the Book M. cannot be meant <hi>Mundus,</hi> ſince the World cannot be turn'd into Arabick and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; and 'tis not a Secret but a Figure and Metaphor to call the World a Book. If it be lawful to admit a Figure in it, I think 'tis more likely that this Book is nothing elſe but a Taliſmanical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or Character engraven in a Seal, and employ'd by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie-Crucians to underſtand one another; and call'd the Book M, becauſe it repreſents an M croſs'd by ſome other Letters, from whoſe combination reſults the myſtery of the Great Work, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning its matter, veſſel, fire, and other Circumſtances; the firſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66371:173"/>
whereof is Dew, the true <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or Diſſolver of the Red Dragon or Gold. In brief, ſo many things are compriz'd in this figure, by the various combination of the Letters repreſented therein, that it deſerves well to be term'd a Book.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, If this be the Secret of the Brethren of the Roſie-Croſs, they are Inviſible in all their proceedings; becauſe no Secret is ſeen in it, but only many abſurdities. As, amongſt others, to call that a Book, which is neither Paper, nor Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Leaf, but a Figure; in which 'tis no wonder if they find what they pleaſe, ſince in theſe three Letters <hi>Sic,</hi> variouſly interlac'd one with another, you may find not only all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but alſo by their combination all the Books and all the things which are in the World; and it requires no more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry than to found all ſorts of notes upon a Flageolet. Let us therefore rather ſay, That Authors who puzzle their Readers minds with ſuch Figures, are as culpable as thoſe are commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who feed them with true and ſolid demonſtrations; and whereas we thought that this M ſignifi'd <hi>Mons,</hi> we now ſee that it ſignifies no more than <hi>Mus</hi>; according to the ancient Fable of the labouring Mountains, out of which upon the concourſe of people to the ſpectacle, iſſu'd forth nothing but a Mouſe.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That high Myſteries have alwayes been veil'd under contemptible, and oftentimes ridiculous Figures; as if the wiſdom of the ſublimer Spirits meant to mock thoſe of the vulgar, who judge of things only by appearance. Which may have place in common effects; but as for extraordinary things, their cauſes are ſo too, whereof we have experiences in Nature ſufficiently manifeſt. There is no affinity between a word and the death it gives to a Serpent; yet the Poet atteſts the thing in this Verſe,
<q>Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur Anguis;</q>
between the ſight of a little bird call'd a Wit-wall, and the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which it cures; between the Figure call'd <hi>Abacus Lunae,</hi> and the Meagrim, which is alſo cur'd thereby; between a point ty'd, and the Generative Power which it hinders. In brief, the moſt excellent effects are of this kind, and deſerve not the name of admirable, unleſs when our mind finds no connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the effect and the cauſe that produceth it. Why then may not the ſame reality be admitted between this Character and the effects pretended by thoſe Brothers of the Roſie-Croſs?</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCV. Of the Art of <hi>Raimond Lully.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SOme Wits are fitter for Invention than Imitation, and ſo was that of <hi>Raimond Lully,</hi> who invented an Art how to find many Attributes, Propoſitions, Queſtions, and Means of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Subject propounded, to the end to be never ſurpriz'd, but to be and always appear ready. By this Art, which upon account of its uſe, and becauſe it pretends to ſhorten vulgar ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he ſtiles Great, he endeavors to out-do <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who having reduc'd all Logick to <hi>Definitio, Proprium. Genus,</hi> and <hi>Accidens</hi>; and in his Books of Topicks, ſet down ſome few places out of which to draw <hi>Mediums</hi> for arguing; <hi>Lully</hi> hath propos'd others, not only drawn from all the preceding, but increas'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others invented by himſelf. This Art he divides into two parts. The firſt treats of ſimple terms, which he calls Principles, whereunto he hath joyn'd general Queſtions; and this part he calls the Alphabet, becauſe it comprizes each of thoſe terms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to nine by as many Letters of the Alphabet. The ſecond treats of the connexion of theſe Principles, and makes Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Syllogiſms of them: this part he intitles <hi>De Figuris,</hi> either becauſe, 'tis illuſtrated by Tables or Figures repreſenting the combination of thoſe Principles, or becauſe Arguments are compos'd of them as the Celeſtial Figures are of Stars. His Alphabet is thus delineated by <hi>Pacius.</hi>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCVI. Why a Needle touch'd by a Loadſtone turns toward the North?</head>
            <p>TO omit Preface in this Queſtion, There are two ſorts of Load-ſtones; the black, diſtinguiſht with little lines, which draws fleſh; and that which is of the colour of Iron. This latter is call'd <hi>Lapis Herculeus,</hi> perhaps, upon account of its great virtue; and <hi>Sideritis,</hi> from Iron which it attracts. <hi>Cardan</hi> mentions a third ſort, with which a Needle being rub'd, enters into the fleſh without being felt. We here conſider the ſecond ſort, which turns it ſelf towards the tail of the leſſer Bear. And ſince nothing is done in vain, the Loadſtone muſt be mov'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome Cauſe, which alſo muſt be either in Heaven or on Earth, the Poles of both which are fixt. I am of their opinion, who ſay, that under the Northern Pole there is an Iſland call'd <hi>Ilva,</hi> wherein there are high Mountains of Loadſtone, towards which, (the ſtronger prevailing over the weaker) both our leſſer Loadſtones and Needles toucht therewith turn; becauſe thoſe vaſt heaps of Loadſtone diffuſe their virtue over the whole Earth, and ſo draw all Loadſtones, and what-ever Iron is rub'd with them towards themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the Cauſe of this Motion ought rather to be aſcrib'd to ſome thing in Heaven, becauſe in Ships that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that Iſland of Loadſtone, the Needle ſtill tends towards the North, and not towards that Iſland. The truth is, there is a Sympathy between ſome parts and things of the world; the Female Palm bends towards the Male, Straw moves to Amber, all Flowers, and, particularly, the Marigold and Sun-flower in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards the Sun, the Loadſtone towards the Iron and the tail of the little Bear, which if we conceive to be of the Nature of Iron, there is no more inconvenience therein than in the other Properties attributed to the reſt of the Starrs and Planets.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That (to wave what other Authors have ſaid) this inclination of the Loadſtone proceeds from the great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the North, which is the Centre of all waters, towards which they tend. For the Loadſtone being extreamly dry, and oblig'd to tend ſome way, when it is in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> it veers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that quarter to ſeek the moiſture which is wanting to it; as alſo doth Steel heated red hot, and ſuffer'd to cool of it ſelf, if it be lay'd upon a piece of the wood floating gently in water.</p>
            <p>The Fourth was of <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Opinion, who conceives, that ſtones are animated, and, conſequently, that the ſoul of the Loadſtone carries it to the ſearch of its food and its good; as the the Eye affects Light, a Whelp is carry'd to his Dam's teat, and a
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:66371:175"/>
Sheep naturally eſchews a Wolf. For it matters not whether we hold, That the touch'd Load-ſtone moves towards the tail of the little Bear, which is diſtant five degrees from the Arctick Pole; or, Whether it flie and recoil from the part of Heaven diametrically oppoſite thereunto? Now that the Loadſtone is animated, appears by its being nouriſht with, and kept in the filings of Steel, by its growing old, and by the diminiſhing of its attractive virtue with age; juſt as the virtues of other bodies do. Wherefore, 'tis probable, that the Loadſtone's ſoul either with-draws it from that part which is contrary to it, or elſe leads it towards its good. Indeed two different inclinations are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in this Stone, depending upon the ſituation it had in the Mine; one Northwards, whither it turnes the part that once lay that way; the other Southwards, whither it turns its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite part. But the Experiment of Iron looſing its attraction by being rub'd on the Loadſtone the contrary way to which it was rub'd at firſt, is an evident ſign of ſuch a ſoul in it, which makes it thus vary its actions.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That all theſe accounts leave many difficulties to be reſolv'd; for if the Loadſtone mov'd towards thoſe great Adamantine Mountains of <hi>Ilva,</hi> then they would draw only that and not Iron; if Iron too, why not before 'tis rub'd with a Loadſtone? Nor doth this inclination of the Loadſtone proceed from its dryneſs, for then plain Iron, (which is as dry) Pumice, Lime, and Plaſter, (which are dryer) ſhould have the ſame effect: Beſides that, there is not ſuch want of humidity as that this ſtone ſhould ſeek it Northwards, the Mediterranean and the Main Ocean being nearer hand. As for Heaven, the Cauſe is no leſs obſcure there, and the terms of Sympathy and Antipathy differ not much from thoſe which profeſs naked Ignorance. The ſecond Opinion hath moſt probability; for ſince the two pieces of a Loadſtone cut parallel to the Axis, have ſo great a community of inclinations, that a Needle touch'd with one piece, is mov'd at any diſtance whatſoever, according to the motion of another toucht with the other piece; why may we not admit that the tail of the little Bear, or its neighbouring parts, are of a Magnetical Nature; and have the ſame commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with our Terreſtrial Loadſtone; according to that Maxim in <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi>'s <hi>Smaragdine</hi>-Table, That which is above, is as that which is below.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCVII. What Sect of Philoſophers is moſt to be follow'd.</head>
            <p>ALl the Sciences confeſs Obligations to Philoſophy. Divinity draws Ratiocinations from it; Eloquence is diffuſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; and Rhetorick is not to be learnt but after Philoſophy. Civil Law, being wholly founded upon Morality, is nothing but an effect of it, whilſt it teaches us to do voluntarily what the Laws makes us practiſe by force. Phyſick ſuppoſes excellent ſkill in Philoſophy, ſince the Phyſician begins where the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt ends. Now there are ſo many Sects of Philoſophers, that to follow them all, is to fall into manifeſt contradictions; and to adhere to one alone, is to be in great danger of miſtaking the worſt. That which keeps us from being able to make a good choice, is the little knowledge we have of theſe Sects, and the Probability each ſeems to have; and therefore 'tis requiſite to examine them in general, in order to drawing a general conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And becauſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cites almoſt three hundred Opinions touching the Supream Good, and as many may be brought touching other points of the Sciences; I ſhall only take notice of the famouſeſt Sects, as ſeeming the moſt rational, and moſt follow'd. And let us compare the always contentious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatericks, and the Stoicks together: The end of the former was to contemplate and underſtand things; the latter, aim'd more to do good than to know it; their deſign was Speculation, the ſcope of theſe <hi>Practici.</hi> I ſide with the former, becauſe that Science which embelliſheth Man's nobleſt part, his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the moſt ſublime, and conſequently, the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And as the Underſtanding is more excellent than the Will, ſo is Theory in matter Science than Exerciſe, Acts of Virtue depending on the Acts of Reaſon, and thoſe of Reaſon not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on thoſe of Liberty. Beſides, that is moſt to be eſteem'd, which muſt render us bleſſed; and that is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of the Creatures in God and in themſelves, which is to conſtitute the Beatifick Viſion.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Men ought not to get knowledge only to know, but to operate comformably to their knowledge. Truth would be either uſeleſs or dangerous, if it lead us not to practiſe. And though the Will is one Senſe ſubordinate to the Underſtanding, yet it commands the ſame in another. To know how to do well, and yet to do ill, is a double crime. And if knowledge alone could make happy, the Devils would be ſoon in Heaven; ſince Divines tell us, the leaſt of them, hath more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge than all Mankind together. Now the Opinion of the Stoicks regulating the Acts of our Wills, and compoſing our Manners ſuitable to Reaſon, ſeems to place the ſteps which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:66371:176"/>
muſt raiſe us to the higheſt pitch of Felicity. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Curious may follow the firſt Sect of theſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Peripateticks; but good men muſt neceſſarily adhere to that of the Stoicks.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That there are three other Sects which ſeem to comprize all the reſt, and therefore not to be omitted in this important choice: Firſt, the <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> who doubt of all things, and ſay, There is no knowledge of any thing. Secondly, Thoſe that doubt of nothing, but think they know every thing. Thirdly, Thoſe who are neither in doubt, nor in perfect certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in ſearch of Truth. The firſt do found their Opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this receiv'd Maxim, That there is nothing in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but what paſs'd through the Senſes; and theſe being fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, our Notions muſt be ſo too; That being we perceive not the eſſence of things, we cannot ſay that we know any thing. But theſe people may be anſwer'd, That ſince they have not ſo much as a knowledge of their doubts, they cannot make the ſame paſs for a demonſtrative maxim; if they think they have ſuch a knowledge, they muſt grant that there is knowledge of ſome thing; and if of doubts, why not of certainties. Moreover, if the Senſes be always fallacious, it will follow that there are Powers, which acting without impediment, never attain their end; and if our Underſtanding be always abus'd, 'tis in worſe caſe than the faculties of Brutes, who acquieſce in embracing their Objects. In brief, theſe dreamers cannot be ignorant that themſelves exiſt, becauſe they act, and that exiſtence is the foundation of all action. Nor are thoſe that think they know every thing much more intelligent; the former offend againſt Truth, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; theſe, by thinking it their ſole Miſtreſs. They argue, that ſince the Underſtanding is the Subject of the Intelligible Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which contain (they ſay) either actually or potentially the impreſſions of all Objects, it follows that as ſoon as we frame a Notion, we know all things. But I aſk theſe Knowing Men, What Truths they know ſo eaſily, which other Wits hold ſo difficult to be known, Whether created or uncreated Verity? The former is knowable only to it ſelf; we may demonſtrate, That it is, but not What it is in its own Nature. And how many errors have there been concerning the Nature of that Sole, Neceſſary, and true Being? And as for the latter, we know not the Truth of Eſſences, but by their Accidents; and theſe by Species which are very often perverted, either in the <hi>Medium,</hi> or the Organ. But how can we know other things perfectly, whereas we know not our Selves? We know that we act, but we know not how; ſo that the Opinion of thoſe that profeſs only to ſeek Truth, is the beſt and ſureſt, though it ingageth us to continual labour; and be the puniſhment ſaid by the Holy Scripture to be inflicted upon Men, both to ſatisfie and chaſtiſe their Curioſity. Now Action is the Life of the Soul, and that Science which keeps the Mind always awake, is juſtly preferrable before that which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66371:177"/>
renders ſo good an Agent idle, and impoveriſhes it by perſwading it that it hath riches enough already. Beſides, all Men are of this Opinion, either directly or indirectly: And Diſſenters themſelves, ſeek Reaſons every day to maintain it. Aſtrologers ſtill endeavor to diſcover new Stars, Chymiſts new Secrets, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians new Remedies, and Philoſophers new Opinions.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CXCVIII. Why Mules breed not.</head>
            <p>THe Firſt ſaid, That Mules are barren, becauſe every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Animal can produce only its own like by univocal Generation, defin'd, The production of a Living Thing deſcending from another Living Thing by a conjoyn'd Principle, in order to ſimilitude of Species. But Mules cannot generate thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being produc'd by a Horſe and an Aſs, they are neither the one nor the other, nor yet both together; but a third Species retaining ſomething of both. So that after what-ever manner they joyn together, they cannot make their like, that is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Animal part Horſe, and part Aſs; If a Mule could ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, it muſt be by coupling with a Species different from its own, as with a Horſe or an Aſs; whence infinite ſeveral Species, partaking more or leſs of the nature of Horſe or Aſs would ariſe, and ſo Forms being increas'd or diminiſh'd, Subſtance ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive degrees of More and Leſs, contrary to the Maxim of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. And in this matter, Nature's Wiſdom and Providence is obſervable, who rather ſuſpends her Action, than ſuffers any inconvenience to come by it.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That there are particular as well as general cauſes of the Sterility of Mules. As firſt, they want diſtinction of Sex, that between them being only ſimilitudinary, and the parts they have anſwering to the genitals of other Animals, having only the outward figure, not the internal form and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy thereof: Juſt as the Teats in Men, Dogs, Swine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſignifie nothing as to any uſe, but ſerve only for correſpondence with the Female and Ornament.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Sterility of Mules cannot be deſign'd by Nature only to avoid multiplication of Species in <hi>infinitum</hi>; ſince this conſideration hinders not but that Leopards and other Mixt Animals generate, and Plants ingrafted upon others of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Species bear fruit. But the cauſe hereof muſt be ſought in the divers Temperature and Complexion of the Aſs and Horſe; the former being very melancholy, that is, Cold and Dry, as appears by his ſlowneſs; the other Hot and Dry, as he teſtifies by his nimbleneſs; their two ſeeds mingled together compoſe a third, which indeed, hath Natural Heat and Radical Moiſture
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:66371:177"/>
enough for making an Animal: but Nature having brought her work to this point, can go no further; becauſe ſhe ſpent all the Radical Moiſture and Natural Heat ſhe had in the firſt produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; whereby Mules have the Courage of the Horſe, and the Laboriouſneſs of the Aſs. But the Mule having only Heat and Radical Moiſture enough for it ſelf, and not enough for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of another, the ſame cannot be produc'd.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the Number of Forms and Species of things being limitted, 'tis not in the power of Art and Nature to multiply them. And though it be eaſie to multiply them in the family of Plants, which are but of one Sex, (though ſome are diſtinguiſht into Male and Female, upon account of ſome ſmall differences); Yet 'tis not in the Gardener's power to ingraft all ſorts of Fruits one upon another. For (excepting the Colewort, in whoſe foot, when 'tis become hard and ligneous, one may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft ſome ſhrubs) Plants of divers kinds mingle not one with another, as trees with herbs or ſhrubs, and herbs with trees. Nor will the Pepin admit inſition into the Nut-tree, or on the contrary: Nature differs from Art in this chiefly, that ſhe hath her work bounded and determin'd; but Art counterfeits what the Artiſt pleaſes. Whence Painters oftentimes draw fine Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and beget deform'd Children. Every mixture of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes is not pleaſant, nor of Medicaments effectual; nor do our Sawces admit of any ingredients, but only of ſome that are ſuitable and proper. So alſo two ſeveral grains mixt together produce nothing, becauſe Nature hath temper'd ſeeds in ſuch degree, that nothing can be added or diminiſht from them, but deprives them of their efficacy. If ſuch unnatural Mixture make any productions, the ſame is prodigious, and amongſt Animals is call'd a Monſter: But being an Error of Nature, ſhe returns to her old way as ſoon as ſhe can, and rather ceaſes to generate, than produces ſecond Monſters of thoſe firſt. And this in Mules rather than other Species, becauſe the Equine and Aſinine Natures are no leſs contrary than Fire and Water. So that if they happen to be conjoyn'd, and make one <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> the Generative Virtues then exiſtent in their ſeeds make an Animal indeed; but, in producing the ſame, they extinguiſh one another, as Fire doth Water; and ſo what is generated of them, hath no power of Generation.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That this Sterility being ſuppos'd, (although <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> relates, that in <hi>Syria</hi>-Mules commonly generate; and <hi>Theophraſtus, Varro,</hi> and others affirm the like of thoſe in <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi> and <hi>Africa) Democritus</hi> in <hi>Aelian,</hi> attributes the cauſe thereof to the ill conformation of their genitals, particularly, of the womb, which is unapt to retain and quicken the ſeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through the exceſſive heat deriv'd from the Horſe, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages ſerving to thoſe parts in either ſex are too much dilated; beſides that, the ſame are very laxe in the Shee-Aſs; whence Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts and Experience tells us, that ſhe conceives not, unleſs
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66371:178"/>
after covering ſhe be well cudgel'd, that ſo the pain thereof may make her conſtringe her womb, and retain the ſeed which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would ſlide out again. Now this over great dilatation of the genitals appears by diſſection; and 'tis found by Experience, that the Beaſts themſelves are unwilling to ſuch an unnatural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation; ſo that in ſome Countries people are fain to feed Aſſes with Mare's milk, and cover the Mares ſometimes with Cloaths of the colour of an Aſs, to beguile them into the ſame. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that both the Species, of which Mules are generated, are very ſubject to Sterility. For the Aſs is of a cold temper, and particularly, its ſeed is ſo cold, that unleſs it begins to generate at the firſt caſting of its Teeth, it remains barren for ever. Yea, if an Aſs couple with a pregnant Mare, the coldneſs of his ſeed makes her caſt her Foal. The Horſe likewiſe, by <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns, that in two dayes the <hi>Pariſians</hi> publickly burnt all the inſtruments of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs and debauchery, and, particularly, the Women their Images; and Mandrakes which they kept wrapt up in their attires, upon a belief that as long as they had Mandrakes, they ſhould never fail to become rich: which Mandrakes, gave them Anſwers by ſhaking the head, or elſe by ſpeech. And there are not only true, but alſo counterfeit ones, ſuch as were made by an Italian Mountebank, (as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> relates) who carv'd the root of Pyony, or of a great Reed in the ſhape of a Man, and ſticking Millet or Flax ſeed in the places where hair ſhould grow, bury'd the ſame for twenty dayes; at the end whereof, fine ſmall threads appear'd in thoſe places, and a ſkin over all the reſt, which repreſented and paſs'd for a true Mandrake. <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſt</hi> alſo relates, that the Maid of <hi>Orleans</hi> was calumniated for having acquir'd the valour ſhe teſtifi'd againſt the Engliſh by the Magical Virtue of a Mandrake. And <hi>Henry Bouquet,</hi> a modern Author, affirms, that Thieves ſteal the Goods out of Houſes, and Children from their Mothers Breaſts by help of it; thoſe that behold them being unable to defend themſelves, becauſe this Plant ſtupifies their Hands. So likewiſe <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> tell us, that 'tis employ'd with great effect in Philtres and Amorous Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Upon which account, <hi>Natalis Comes,</hi> thinks it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in that which <hi>Circe</hi> gave <hi>Scylla,</hi> whereby ſhe became ſo deſperately in Love with <hi>Glaucus,</hi> that, being unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, ſhe caſt her ſelf headlong into the ſtreight of <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina.</hi> Some think, 'tis the ſame Plant that <hi>Joſephus lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>de bello Judaico,</hi> calls <hi>Baaras,</hi> from the valley wherein it grows; which, he ſaith, ſhines in the night like fire, and is pluckt up by a hungry Dog ty'd to the top of the root, after the ſame hath been ſoftned with the Urine of a Woman; becauſe upon its plucking up, 'tis ſaid to ſend forth a ſhreek which is mortal to the hearer, and ſo the Dog dyes after his work is done. Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that this root cannot be found except a little before the riſing of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> which is about the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> Which is no more incredible, than that the ſeed of Fearn ſprings but at a certain prefixt time, before and after which, it appears not. 'Tis likewiſe thought particular to Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to be pluckt up only by certain Sorcereſſes, and that in the night; whence alſo they ſell the ſame ſecretly, for fear of being puniſh'd by Juſtice; as it happen'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1630. at <hi>Hamburg,</hi> where the Senate caus'd three Women who exercis'd this trade to be whipt. Moreover, they hold that this Plant, (call'd Mandrake from a German word which ſignifies to bear the figure of a Man; for <hi>Man</hi> hath the ſame ſenſe in that Language as in ours; and <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> is to bear or carry) comes from the ſeed of Men hanged on
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66371:179"/>
Gibbets, or broken on the Wheel, which dropping upon the ground, already fat and unctuous by the multitude of hanged Bodies, produceth this Anthropomorphite-Plant, ſo term'd by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and alledg'd as an Inſtance to prove his Metempſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſis. Which Conceit is alſo ſtrengthened by the production of Beans, which the ſame <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and many others hold, to be produc'd of dead Bodies; for which reaſon he not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd from eating them, but had them in ſuch reverence that he ſuffer'd himſelf to be kill'd in a field of Beans, through which he might, have eſcap'd, but would not, for fear of hurting them. So likewiſe of the Urine of a Dog is produc'd the Herb <hi>Orrach</hi>; of an Elephant's Blood, ſuckt and vomited by a Dragon, <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi>; of the Bodies of Serpents, <hi>Serpentana</hi>; and of the ſeed of Stags, the Muſhroms, call'd <hi>Boleti Cervini.</hi> So that though this Plant be not ſeen, it doth not follow that there is no ſuch thing; it being no more abſurd to credit the voice of the vulgar in this matter, than in many others.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, There are three ſorts of Plants that bear the name of Mandrake, the Etymologie whereof may be taken from the Latin word <hi>Mandra,</hi> which ſignifies a Cave or a ſhady place; becauſe this Plant loves to grow in the ſhadow, and cannot long endure the heat of the Sun. The firſt ſort is call'd <hi>Mandragoras mas,</hi> or white Mandrake; hath on the top of its Root great leavs, ſpread on the ground like thoſe of broad-leav'd Lettice, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long, ſhining and ſmooth, in colour reſembling thoſe of Bete, to wit, of a pale green; the Flower is likewiſe pale, whereunto is annexed a round Apple of the bigneſs of a ſmall Lemon, of a pale Saffron colour, and full of a ſucculent pulp, wherein are pale or blew kernels, like thoſe of a Pear, ſaving that they are not pointed, but flat like a kidney. Its root is laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dyes not yearly as moſt others do; long, and ſo thick, that it can ſcarce be graſp'd with one Hand. 'Tis uſually divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two; of colour outwardly, between white and red; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, white; carnoſe, juicy, and of taſte between ſweet and bitter. The whole Plant ſends forth a ſtrong ſmell, eſpecially the Apples, whoſe juice is ſom what vinous, but bitteriſh; and burdens the Head both ſmelt and taſted. The ſecond ſort call'd <hi>Mandragoras niger,</hi> or Female Mandrake, hath leavs like the Male, but leſs and ſtraiter, like thoſe of ſmall-leav'd Lettice, of a dark green, bearing Apples as big as our little Medlars: Its root is leſs, but otherwiſe in ſmell, taſte, and figure, like the former; only 'tis black without, and white within, and ſometimes divided into three. The third kind is call'd by ſome Herbariſts, <hi>Morion,</hi> or Mandrake of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi>; touching which, though all agree not, yet the opinion of <hi>Codrus,</hi> whom we follow here, is, that it hath great roots, a high ſtalk, and leavs of a middle ſize between <hi>Solanum</hi> and Female Mandrake; its Flower is black, and ſo alſo is its Fruit; equal to a big Grape, and of a vinous juice: which Plant ſome call <hi>Solanum Mortiferum,</hi> the Italians <hi>Bella
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66371:179"/>
Donna,</hi> which grows likewiſe in ſhadowy places (as the former alſo do) in many parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Apulia,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is ſet in Gardens: the Apples are ripe in <hi>Auguſt. Galen</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts them cold in the third degree, and all Authors agree that they are very moiſt. All their parts are <hi>ſomniferous,</hi> and of great uſe in Phyſick, according to <hi>Dioſcorides.</hi> The moſt active is the bark of the Root: The ancient way was to peel the root, preſs out the juice, and thicken it in the Sun; or elſe to boil the root in new Wine till a third part were conſum'd, or to infuſe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coction: of this liquor they adminiſtred one or two glaſſes to ſuch as could not ſleep, and three to ſuch as were to have a limb cut off. They us'd it likewiſe in inflammations of the eyes, ſome feminine diſeaſes, and to ſuppurate Phlegmons; having ſuch a mollifying faculty, that in ſix hours boiling the Root with Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (they ſay) the ſame becomes plyable, and apt to take any impreſſion. At this day ſcarce ought but the leaves and roots are in uſe, (except that the apples are ſometimes boil'd in oil) but all externally, not by the mouth. 'Tis alſo thought alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macal againſt Serpents, and good to cure Tetters, being bruis'd and apply'd with vinegar. All which effects have made it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd; but (as humane Nature is prone to Superſtition) though this Plant be indu'd only with Vertues common to other Plants, (the ſoporiferous Quality being found in Lettice, Poppy, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, and more eminently in Opium; and that of being proper to Women, in the <hi>Ariſtoloches</hi>) yet becauſe its root reſembles a man's legs, and its trunk in ſome ſort his body without arms; hence Mountebanks have by their frauds and tricks brought people to believe their ſtrange Stories of it, even that it eats like a man, and performs his other natural functions. Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, though leſs prevalent upon ſtrong minds, becomes leſs credible by the prodigious manner they relate it to be produc'd: for 'tis impoſſible to imagine that any generation can proceed from ſperm deſtitute of ſpirits, and out of the proper natural ſubject deſtinated to its reception.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That indeed no Univocal Generation can be made after the loſs of the ſpirits of Sperm; but equivocal, ſuch as this is, may: whereunto Nitre contributes very much; which ſalt not being loſt by death, nothing hinders but, a fertile ſoil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determin'd by ſome form or other, a Plant may ariſe out of it; to which production fewer conditions are requiſite than to that of an Animal. And 'tis the leſs incredible, if the Experiment deliver'd by ſome Authors be true; That the ſalts of Roſema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Sage, Mint, and ſome other ſtrong-ſented herbs, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted according to Art, and frozen in a Glaſs, exhibite the image of thoſe Plants, therein; and, if ſown in well-prepared earth, produce the Plants of ſame Species.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That not only the means of the production of this imaginary Plant are ſo too, but alſo the ſupernatural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues aſcribed to it are ridiculous; yea, thoſe ſaid to be natural
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:66371:180"/>
to it are very hard to be juſtifi'd: for to be ſoporiferous, and to promote Procreation in Men and Women of ſeveral tempers is inconſiſtent, becauſe theſe things require Simples of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Qualities; and alſo are the cauſes of Sterility. This error of its being prolifick,, proceeds from a falſe ſuppoſition taken out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Reuben,</hi> the Son of <hi>Leah,</hi> one of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Wives, having brought Mandrakes to his Mother, her Siſter <hi>Rachel</hi> could not obtain them of her but upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Jacob</hi> (who deſpis'd her for <hi>Rachel</hi> the fairer of the two but barren) ſhould lie with her that night: which bargain was made between them. Now becauſe <hi>Rachel</hi> had Children after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, hence ſome Interpreters infer, that ſhe eat thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes, and that they render'd her fruitful: which is not at all in the Text; and her Fruitfulneſs might proceed from the favour of God, or ſome more fit means than that Herb. Nor is it an edible fruit, neither did all the Women in the Scripture, who of barren became fruitful, eat Mandrakes. 'Tis therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that this Plant hath neither the Form, nor the Properties which vulgar and vain Antiquity attributes to it.</p>
            <p>The fifth ſaid, 'Tis eaſier to overthrow, then to eſtabliſh a Truth, when the queſtion is about things apparently repugnant to Reaſon, which many times agrees not with our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby we ſee ſeveral contrary effects of one and the ſame Plant. As the pulp of an Orenge cools, the peel heats, and oil of the ſeeds is temperate: The like may be ſaid of Mandrake, which according to the diverſity of its Species and Parts may produce the different effects, which are atteſted by Antiquity; <hi>Apuleius,</hi> in his <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> relating, That a Phyſician deluded the malice of a Servant and a Stepmother, by giving them the juice of Mandrake inſtead of poyſon (which they deſir'd of him to kill a young man) which caus'd them to think him dead when he was only in a deep ſleep: and <hi>Columella</hi> ſpeaking of the ſoil where it grows;
<q>
                  <l>Quamvis ſemihominis veſano gramine foeta,</l>
                  <l>Mandragorae pariat flores.</l>
               </q>
Moreover ſince there are middle Natures compos'd of two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, as your <hi>Zöophytes</hi> between Plants and Animals, to wit, Spunges and Coral; between Brute and Man, the Ape; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſoul and body of Man, his Spirits: why may there not be ſomething of a middle Nature between Man and Plant, to wit, the Mandrake, a Man in external Shape, and a Plant in Effect and internal Form. In brief, we believe there is an Unicorn, though no man of this age hath ſeen it; why therefore may we not believe, that there is ſuch a Mandrake as moſt deſcribe, who affirm that they have ſeen one, as I my ſelf have alſo, though I cannot affirm whether it were a true or falſe one.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CC. Of Panick Fear.</head>
            <p>THe Species conceiv'd in the Phantaſie repreſenting to the Intellect ſome future Good, they beget Hope; when E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Fear. 'Tis not very hard to comprehend the way, nor how he, that ſees himſelf purſu'd by a potent enemy, betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to flight, by the Inſtinct of Nature, which avoids what ever is deſtructive to her: But the Mind is puzled to find the cauſe it ſees not, as of groundleſs Fear; which nevertheleſs ſometimes befalls the moſt reſolute, yea whole Armies, which fly without any purſuer. The Vulgar of the Ancients, (who made Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of every thing, eſpecially of what they underſtood not) thought <hi>Pan</hi> the God of Shepherds put this ſudden Paſſion into the minds of men; becauſe oftentimes it happens to flocks of Sheep, over which he is ſaid to preſide; though there be no appearance of any Wolf to fright them: whence they call'd it a Panick Terror. Unleſs you had rather interpret <hi>Pan</hi> to be the Univerſal and Supreme Deity, who giving the ſucceſs of Battels, ſometimes immits ſuch a fear into the hearts of thoſe men whom he intends to deliver into the power of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That <hi>Pan</hi> was an ancient Warrior, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the ranging of Soldiers in order of Battel, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd them into Wings, call'd by the Latins, <hi>Cornua</hi>; whence he was pictur'd with Horns. He alſo firſt devis'd Strategems; ſo that one day, having ſent out his Scowts, and underſtood that the Enemies were lodg'd in a deſert place full of reſounding ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, he order'd his Soldiers, that as ſoon as they approach'd the Enemy, they ſhould make a great ſhout; which, multiply'd by the Echo of thoſe neighbouring caverns, ſo frighted them, that before they could underſtand what it was, they betook themſelves to flight, conceiving they had to do with a far greater multitude of Enemies than there was: Whence the Fable of this God <hi>Pan</hi> adds, that the Goddeſs <hi>Echo</hi> was his Miſtreſs. From this, Groundleſs Fear, as others of the like nature, came to be call'd Panick Terrors. Such was that which ſeiz'd the Soldiers of <hi>Marc Antony</hi> in the War againſt <hi>Mithridates</hi>; that of the Gauls under <hi>Brennus,</hi> when they were ready to ſack the Temple of <hi>Delphos</hi>; that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he approacht the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> to beſiege it; and that of <hi>Macedonians</hi> under their King <hi>Perſeus,</hi> who ſo loſt their courage upon ſight of an Eclipſe of the Moon, that it was eaſie for the Romans to overcome them.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> relates another cauſe of this Appellation; namely, That when the latter of them reign'd in <hi>Aegypt, Typhon</hi> ſurpris'd him
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66371:181"/>
by a wile, and caſt him in a cheſt into <hi>Nilus</hi>; which News arriving amongſt the Pans and Satyrs, it put them into an aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; from which all other ſudden frights took their name. But leaving apart conjectures of words, let us conſider the thing, and examine, Whether it be not a miſtake, to think that there can be terrors without any cauſe? I think, There cannot; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis as true in Moral as in Natural Philoſophy, That nothing produceth nothing. But as an even balance is ſway'd either way by the leaſt blaſt, and (the cauſe being imperceptible) ſeems to incline of it ſelf; ſo when Men are ready for a battel, and every one thinks of the doubtful event thereof to himſelf, the leaſt external cauſe hapning to make never ſo little impreſſion upon their Spirits whilſt they are in this balance, is enough to move them either way; the firſt object that occurs, yea, the leaſt word, being of great efficacy. And becauſe Fear is found more univerſally imprinted in Mens minds than Courage; hence there needs leſs ſubject to produce it, than to animate them. Thus at the battel of <hi>Montcontour,</hi> this ſingle word, Save the Princes, ſpoken either accidentally, or by deſign, made them loſe the day. Thiſtles being miſtaken for Lances, gave a great terror to a whole Army; and an Aſs or a Cow in the Trenches, hath ſometimes given an Alarm to conſiderable Garriſons.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Fear caus'd in an Enemy being one of the ſureſt means to conquer him, Generals have not been more careful to animate their own Souldiers, than to terrifie their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies even by vain affrightments; as ſhowts, extravagant arms, and habits. For this reaſon the <hi>Germans</hi> were wont to paint their Faces with ſeveral colours, that they might ſeem terrible; ſome think our <hi>Poictevins</hi> had their name of <hi>Pictons</hi> from this cuſtom: So <hi>Gideon</hi> by Gods command employ'd Trumpets and earthen Pitchers with fire in them to terrifie the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> Yet none of theſe Inventions, no more than that of Elephants, Chariots of fire, and other Machins, can cauſe a Panick Terror, becauſe it ceaſes to bear that name when 'tis found to have ſome manifeſt cauſe. So that to aſk, Whence Panick Fear proceeds? is to aſk, What is the cauſe of that which hath none? If there be any, I think 'tis from ſome hideous Phantaſms irregularly conceiv'd in the Brain as a <hi>Mola,</hi> or a Monſter is in the womb; which Phantaſms ariſing from a black humor, cauſe Sadneſs and Fear; a Paſſion eaſily communicable, becauſe conformable to the Nature of Man; who conſiſting of a material and heavy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath more affinity with the Paſſions that deject him, as Fear doth, than with thoſe which elevate him, as Hope and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do. The moral cauſe of Panick Terror is Ignorance, which clouds and darkens the light of the Soul; whence the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as Children and Women, are moſt ſubject to this Fear; and Souldiers, who are the more ignorant ſort, being taken out of the Country, and from the dregs of the people, become eaſily ſurpriz'd with it; and by the proneneſs of Men to imitation, upon
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:66371:181"/>
the leaſt beginning it finds a great acceſſion and familiarity in Humane Nature.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the cauſe of this Terror may be a natural preſcience our Souls have of the evil which is to befall us; which is more manifeſt in ſome than in others; as appear'd in <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was advertis'd of what-ever important thing was to befall him by his familiar Spirit, or good Angel. Now if there be any time wherein thoſe Spirits have liberty to do this, 'tis when we are near our End, our Souls being then half unloos'd from the Body, as it comes to paſs alſo at the commencement of a battel, through the tranſport every one ſuffers when he ſees himſelf rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either to die or overcome.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCI. Of the Water-drinker of <hi>S. Germain</hi>'s Fair.</head>
            <p>THis Perſon is of a middle Stature; hath a large Breaſt, as alſo a Face, eſpecially his Fore-head; very great Eyes, and is ſaid to be ſixty years old, though he appears to be but about forty. He was born in the Town of <hi>Nota,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> and is nam'd <hi>Blaiſe Manfrede,</hi> They that have obſerv'd him in private Houſes, and upon the Theatre, relate that he makes his experiment not only every day, but oftentimes twice in one afternoon. Moreover, vomiting ſo freely as he does, he is always hungry when he pleaſes. His Practiſe is very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his publiſh'd Tickets, wherein he promiſes to drink a hundred quarts of water; but he never drinks four, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning it up again. His manner is thus: He cauſes a pail full of warm water, and fifteen or twenty little glaſſes, with very large mouths to be brought to him; then he drinks two or three of theſe glaſſes full of water, having firſt waſht his mouth, to ſhew that there is nothing between his teeth: Afterwards, for about half a quarter of an hour, he talks in Italian; which time being paſs'd, he drinks three or four and twenty more of the ſaid glaſſes, and thereupon ſpouts forth of his mouth with violence a red water, which ſeems to be wine, but hath only the colour of it. This water appears red as it comes out of his mouth, and yet when it is ſpouted into two of his glaſſes, it becomes of a deep red in one, and of a pale red in the other; and changing the ſituation of his glaſſes, on the left ſide of his mouth to the right, and of thoſe on the right to the left, theſe colours always appear different in the ſame glaſs; namely, the one of a deep red, and the other yellow, or Citron-color. Some of the water is of the color of pall'd wine; and the more he vomits, the clearer, and leſs colour'd the water is. He hath often promis'd to bring up Oyl and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:66371:182"/>
Milk; but I never ſaw nor heard that he did it. This done, he ſets his glaſſes to the number of fifteen or ſixteen upon a form or bench, to be ſeen by every one. After which, he drinks more water in other glaſſes, and brings it up again either clear water, or Orenge flower water, or Roſe-water; and laſtly, <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> (which are manifeſt by the ſmell, and by the burning of the <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi>) having been obſerv'd to keep this order always in the ejection of his liquors, that red water comes up firſt, and <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> laſt. He performs this Trick with thirty or forty half glaſſes of water, which cannot amount to above four quarts at moſt; then having ſignifi'd to the people that his Stomack, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no Muſcle, (which is the inſtrument of voluntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) obeys him, he caſts the ſame water up into the Air with its natural colour ſo impetuouſly, that it imitates the Caſts of water in Gardens, to the great admiration of the Spectators, who for ſix we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks together, were ſeldom fewer than three hundred daily. For my part, I find much to admire in this action. For though men's Stomacks be of different capacities, and ſome one perſon can eat and drink as much as four others; yet I ſee not, poſſibly, where this fellow ſhould lodge ſo much water. And again, he ſeems rather to powr water into a Tun than to ſwallow it, though the conformation of the Gullet doth not conſiſt with ſuch deglutition. Beſides, vomiting is a violent action, and yet moſt facile in this Drinker. And as to the order of this Evacuation, 'tis certain, that all things put into the Stomack are confounded together therein, ſo that Concoction begins by Mixtion; and yet this fellow brings up what-ever he pleaſes, as 'twere out of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral veſſels; ſo that he undertakes to eat a Sallad of ſeveral ſorts of Herbs and Flowers, and to bring them up all again in order. Moreover, what can be more prodigious, than this mutation of Colours, Smells, and Subſtances? And, indeed, they ſay, he hath ſometimes fear'd to be queſtion'd for Sorcery. But the greateſt wonder is that ſmartneſs and violence wherewith he ſpouts out water from his Stomack, not laterally, which is the ordinary manner of vomiting; but upwards, which is a motion contrary to heavie bodies, as water is. Some ſpeculative perſon that had read in Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that a Man's being turn'd into a Horſe by the power of Imagination, might refer the cauſe of all theſe wonders to that faculty; which daily producing new ſhapes upon the Bodies of Children in their Mothers womb, may with leſs ſtrangeneſs, produce in this Man the above-mention'd alteration of one colour into another. And as for his facility of bringing up what-ever he hath ſwallow'd, I can find no better Reaſon for it than Cuſtom, which in him is turn'd into Nature.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Ignorance being the Mother of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we begin leſs to admire as we proceed to more Knowledg. Now if this <hi>Malteſe</hi> were a Magician, he would do more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous things, and of more than one ſort; whereas all his power is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:66371:182"/>
only to the vomiting up of liquors which he drunk before; and the faculty of his Stomack being determin'd to this ſingle kind of action, the ſame muſt be natural; becauſe that is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of natural powers. Moreover, no action ought to be accus'd of Magick, till good Reaſons have evinc'd it to ſurpaſs all the powers of Nature; which is very hard to prove, becauſe we know not how far they may reach: And ſhould we accuſe of Magick every thing when we underſtand not the Cauſes, almoſt all Natural Philoſophy would be turn'd into ſuperſtition. Again, a Man that promiſes more than he can perform, drinking but the twentieth part of what he boaſts of, and who can make but one ſort of colour iſſue out of his mouth, though he expoſes ſeveral others to the Spectator's Eyes, cannot paſs for a great Sorcerer, or refin'd Magician. As for the eaſineſs and violence where-with he caſts water out of his Stomack at pleaſure, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be either from Artifice or Cuſtom alone, which cannot put free and voluntary motions into parts wherein there is none, nor procure new Organs neceſſary to this action; and no Man being able to accuſtom himſelf to move his Ears at his pleaſure, unleſs the ſame be naturally diſpos'd thereunto, as <hi>Manfrede</hi>'s Stomack is. Now natural diſpoſitions are only of two ſorts; ſome depend upon the Temperament, which is incapable of this effect; others, belong to the Stomack, as it is an Organical part; namely, a particular Conformation, which may be eaſily conjectur'd from the example of ruminating Animals, who when they liſt, bring up their food out of their Stomack into their mouth: An action not impoſſible to Men; ſince Nature oftentimes by error gives one Species ſuch a Conformation in ſome parts, as is of right peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to another; and accordingly the faculty of ruminating is found in divers Men. <hi>Aquapendens</hi> ſaw two to whom this action was more voluntary than that whereby we void our excrements, when they importunately ſolicite us; obſerving expreſly that they were not conſtrain'd to it, but by the pleaſure which they took in it. And the ſame Author likewiſe records, that opening the Body of one that ruminated, he found one Membrane of his Stomack more fibrous and ſtrong than ordinary. And the ſame is probably ſo in that of this <hi>Malteſe,</hi> ſince this voluntary motion can proceed only from ſuch a Conformation. In like manner theſe perſons that have been able to move their Ears, have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to have the Muſcles behind them more fleſhy than other Men. And our Conjecture is further confirm'd by the Inſtance of the Bladder, whoſe Excretion is perform'd by the Pyramidal Muſcles, which oftentimes are deficient; and in that caſe their office is ſupply'd by the carnous Membrane of the Bladder which is valid, and performs the motions of a Muſcle, according to the opinion of the greateſt Anatomiſts of this Age. So that what is ſo ordinary in the Bladder, is not to be admir'd in the Stomack: Beſides that, Cuſtom may have much increas'd the ſtrength and dexterity of this faculty; and although it have not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:66371:183"/>
conduc'd in the leaſt to the effect, but only as founded upon a natural Diſpoſition. That all ruminating have not been able to do the like, is, becauſe they neglected to increaſe the natural Diſpoſition by uſe and practiſe; and as to the diverſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſmells, there is nothing therein but artifice and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That what is here thought moſt admirable, the drinking of a great quantity of Water, is ſeen every day at <hi>Pougues</hi> and <hi>Forges,</hi> where you ſhall have one Perſon drink ſixty glaſſes: and thoſe that have ſeen the Stomach, that hangs up in the Anatomical Theater of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and is capable of ſeven quarts, will not think it ſtrange, that this <hi>Malteſe</hi> drinks much leſs: As for the diverſity of Liquors, which he brings up, diſcern'd by their ſeveral colours, ſmells, and the inflammability of the <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> I attribute it to the perfection of the reaſonable ſoul, which, as well as all other forms, imprints Diſpoſitions in the matter; this being univerſal, that, beſides the Properties common to the whole Species, there is a particular one in every Individual which diſtinguiſhes the ſame from others, and comes from the laſt Character of the form. That of the <hi>Malteſe,</hi> is to turn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water into Wine, Orenge-flower-water, Roſe-water, and <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> For the diverſity of matter, and its diſpoſitions, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing as to the mutations introduc'd therein by the Forms; though one may ſay, that in common Water, eſpecially that of the Well, all the Elements, and the three Principles of Chymiſtry are found, having its Salt from the Earth, its Sulphur from the Bitumen and Naphtha, wherewith the Caverns of the Earth, and eſpecially Wells abound; and, as for Mercury, 'tis nothing but water it ſelf. No wonder then, if ſince every thing may be made of every thing, by the Maxim of the moſt ancient Philoſophers, our <hi>Malteſe</hi> fetches what he pleaſes out of his Stomack.</p>
            <p>The Fourth wonder'd, if this Maxim were true, That every thing is made of every thing in the <hi>Malteſe</hi>'s Belly, even without any diſtinction or preparation of the matter, why this Water-drinker fetcht ſo great a circuit to get money, ſince 'twould be a ſhorter way for him to make it, and even Gold it ſelf by the ſame reaſon; or at leaſt he would make ſale of his ſweet Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not ſuffer the Perfumers to be at ſuch charge in fetching them from far. If he make it his excuſe, that he would not get vent for ſuch an abundance, why, if there be no cheat in the thing, hath he not taken occaſion of the dearneſs of Wine in <hi>France</hi> this year, to ſell the Wine he makes in <hi>Paris?</hi> But Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence renders it manifeſt, that the Wine he promiſes is nothing but water, and conſequently, he is leſs able to make <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> into which water cannot be turn'd but by firſt taking the nature of Wine; and indeed there needs more wine to yield the quantity of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> he pretends to bring up, then he drinks water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ejects it. Beſides, Chymiſtry manifeſts, that <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> is
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:66371:183"/>
not made, but only ſeparated. Nor can this change be a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Malteſes</hi> Stomack, becauſe all Properties are ſpecifical, and belong to all the Individuals of the ſame Species, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing peculiar in any man, but a certain degree of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible temperament, call'd Idio-ſyncraſie. And, if his temper be ſo hot as to turn common water in an inſtant into <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> 'tis impoſſible to be cold enough to make Roſe-water at the ſame time: if it have any tranſmuting vertue, it ought to turn all into one ſort of Liquor; becauſe the ſame Agent never makes but the ſame Effect, unleſs the Subject be diverſifi'd by diverſity of matter; whereas here 'tis all water from the ſame Spring. Neither could this Drinker drink Well-water without intoxication, becauſe, being turn'd into <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> the vapors thereof would mount up into his brain; and ſo to preſcribe him water in a Feaver, would be no more refreſhment to him then if one gave him <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth ſaid, That the diverſity of colours and odors of the Liquor he ejects, proceeds from the tincture of ſome maſs of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence extracted from the ſame materials, which thoſe Liquors repreſent; which Maſſes he holds between his teeth incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſome gum which faſtens them there; ſo that, as the Water he drinks, paſſes impetuouſly between his teeth, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives colours and odors from the ſame: Which is the reaſon why the water he firſt caſts forth, is moſt colour'd; whereas, if the Dye proceeded from his Stomack, it would be deeper at laſt of all, as having acquir'd more digeſtion by a longer infuſion.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That Hiſtories are full of ſeveral particular Conſtitutions of the Natural Parts; witneſs the example of the Maid mention'd by <hi>Cardan,</hi> who drinking but two pints of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a day, piſs'd twenty; and that of the Emperor <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who commonly eat forty pound weight of meat, with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable drink, and ſweat ſo abundantly, that he fill'd — 'Tis ſaid, That <hi>Theagenes</hi> the Thaſian eat a Calf for his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and <hi>Milo,</hi> the famous Wraſtler of <hi>Croton,</hi> devour'd a 100. pound of Fleſh, a Hogſhead of Wine, and Bread proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Such was that Paraſite, who one day at the Table of the Emperor <hi>Aurelius,</hi> eat a Boar, a Sheep, a Pig, and an hundred Loaves, and drunk half a tun of Wine. All which ſtories ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der leſs ſtrange the quantity of this <hi>Malteſe</hi>'s Drink, whoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour poſſibly afterwards he diſguiſes with powders hid in his Handkerchief which he handles ſo often, or by the help of a double Glaſs, of which his Veſſels are made, or by ſome other trick whereto he ha's inur'd himſelf for many years.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, That mineral waters are uſually drunk with more eaſe in great quantity by half than common water can be, becauſe their tenuity makes them paſs immediately into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body. And if you conſider that this fellow drinks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of ſmall veſſels, and thoſe not always full; as alſo with what nimbleneſs he diſpatches his work, you will much abate
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:66371:184"/>
the opinion that he drinks ſo much as is generally believed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, though his pail be of a middle ſize, yet 'tis never quite full; and he ſpends much water in waſhing his mouth and his glaſſes, and ſome too is left behind. Nor is it abſurd to think, that before his ſhewing himſelf to drink, he ſwallows a bolus of Brazil, or of Alkanet, or Fearn Root, or of red Sanders, or Indian Wood, or ſome ſuch other thing in powder; after which drinking two or three glaſſes of water, he interpoſes ſome interval, that the ſame may be the better tinctur'd in his Stomack; which time being paſs'd, he drinks about two quarts of water, which ſoon after he brings up red, appearing ſo both in the Air and in the glaſſes: Which colour being weak for want of time to be well imbib'd by the water, is wholly loſt when the ſame is powr'd into a veſſel, wherein there is a little Verjuice, Vinegar, juice of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, Spirit of Vitriol, or other ſuch acid liquor, which is proper to conſume the ſaid color. And 'tis obſervable, that the laſt water he vomits, is continually paler than the firſt, the tincture being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſht by the quantity of water. Add hereunto, that 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his glaſſes are ſmear'd with ſome eſſences, which ſeem tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the Spectators; for though he makes ſhew of waſhing them, he only paſſes the brims dextrouſly over the water, and lets none of it enter into them. As for the violence wherewith he ſpouts forth the water, it muſt be confeſs'd, that the fellow hath a great natural propenſity to vomiting, which by frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, is become habitual to him: Cuſtom being capable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch effects, that I have ſeen a Beggar about fifty years old, by being exercis'd thereunto, piſs as high as a pike.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCII. Why dead Bodies bleed in the preſence of their Murderers.</head>
            <p>HOneſt Antiquity was ſo deſirous of knowing the Truth, that when natural and ordinary proofs fail'd, they had recourſe to ſupernatural and extraordinary. Such was the Jews water of Jealouſie, which made the otherwiſe undiſcoverable Adulterer burſt in ſunder; the innocent Veſtal's Sieve, in which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of Inceſt, ſhe carry'd water without ſhedding. Such alſo were the Oaths made upon Saint <hi>Anthonie</hi>'s arm, of ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, that 'twas believ'd the perjur'd would burn a year with the fire of that Saint; and in our time the excommunication of Saint <hi>Genevieſue,</hi> which thoſe that incurr, are commonly reckon'd not to out-live a year. In like ſort the zeal of Men againſt that horrid crime of Murder, hath made them cheriſh a perſwaſion, that a Carkaſe will bleed before its Murderers; (though moſt ſlain Bodies bleed when they are ſtirr'd) that ſo the Conſcience of the Actors being diſturb'd, they might either by word or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:66371:184"/>
be brought to make diſcovery of themſelves. For, indeed, the Blood which was congeal'd in the Veins preſently after death, becomes liquid again after two or three dayes, when it is in its tendency to corruption; which Liquefaction, and the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the Murderer, hapning commonly at the ſame time, 'tis no wonder if the Body bleed in the Murderer's preſence, ſince it doth ſo frequently when he is abſent. Yet becauſe this falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion from the co-incidence of times, ceaſes not ſometimes to have its effect, and to diſcover Truth; therefore Legiſlators have thought fit to authorize it, and to uſe it as an Argument at leaſt to frighten the Murderer; though, indeed, 'tis no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive one to condemn him.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That 'tis not credible that Courts of Juſtice who often admit this proof to good purpoſe, could ſo continue in ignorance of Natural Cauſes, as not to diſcern the effuſion of Blood enſuing upon its putrefaction in the Veins, from that which happens upon confrontation of a Murderer. 'Tis better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſeek further for the cauſe, than to queſtion the effect; which ſome attribute to ſome ſecret Antipathy of the murder'd perſon's blood to that of his Murderer; or elſe to their mutual emiſſion of ſpirits, which ſtill ſeeking the deſtruction of each other's perſon, thoſe of the Murderer being the ſtrongeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſtill living, cauſe a commotion in the Blood of the dead, which thereupon breaks forth at the out-let of the wound; <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella</hi> attributes it to the ſenſe where-with all things are indu'd, and which ſtill remains in theſe dead Bodies; ſo that having a ſenſe of their Murderers, and perceiving them near hand, they ſuffer two very different motions, Trembling and Anger, which cauſe ſuch a commotion in the Blood, that it flows forth at the wound. For the ſpirits, which during life had ſuch perceptions as were neceſſary for their receiving and obeying the Soul's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, retain ſomewhat thereof after death, and are capable of diſcerning their friends and their enemies.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, If this opinion concerning the emanation of ſpirits, whether by Sympathy or Antipathy, be true, it will follow, That one who hath done a Murder with gun-ſhot, cannot be diſcover'd by this ſign; and that one ſlain in his Wife's arms, and in a crowd of his friends that endeavor'd to defend his life, will bleed rather in the preſence of his friends than of his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, whoſe ſpirits are more inwardly retir'd through fear of puniſhment; whereas thoſe of his friends are ſent outwards by Anger and deſire of Revenge: Yea, if the Murderer had been wounded before, he ſhould rather bleed than the dead, becauſe his Blood is more boyling, and capable of commotion by the ſpirits iſſuing out of the Carkaſe. And had they any Sympathy, they could not diſcover the Murderer for want of ſenſe, which they never had; for the ſpirits which are in the Blood ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that name, being purely natural, and void of all ſenſe even during life, and ſpecifically different from the animal ſpirits. The
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:66371:185"/>
vital ſpirits which are a degree above them, vaniſh together with life, whence the Arteries that us'd to contain them are empty. And thoſe that ſerve for Senſation cannot remain in a dead Body, becauſe they are eaſily diſſipable, and need continual reparation; whence we ſee all the ſenſes fail in a ſwoon, becauſe the Heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits them not by a continuity of their generation: Beſides, ſhould they remain after death, they would be unactive for want of fit diſpoſitions in the Organs. Moreover, natural cauſes act neceſſarily when their object is preſent; but ſometime tis known, that Murderers have thruſt themſelves more diligently into the crowd of Spectators than any other perſons, for avoiding ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no ſuch bleeding hath hapned in their preſence; and that Executioners take Criminals the next day from the Gallows or the Wheel, and not a drop of Blood iſſues from their wounds. And why ſhould not a dead Sheep as well fall a bleeding afreſh in the preſence of the Butcher that kill'd it? Or a Man mortally wounded, when he that did it is brought unknown into his Chamber? For 'tis hard to imagine that we have leſs ſenſe and knowledge whilſt life remains than after death, that a wounded perſon muſt die that he may become ſenſible. In ſhort, tis eaſie to ſee that this effect is not like other wonders which have a cauſe in Nature; becauſe though we cannot aſſign the particular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe, yet they are prov'd by ſome demonſtrative, or at leaſt ſome probable reaſons. And as for Antipathy, it ſhould rather concenter all the dead perſon's Blood in his Murderer's preſence, and make it retire to the inward parts. Wherefore, I conclude, that not only the cauſes of this miracle are not yet found, but alſo that 'tis impoſſible there ſhould be any natural one of it at all.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That according to the opinion of <hi>Avicenna,</hi> who holds, That the Imagination acts even beyond, and out of its Subject, this faculty may cauſe the effluxion of Blood; the Criminal's Phanſie working mightily when the perſon ſlain by him is objected before his Eyes; And the nitrous vapors ariſing out of the Earth upon digging up the Body, together with the heat of the Air greater than that of the Earth, and increas'd by the conflux of Spectators, may in ſome meaſure contribute to the new fermentation of the Blood. But the truth is, after all our inquiries, this extraordinary motion cannot be better aſcrib'd elſewhere, than to God's Providence, who ſometimes performs this miracle for the diſcovery of Murder, which would otherwiſe be unpuniſht, but not always. And 'tis no leſs impiety to deny, that Divine Juſtice comes ſometimes to the aid of that of Men, than 'tis ignorance and ruſticity to be ſatisfi'd in all caſes with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cauſes, without recurring to particular ones; which God employes moſt ordinarily for the Production of Effects, yet does not ſo tye his power to the neceſſity of their operations, but that he interrupts the ſame when he pleaſes, even ſo far as to give clay power to open the Eyes of the blind.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCIII. Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn.</head>
            <p>THere are no greater impoſtures in the Art of Phyſick than thoſe which relate to Antidotes and Preſervatives from Poyſon, ſuch as the Unicorn's Horn is held to be: And I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, if it be not a popular error. Firſt, becauſe the opinions of all Authors are ſo contrary concerning it. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in the life of <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſaith, that the Animal of this name is an Aſs, and is found in the fenns of <hi>Colchis,</hi> having one ſingle horn in the fore-head, where-with he fights furiously againſt the Elephant. <hi>Cardan,</hi> after <hi>Pliny,</hi> ſaith 'tis a Horſe, as 'tis moſt commonly painted; only it hath a Stag's head, a Martin's ſkin, a ſhort neck, ſhort mane, and a cloven hoof, and is bred only in the Deſarts of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> amongſt the Serpents, whoſe Poyſon its horn which is three cubits long reſiſts. <hi>Garſius ab Horto</hi> ſaith, 'tis an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Animal, bred on Land near the Cape of good Hope, but delighting in the Sea, having an Horſes head and mane, a horn two cubits long, which he alone of all Authors affirms to be move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able every way. Moſt agree that it cannot be tam'd; and yet <hi>Lewis Vartoman</hi> ſaith, that he ſaw two tame ones in Cages at <hi>Mecha,</hi> which had been ſent to <hi>Sultan Solyman.</hi> Almoſt all confeſs it very rare, and yet <hi>Marcus Sherer,</hi> a Renegado German, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards call'd <hi>Idaith Aga,</hi> and Embaſſador from the ſame <hi>Solyman</hi> to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, affirms that he ſaw whole troops of them in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi>; And <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> the ſame in the Kingdom of <hi>Baſman</hi>; where they are almoſt as big as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, having feet like theirs, a ſkin like Camels, the head of a Boar, and delighting in mire like ſwine. Nor are Authors leſs various concerning its manner of eating; ſome alledging, that being unable to feed on the ground by reaſon of his horn, he lives only on the boughs and fruits of Trees, or on what is given him by the hands of Men, eſpecially of fair Virgins, of whom, they ſay, he is amorous; though others think it fabulous. Some believe that there was once ſuch an Animal, but not now; the whole race periſhing in the Deluge; and that the horns we find now, for the moſt part in the earth, have been kept there ever ſince. And if there be ſuch variety in the deſcription of this Animal, there is no leſs in the horns, which they tell us are thoſe of the Unicorn. That at Saint <hi>Dennis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is about ſeven foot high, weighs thirty pound four ounces, being wreath'd and terminated in a point from a broad baſe. Yet this is not comparable to that <hi>Aelian</hi> mentions, which was ſo thick that cups might be made of it. That at <hi>Strasburg</hi> hath ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with this of Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Venice</hi> differ from both, as that deſcrib'd by <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> doth from all. For
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:66371:186"/>
'tis, ſaith he, ſolid like a Hearts horn, ten foot high, and very large at the baſe. The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> have one, which was ſometimes found on the bank of a River near <hi>Bruges,</hi> two cubits long, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without, white within, odorous, and apt to take fire. That at <hi>Rome</hi> is but one foot high, having been diminiſh'd by being frequently raſp'd in order to be imploy'd againſt Poyſon; 'tis alſo ſmooth and ſhining like Ivory. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> who writ a Treatiſe of this Subject, ſaith, he ſaw one ſo big at <hi>Niclaſbourg,</hi> that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the rib of a Whale rather than a Horn. <hi>Becanus</hi> the Queen of <hi>Hungarie</hi>'s Phyſician, ſpeaks of one at <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſeven foot high, ſo faſtned to the ſkull of the Animal, that it was bow'd backwards along the back bone, and could not ſerve to trouble the water for repelling its venenoſity, (as Authors ſay it doth) nor yet be of any defence, which is the uſe of horns, except by bowing down the head between the fore-legs, as Bulls do in their fights. It was alſo white; and yet <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith, it muſt be black: And <hi>Cteſias,</hi> Phyſician to King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it but one cubit high, purple towards the point, and black at the baſe. Which variety makes ſome believe, that all theſe are the horns of Fiſhes, or Sea-monſters, there being no Element ſuſceptible of more varieties: Whereunto that Fiſh is to be referr'd which <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> calls <hi>Monoceros,</hi> from its having one horn in the Fore-head; the opinion of thoſe that think the Unicorn was the Rhinoceros. <hi>Pliny,</hi> after <hi>Cteſias,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that ſome Oxen in <hi>India,</hi> have but one horn, and are not cloven hoof'd. <hi>Aelian</hi> and <hi>Oppian</hi> report the like of others in <hi>Aonia</hi>; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> of others in the Hercinian Foreſt; and <hi>Lewis Barthema,</hi> that he ſaw ſuch Cows in <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> In brief, as 'tis agreed that there are Animals with one Horn, ſo 'tis impoſſible to know which is that whereunto Antiquity gave the Appellation of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn by way of excellence; which incertainty, thoſe Kings and States that have them teſtifie, by keeping them in their treaſures for ſhew only, not for uſe, and not making them into drinking veſſels, which (according to <hi>Aelian</hi>) retun'd the hurtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all Poyſons. Add hereunto, that 'tis not credible the <hi>Romans</hi> who ſubdu'd moſt of the acceſſible world, and were very careful to delight their people with ſpectacles of the rareſt beaſts, would not have forgot to ſhew them Unicorns, if there had been any. But were there a Unicorn, I ſhould not eſteem its virtues ſuch as they are deſcrib'd, being countenanc'd by the authority neither of <hi>Galen</hi> nor <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> So that <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth's Phyſician ſaid, he would have taken away the cuſtom of putting a piece of this horn into the King's Cup, but that it was good to leave an opinion of its virtue in the minds of the vulgar. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the marks given of it are like all the reſt, equivocal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and ridiculous. For they ſay, a true is diſcern'd from a falſe by the ebullition the true one cauſeth in water when caſt thereinto; which nevertheleſs all porous Bodies do, as burnt bones, lime, brick, and ſuch other things wherein there are many
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:66371:186"/>
cavities. Others diſcover it by giving ſome of it in powder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a doſe of Arſenick to a Cock, or a little Dog; whom it will not only ſecure, but almoſt revive when dead, and yet all that can be gather'd upon trial, is, that we ſee thoſe Animals that have taken this antidote, die more ſlowly than others. Which is ſuppos'd to happen by the aſtriction that all horn cauſeth in the mouth of the Stomack, and the other Veſſels, whence the exhalation of the Spirits is retarded. The trial of ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericks is yet more ridiculous; they boaſt, that if a Circle be deſcrib'd with a piece of this horn upon a Table, and an Adder or Spider laid in the middle of it, they can never come out of it; and, that theſe Animals die, if only held a quarter of an hour under the ſhadow of this Horn. Some add, that this horn ſweats in the preſence of poyſon, which ſeems abſurd: becauſe in this caſe the counter-poiſon ſuffers from the poyſon, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, muſt be ſtrongeſt and moſt active of the two. In brief, theſe numerous Contradictions, Impoſſibilities, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties make me conclude this Story of the Unicorn a meer Fiction.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid. If the Verity of things were ſhaken by the falſe conceits others have of them, there would be no Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe there are oftentimes ignorant ones; no point of Right, becauſe many know it not; no true Deluge, becauſe the Poets feign'd that of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi>; no true Religion, becauſe the Pagans and others have had falſe ones. On the contrary, as the Romances, concerning <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> were built upon the truth of his admirable exploits, ſo 'tis credible, that the marvellous effects of the Unicorn's Horn have given both great and ſmall occaſion to ſpeak of it, and out of ignorance of the Truth to feign much more then the Truth concerning it. The objection taken from the verity of deſcriptions of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, and from that which is obſerv'd in ſeveral Horns, (of about twenty whereof found in the treaſures of Princes and States of <hi>Europe</hi> there are not two altogether alike) is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding; ſince the ſame may be ſaid of moſt other Animals, who according to the diverſity of Climats change their colour, and oftentimes ſhape too, yea, in one and the ſame place, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer according to their Ages. Moreover, the Error is very excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in Authors that have treated of the Unicorn, in taking (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth) the Greek name <hi>Monoceros,</hi> and the Latin <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicornis,</hi> for a Noun Adjective applicable to every ſort of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals that have but one Horn, as many have not. Some indeed have confounded <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> with <hi>Monoceros</hi> through the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of their cadence, which <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> the Romans had in their Spectacles or Shows, and is deſcrib'd by <hi>Martial</hi> ſo furious, that he threw a Bear up into the Air, as one would do a Ball: But it follows not, that they had no Unicorns in their Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theaters, becauſe there is no mention made of any; an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from Negative Authority not being demonſtrative:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66371:187"/>
and, granting it was unknown to them, it follows not thence that there is no ſuch thing in Nature; not only becauſe they knew not the greateſt part of the World, but alſo, becauſe this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is repreſented ſo furious, that it cannot be taken alive; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in its perfect Age, being fierce even to thoſe of its own Species of either Sex, and only accoſtable at the time of their Copulation. <hi>Philo</hi> after <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith, That the Brachmans call it <hi>Cartazonon,</hi> that 'tis of the bigneſs of a Horſe, of a bay co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, very nimble of body, eſpecially of the legs, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out joints; that it hath the tail of a Boar, one horn between the eyes, black, ſtreak'd like a Snail, and ending in a very ſharp point, two cubits long; that it hath a hoarſe voice, is leſs furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards other Beaſts, than to thoſe of its own Species, with whom it fights inceſſantly, unleſs when they are at rut. There are alſo ancient Medals repreſenting this Animal putting his horn into a Cup; which 'tis thought were <hi>Alexander</hi>'s. <hi>Aeneas Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> affirm, That Unicorns are found in the Mountains of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Cathay</hi>; though the marks this latter give them, agree better to the <hi>Rhinoceros:</hi> But theſe Authorities are not conſiderable in reſpect of that of the H. Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'tis ſaid, Deut. 28. <hi>His horns ſhall be like that of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn:</hi> and Pſal. 22. <hi>Deliver me, O God, from the Lion's mouth, thou haſt heard me alſo from among the horns of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns:</hi> and Pſal. 29. <hi>He maketh</hi> Lebanon <hi>and</hi> Sirion <hi>to ſkip like a young <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi>; and Pſal. 92. <hi>My horns ſhalt thou exalt like the horn of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi>; and Iſaiah 34. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns ſhall come down with them, and the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks with the bulls. Job</hi> alſo ſpeaks of it, chap. 39. Add to theſe Authorities the experience and example of ſo many Kings and States, who would not think their treaſure well furniſh'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had an Unicorn's horn. For, the matter that makes teeth, being transferr'd to the generation of horns, and ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſublim'd; 'tis certain, that all Horns have an Alexiterical Vertue, by which they reſiſt Feavers, cure Fluxes of the belly, kill Worms, and ſerve for many other Remedies to Man: but when this already great Vertue comes to be united into one ſingle Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, as it happens in the Unicorn, the ſame is mightily augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And 'tis too much detraction from the power of Nature, to deny ſuch Vertue to be found in inanimate Bodies, as in the Serpentine Tongues found in the Caves of <hi>Malta,</hi> ſealed Earths, and Minerals, ſuch as thoſe they call for that reaſon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicornu minerale,</hi> not becauſe taken from Unicorn's bury'd under ground ever ſince the time of the Deluge, but becauſe of their Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in Vertues, Properties, and outward Figure: and indeed there is ſo much of this Mineral Unicorn's horn, and Mineral Ivory found, that 'tis not credible it ever belong'd to any Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. Nor is this truth prejudic'd by [the] tricks of Impoſtors, who make counterfeit Unicorn's horns of Ivory, or other horns, or the bones, of Elephants, and other Animals kept for ſome time under ground, whereby they acquire more ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:66371:187"/>
and ſome tranſparency, by means of the ſalt of the Earth, which inſinuates thereinto, as it doth to Porcellane, which for that reaſon is bury'd a whole Age: nor by the ebullition that ſome other natural and artificial bodies cauſe, or by the ſweating of ſome Stones upon the approach of poyſon, which proceeds from the poyſon's inſpiſſating the Air, which thereupon ſticks to the next ſolid body. Nor is the colour material; ſince proceſs of time may alter it; beſides that, the Ancients attribute blackneſs only to the horns of the Indian Aſs, and the Rhinoceros: And, as for the ſmell found in the Unicorn's horn in <hi>Suizzerland,</hi> 'tis an argument, that the ſame is either adulterate, or a Mineral one; the texture of the horns being too cloſe to evaporate any thing; and thoſe that have diſtill'd them by fires, find, that they abound with an inodorous Salt, and a ſtinking Sulphur. In ſhort, 'tis not credible, <hi>Clement</hi> VII. <hi>Paul</hi> III. and divers others, would have taken this Animal for their Arms, if there were no ſuch; nor do Popes ſo much want underſtanding men, that <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> III. would have bought a fragment of it for 12000. crowns; whereof his Phyſitian made uſe ſucceſsfully in the cure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes that had any thing of venenoſity. <hi>Marſilius Ficinus, Braſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavola, Matthiolus, Aloiſius, Mundela,</hi> and many other Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, recommend it in ſuch diſeaſes, eſpecially in the Peſtilence, the Biting of a mad Dog, Worms, Falling-ſickneſs, and other ſuch hideous Maladies. To conclude, I conceive, that effects which depend upon occult Properties, as this doth, ought not to be raſhly condemn'd; being mindful that our knowledg is limited, and therefore, the Authorities, Reaſons, and Experiences, which eſtabliſh the Unicorn's horn, and its wonderful Effects are to be yielded to; only with exception to Impoſture.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCIV. Of Satyrs.</head>
            <p>NOvelty and extraordinary things have ſuch power upon our Minds, that they not only render us attentive when they are preſent, but remain longer imprinted in the Memory; as thoſe, that teach the Art of Memory truly obſerve. This oblig'd many Poets and Hiſtorians to ſpeak of Hydra's, Chimaera's, Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſks, Satyrs, Centaurs, and other ſuch Fictions. For thoſe that have moſt exactly examin'd the power of Nature, find the mixture of theſe Species impoſſible, not only on the part of the Matter which is to receive the Soul, to which it is determin'd by a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, but alſo in reſpect of the Form, which is indiviſible, eſpecially the Rational Soul. To which purpoſe the Poet <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> ſpeaks very learnedly, and maintains, that there can be no Centaurs; and the reaſon he alledges, holds as well againſt
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:66371:188"/>
the poſſibility of Satyrs: Becauſe, ſaith he, if this mixture of the humane and equine Nature had place, Horſes being in their full ſtrength at three years old, at which time children ſcarce leave ſucking the breaſts of their Nurſe, how is it poſſible this monſtrous Animal ſhould be in its tender age and full growth both together? And again, a Horſe growing, when the Man enters into the prime of his youth, how can the one dye, when the other is in the ſtate of its greateſt vigour? Now Goats live leſs time than Horſes, and ſo there is leſs probability for an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal compounded of the Nature of a Goat and a Man. Hence <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the ſeventh book of his Natural Hiſtory, ſaith, That a Hippocentaur being bred in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> it dy'd the ſame day, and was afterwards preſerv'd in honey, which is an excellent bawm. <hi>Virgil</hi> places them at the entrance of Hell, becauſe things againſt Nature cannot ſubſiſt. And S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in the life of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Hermit, relating how a Centaur appeard to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> doubts whether it were a true Centaur, or the Devil under that ſhape; and indeed ſeems to infer it an Evil Spirit, becauſe it was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away by the ſign of the Croſs. So that Satyrs are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed only to the liberty Poets have ever taken, as well as Painters of daring and attempting every thing, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Rule <hi>Horace</hi> preſcribes them not to conjoyn Natures totally diſagreeing and oppoſite; for, by theſe mixtures they intended only to repreſent very nimble, laſcivious, ruſtick, and perhaps abuſive men; (whence came their Satyrick Poems.)</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That 'tis as dangerous to conclude all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that we have not ſeen, as to be credulous to every thing. But when Reaſon, and the authority Experience carries with it, are of a ſide, our incredulity, hath no excuſe. Now the caſe of Satyrs is ſuch; for they may be as well produc'd by the mixture of the Seeds of two Species, as Mules are. Beſides, were not the Imagination of Mothers capable of imprinting this as well as any other change of Figure in a Child's body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have daily examples; yet the wild ſuckling and courſe of life ſome Children may have had amongſt Goats (as <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> had from a Wolf) may in proceſs of time have begot ſome reſemblance of ſhape in them. As for <hi>Lucretius</hi>'s Reaſon, we ſee that Plants are ingrafted into others, not only of the ſame, but alſo of a different Species, as the Apple-Cyon on a Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort; which Plants being of different durations, the graft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of a middle duration between them, namely longer-liv'd then a Colewort, and ſhorter then another Apple-tree. And S. <hi>Hierom</hi> is not poſitive, that the Centaur, which appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> was an illuſion, but doubts whether it were a true Centaur ſuch as Antiquity ſpoke of, or whether 'twas not the Devil appearing in that ſhape to frighten that holy Perſon. And, <hi>Plato, in convivio ſapientum,</hi> relates, That a Shepheard having preſented to <hi>Periander</hi> a Foal born of a Mare of his, that had the head, neck, and hands of a Man, the reſt of an Horſe;
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:66371:188"/>
and the voice of a Child, <hi>Diocles</hi> affirm'd, that this Prodigy preſag'd Seditions and Diviſions of Minds: But <hi>Thales</hi> reply'd, 'Twas a natural thing, and, for preventing the like again, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him to have no other Horſ-keepers but what were married. <hi>Pliny,</hi> likewiſe in the ſeventh Book of his Natural Hiſtory, ſaith, That in the Country of the <hi>Cratadulones,</hi> amongſt the Indian Mountains, Satyrs are found; very ſwift Creatures, running ſometimes on two feet, ſometimes on four, and having the ſhape of a Man. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s life, That, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> a Satyr was brought to him like thoſe deſcrib'd by ancient Authors, half-man, and half-goat; and being aſkt what he was, anſwer'd nothing that reſembled a humane voice, but with a tone mixt of that of Goats, and the neighing of Horſes. Whereupon, <hi>Sylla,</hi> having compaſſion on him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed guards to carry him back. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd place deſcribes another Satyr, which, he ſaith, was of a middle ſtature, having a crooked Noſe, horned front, and Goats feet, and brought Dates yet hanging on a Palm-branch, to S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit. The Saint askt him what he was, and he anſwer'd, that he was a Mortal, one of the Inhabitants of that Hermitage, whom the abuſed Pagans adore, for Fauns, Satyrs, and Incubes; and I come (ſaith he) as deputed to you from our Company, to deſire you to pray for us to your and our God, whom we know to be come into the World, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation. After which words, this light Animal took its courſe and fled away. And leſt this Relation might ſeem ſtrange, I ſhall add, That under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> a living one was brought to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſhewn there to the People; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being dead, it was called and carried to <hi>Antioch</hi> to be ſeen by the Emperor. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> records alſo, That he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by one <hi>Euphemius,</hi> who, (he ſaith) was a man worthy of credit, how that ſailing into <hi>Spain,</hi> he was driven by ſtorm into certain Iſlands full of ſavage Men, having hairy bodies, long tails, like thoſe of Horſes, and red hair; whom they could not keep off from them, but by blows; and a Woman being expos'd on the ſhore by the Mariners, theſe Satyrs abus'd her with all outrages imaginable. So that to doubt of the exiſtence of Satyrs after ſo many Teſtimonies, is, to aſcribe too much to our own ſenſes, and too little to the witneſs of the Ancients.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCV. Of the Phoenix.</head>
            <p>IF ever there were cauſe to admire the ſimplicity and credulity of the Ancients, 'tis the ſtory of the Phoenix, which is feign'd a Bird that lives many ages, after which repairing to the City <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it builds its neſt, or rather funeral pile, there of aromatick wood, which, by reaſon of its high ſituation being fir'd by the Sun-beams, ſhe dyes, and immediately another ariſes out of her aſhes; it being as impoſſible for Nature to be without a Phoenix, as the Phoenix to have a Companion. In which Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Hiſtorians have imitated the Poets, and choſen rather to tell ſtrange things than true. For, firſt, this Nativity of this imaginary Bird is a manifeſt impoſſibility; becauſe nothing is more abhorr'd by Nature than voluntary death, and that order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governeſs would rather have given the Phoenix a Female, as well as to all other Creatures, than have put her ſelf thus upon the neceſſity of a miracle. Nor can any thing be more contrary to the generation of Animals than aſhes, which, are dry; dryneſs being altogether oppoſite to life, and to the corruption which is antecedent to every generation. Next, its progreſs is equally abſurd. For, they ſay, this little Bird no ſooner attains its juſt bigneſs, (which is equal to that of an Eagle, having its head criſted with divers colours, the neck gold-colour, the reſt of the feathers purple ſaving that the tail is mixt of ſcarlet and ſky-colour) but it prepares it ſelf to pay the laſt duties to the bones of its deceaſed parent. (But how conſiſtent is this with the Bird's being reduc'd to aſhes?) Which bones ſhe lays upon her back, and flyes from <hi>Aegypt</hi> with them to <hi>Arabia,</hi> where ſhe places them upon an Altar dedicated to the Sun; upon which the ſame Bird before her death had made an offering of the Neaſt, which was to be her fatal pile. After theſe funerals it flies towards Heaven, where 'tis fed with dew, and the fumes of Incenſe and Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum; and inſtead of drink, makes uſe of the vapors which ariſe from the Sea, abhorring all kind of grain and food common to other Birds. According to <hi>Aelian,</hi> it lives five hundred years, according to others ſix hundred, and according to others more, in places apart from the commerce of Men; but ſo highly reverenc'd by all other Birds, that they follow it with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and admiration, inſomuch that Birds of rapine forget their prey, and others the fear of being taken. As many fictions as words, even if <hi>Lucretius</hi>'s opinion be true, who admits not, that any ſingle Animal can generate. Wherefore 'tis not without reaſon, that to avoid rendring account of the many abſurdities ariſing from theſe falſe ſuppoſitions, the Hiſtorians make it to be hid from our ſight ſo many Ages; foreſeeing that if there was
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:66371:189"/>
but one Woman found that had danc'd twice at <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Playes, there will be no witneſſes found to atteſt the nativity, life, and death of this Animal.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That we ought not to condemn the abſent under pretext that they are unknown; for the Nativity of this Bird is defended by that of <hi>Barnacle,</hi> which is bred of the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a Ship; and of another call'd <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> which by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s report, is produc'd of the leaf of a Tree near the River <hi>Hippanis.</hi> If the duration of its life be uncertain, ſo likewiſe is that of all Animals with which we converſe not. And were the authority of <hi>Betonius</hi> ſuſpected, who confounds it with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucodrata,</hi> yet that of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the fourteenth Book of his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals is authentick. <hi>P. Fabius,</hi> and <hi>L. Vitellus,</hi> (ſaith he) being Conſuls. the Bird call'd a Phoenix after many Ages appear'd in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and gave occaſion to many Greeks and other perſonages of the Country to diſcourſe of the miracle; concerning which they relate many doubtful things, but worthy to be known. They ſay, this Animal is devoted to the Sun, and that its beak and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of plumes, is wholly different from other Animals. Moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it lives five hundred years; others, that it attains to one thouſand four hundred ſixty one: and that the firſt were ſeen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> and <hi>Amaſis,</hi> Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; next, under <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who reign'd the third of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> It came then into the City of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> accompany'd with a great number of other Birds, who ſeem'd as well as Men amaz'd at the new ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle. But becauſe (ſaith he) there were but two thouſand five hundred years from <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> under whom this appear'd; this made ſome doubt it was not the true Phoenix, and came not from <hi>Arabia,</hi> whence it ought not to come till its life were near an end, to build its neaſt in <hi>Egypt</hi>; wherein he leavs a genital virtue whereby his Succeſſor is produc'd, who as ſoon as come to full vigor, prepares to pay the funeral duty to its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; which it doth not, lightly, but after it hath try'd by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying an equal weight of Myrrh, whether it be able to carry that of its parent's bones. However, ſaith he, 'tis a certain thing that this Bird is ſeen ſometimes in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And, indeed, its exiſtence is prov'd by the Authority of <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> in his Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks; <hi>Manilius, Pliny, Ovid, Athenaeus, Albertus Magnus,</hi> yea, by the publick voice which uſes this word, to ſignifie a rare thing, and ſingular in its Species: Which were not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if <hi>Lactantius, Tertullian,</hi> and many other Fathers had not often employ'd it to convince the Pagans who queſtion'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Moreover, <hi>Aelian</hi> in his Hiſtory of Animals, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing this too well known to be particularly deſcrib'd, only blames the broking Miſers of his time, who prefer their affairs before the wonder of this Bird, which is ſo well ſkill'd in calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that it fails not to repair to its fatal neaſt at the prefixt time. In ſhort, we may doubt of ſome circumſtances, but not of the truth of its exiſtence; its renovation is prov'd poſſible
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:66371:190"/>
from the re-animation of a drown'd fly by the Sun; and ſince hard to give a ſatisfactory account of common generations, we may therefore forbear to reject this, which, though extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, may yet be maintain'd by Chymiſts, who lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of generation in Salt, the ſole permanent principle, and not volatile as the two other are.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Fathers in uſing Compariſons from this Bird, had regard to the common belief, as God accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates himſelf to the Language of Men, attributing Paſſions to himſelf, though he hath none. And for the Authors that ſpeak of it, 'tis always upon the credit of others. Even <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> the firſt whereof, (if you will believe him) ſaw almoſt every thing however ſtrange and unheard of; and the ſecond affirms almoſt every thing; (ſo far as to ſay, that certain Birds lay their Eggs in a Hare's ſkin, which they afterwards hang upon a Tree; and that others carry theirs upon a ſtick lay'd over the ſhoulders of two; beſides infinite other things no leſs incredible and ridiculous) yet ſpeak but doubtfully of this Bird. So that we have great reaſon to do the like, yea, to eſteem it a Fiction.</p>

            <p>SEnſe and Motion are in ſome ſort obſerv'd in all Plants, which incline towards the Sun and Light, and attract their aliment at diſtance; particularly, the Vine, which ſeems to act with choice, twining about the next Tree that may ſupport it, not once, as might be by chance, but twice or thrice. But with much more reaſon may we attribute Senſe to the <hi>Helitropium</hi> and Marygold; as alſo to Tulips, which ſhut up themſelves at night, and open again in the day. <hi>Pliny</hi> attributes a yet more admirable property to the <hi>Lotus,</hi> ſaying, that it ſinks and hides it ſelf totally at night in the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> near which it grows, ſo that 'tis not to be reach'd by one's hand, then riſes out of the water again at Sun-riſe; and that, in places where it grows remote from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Evening it wraps up its Flower and Fruit in its leavs, and diſcovers them afreſh next Morning. The Tree call'd <hi>Arbor Triſtis,</hi> ſeems alſo to have much Senſe, its leavs reſemble thoſe of the Sloe-Tree; its Flowers open at night, and in the day are all languid, though of ſo good a ſmell, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and <hi>Goa</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> diſtill an odoriferous water from them, and make uſe of their red ſtalks to colour meats, as the Europaeans do of Saffron.

turn'd into Birds like our Ducks; and that mention'd by <hi>Ruellius, l.</hi> 12. <hi>ch.</hi> 38. of his Hiſtory of Plants, which bears Cockles, of which Birds are produc'd; and thoſe ſaid by <hi>Munſter</hi> in his Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography, to grow in <hi>Vomonia</hi> near <hi>Scotland</hi> towards the North, whoſe Fruit falling into the water is turn'd into a Bird, call'd a Tree-Bird. <hi>Guadaguigna,</hi> an Italian Author, affirms the like of the leavs of another Tree.

It adheres to the Earth by the Navil, and cannot live unleſs graſs be ſown about it; which withering, or being purpoſely deſtroy'd, the Plant dyes: Which Plant-Animal, <hi>Sigiſmond Liber,</hi> a Pole, ſaith, is alſo call'd <hi>Smarcandeos</hi> by the <hi>Muſulmans,</hi> who wear the ſkin of it upon their breaſts and ſhaven heads for warmth. And there are ſeen at this day in the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Garden in the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of S. <hi>Victor</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> three ſorts of Plants, to which cannot be deny'd the name of Senſitive, ſince being toucht, they flag their leavs, one ſooner, another more ſlowly, and the third very leiſurely; which leavs return to their place after the Sun hath warm'd them again with his rayes, <hi>Garſias ab Horto</hi> ſpeaks as much of certain anonymous Plants growing in the Province of <hi>Malabar,</hi> which as ſoon as they are toucht, ſhrink and contract their branches by a motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former; and he adds, that their leavs reſemble thoſe of Polypody, and the Flowers are yellow. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in Book 4. Chap. 3. of his Hiſtory of Plants, attributes the ſame faculty to a Spinous Plant like Fearn, (according to <hi>Gaza</hi>'s Tranſlation) or Feathers, (according to that of <hi>Pliny</hi>) the leavs or boughs of which Plant being toucht, become arid and languid,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:66371:191"/>
cloſe, and compreſs themſelves, and after ſome time turn green again, and reſume their firſt vigor: He ſaith, This Plant grows at Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and is ſo big that three men can ſcarce fathom it. <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> the Diſciple of <hi>Democritus,</hi> aſcribes the like virtue to an Herb which he calls <hi>Aeſchinomene,</hi> or Chaſt-Herb, becauſe it ſhuns the hand of any that offers to touch it, ſhrinking its leavs up into an heap. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of another in the Iſlands of the <hi>Troglodites</hi> like Coral, call'd <hi>Charito-Blepharon,</hi> which ſeems to be ſenſible of the approach of him that comes to cut it, becomming then as hard as horn; and, if he wait ſome time, like a ſtone. The <hi>Portugals</hi> tell in their Navigations of an Herb that grows with ſmall roots in hot and moiſt places, putting forth eight little branches two fingers long, furniſht with leavs on each ſide, as green as <hi>Tamarisk,</hi> but reſembling thoſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypody. From the middle of the roots ariſe four ſmall ſtalks, each of which bears a yellow Flower like that of Cloves, but without ſmell; which being never ſo little toucht, languiſh and flag, but reſume their firſt vigor upon the removal of the hand. Of which Marvail, a Philoſopher of <hi>Malabar</hi> being unable to find the cauſe, became a fool. <hi>Monardes</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Sevil,</hi> having deſcrib'd a ſort of Barly in new <hi>Spain,</hi> call'd <hi>Gayatene,</hi> or <hi>Cevadilla,</hi> (wich falls flat as ſoon as it is toucht) makes mention of another Species of the ſame Herb, which lying ſpread upon the ground, upon touching, folds it ſelf like criſped Colewort. Laſtly, <hi>Nicolas Conti</hi> ſays, that in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> between the Cities of <hi>Biſnagar</hi> and <hi>Malepur,</hi> there grows a Tree without Fruit three yards high, call'd <hi>Arbor Pudica,</hi> which retracts its branches when any Man or Beaſt approaches it. By all which Relations, it is manifeſt that there are Senſitive Plants.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That ſince 'tis not poſſible to imagine Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Life without Organs, theſe motions muſt not be attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Senſe, but to other Cauſes; as to the attractive heat which is in all Plants, which makes them fold up themſelves according to the figure of the Body near which they are. Some Animals, as Oyſters, have indeed a more imperceptible degree of Senſe, yet are not they therefore Plants; thoſe whereof that have any local motion, have it, perhaps, from the concuſſion of the Earth caus'd by the approaching perſon, or from the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Air; which though imperceptible, drives along the <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi>: And, perhaps, theſe Flowers and Herbs are of a very rare and ſubtle texture. Unleſs you had rather recurr to the Antipathy which is found between theſe Plants and Man, which cauſes the ſkin and fiddle-ſtrings made of Sheeps guts, to break at the noiſe and ſound made by thoſe of a Wolf, with which they will never be brought to be harmonious. For this is a better way than to multiply Species without neceſſity, as they do who eſtabliſh a middle Nature between a Plant and an Animal. And as for thoſe which remove from one place to another, they may, perhaps, find the ſame account of them upon inquiry that <hi>Aeneas
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:66371:191"/>
Sylvius</hi> did, who (as he ſaith in his Deſcription of <hi>Europe, Chap.</hi> 46.) aſking <hi>James</hi> VI. King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> touching thoſe Tree-Birds reported to be bred there, learnt from the mouth of that learned King, that thoſe famous Trees grew not there but in the Orcades. Whereupon <hi>Aeneas</hi> truly and handſomely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>Miracula fugiunt.</hi>

            <p>THis word ſome think is deriv'd from the Hebrew <hi>Bel,</hi> which ſignifies King, and <hi>zaars</hi> Poyſons, as if it were the King or Maſter of Poyſons, which are ſubdu'd more powerfully by this than any other remedy. According to <hi>Scaliger, Bezohard</hi> is taken by the Arabians for that which preſerves life, and ſo the Stone will have borrow'd its name from its effect. <hi>Cardan</hi> ſaith, there is a poyſonous root of this name, which bears a fruit call'd <hi>Niraebri,</hi> which is an Antidote to it. This ſtone is divided into Natural and Artificial. The Natural is of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Animal and Mineral; yea, Plants and every thing good againſt Poyſons is commonly term'd Bezoardical, But the Name primarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a ſtone found in an Animal, called by the Perſians <hi>Paſan,</hi> or <hi>Paſar</hi>; which Animal, <hi>Monardes</hi> ſaith, is of the bigneſs, and almoſt of the ſhape of a Stag, having two Horns large at the baſe, pointed at the top, and bowed over the back like thoſe of a Goat, which it reſembles in the feet, and ſomething too in the form: Whence ſome term it Trag-elaphos, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Goat-Deer, though this be a different Animal, having ſhort Hair, and a ſkin between grey and red, and ſometimes of other colours. The Indians take them in nets for the ſtone's ſake, which they ſell to Merchants. For though the Beaſt is ſo furious that it breaks any other link but thoſe of Iron, yet the price of this ſtone is ſo great that it makes the danger deſpicable. He adds, that it is ſo nimble that it caſts it ſelf down from an high Rock, and lights upon its horns without any hurt; and that its pace is leaping and bounding like a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball. All agree not in what part of the Animal the ſtone grows. The Arabians write, that this and all other ſorts of Deer find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves old and ſick, by their breath draw Serpents out of their holes and devour them, that ſo thereby they become young and well again; after which finding themſelves heated by this food, they run into the water, and ſtay there without drinking till their heat be over; during which ſtay in the water, this ſtone is bred in the corners of their Eyes, whence it is taken for the uſes aboveſaid. But <hi>Monardes</hi> more probably learnt from the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Mountains of <hi>China,</hi> that in the <hi>Indies</hi> near the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> theſe Goat-Deer after their eating of Serpents
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:66371:192"/>
go about the tops of the Mountains feeding on ſuch Herbs as Nature hath taught them reſiſt Poyſons; of the quinteſſence whereof mix'd with that of the Poyſons, the Bezoar is by ſome particular virtue produc'd in ſome cavity of their Bodies; <hi>Garſias ab Horto,</hi> and <hi>Acoſta</hi> ſay, in their ſtomack; particularly in that reduplication by which they ruminate: others, as <hi>Fragoſus,</hi> in the kidneys, becauſe ſome ſtones have the figure of that part, which alſo is the moſt lapidifick of the whole Body; and others too, as <hi>Rabbi Moſes</hi> the Aegyptian, in the Gall; which opinion <hi>Monardes</hi> himſelf is of though he admits too that it is found in the Ventricle, Inteſtines, and other cavities of the Body: As, indeed, there is no place in the Bodies of Animals, but ſtones may be generated in them. However, 'tis univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd ſo uſeful, that the hunters are expreſly commanded to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them all to the King, who buyes them at a great rate, and they are not tranſported elſewhere but clandeſtinely. <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> ſaith, that one of the richeſt Preſents which <hi>Cochain</hi> King of the place ſent in his time to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was one of theſe ſtones, a little bigger than a Hazle-nut; of which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerv'd the great effects, he procur'd others to be brought from that Country. Theſe effects are the curing of Peſtilential Fevers, the Leproſie, Small Pox, Epilepſie, Worms in Children, bitings of venomous Beaſts, and generally againſt all Poyſon; particularly, 'tis very proper for faintings, — and other effects of Melancholy. Whence 'tis us'd in Quartan; Agues to appeaſe the Symptoms thereof, and <hi>Charles</hi> V. took it often; yea, 'tis obſerv'd in ſome Hoſpitals, that the bare powder of this ſtone temper'd in water, communicates its virtue thereunto, ſo that it hath cur'd the Purples and other Epidemical Maladies.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That ſuch as deſign'd to get themſelves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in Phyſick, finding many Diſeaſes unconquerable by common Remedies, that they might not remain idle, and ſuffer the defect of curing incurable, and rebellious Maladies to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted either to their Art or their Ignorance, have had recourſe to the Foxe's ſkin, propoſing the uſe of Remedies ſo rare and hard to find, that their Impoſture might not be diſcover'd. Hence, ſome have ſo highly extoll'd precious Stones and Gold, which not fifty years ago the poor were perſwaded, cur'd them by being boil'd in Reſtoratives, though the rich, who made uſe of the traud, found their gold Chains as heavy afterwards as before, (in caſe they lookt well to them, in the boiling) and conſequently, that no Vertue was deriv'd from them. Of this kind is the Bezoar-ſtone: touching the Original whereof we ſee how Authors differ, and a few moneths ago an Animal was ſhewn in this City very different from that above-deſcrib'd, which they term'd <hi>Pucos,</hi> and affirmed to be that which bred the Bezoar. Beſides, the difficulty of diſcerning the true Stone from falſe, which probably are the moſt numerous, muſt needs render the uſe of it ſuſpicious; ſince even in the time of <hi>Serap on</hi> it was
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:66371:192"/>
ſold falſifi'd, which, he ſaith, was unprofitable, but I think ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchievous. And <hi>Cluſius</hi> complains, That the Merchants of <hi>Lisbon</hi> would not ſuffer the uſual trial to be made for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the true from the adulterate. Neither do Authors agree about thoſe trials; ſome accounting it a ſign of Goodneſs, if the Stone hath nothing but a little duſt in the Center; whereas the falſifi'd (ſay they) have ſome Seed, or other ſolid body there, upon which the other Materials were ſuperinduc'd: others think, the right hath always a ſtraw in the middle. Wherein we may obſerve, that the ſeveral ſcales or folds it hath one over another, like thoſe of an Onion, or the Stone of a man's Bladder, which are made by new appoſition of matter, agree not with the above-mentioned manner of its being made all at once. But in whatever manner and place it be produc'd, I think it can act on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by its manifeſt Qualities which alone are active; the Effects of occult Qualities being as hidden as themſelves. Beſides, how could theſe Treaſures and Preſents of Kings to be ſo common at this day, in all Shops, if they had ſuch great Vertues too as are attributed to them. Wherefore 'tis moſt likely, that the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of Men hath added this to other popular Errors.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That as no Sect is more eaſie than the Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhonian or Sceptick, which doubts of every thing; ſo 'tis a very obvious Invention for ſuch as are willing to decline inquiring into that vaſt treaſure of Remedies, which are diſpers'd from the Concave of the Moon to the Center of the Earth, and into the trials which may be made by their almoſt infinite preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and mixtures, to reject all upon pretext of Incertainty in Philoſophical accounts. But though the ſhorteſt, I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the beſt way; ſince Experience ſhews us many Effects which depend not upon Qualities; and, they that decry the Bezoar, becauſe it acts not by manifeſt Qualities, admit others which do as little, <hi>viz.</hi> Elective Purgers, Splenetical, Hyſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and other appropriate Remedies, though in ſome caſes even of a contrary temper to the parts they are apply'd to. Which error happens, from our always making Qualities Cauſes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as oftentimes they are Effects. Beſides, 'tis great pride to deny whatever we underſtand not; ſince the moſt knowing agree that they ſee only through a cloud, and the chief effect of Beatitude will be, To be ignorant of nothing. And why ſhould the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Antidotes depend more upon firſt Qualities than thoſe of poyſons do? ſince they ought to be contraries, and contraries are under the ſame <hi>Genus.</hi> Wherefore it ſufficeth to recur to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Experiment. Indeed <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> knew not Bezoar; yet neither do wee reject <hi>Sena</hi> which they knew not, and which is one of the commoneſt and beſt Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments we have. But all the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſicians concurr in this point, and <hi>Serapion</hi> particularly affirms, that this Stone is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Antidote againſt all poyſon in the bitings of venemous Beaſts; and ſo efficacious, that not only three or four grains of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:66371:193"/>
it held in the mouth, enervate poyſons; but the powder apply'd to a venemous Animal, ſtupefies it, and takes away its power of hurting; ſo that ſome parts already begun to corrupt by their biting, have preſently been reſtor'd to their firſt eſtate by its ſingle application. <hi>Avicenna,</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his ſecond Canon ranks it with Treacle, amongſt Alexipharmacal Remedies which preſerve health, and ſtrengthen the Spirits. <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> in his Continent, affirms, That he found more admirable Faculties in Bezoar, than in all other Antidotes; and in his book to <hi>Almanſor,</hi> he ſaith, That Remedies for reſiſting poyſon, that aſſault the heart, and offend by their whole ſubſtance, are in vain prepar'd, if Bezoar be left out; which alone, he ſaith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the poyſon of <hi>Napellus</hi> or Monks-hood the moſt pernicious of all. <hi>Avenzoar,</hi> in his <hi>Theyſer,</hi> writes, that a man given over for dead upon taking of poyſon, was cur'd by three grains of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar. <hi>Peter</hi> de <hi>Abano</hi> (call'd the Conciliator) affirms, That <hi>Edward</hi> I. King of <hi>England,</hi> being wounded with a poyſon'd ſword in the war againſt the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and ready to expire, was cur'd by ſome of this ſtone given him by the General of the Templars: and that the bare wearing it reſiſts poyſon. <hi>Monardes</hi> affirms, That with this Stone in leſs than a quarter of an hour he cur'd a certain Licentiate, whoſe body was already all ſwell'd by having once drunk, and another time eaten poyſon; and that a poyſon'd Maid, after the uſeleſs tryal of all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyſons, was preſently cur'd by this. The ſame Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a great number of Syncopes, Peſtilential Feavers, Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, Epilepſies, and other Diſeaſes cur'd by this Remedy; which is the more excellent in that it is inſipid and void of all the bad taſte which accompanies moſt other Remedies. Theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are further authoris'd by the publick voice, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eaſily outweigh'd by the few perſons that undertake to bid defiance to Antiquity, and to accuſe it of ignorance or fraud, though it be not wholly deſtitute of Reaſon. For ſince 'tis grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Viper's fleſh is neceſſary in Treacle to render the ſame efficacious againſt the bitings of that Animal, (it being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ſomething intervene of a middle nature between ours, and that of the Viper, as its fleſh, is being void of venom, but ſuſceptible of it) why ſhould it be deny'd, that Bezoar which is produc'd of ſomething that hath poyſon, and ſomething that reſiſts it, may ſerve for a <hi>medium</hi> to ſubdue the ſame in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The objections to the contrary are either general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The former concern only Mountebanks, who are left to anſwer them; it being incredible that a good man, much leſs a Chriſtian, would deceive in a matter ſo important as Life; which yet may be as often indanger'd by rejecting good remedies upon vain Argumentations, (to ſay no worſe) as by preſcribing thoſe that are unprofitable. The Objection againſt Gold and precious ſtones makes as much againſt the Confection <hi>de Hyacin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this,</hi> and others, whereof they are ingredients; but they that
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:66371:193"/>
have well conſider'd thoſe rich Bodies, find virtues to iſſue from them which impair not their weight; as is obſerv'd in Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, the decoction whereof kills worms, though its weight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame; and in the Regulus of Antimony, a cup where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of renders liquors purgative in <hi>infinitum,</hi> without any diminution of its ſubſtance. As for the diverſity of Opinions touching the generation of this Stone, this difficulty is found almoſt in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign remedies; and though 'tis not known, Whence Amber comes? yet we find its perfume excellent, and its uſe profitable in Phyſick. Nor is Adulteration proper only to Bezoar ſtones, but common to Balm, Civet, Storax, Rhubarb, and, in a word, to all other remedies; and the abuſe ought not to prejudice the uſe, ſince the ſame Authors that have obſerv'd theſe impoſtures, teach us alſo to avoid them. <hi>Cluſius</hi> makes tryal of them, by paſſing a poyſon'd thread through a Dog's Leg, and when the Symptoms of the Poyſon have made him fall down as dead, if upon taking a little of the powder of this Stone, he revives, 'tis right; if not, 'tis falſifi'd. <hi>Monardes</hi>'s tryal is by breaking the ſtone, which ought to appear made of ſeveral films thicker or thinner according to its bigneſs, which is commonly equal to that of an Olive, and almoſt of the ſame colour, though ſome are found to weigh two ounces, and the biggeſt are the beſt; but the Surfaces muſt be all ſmooth, the inward more than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the middle of which is a powder of more efficacy than the outſide, or a ſtraw or little piece of dry'd Herb, not a ſeed as there is in the fictitious; thoſe that are vers'd therein know how to avoid being abus'd, and adjudge the Oriental better than the Occidental, which are darker and weaker. It matters not as to the truth of the effect, in what manner this ſtone is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; though 'tis not impoſſible for ſeveral Tunicles to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd together, as thoſe of the Onyon are. In fine, ſuch may the rarity of Bezoar have ſometimes been, that only great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons made uſe of it; but its admirable effects have made men curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to procure ſtore of them, which they may the more eaſily do even by their means who decry them, the Apothecaries thereby having always ſome left in their ſhops.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That in order to know well the benefits of Bezoar, 'tis requiſite firſt to be agreed What it is; which point is not yet determin'd. <hi>Scribonius Largus</hi> conceives it the hardned tear of a Stag a hundred years old: Others, think it a Mineral; others, a ſtone bred in an Animal, ſo contrary to Nature that the Animal that breeds it is exceedingly tormented with it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if be big; which the hunters gueſs by ſeeing them go with pain, as Men do that have the ſtone in the Bladder. Yea, 'tis not agreed in what part of the Body 'tis found, though this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication be neceſſary towards the diſcovery of its virtue; ſince ſtones found in the Gall are of another Nature and Properties, than thoſe of the Reins or Bladder. Moreover, the colour of theſe ſtones is extreamly various, not to mention the difference
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:66371:194"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:66371:195"/>
which proceeds from that of Climates; the Occidental being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without virtue in compariſon of the Oriental. Whence it follows, that no certain unqueſtionable property can be aſſign'd to this ſtone as to other Remedies, which act always in the ſame manner; otherwiſe there would be no Science. But ſhould the Bezoar have an Alexipharmacal Virtue, yet it could be but like that of other Bodies, which act proportionally to their bulk. Now what proportion is there between three grains of an inſipid powder which cauſes no evacuation, or other ſenſible action; and a mortal poyſon, whoſe cruel Symptoms diſcover themſelves as ſpeedily as fire doth when put to matter ſuſceptible of combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And I appeal to the teſtimony of all thoſe that have made uſe of it in our Age, whether they ever found the effects that are attributed to it. Whence it follows, that it is doubly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; Firſt, becauſe 'tis of great coſt to the Patient; Secondly, it takes up the place of ſome other good Remedy, cauſing loſs of time which might otherwiſe be profitably employ'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the ſick.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That Poyſons and Epidemical Diſeaſes hurt not by their manifeſt qualities, nor by the quantity of their matter; as appears in the biting of a Scorpion, which caſts forth an imperceptible quantity of venom. And therefore 'tis not to be expected that their Remedies ſhould act either by ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or by their quantity. Nor are we to doubt of the effect of Bezoar, under pretext that 'tis given in few grains, though ſome have given twenty and thirty grains; and that the ordinary doſe is about nine or ten grains. Neither is it material whether it be the ſtone of the kidneys of a Goat, Deer, or the tear of a Deer, provided it have the Virtues aſcrib'd to it, which is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible than that which <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms, himſelf try'd in the Stag's tear, which, he ſaith, ſo melts Men's Bodies that are either poyſon'd or infected with the Peſtilence, that they ſeem turn'd all into water, and thereby are cur'd. To which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, there are few well employ'd Phyſicians but can add many more. Nor is any thing ſaid againſt Bezoar, but what may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt all other Antidotes, as Sealed Earth, Unicorn's Horn, and all Cordial Remedies, whoſe Virtue may as well be queſtion'd as that of Bezoar.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCVIII. Whence proceeds the ſudden Death of Men and Animals upon deſcending into certain Pits.</head>
            <p>ON the ſixteenth of <hi>June</hi> laſt, an Inhabitant of the Town of <hi>Tilliers,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Virruel,</hi> perceiv'd a goodly Pigeon, which he took to be one of his own, fall down into a Well hard by his Houſe; whereupon he call'd his Son, and, to draw it out, they let down a baſket with a rope to the bottom of the Well, into which the Pigeon preſently entred; but as oft as they lifted it up from the water, it fell back again thereunto: After their deſign had fail'd, the Son tyes a cudgel to the rope, and being let down by his Father, endeavors to take the Pigeon. The Father aſk'd him, Whether he had her? He anſwer'd thrice, No; and after ſome ſighs falls, having loſt both Speech and Life. The Father troubl'd at ſo ſtrange an accident, reſolves to go down himſelf, and accordingly without any help deſcends into the Well, where he remain'd as his Son. The Neighborhood advertiſed of this dyſaſter repair'd thither, and, amongſt others, one who had not long before caſt the Well; He aſcribing all to the weakneſs of thoſe who were dead, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently betakes himſelf to go down; but he was ſcarce come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two foot of the water but he fell down dead without making any complaint. A ſtrong and vigorous young Man upon the belief that the company conceiv'd that thoſe perſons were not dead, but only needed help, undertakes to go down likewiſe; he did ſo, but ſuddenly fell backwards with a little Convulſive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which made him caſt up his head. Hereupon, notwithſtanding the diſſwaſions of the Curate of the place, who began to ſuſpect ſome mortiferous cauſes of this effect, a fifth deſcended after he had caus'd the rope to be faſtned to his middle; he was no ſooner in the middle of the Well but he was pull'd up again upon the Geſtures which he made, with a livid Countenance, and other ſignes fore-runners of Death, which he eſcap'd by being preſently ſuccoured with Wine and <hi>Aqua Vitae.</hi> Being recover'd, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had perceiv'd no hurt but only a certain faintneſs upon him. This laſt attempt cool'd all aſſiſtance, ſo that there was no more talk of going down, but only of getting the Bodies up; which was done: and 'twas obſerv'd that none of them had any ſignes of Life ſaving the Son, in whom were ſeen ſome ſmall tokens which preſently vaniſh'd. The wonderment of all this was greatly increas'd, when a Gentleman of the Country, curious of ſeeing what was reported, let down a Dog, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd there a quarter of an hour, and was pull'd up again ſafe and ſound. This Well twenty five foot deep, and of water but two, is inclos'd with a very ancient Wall at the foot of a good
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:66371:196"/>
high Hill, whereon ſtands the Caſtle of <hi>Tilliers</hi>: And which help'd not to diminiſh the wonder, it had been cleanſed by two men who found no hurt, nor any thing extraordinary in it, ſaving an odour ſtronger than elſewhere; the water being as clear as that of the Spring, and without any ſediment. Now if it was mineral and malignant vapors that ſuffocated thoſe that deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſame might have done the like upon thoſe that firſt gave them vent.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That this Effect cannot be attributed to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors barely venomous, and of the nature of ordinary Poyſons, which corrupt our humours, ſometimes after Applications, as the Plague and other Epidemical Diſeaſes do; but this ſteam is ſo oppoſite to Life, that it deſtroyes the ſame in an inſtant; which we cannot imagine to proceed from any other cauſe but a mineral, which is far more active. The eſcape of thoſe that cleans'd the Well, may be attributed to the mud which ſmeared the ſides of the Well, and ſo kept the vapor in; till growing ſtronger by that reſtraint, it made way for its ſelf through that remaning cruſt, and produc'd the above-mention'd diſmal effects; emitting its Poyſon in a ſtrait line, according to the rectitude of the Well, which weakned the Pigeon in ſuch ſort, that it was unable to riſe again; as 'tis reported that Birds fall down as they fly over the <hi>Mare Mortuum,</hi> or Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in <hi>Judea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, 'Tis not probable that any ſuch ſlimy cruſt hindred this Effect at firſt, ſince the Dog let down afterwards found no hurt; unleſs you think a new cruſt aroſe in that little time which paſs'd between the death of the Men, and the deſcent of the Dog. This Effect therefore may probably be attributed to the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> or Central Fire, that Motor of Nature, which dries all the vapors of the Elements from the Centre to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, ſubliming the principals of minerals, in order to make its Productions; and as the ſeveral mixtures of theſe elevated vapors are in ſome places wholſome, to wit, in Bathes and mineral waters; ſo there are others deſtructive of our Nature. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch elevation is not continual, but only at certain times, according to the motion of that grand Motor, and, particularly, of the Sun; hence Arſenical vapors have produc'd ſuch Effects at one time, and ſtifled thoſe that deſcended into a Well filled with them, which they have not done to thoſe that clean'd it, nor to the Dog; in as much as thoſe vapors were not rais'd at this time. And, perhaps, theſe mineral vapors are not always ſublim'd in ſuch a degree as to be mortiferous; otherwiſe it would follow that none could ever labor in mines with ſafety, by reaſon of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fumes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That ſuch expellations could not extinguiſh the Fire of Life in ſo ſhort a time, without ſome fore-running ſignes. But 'tis more probable, that this Effect proceeds from ſome venomous Animal infecting the Air, which being confin'd in a place incapable of evaporation, and ſuckt by thoſe that
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:66371:196"/>
deſcend down the Well, they can no more ſave themſelves from Death, than in a peſtilent Air. Nor are they Fables which Hiſtory records of certain Grottoes, in which Baſiliſks and Serpents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding, infected not only the place, but alſo the whole Country; as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> relates in the Life of <hi>Apollonins,</hi> how a Dragon carry'd the Plague into all places where-ever he went. Now as to the particulars of the Story, what is difficult in them I thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. Thoſe that cleans'd the Well open'd the paſſage to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliſk, who by degrees creeping forth out of his hole into the Well, there darted forth his mortal rays upon what-ever was preſented to his Eyes; which done, he retir'd into his hole again; ſo that the Dog let down into the Well after the Baſiliſk's retirement, could not be hurt: For that the ſpirits iſſuing out of the Eyes of this mortiferous creature, are harmleſs to dogs, and deadly to Men, is not warranted by any Example; Antiquity, whoſe Judgement is venerable even in doubtful things, allowing this Beaſt capable of doing miſchief only in the place where he reſides.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCIX. Whether a Dead Body can be preſerv'd naturally many years.</head>
            <p>THis Queſtion is divided in two points; Firſt, Whether a dead Body can be kept without art; Secondly, Whether it can be ſo by art; Nature being here oppos'd not to Art, but to what is ſupernatural. The firſt is hard, every Carkaſe having in it ſelf the principles of Coruption; becauſe the harmony of qualities which caus'd to ſubſiſt being diſſolv'd, it advances of it ſelf to an annihillation: And Nature ſhould ceaſe her continual motion, if her ſubject depriv'd of animal life ſhould always remain in one and the ſame ſtate. Yea, if Nature ſhould ſtop her courſe in dead Bodies, and not be able to reſolve them into other works, the Influences of the Heavens would be uſeleſs in reſpect of them, as alſo their motion, which is in order to generations, which would ceaſe if there were no more corruption; whence the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Univerſe in its parts would follow. Nor would the Elements act any more one againſt another, remaining pure and ſimple, and incapable of any generation, ſince ſiccity could no more act upon humidity, nor heat upon cold. It remains to enquire, Whether a dead Body may be preſerv'd by art; which ſeems poſſible, becauſe we may by art deſtroy the activity of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reduce them to a juſt and equal temperament capable of long preſervation. For if impurities and ſuperfluities lead mixt Bodies to Corruption, 'tis eaſie to ſeparate them by Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; otherwiſe this art would be incapable of reducing them as it doth every day to a juſt Temperament: Yea, if we conſider
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:66371:197"/>
the Principles of Preſervation, it will appear, that thoſe of Art are more powerful than thoſe of Nature, in regard of the means and Inſtruments it employs to ſeparate them which Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, becauſe She mixes things without choice and depu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o this Conference; Whence it may be preſum'd, That Women are not ſo eaſily corruptible, becauſe their bodies are made of fleſh more elaborate then that of man, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taken from the duſt, and conſequently is more prone to return into its firſt Original. Now the way to preſerve dead bodies from corruption, is, to prevent the diſſolution of their parts; which is done by maintaining the connexion of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity with drineſs; to which end all extrinſical heat and moiſture muſt be kept from them as much as poſſible. Hence it is, that dead bodies are plac'd in ſubterraneous places, and incloſed in leaden Coffins, to the end, the cold and dry vapours ſymbolizing with the qualities of Saturn, (which the Chymiſts make as juſtly preſervative as the Poets make it deſtructive) may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand extrinſecal heat and moiſture, and maintain the marriage of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

A Habit of body moderately fleſhy, (which <hi>Galen</hi> accounts the moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and which denotes a good Conſtitution) is fitteſt for this purpoſe; and 'tis probable, that the bodies of thoſe that die of a ſudden death, reſiſt putrefaction longer than thoſe that have been extenuated by a longer Sickneſs, or brought to the Grave by a Feaver; becauſe in theſe caſes the body is in a great tendency to putrefaction even before Death.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCX. Of the Remora.</head>
            <p>TIs a ſmall Fiſh, half a foot long, called by the Greeks, <hi>Echeneïs,</hi> and, by the Latins, <hi>Remora</hi>; becauſe 'tis thought to ſtop the motion of Ships, by means of two ſcales wherewith it cloſely imbraces the keel. This common belief is founded upon many experiences reported by Authors, worthy of Credit. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, That <hi>Periander,</hi> having ſent a Ship to <hi>Gnidos,</hi> with orders to caſtrate all the principal Children of that Iſland, it was ſtopp'd in the main ſea ſo long time as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſend for other Orders contrary to the former by another Ship; and that in remembrance of this happy retardment, the two ſcales of this little fiſh were in his time ſeen hanging up near the Altar of <hi>Gnidia</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> The like happen'd to a Pretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ship of <hi>Anthony</hi> at the battel of <hi>Actium,</hi> ſo that he could not advance to give Orders to his Naval Army. The Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> having ſet ſail from <hi>Asturia,</hi> with a Gally of five banks, was likewiſe conſtrain'd to ſtay by the way with his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the other Ships not ſuffering the ſame obſtruction; at which this Prince was ſo incens'd, that he preſently commanded divers to ſeek out the cauſe, who at length found this Fiſh ſticking to the helm of the Veſſel which they ſhew'd him about the bigneſs of a Snail; and he was more ſurpris'd when he ſaw that it had not the like effect within the Ship as without; as 'tis ſaid, the foot of a Tortoiſe being in a Veſſel, makes it move ſlowly. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the ſecond book of his Sympoſiacks, affirms, That this Fiſh was found ſticking to the Ship which he hired, to ſail into <hi>Sicily</hi>; and <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſaith. That the Cardinal of <hi>Tourain</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Veſſel of three banks was a long time ſtopp'd in a place at Sea by this little Fiſh, which being taken was ſerv'd up to his table; though others write, that it is not fit to eat. But what they add, That its vertue of retarding is ſuch, that it is made uſe of to hinder the Judgment of a Law-ſuit whereof the iſſue is fear'd; and alſo in filtres to retain a Lover that deſpiſes his loving Miſtris, is as hard to believe, as 'tis to find conſiderable reaſons for it, without having recourſe to the ancient <hi>aſylum</hi> of thoſe who deſpair to find any, which is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick form of this Fiſh, which hath the ſame faculty of ſtopping Ships, that a Diamond hath of retaining the Vertue of the Loadſtone, and Garlick of hindering it to act: as the Ship ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeth the fury of the Elephant; the Fig-tree, that of the Bull; and many other ſuch things, which though ſmall in bulk, are yet very great and virtuous; as they make appear in their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which are as ſenſible in their Effects, as they are occult in their Cauſes.</p>

               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:66371:199"/>The Second ſaid, That the Remora worketh the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the Ship, that the Torpedo doth upon the hand of the Fiſher, which becomes ſtupid, when he toucheth the ſame with a long pole. Now of this effect of Remora is not hard to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, if we follow the Principles of <hi>Campanella,</hi> and thoſe who allow ſenſe to all, even the moſt groſs corporeal things. But this opinion being little received, 'tis better to ſay, that whereas all natural things ſubſiſt only by the viciſſitude of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reſt; wiſe Nature, who is the principle of both, hath judiciouſly diſpenc'd them that they are found differently in ſome things, and in others, and that for the good and ornament of the Univerſe, which requires, that as they are bodies immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable by reaſon of their ſcituation or uſe, to wit, the Earth, and the Poles of the Heavens; others always in motion, to wit, the Heavens, Rivers, Air, and Fire; and others, endued with an attractive vertue, as the Loadſtone and Amber; ſo She hath given others a Quality contrary to this. Namely, the Remora, that of ſtopping the motion of a Ship: and becauſe motion and reſt are contrary one to the other, their principles are no leſs, as well thoſe that are effective of motion, as thoſe which cauſe reſt; but 'tis better to explicate them by their ſenſible and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable effects, than by reaſons ordinarily frivolous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, 'Tis no rare thing for Ships to be ſtaid in the main Sea, whatever pains the Mariners take to make them go forward; and how favourable ſoever the Wind may be, the cauſe whereof is no other but the contrary motion of the waves of the Sea, eſpecially in ſtreights and narrow places where there are ſtrong Currents, which probably. ſtopp'd <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Ship, and thoſe other mentioned in Hiſtory, rather than this little Fiſh which 'tis credible can ſend ſo ſtrong a Vertue from its ſmall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as to fix and check the far greater, and oftentimes irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force of the Winds and Sea. Unleſs you had rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this retardment to the mucoſity and other foulneſſes wherewith Ships are cruſted in long Voyages, which hinder their advancing; and this Fiſh being ſometimes found in thoſe mucous humidities, people miſtake it for the cauſe, though it no wiſe contributed thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Fourth maintain'd, according to the opinion of <hi>Francaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> That 'tis not poſſible for ſo ſmall a Fiſh as the Remora, to ſtop a great Ship at full ſail; but that this Effect is occaſion'd by Rocks indu'd with a Quality like that of the Loadſtone; upon which this Fiſh uſing to reſide, when a Ship paſſes near them, their Adamantine Vertue attracts the ſame towards them; whence the ſame thing happens by theſe two violent motions, <hi>viz.</hi> that wherewith the Veſſel is driven along in the main Sea, and the attraction of theſe Rocks, as when two equal forces draw a weight two ſeveral ways, the thing remains unmov'd; ſo that this fiſh is not the cauſe, but only the ſign of this retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:66371:199"/>The fifth ſaid, That if there were any ſuch magnetical vertue, in this caſe the nails and iron-works of the Ship ſo ſtay'd, would rather be taken away, than its courſe ſtopt, the latter being more hard to do than the former; ſince a little force ſufficeth to pull a nail out of a Ship, whoſe impetuous motion, 'tis not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to withhold; whence <hi>Archimedes</hi>'s his drawing of a Ship out of the Port into the Market-place by his endleſs ſerue, paſs'd for one of the goodlieſt ſecrets of the Mechanicks, though indeed it be nothing to the preſent enquiry. And the truth is, this ſtrange effect may beſt be attributed to a hidden property, and ſingular quality of this Fiſh, which being always found ſticking to the ſtopped Ships, is more probably the cauſe of that impediment, than any unknown Rocks, which ought to do the like to all Veſſels that approach them, if there were any ſuch: For tis a vanity condemn'd by the moſt intelligent in the ſecrets of Nature, to preſume to give valid reaſons thereof, whilſt we have none for the moſt ſenſible and ordinary effects, for want of knowing the laſt and proximate differences which conſtitute every thing in its Eſſence, and diſtinguiſh it from others; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſie to know, that the Remora, after the example of many other which act by a propriety of their form, produceth this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, without being needful to trouble our ſelves to find out the means it imploys in order thereunto.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXI. Of Negroes.</head>
            <p>NAture loves variety ſo well that ſhe is not contented with producing a great number of Species of all ſorts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals differing chiefly according to the Climates which produce them; but ſhe hath alſo pleas'd her ſelf in an innumerable diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of individuals eſpecially as to colour, as cannot be call'd an Accident in Blackamores, but an inſeparable property, which diſtinguiſhes them from other men, and conſtitutes the nature of Negroes, in whom the Sun's heat produceth an effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of his light; this brightning, the other obſcuring the ſubject upon which it acts. Yet it acteth not alike upon all Subjects, ſince the ſame Star (Aethiopian) whitens linnen and wax; but this blackneſs happens to the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> becauſe moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture exceeds, and in a manner extinguiſheth heat; juſt as we ſee it come to paſs in Charcoals, Gangreens, and the parts of man's body when ſtruck with Lightning. For, if the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would take colours, no doubt cold would be white as we may judg by Water, Ice, Snow, Gray Hairs, and the Animals that live under the Artick Pole which are all white, though of the ſame Species with ours of another colour; as Bears and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:66371:200"/>
Hares. Which is further prov'd by Herbs which grow white under ground, and loſe as much of their heat and bitterneſs, as they partake of ſuch whiteneſs, witneſs the ſtalks of Harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choaks and Savoury. Hot things would be red, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Fire, which we ſee gives that colour to faces formerly pale, to hot Iron and burning Wood; but a ſuperfluous humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſupervening ſtifles, and extinguiſhes this heat, and leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it the colour of corruption; as we ſee the whiteſt ſkin grows black by heat upon travelling Southwards; the contrary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to thoſe that go Northwards.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That, if heat alone made Blackamoors, thoſe that are moſt expos'd to the Sun-beams ſhould be the blackeſt; but they are not ſo, there being many Nations of the New World, where it is ſo hot, that they go all naked, of an olive colour; whereas in <hi>Guiney, Aethiopia,</hi> and other places inhabited by Moors, they are cloth'd and feel more cold. And becauſe this colour may be aſcrib'd to the reciprocation of heat and cold, which is more likely to alter men's bodies in all other qualities, than in a permanent one; there are found both black and white people under the ſame parallels and elevation of the Pole; as in the Iſle of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> where the Inhabitants are white. Wherefore this colour muſt not be attributed to the Heaven but to the Earth, which produceth all other varieties of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, eſpecially of men, as is obſerv'd in the <hi>Patagons,</hi> who are Gyants: To whom are oppos'd the Pigmies which their ſoil likewiſe produceth. And to ſhew that the tincture of the ſkin is not the only particularity obſervable in Negroes, they have many other Properties whereby they are diſtinguiſh'd from other Nations; as their thick lips, ſaddle-noſes, coarſe ſhort hair, the horny tunicle of the eye, and the teeth whiter than the reſt of men. Beſides, they are not only exempted from the Pox and other Venereous Maladies, but their Climate alone airs the ſame. Not to mention the Qualities of their minds, which are ſo ignorant, that though they have plenty of Flax, yet they want Cloth, becauſe they want ſkill how to work it; they abound with Sugar-canes, yet make no trade of them, and eſteem Copper more than Gold, which they barter for the like weight of Salt; and are wholly ignorant of Laws and Phyſick. Which ignorance renders their ſpirits more baſe and ſervile than thoſe of other Nations; and they are ſo born to ſlavery, that even free men among the Abyſſins (the moſt conſiderable people of all <hi>Aethiopia</hi>) when they are employ'd by any one, take it not ill to be laſh'd with a Bull's Pizzle, provided they be paid; and when their Prieſts exhort the people, they whip them till the blood comes, for the better inculcating of their Inſtructions, thoſe being held in moſt reverence, who whip them moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; though they were the firſt Pagans who were converted to the Faith by Queen <hi>Candace</hi>'s Eunuch, who was inſtructed by S. <hi>Philip.</hi> And as puſillanimous perſons are commonly the moſt
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:66371:200"/>
treacherous, (theſe two vices having both the ſame principles) and preſuppoſing ignorance of the point wherein true Honour conſiſts; ſo the Moors are ordinarily baſe and unfaithful to their Maſters, as is verifi'd by abundance of Hiſtories; which meanneſs and poorneſs of Courage, reaches from the ſecond next the King's perſon to the moſt inferior amongſt them; all bowing down and touching the ground with their hand when they hear the name of their King <hi>Prete-Jun,</hi> before whoſe Tent they make a Reverence though he be not there, and flatter him ſo exceſſively that if one of their Kings happen to loſe an Eye or other member, they deprive themſelves of the ſame too. Moreover, they are ſo credulous that they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that this King is deſcended in a direct line from <hi>Solomon</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> (who, they ſay, was nam'd <hi>Maqueda</hi>) when ſhe came to ſee him, as they report, for ſome other cauſe beſides admiring his Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the caſe is the ſame with the Negroes, in reſpect of the color of their ſkin, and the other above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd particulars, as with the long heads of the Children of <hi>Paris,</hi> which Nature produceth at this day of herſelf, ever ſince the Midwives had form'd the firſt after that manner, upon a belief that this figure was more becomming and ſuitable to the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul than roundneſs. So likewiſe the heat of the Sun firſt blacken'd the ſkin of the Moors of either Sex by little and little; amongſt whom, the blackeſt hides, the thickeſt lips, and moſt evers'd being in eſteem, every Mother endeavor'd to make her Childrens lips and noſe of that figure; and Nature, helpt by their Imagination mov'd by the occurrence of like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, hath produc'd ſuch ever ſince. But 'tis no wonder if the people of ſome Countries, under the ſame parallels and latitude indeed, but defended from the heat of the Sun by oppoſite Mountains, are exempt from the effect of that heat; as there are places in <hi>France,</hi> where upon the ſame reaſon fruits are a month or two later in ripening than thoſe of their Neighbors. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the friſl'd ſhort hair of Negroes is an effect of the ſame heat, as alſo their being exempted from the Pox, which being a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick cold poyſon, as appears by its invading the ſpermatick parts, and the encreaſing of its pains in the night more than day, 'tis more reaſonable that the Temperaments oppoſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſuch as theirs whoſe fleſh is very dry and void of Phlegm, be free from the ſame. Now that Negroes abound not in Phlegm and Moiſture, appears in that they never ſpit in their Churches, not only out of cuſtom, but expreſs Law, which would never have been made if it had not been eaſie to obſerve. Moreover, the whiteneſs of their teeth is augmented by the blackneſs of their faces: And as for their wits, <hi>Scaliger</hi> thinks them not really dull, but only out of deſign and craft, which always argues wit.

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXII. Of Ecſtacies.</head>
            <p>THough the union between the Body and the Soul be ſo ſtrict, as to ſerve for a model to all other unions obſervable in Nature, yet is it not ſo ſtrong but that ſometimes it admits of a diſſolution, which the Philoſophers conceiv'd poſſible, both thoſe parts continuing entire. This ſeparation is call'd an <hi>Ecſtacy,</hi> wherein the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> who firſt brought it into <hi>Vogue,</hi> plac'd the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> or greateſt Felicity, inaſmuch as they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that mens minds were thereby diſengag'd from all material things; nay, from their very Bodies, by the clouds and humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereof they imagin'd, that the mind was diſturbed in its functions, which, being equally ſpiritual, are the more compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd, the more the Underſtanding whereby they are produc'd, is diſengag'd from this corporeal maſs. Whence it comes, that old men, eſpecially ſuch as are near death, or in their ſleep, have clearer viſions, and more certain predictions than young men, and thoſe who are in perfect health, of a moiſt Temperament, who are waking, and perform all their other functions. And whereas there is no great road between the higheſt wiſdom and the greateſt extravagance, it may be further inferr'd, that thoſe who are of a more dry Temperament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is as likely that fools as well as wiſe men, may be, frequently have ſuch viſions, and fall into thoſe <hi>Ecſtacies</hi>; and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:66371:201"/>
that they mind not their own thoughts, are eaſily ſuſceptible of external impreſſions, and the firſt objects which preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them. So that we may make a diſtinction of <hi>Ecſtacies</hi> into two kinds. The former is to be attributed only to great and contemplative perſons, and may be ſaid to be only a diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the mind, which is ſo taken up with the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an object, that it quite forgets all its other functions. For the caſe is the ſame with the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> in reference to its object, which is <hi>Truth</hi>; as it is with the <hi>Will,</hi> in reſpect of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object, to wit, <hi>Good,</hi> which it ſo paſſionately affects, that it is not ſo much where it <hi>lives,</hi> as where it <hi>loves.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Underſtanding being forcibly engag'd to a taking ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whereof it makes a particular obſervation of all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is ſo transform'd into it, that it ceaſes to act any where elſe. Now the reaſon of this, is, that knowledge or apprehenſion, as well as all the other functions, is wrought by a concourſe of ſpirits, which being by that means, in a manner all employ'd in that tranſcendent action, there are not enough remaining for the performance of other actions, the ſmall portion that is being wholly employ'd about reſpiration, nouriſhment, and the other actions neceſſary for the Conſervation of Life. Accordingly, this kind of <hi>Ecſtacy,</hi> or ceſſation of the functions is not only obſerv'd to happen in that conflict and contention of the mind, when it is wholly bent upon the examination of ſome object, but alſo in all the other actions which are perform'd with exceſs: ſuch as for example, the Paſſions are, the extraordinary violences whereof occaſion <hi>Ecſtacies,</hi> an extream grief caſting a man down ſo much, that he becomes as it were ſtupid and inſenſible. The ſame thing happens alſo through joy by a contrary effect, as well as in Anger, Fear, Audacity, and the other perturbations of the iraſcible and concupiſcible Appetites, by reaſon of the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion or concentration of the ſpirits. Whence it follows, that it is not more ſtrange to ſee a man raviſh'd and fallen into an <hi>Ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> as it were out of himſelf, in the contemplation of ſome object, than to ſee ſome perſons ſo over-joy'd, as to die out of pure joy. For Knowledge being an action of the Underſtanding, whereby it raiſes and elevates to a ſpiritual and incorporeal Being things that are moſt material, which are advanc'd in the Underſtanding to a new and more perfect Being, than that which they had of their own Nature, the Underſtanding renders them like it ſelf, and is ſo united to them, that there cannot be a greater conformity than what is between the object and the power whereby it is known. When therefore that object is of its own Nature ſpiritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, the Underſtanding having diſengag'd it ſelf from every other Subject, is ſo over-joy'd at its own knowledge, that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets all other actions of leſs conſequence.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> is properly attributed to Lunaticks and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted perſons, and is by Phyſicians plac'd among the higheſt irregularities, cauſed by black Choler in the minds of ſuch as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:66371:202"/>
are much inclin'd to Melancholy; in whom it cauſes an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, which inclines them to imagine, ſpeak, or do things that are ridiculous and extravagant; ſometimes with fury and rage, when that humor is enflam'd, and converted into black Choler, and ſometimes with a ſtupid ſadneſs, when it continues cold and dry.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifying an <hi>Ecſtacy,</hi> is ordinarily taken for every change of condition whatever it may be; ſometimes for a tranſportation and elevation of mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man comes to know things abſent, as it was explicated in the precedent part of this diſcourſe. Such peradventure was the taking up of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> even while he liv'd, into that blisful Seat of the Bleſſed, which he calls the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> allowing the Air to be one, and the ſtarry-ſky to be another: And that of Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, which he ſpeaks of in the <hi>Revelation</hi>; Nay, before them, ſuch were thoſe of the Prophets, and, after them, thoſe of many other perſons, if we may give any credit to Hiſtorians. Such was that of the Abbot <hi>Romuald,</hi> who, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great difficulty to read the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> became, in an <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> he had as he was ſaying Maſs, ſo learned, that he was able to interpret the moſt intricate paſſages of them. Such was that of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> the Founder of the Order of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> who, in a raviſhment, receiv'd upon his body the marks of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Paſſion. Such was Saint <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who frequently fell into ſuch an <hi>Ecſtacy,</hi> that he ſeem'd dead to all that were about him. Such was <hi>John Scot,</hi> commonly known by the name of the ſubtle Doctor, to whom the ſame thing happen'd ſo often, that his moſt familiar friends ſeeing him as he ſate reading or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, found him many times immoveable and without ſentiment, inſomuch that he was carry'd away from the place for dead; and yet theſe two laſt, were rais'd up ſo illuminated from that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Death, that they have left but few imitators of their great Learning. The ſame thing is affirmed of a certain Virgin, nam'd <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Senſes were ſometimes ſo ſtupifi'd, that ſhe continu'd a long time in a manner dead; from which kind of Trance being come to her ſelf, ſhe fore-told ſome things, which afterwards came to paſs according to her predictions. To be ſhort, there are few Monaſteries of either Men or Women, but affirm as much of their Founders. And that it may not be imagin'd, that ſuch a ſeparation of Body and Soul happened during this Life only to Enthuſiaſm, or a highly-contemplative meditation of divine things, which nevertheleſs muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the common cauſe of it; we read of <hi>Epimenides</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> and <hi>Ariſteas</hi> the <hi>Proconneſian,</hi> eminent Poets and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that ſometimes they left their Bodies without Souls; which, having taken their progreſs about the world, return'd after a certain time, and re-animated their Bodies. Nay, <hi>Pliny</hi> hath a pretty remarkable Story, how that the Soul of this <hi>Ariſteas</hi> was many times perceiv'd to take her flight out of his Body,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:66371:202"/>
under the form of a Crow; and that his Enemies having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it, and on a time met with his Body in that poſture, burnt it, and by that means diſappointed the Bird of her neſt. <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> relates a Story yet much more prodigious, of <hi>Hermotimus</hi> the <hi>Clazomenian,</hi> to wit, that his Soul made Voyages of ſeveral years; having left his Body, during that time, without any ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while ſhe went up and down into divers parts of the world, fore-telling Earth-quakes, great Droughts, Deluges, and ſuch other remarkable Accidents. And further, that this thing having ſeveral times happen'd to him, he had given his wife a ſtrict charge that no Body ſhould touch his Body during his Soul's being abroad upon the account aforeſaid; but ſome perſons of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance bearing him a grudg, having with much importunity obtain'd of her the favour to ſee his Body lying on the ground in that immoveable poſture, they caus'd it to be burnt, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Soul's return into it; which yet it being not in their power to do, and the <hi>Clazomenians</hi> being inform'd of that injury done to <hi>Hermotimus,</hi> built him a Temple, into which Women were forbidden to enter. And <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Daemon or Genius, confirming this Relation, and allowing it to be true, affirms, that thoſe who had committed that crime, were then tormented in Hell for it. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book of the <hi>City of God,</hi> Lib. xiv. relates, that a certain Prieſt, named <hi>Reſtitutus,</hi> when-ever, and as often as, he was deſir'd to do it, became ſo inſenſible at the mournful tone of ſome lamenting voice, and lay ſtretch'd along as a dead Carkaſe, ſo as that he could not be awak'd by thoſe who either pinch'd or prick'd him; nay, not by the application of fire to ſome part of his Body, inaſmuch as he could not feel any thing while he continu'd in the <hi>Ecſtacy,</hi> only afterwards it was perceiv'd that he had been burnt, by the mark which remain'd upon his Body after he was come to himſelf; before which time be had not any reſpiration, and yet he would ſay, that he had heard the voices of thoſe who had cry'd aloud in his Ears, calling to mind that he had heard them ſpeaking at a great diſtance. The ſame Author in the xix. Book of the ſame Work, affirms, that the Father of one <hi>Praeſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was apt to fall into ſuch <hi>Ecſtacies,</hi> that he believ'd himſelf chang'd into a Pack-Horſe, and that he carry'd Proviſions upon his back into the fields with other Horſes, when all the while his Body continu'd immoveable in the Houſe. Among other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this kind of <hi>Ecſtacy, Bodin</hi> in his ſecond Book of his <hi>Daemonomania, chap.</hi> 5. relates a ſtory of a certain Servant-maid living in the <hi>Danphine,</hi> having been found lying all along upon a dung-hill, in ſuch a dead ſleep that all the noiſe made could not awake her; nay, her Maſter's banging her with a ſwitch not prevailing any thing, he ordered fire to be ſet to the moſt ſenſible and tendereſt parts of her Body, to try whether ſhe were really dead or not. Which being upon tryal believ'd, they left her in the ſame place till the morning; and then ſending to look after
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:66371:203"/>
her, ſhe was found very well in her bed. Whereupon the Maſter aſking her, What ſhe had been doing all the night before? Ah, Maſter, ſaid ſhe, how unmercifully have you beaten me? Upon that diſcovery ſhe was accus'd for a Witch, and confeſs'd it. To be ſhort, <hi>Cardan</hi> in his eighth Book of the <hi>Variety of Things,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms of himſelf, that he fell into an <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> when he pleas'd; inſomuch that he ſleightly heard the voices of thoſe who ſpoke to him, but underſtood them not; Nay, what is more, was not ſenſible of any pinching, nor yet feeling the exquiſite pain of his Gout, whereto he was much ſubject; as being not ſenſible at that time of any thing but that he was out of himſelf. He afterwards explicates the manner how that <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> is wrought, affirming, that he felt it begin at the Head, eſpecially in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Brain, and thence ſpread it ſelf all along the Back-bone. He affirmed further, that at the very beginning of it he was ſenſible of a certain ſeparation about the Heart, as if the Soul with-drew at a kind of wicket, or ſally-port, the whole Body concerning it ſelf therein; and adds, that then he ſees what-ever he would with his Eyes, and not by the ſtrength of the Underſtanding, and that thoſe Images which he ſees are in a continual tranſiency and motion, in the reſemblance of Foreſts, Animals, and ſuch other things: The Cauſe whereof he attributes to the ſtrength of the Imagination, and ſharpneſs of the Sight. He further relates of his Father ſuch things as are much more miraculous, and occaſion'd the ſuſpicion of his being a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</p>
            <p>Now from all theſe Sacred and Prophane Hiſtories, it may be inferr'd that of <hi>Ecstacies,</hi> ſome are <hi>miraculous,</hi> and others <hi>natural.</hi> The former not ſubmitting to ordinary Cauſes any more than all the other things do that concern Religion, which ſtands much upon the preheminence of being above Reaſon. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proceeding from the great diſproportion there is between the Body and the Mind, the one being extreamly vigorous, the other extreamly weak. Whence it follows, that there are two ſorts of perſons ſubject to <hi>Natural Ecſtacies,</hi> to wit, thoſe tranſcendent Minds which are diſpos'd into weak Bodies, and weak Minds in ſtrong and robuſt Bodies; inaſmuch as there being not a perfect connexion and correſpondence between them, the Soul finds it no great difficulty to diſengage her ſelf from the Body, or the Body from the Soul, which by that means obtains a freedom in her operations, it being ſupposd that they do not all at depend one upon another, as may be ſeen in the Formation of the Embryo, wherein. the Soul making her ſelf a place of aboad plainly ſhews, that ſhe is able to act without it, as alſo in ſwoundings and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, during which, the Body continues ſo deſtitute of ſenſe, that no active faculty, at leaſt no operation of the Soul, is obſervable in it.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Vegetative Soul, which is without motion, being the firſt whereby we live, it is not to be much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:66371:203"/>
if the other two Souls, to wit, the Senſitive and the Rational do ſometimes ſeparate themſelves from it; and this is that which they call <hi>Ecſtacy</hi>: whereof we have a certain inſtance in all the faculties, wich are in like manner ſeparated one from another, without the loſs of their Organs. Accordingly, he who is moſt ſharp-ſighted as to the Underſtanding, hath common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but a weak corporeal ſight; the moſt robuſt Body is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn'd to the weakeſt Mind: Thoſe perſons who walk and talk in their ſleep, do alſo ſhew that the Rational Soul does quit the Government of the Body, and leaves it to the direction and diſpoſal of the ſenſitive; and the ſame thing may be alſo ſaid of the Vegetative excluſively to the other two. To come to Inſtances: we have at this day the experience of ſome, who continue a long time in <hi>Ecſtacies,</hi> and that not only in matters of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but alſo in ſome things of little concernment, which they are not able to comprehend; nay, there are ſome have the knack of falling into Trances and <hi>Ecſtacies</hi> when they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And this hath been affirm'd to me of a certain perſon who was able to do it, without any other trouble than this: He caus'd to be painted on the wall a great Circle all white, in the Centre whereof he ſet a black mark, and after a long continu'd looking upon it, the Viſual Spirits being by degrees diſſipated, brought his Soul into a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or Dizzineſs, which occaſion'd the <hi>Ecſtacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the opinion of <hi>Bodin,</hi> which allows a ſeparation between the Souls and Bodies of Witches and Sorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, having been invented only to render a reaſon of what they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they had ſeen, during the time their Bodies had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, is not to be believ'd without ſome further proof; ſince it is impoſſible even by that to explicate the Relations which they make of thoſe places, where they ſay they had been, and the things they had there done; inaſmuch as they poſitively affirm, that they had made thoſe progreſſes with their Bodies and all their members, and that they had made uſe of them in eating, drinking, and performing ſuch other actions as are purely corporeal, and cannot be imagin'd done in a ſtate of ſeparation, as being not compatible to ſeparated Spirits, which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, ſtand in need of Bodies to aſſume corporeal affections, and perform thoſe beaſtly Actions whereof Sorcerers talk ſo much.</p>
            <p>To this may be added, that this ſeparation cannot be wrought without death, and, that ſuppos'd, it were impoſſible the Souls ſhould re-enter into their Bodies otherwiſe than by a real reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is an act that God hath ſo reſerv'd to himſelf, that the Devil is not capable of doing it: Nay, though it were in his power, it is rather to be imagin'd that he would be far enough from taking ſouls out of their bodies, and diſrobing them of their ſenſual inclinations, inaſmuch as he does all lies in his power, to involve the Souls of Men more and more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into their Bodies, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:66371:204"/>
make them wallow in ſenſuality, and render all their affections corporeal. Accordingly, great and generous Souls, ſuch as are moſt diſengag'd from the Body, are not fit for that purpoſe; ſince <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and all the other Maſters of that deteſtable profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, require Simplicity in thoſe who would be Sorcerers, as a neceſſary and previous diſpoſition. So that if the Souls of Sorcerers, which are at firſt engag'd, and afterwards continu'd in the Devil's ſervice, only in proſecution of the concerns of the Body, came to be deveſted of that heavy maſs whereby they are encompaſſed, and ſtripp'd of the inclinations of the Body, no doubt they would break off ſo diſadvantagious a bargain, at leaſt they would not find any delight in the divertiſements where-with the Devil does amuſe them. It is therefore more probable, that the Devil ſhould ſometimes caſt Sorcerers into a certain ſleep, and bind up their common ſenſe, ſo as that they are rendred incapable of receiving external impreſſions, and that in the mean time, he ſhould joyn together the different ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Memory, and raiſe in the Imagination ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof as are conformable to the truths which are made elſe-where. So that the Underſtanding not receiving any thing from without, which might undeceive it, is wholly taken up with the ſpecies it hath within; the apprehenſion of Sorcerers being much like thoſe of ſome perſons, who having their brains either weakned by Diſeaſes, or naturally receive ſuch an impreſſion from their dreams, that when they awake, they are hardly able to diſtinguiſh them from the things they have ſeen. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is commonly called a Diabolical <hi>Ecſtacy,</hi> deſerves not the name, ſince it is only the caſting of one into a dead ſleep. Thoſe Diſeaſes which Phyſicians call <hi>Ecſtacies,</hi> as Catalepſies and Madneſs, are only ſuch improperly; and the ſame thing is to be ſaid of thoſe kind of ſwoundings, which have frequently been taken for <hi>Ecſtacies</hi> in ſome perſons, who having continu'd their Contemplations beyond the ſtrength of their Bodies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſwounded out of pure weakneſs, have upon the recovery of themſelves, imagin'd, that their Minds had been tranſported into real <hi>Ecſtacies,</hi> and yet can give no account of what had paſs'd during the time of their Trance. The precedent ſtories, and thoſe which may be thereto added, of <hi>Socrates, Archimedes,</hi> and ſome others, do not prove that, naturally, there can be any <hi>Ecſtacy</hi>; for either thoſe ſtories ſeem to be palpably fabulous, or only ſhew that the Souls of thoſe Ecſtatical Perſons had not broke off all correſpondence with the Body, nor quitted the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the ſenſes and their Organs, that they might be wholly involv'd in themſelves, and ſo reſign themſelves to Meditations purely Intellectual. For he who ſhall examine the example of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as it is related in <hi>Plato,</hi> will look upon that action rather as a tryal, which <hi>Socrates</hi> made of his own Patience, than as a real <hi>Ecstacy,</hi> eſpecially ſince <hi>Socrates</hi> is imagin'd ſtanding; a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture requiring the motion of the Muſcles, which preſuppoſes
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:66371:204"/>
ſentiment in the exterior parts. Accordingly, dead bodies, as alſo thoſe wherein the action of the Soul is check'd and hindred, are not found ſtanding, though the <hi>Athenians</hi> have ſhuffled in, among their ſtories, a tale of one of their men who ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right after he had been kill'd. The other Inſtances are of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who meditated with ſuch earneſtneſs and attention on their own thoughts, and directed their minds with ſo much violence towards that ſenſe, whereof they had moſt occaſion, that the other ſenſes were deſtitute of Spirits and without action, not diſcerning their own proper objects if they were not extreamly violent, which is no real <hi>Ecſtacy,</hi> inaſmuch as otherwiſe we muſt call Sleep an <hi>Ecſtacy.</hi> And, indeed, the moſt refin'd and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Meditations, which we derive from thoſe <hi>Ecſtacies,</hi> ſmell ſo ſtrong of the Body and Matter, that it is probable, they were not the pure productions of the Soul, no way diverted by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances of the Body and the internal ſenſes, on which ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively depends, even in the inorganical actions ſhe does; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing impoſſible for her to meditate alone, ſince that in her direct actions ſhe ſtands in need of the Imagination, and muſt be excited by Phantaſms; but above all, ſhe cannot be without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which always furniſhes her with the matter of her ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſerves the ſpecies of them. Beſides, thoſe who are of opinion, that all the faculties of the Soul while ſhe is in the Body are organical, cannot imagine any <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> wherein the Soul meditates by her ſelf, without any commerce with the Body and its ſentiments; and thoſe, who conceive, that the faculties of the Underſtanding and Will borrow nothing of the Organs but the objects of their actions, do nevertheleſs inferr, that the Soul ſtands in need of the ſenſes, in order to the doing of her actions, and is not over-earneſt in the doing of them, but when ſhe is excited by the Phantaſms, for the ſtirring whereof the Animal Spirits are abſolutely neceſſary, which takes away all conceit of <hi>Ecſtacies.</hi> And thoſe who imagine, that in <hi>Ecſtacies</hi> the Soul hath no correſpondence with them, and makes no uſe of them in her actions, do, by that means, inſtead of eſtabliſhing deſtroy the <hi>Ecſtacy</hi>; ſince it muſt be inferr'd, that the Soul du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of thoſe retir'd meditations, leaves the Spirits in the Organs, whoſe function it is in the mean time to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the external objects, and convey them into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, and thence into the Imagination and Memory; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis expected, that the <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> ſhould leave the Body without action. Whence therefore, I conclude, that there is not any at all, in regard that an <hi>Ecſtacy</hi> ſignifying a ſtate of the Soul, beſides that which is natural to her, and beſides the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence there is between the actions of the ſenſes, and thoſe that are proper to the Rational Soul; it may be affirm'd, that ſuch a ſtate never happens, and that the Soul ſhall not be abſolutely freed from the incumbrances and diſtractions of the Body till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death. And this hath been ſufficiently acknowledg'd by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:66371:205"/>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Phoedon,</hi> notwithſtanding all the <hi>Ecſtacies</hi> attributed to him; and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whoſe thoughts were more abſtracted, and tranſcended thoſe of all others, would not by any means admit of <hi>Ecſtacies</hi> from a natural cauſe, but attributes them all to God. Which procedure of his hath been approved by <hi>Scaliger</hi> and many others.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXIII. Of the Cock, and whether the Lyon be frightned at his Crowing.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Germans</hi> being engag'd upon an expedition of War had ſome reaſon to carry a Cock along with them, to ſerve them for an incitement and example of Vigilance. Thence haply proceeded the cuſtom, which ſome Mule-drivers and Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners ſtill obſerve of having one faſten'd to the leading Mule or Horſe; and ſometimes for want of that, adorning them with a plume of his or ſome other feathers. 'Twas upon this account, that <hi>Phidias</hi>'s <hi>Minerva</hi> had a Cock upon her head-piece, unleſs it be attributed to this, that the ſaid Goddeſs had alſo the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and direction of War, where there is no leſs need of Vigilance than Induſtry; though that Bird belongs to her ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently upon the ſcore of his other qualities, as being ſo gallant and courageous, as many times rather to loſe his Life upon the ſpot, than quit the deſire of victory; and when he is engag'd, fighting with ſuch fury, that <hi>Caelius Aurelian</hi> relates that one who had been peck'd by a Cock in the heat of fighting, grew mad upon it. For the Paſſion of Anger being a ſhort fury, 'tis poſſible it may extreamly heighten the degree of heat, in a temperament already ſo highly cholerick, that in time the body of the Cock becomes nitrous; and upon that conſideration, is preſcrib'd to ſick perſons for the looſening the belly, and that after he hath been well beaten with a wand, and the feathers pluck'd while he is alive before he is boyl'd. It may be further urg'd, that this Courage of the Cock was the motive which inclin'd <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to grant him, who kill'd Prince <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of carrying on his Javelin a little Cock of Gold, as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular acknowledgement of his Valour. Whereupon the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Province of <hi>Caria,</hi> whereof he who had the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid priviledge of the Cock was a Native, in imitation of him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Corſlets wore Cocks upon their head-pieces; whence they had the name of <hi>Alectryons,</hi> or Cocks, in Latin <hi>Galli,</hi> which poſſibly is the reaſon that gave the French that name: And whereas the Cock commonly crows after he hath beaten ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it came alſo to be the Hieroglyphick of Victory, and that
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:66371:205"/>
haply gave the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> occaſion to ſacrifice a Cock when they had overcome their Enemies.</p>
            <p>This Creature was alſo dedicated to <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Poets feign, that he had ſometime been a young Souldier, whom that God of War order'd to ſtand ſentinel when he went in to <hi>Venus</hi> to give him notice of <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s return; but he having ſlept till after the Sun was riſen, and by that neglect of duty <hi>Mars</hi> being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with her, he was ſo incens'd that he metamorphos'd him into a Cock; whence it comes, ſay they, that being ever ſince mindful of the occaſion of his transformation, he ever crowes when the Sun approaches our Horizon. This fable, how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſoever it may be thought, is as ſupportable as that of the <hi>Alcaron,</hi> which attributes the crowing of our Cocks to one which it ſaies there is in Heaven; a Cock of ſuch a vaſt bulk, that having his feet on the firſt of the Heavens, the head reaches to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and this Cock crowing above, awakens and incites all thoſe upon Earth to do the like, as theſe laſt ſet one another a crowing, as if they all crow'd at the ſame inſtant all over the world.</p>
            <p>The Cock was alſo dedicated to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Latona, Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina</hi>; whence it came that the Novices, and ſuch as were initiated in their myſteries, abſtain'd from the eating of it. It was alſo the ſame to <hi>Mercury,</hi> in regard that vigilance and early riſing are requiſite in Merchants. And thence it came that he was painted under the form of a Man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, having a Creſt or Comb on his Head, Eagle's claws inſtead of Feet, and holding a Cock upon his fiſt. But there was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſecration made of him to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> which oblig'd <hi>Socrates</hi> at his death to entreat his Friends to ſacrifice a Cock to him, ſince the Hemlock where-with he was poyſon'd had wrought well. The Inhabitants of <hi>Calecuth</hi> ſacrifice him to their divinity under the form of a he-goat: And <hi>Acoſta,</hi> after <hi>Lucian,</hi> affirms, that anciently the Cock was ador'd as a God; which Chriſtianity not enduring, hath order'd them to be plac'd upon Churches &amp; on the tops of ſteeples, and other very high ſtructures, that by their turning about they might tell the beholders which way the Wind blew; unleſs haply ſome would refer it to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> at the ſecond crowing of one of them. As concerning the crowing of this Creature, it is commonly attributed to his heat, and may be a certain diſcovery of his joy at the approach of the Star of the ſame temperament with him. And whereas he is more ſuſceptible than any other of the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Air, (whence it comes that being moiſten'd by the vapors, he crows with a hoarſer voice, which Labourers look on as a prediction of Rain) it may be thence conſequent, that he is the firſt ſenſible of the coming of the Sun. Moreover, whereas there is a Solar Animal, ſuch as is alſo the Lyon, but in a lower degree than he, the ſpecies of Birds being hotter and dryer, as being lighter than that of four-footed Beaſts; it thence follows,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:66371:206"/>
that the Cock hath an aſcendent over the Lyon, which no ſooner hears his crowing, but it awakens in his Imagination thoſe ſpecies which cauſe terror to him: Unleſs we would rather affirm, that the ſpirits of the Cock are communicated to the Lyon, by that more than material voice; and as ſuch more capable of acting, than the ſpirits iſſuing out of the Eyes of ſick perſons, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs infect thoſe who are well, and look on them; nay, if we may believe the Poet, bewitch even innocent Lambs.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That this error of the Lyon's being terrifi'd at the crowing of the Cock, was to be added to the number of all thoſe vulgar ones, which had occaſion'd ſo much beating of the Air in the ſchools and pulpits about Maxims which are diſcover'd to be abſolutely falſe in the Practick; it being a thing not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that ſome Lyon which had been tam'd, and by change of nouriſhment become cowardly and degenerate, had been a little ſtartled at that ſhrill crowing of the Cock, grating of a ſudden upon his ears. And this conjecture will not be thought ſtrange by thoſe, who, about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> laſt, 1659. were preſent at an engagement which had been appointed between ſuch a Lyon and a Bull in a Tennis-Court at <hi>Rochel</hi>: The Lyon was ſo frightned at the ſight of the Bull, that he got up into the Lights precipitating the Spectators, who had planted themſelves there in great numbers, as eſteeming it the ſafeſt place of all; and thence he ſlunk away and hid himſelf, and could never afterwards be gotten into the liſts. It may alſo be imagin'd, that the ſtrangeneſs and novelty of that Crowing might ſurprize ſome Lyon that had never heard it before, by reaſon of his living at a great diſtance from Cities and Villages, where thoſe Creatures are commonly bred, and that thence it came the Lyon was ſtartled at that firſt motion. Moreover, 'tis poſſible, nay, it may be more than probably affirm'd, that ſome have taken that ſtartling out of indignation, obſervable in the Lyon when any thing diſpleaſes him for an argument of his fear, whereas it was a diſcovery of his being incens'd. For to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a real and general fear in that generous Creature, upon ſo ſleight an account as the crowing of a Cock, I cannot ſee any probability for it, in regard that correſpondence and conformity which is attributed to them, ſhould rather occaſion a Sympathy in them, than any thing of averſion, which being fully as great as that which the Sheep hath for the Wolf, ſhould no more frighten the Lyon, than the bleating of the Sheep does the Wolf. Nor is it ſo much out of an averſion and Antipathy which the Wolf hath for the Sheep, that he devours and converts it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſubſtance, as out of kindneſs and love to his own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and there are commonly ſeen about thoſe houſes, where Lyons are kept, ſeveral Cocks and Hens, and yet the Lyons never make any diſcovery of their being frighted at their crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or crakling. Nay, for a further confirmation hereof, it comes into my mind, that I have ſeen a young Lyon devour a
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:66371:206"/>
Cock, which, I muſt confeſs, crow'd no more than thoſe of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> a Village of the Province of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> in <hi>Macedon,</hi> where the Cocks do not crow at all. But if there were ſuch an Antipathy between them, as ſome would have imagin'd, the Lyon would have thought it enough to tear him to pieces, and not eat him as he did. And therefore it is to be conceiv'd, that what hath given occaſion to this error, is the moral ſenſe, which ſome would draw from it; to ſhew, that the ſtrongeſt are not free from a certain fear, which they conceive of thoſe things whence they ſhould leaſt expect it. So that, to put this Queſtion, Why the Lyon is frightned at the crowing of the Cock, is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the cauſe of what is not.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That we are not to make ſo ſleight an account of the authority of our Anceſtors, as abſolutely to deny what they have affirmed to us, and ſeems to be ſufficiently prov'd by the ſilent acquieſcence of ſo many Ages, under pretence that we are not able to reſolve it: Which were to imitate <hi>Alexander,</hi> in cutting the <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, becauſe he could not unty it. It were much better to endeavor to find out in the nature of the Cock and in his crowing, the cauſe of the Lyon's being frightned thereat. Let it then be imagin'd, that the Lyon being an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal always in a Fever through an exceſſive choler, whereof his hair and violence are certain marks; the ſame thing happens to him as to ſick and feveriſh perſons, to whom noiſe is inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, eſpecially to thoſe, in whom a cholerick humor enflam'd cauſeth pains in the Head: Nay, there are ſome kinds of ſounds which ſome perſons are not able to endure, yet ſo as that they cannot aſſign any cauſe thereof, and ſo as that we are forc'd to explain it by Specifick Properties and Antipathies; ſuch as we may imagine to be between the crowing of a Cock and the ear of a Lyon. And that is much more probable then the ſtopping of a Ship by the <hi>Remora,</hi> when ſhe is under all the ſail ſhe can make, and a thouſand other effects imperceptible to reaſon, and ſuch as whereof only Experience can judge; and therfore that terror which the Lyon is put into at the crowing of the Cock, is not ſo irrational; that Sovereign of Animals having juſt cauſe to admire, how from ſo ſmall a Body there comes a voice ſo ſhrill and ſtrong, as to be heard at ſo great a diſtance, conſidering with himſelf what miſchief he does with ſo little noiſe; and this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Lyon is increas'd if the Cock be all white, inaſmuch as that colour promotes the diffuſion of his ſpirits already diſpers'd by the firſt motion of his apprehenſion.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXIV. Of the Sibyls.</head>
            <p>THough it be generally acknowledg'd that there were <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byls,</hi> yet as to their Names, their Number, their Country, and their Works, nay, the whole ſtory of them, all is full of doubts and uncertainties. The Etymology of the Greek word ſignifies as much as the <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Counſel of God</hi>; the <hi>Aeolick</hi> Dialect ſaying <hi>Siou</hi> inſtead of <hi>Theou.</hi> The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> call'd them <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes.</hi> They are cited, and conſequently acknowledg'd by <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Athenagoras, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tatian, Lactantius,</hi> and other ancient Authors. <hi>Varro,</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus,</hi> call them Women fill'd with divinity, fore-telling things to come, whence they came alſo to be call'd <hi>Propheteſſes.</hi> Some conceive that they were before the War of <hi>Troy,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr all their predictions only to one of them, imagining that the ſame thing happen'd to them as had done to <hi>Homer,</hi> who, for his great reputation, gave occaſion to ſeveral Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> to attribute his birth to them: in like manner as a great number of Cities and Countrys; as for inſtance, <hi>Erythrae, Cumae, Sardis, Troy, Rhodes, Libya, Phrygia, Samos,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> deſirous to attribute to themſelves the Birth of that Sibyl, it came to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that there were many of them. Amongſt whom, <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus Capella,</hi> grounding his aſſertion upon very probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, acknowledges but two, <hi>Erophila,</hi> the <hi>Trojan</hi> Sibyl, whom he affirms to be the ſame that others call the <hi>Phrygian</hi> and <hi>Cumaean,</hi> and the others <hi>Symmagia,</hi> call'd alſo <hi>Erythraea,</hi> at the place of her birth. <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms, that there were at <hi>Rome</hi> three Statues of the Sibyls, one erected by <hi>Pacuvius Taurus,</hi> Aedile of the people; the other two by <hi>Marcus Valerius Meſſala,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur. The firſt of theſe three, according to the relation of <hi>Solinus</hi> in his <hi>Polyhiſtor,</hi> was call'd <hi>Cumana,</hi> who prophesy'd at <hi>Cumae</hi> in the fiftieth Olympiad, and had ſtill her Temple at <hi>Pouzols,</hi> about a hundred years ſince, but was burnt in a general confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration that happen'd there in the year MDXXXIX. under the ruins of which it was then buried; ſo that there remains now only ſome ſubterraneous places, into which a man cannot go upright, yet ſtill expreſs a certain divinity, inaſmuch as thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of a vaſt and ſpacious ſtructure, ſeem to be all cut out of one ſtone. The ſecond was call'd the <hi>Delphick</hi> Sibyl, and liv'd before the Wars of <hi>Troy.</hi> The third is that <hi>Eriphyla</hi> of <hi>Erythrae,</hi> who prophesy'd at <hi>Lesbos. Aelian</hi> affirms, that there were four, to wit, the <hi>Erythraean,</hi> the <hi>Samian,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> and that of <hi>Sardis.</hi> To that number others add two, the <hi>Judaick</hi> and the <hi>Cumaean</hi>; but <hi>Varro,</hi> deſirous to have yet more of them, adds four, and makes them up ten; of which opinion is alſo <hi>Onuphrius.</hi> They are diſpos'd into this order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:66371:207"/>The firſt and moſt ancient is the <hi>Delphick,</hi> of whom <hi>Chryſippus</hi> ſpeaks in his Book of <hi>Divination,</hi> by the Ancients called <hi>Artemis,</hi> born at <hi>Delphi,</hi> and it is conceiv'd that <hi>Homer</hi> inſerted many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this Sibyl in his Works. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> calls her <hi>Daphne,</hi> and ſayes ſhe was the Daughter of <hi>Tireſias,</hi> of whom ſhe had not learnt the Art of Divination, when the <hi>Argians</hi> having taken the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſent her to <hi>Delphi</hi> to pay their vows, where having learnt to divine by the inſpiration of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſhe ſpoke Oracles to thoſe who conſulted her.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Erythraean,</hi> as is affirm'd by <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> a Native of the ſame Country: And yet <hi>Strabo</hi> ſayes, that ſhe was a <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and had only given her ſelf the name of the <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thraean,</hi> whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> affirms to have liv'd in the time of <hi>Romulus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is the <hi>Cumaean,</hi> or <hi>Cimmerian,</hi> ſo call'd from the <hi>Cimmerian</hi> Town near the City <hi>Cumae</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> whom ſome call <hi>Deiphobe</hi>; to this Sibyl it was that <hi>Aeneas</hi> addreſs'd himſelf when he made his eſcape from <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth is the <hi>Samian,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Phyto,</hi> of whom <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> ſayes, that ſhe was mention'd in the Annals of the <hi>Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The fifth is the <hi>Cumaean,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Amalthaea,</hi> or <hi>Demophila,</hi> and called by <hi>Suidas, Hierophila.</hi> Of this Sibyl is related the ſtory of the nine Books, and according to others of the three, (not of the <hi>Cumaean,</hi> whom ſome unadviſedly confound with this, though they were different) which ſhe preſented to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> as it is affirmed by <hi>Varro, Solinus, Lactantius, Servius, Suidas,</hi> and ſeveral others. And <hi>Solinus</hi> gives this further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her, that, in his time, her Sepulchre was ſhewn in <hi>Sicily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixth is the <hi>Helleſpontick,</hi> born in the Trojan Country, at the Town of <hi>Marmiſſus,</hi> near the City of <hi>Gergithium,</hi> whom <hi>Heraclides</hi> of <hi>Pontus</hi> affirms to have liv'd in the time of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that is, in the L X. Olympiad.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is the <hi>Lybian,</hi> of whom <hi>Euripides</hi> ſpeaks in the Prologue before <hi>Lamia,</hi> which he writ in the LXXX. Olympiad.</p>
            <p>The eighth is the <hi>Perſian,</hi> of whom there is mention made by <hi>Nicanor,</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> calls her alſo the <hi>Chaldaean,</hi> in his <hi>Admonition to the Gentiles</hi>; and ſhe is conceiv'd to have been the Daughter of the Hiſtorian <hi>Beroſus,</hi> and <hi>Erimantha.</hi> She liv'd in the CXX. Olympiad.</p>
            <p>The ninth is the <hi>Phrygian,</hi> who prophecy'd at <hi>Ancyra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth is the <hi>Tiburtine,</hi> called <hi>Albunea,</hi> who was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as a Goddeſs on the ſhores of the River <hi>Anienus,</hi> in which her Statue was found.</p>
            <p>All theſe ten Sibyls are repreſented by a Picture hanging up as it were in the Clouds, having their Heads encompaſs'd with
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:66371:208"/>
Light, as our Saints commonly have. But the firſt holds a Hunter's Horn in his right Hand; the ſecond, a Sword; the third, a Torch; the fourth, a Croſs; the fifth, a pair of Gloves in the left Hand; the ſixth, a Cradle on her right Hand; the ſeventh, holds a Lanthorn; the eighth, a branch of a Roſe-buſh; the ninth, hath a loaf of Bread on one ſide of her; the tenth, hath a ſmall Wand or Rod. The Painters have preſum'd to add two others, to wit, the <hi>Europaean,</hi> holding a Crown of thorns; and the <hi>Agrippinean,</hi> who holds a banner faſten'd to a Croſs; but they do it not by any other Authority, than that They and the Poets aſſume to themſelves to attempt any thing. According to which priviledge, there are yet divers others, to wit, one named <hi>Eliſſa,</hi> who prophesy'd in verſe: Whereto may be added <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Priamus,</hi> the <hi>Epirotick</hi> Sibyl, the Theſſalian <hi>Manto, Carmenta</hi> the Mother of <hi>Evander, Fatua</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Faunus, Sappho</hi>; and, upon a better title than any of the precedent, <hi>Deborah, Miriam,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs <hi>Huldah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt famous of all, and ſhe to whom the Ancients gave greateſt credit, was the <hi>Cumaean,</hi> who, under the form and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of an old woman not known to any, came to <hi>Tarquinius Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbus,</hi> to whom ſhe preſented nine Volumes of Oracles, which ſhe ſaid he ſhould have for three hundred <hi>philippus</hi>'s; whereat the King took occaſion to laugh, as if the old woman were grown a child again, to aſk ſo great a ſumm for ſuch inconſiderable Books: Which ſhe perceiving, went away and burnt three of them; and coming again to make him a ſecond proffer of the ſix remaining, demanded the ſame price ſhe had aſk'd for all the nine; and the King having laugh'd at her as before, and being confirm'd in his conceit of her being diſtracted, ſhe burnt three more of them; but returning the third time, and aſking of him the firſt mention'd ſumm for the three that were left, <hi>Tarquin</hi> aſtoniſh'd at that perſeverance, conſulted the Augurs what he ſhould do; whereto their Anſwer was, that, in all liklihood, they were ſome Counſells ſent by the Gods to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of it, which he ſhould not any longer refuſe. Accordingly he order'd her to have what ſhe demanded; and having advis'd him to be very careful in the keeping of thoſe Books, ſhe vaniſh'd, and was never after ſeen either in that King's Court, or any where elſe, which much heightned the opinion already conceiv'd of her Divinity. <hi>Tarquin</hi> recommended theſe Books to the keeping of two perſons of good repute, which number was afterwards mutiply'd to ten, elected one half out of the people, the other out of the Senate: And afterwards it came to fifteen, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd till it roſe to ſixty, but ſtill kept the name of the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decim viri,</hi> which receiv'd their period with all the other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh ceremonies in the time of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> Only thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were permitted to read the Books of the Sibyls, and their ſuperſtition came to ſuch a pitch, that there was not any thing ſo
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:66371:208"/>
holy and ſacred in <hi>Rome,</hi> as thoſe Books; inſomuch that when any thing occurr'd, wherein the Roman State was highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as the Peſtilence, civil War, or when their forreign Wars were not carry'd on with the ſucceſs they had promis'd themſelves; their recourſe was to thoſe books of the Sibylls, whence they pump'd out the remedies and advices which they had to give the Senate and People. This was obſerv'd till the time of the Social War, when, <hi>Cains Norbanus</hi> and <hi>Publius Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> being Conſuls, the Capitol was burnt, and with it all the ſacred things, and among them the Books of the Sibylls. But ſoon after the reparation of the Capitol, <hi>Scribonius Curio</hi> and <hi>Cneus Octavius</hi> being Conſuls, there came out an Edict from the Senate, that three Deputies ſhould go, as they did, to <hi>Erythrae,</hi> and other Citties of <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> whence they brought to <hi>Rome</hi> about a thouſand Verſes written by divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with the names of the Sibylls to whom they were attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And it is from the ignorance of ſo many hands, as had been employ'd in the writing of thoſe Verſes, that the many faults found therein proceeded; as being ſuch as oblig'd <hi>Tiber,</hi> to correct thoſe errours, and diſtinguiſh the ſuppoſititious verſes from the true ones, to order that every one ſhould bring in to the Praetor, of <hi>Rome</hi> whatever he had of them, with a prohibition that any ſhould retain Copies thereof ſave only the <hi>Quindecim viri,</hi> whoſe Office and Name receiv'd its period at the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the Sibylline Books made by the command of <hi>Stili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> Father-in-law to the Emperor <hi>Honorius,</hi> thinking by that means to raiſe a ſedition againſt his Son-in-law, and ſo to transfer the Empire to his own Son <hi>Eucherio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is all we have of certainty concerning the Hiſtory of the Sibylls, who may be probably conjectur'd to have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd by a certain Enthuſiaſm and divine inſpiration, which was granted them according to the acknowledgment of the Fathers, as a reward of their Virginity; it being not imaginable, that the many noble things they have foretold, even to the higheſt myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Salvation, ſhould proceed from the evil Spirit, much leſs from the motion of Nature, the ſtrength whereof is not able to come up to Prediction.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the vain deſire, which men of all times have been inclin'd to, of knowing things to come, having put them upon an unprofitable conſultation of Heaven, Earth, and Waters, to find out whatever might bring them any tidings thereof, they have not let ſlip any occaſion which they conceiv'd might inform them; their ſuperſtition being come to that height as to draw conſequences and preſages from all things, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to ſearch into the very entrails of Beaſts, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres of the Dead: Nay, what is yet more, if they have deriv'd a certain divination from the very chirping of Birds, whence their Augurs receiv'd their name, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they ſhould give credit to the Diſcourſes and Songs of

young Maids and Women. For, among thoſe who were called Sybills, there were ſome married, eſpecially ſhe who writ the firſt book of the Oracles attributed to them; which Sibyll ſays ſhe had been in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, with her Husband, her Father-in-law, her Mother-in law, her Brothers-in-law, and her Siſters-in law, who conſequently had not the gift of Prophecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on them, upon the account of their Virginity: And though, according to the teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and moſt of the other Eccleſiaſtical Authors, there was not any Sibyll more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then <hi>Moſes</hi>; yet does the Sibyll before-mentioned foretell the coming of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Deluge, at which by that means ſhe could not have been preſent; for things preſent are never fore-told. But what brings the credit of their Works into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuſpicion, is, that thoſe Verſes do themſelves diſcover, that they were written fifteen hundred years after the beginning of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, and conſequently, whatever they tell us of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the raign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Empire of the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> all which preceded that time, are <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> which they obtrude upon us for <hi>Prophecyes.</hi> And all the Myſteries of our Salvation contain'd in the Sibylline Verſes, are, in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſame Nature. And, in the fifth Book of the Sibylline Writings, the Sibyll ſays, that ſhe had ſeen the ſecond confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of the Veſtal's Temple; which, according to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> happen'd in the year of our Lord CXCIX. under the Emperour <hi>Commodus.</hi> And then it was indeed, that thoſe Verſes firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the World, nor were they ſeen before, nor cited by any one, and the Prophecies contain'd in them, have not ought to ſay of what ſhould come to paſs after that time, inaſmuch as they could not have done it with any certainty. As to her ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That there ſhould be three Emperours after <hi>Adrian,</hi> to wit, the two <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s, <hi>Pius,</hi> and the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Commodus,</hi> and then the times ſhould end, being found falſe in reſpect of what was to happen afterwards, as being things abſolute beſides her knowledg, it was not to be imagin'd, ſhe ſhould ſet down the names of the Emperors, or given the firſt Letters thereof, as ſhe had done thoſe of the fifteen, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, of whoſe Hiſtory ſhe gives as particular an account as thoſe Authors who ſpeak affirmatively thereof, and with all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances after their death. Add to this, the erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſome Chriſtians of that time, which are inſerted into their Works; as for inſtance, that the damned ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd after certain Ages; and that <hi>Nero</hi> ſhould remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd to be Antichriſt in the laſt times. Beſides, the too exact obſervance of order in thoſe Writings, is an argument that they were not the productions of perſons ſubject to Fanaticiſm, ſuch as ſome would have the Sibylls to be, who writ upon the leaves of Trees, the Verſes which their Enthuſiaſm dictated to them. And to conclude, there is no probability, that the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> who hath ſpoken more clearly of the Incarnation than
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:66371:209"/>
any other, ſhould think it enough to ſay, <hi>A Virgin ſhould bring forth a Son</hi>; and that the Sibyll ſhould ſay, before the thing came to paſs, <hi>The Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>ſhall bring forth a Son named</hi> Jeſus <hi>in Bethleem:</hi> there is no probability, I ſay, that God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow greater illuminations on thoſe Women, whom Antiquity ranked among the Prieſteſſes of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> than on the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd among his Prophets. Whence it is to be juſtly imagin'd, that ſome Chriſtians were the Authors of thoſe Verſes, who piouſly thought to make ſome advantages thereof againſt the Pagans, who gave credit to other Writings which were then in vogue and repute under that name: as there are ſome in our days who father on <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> ſuch things as he never thought of, and that after they are come to paſs; under pretence that there is ſome mention made thereof in that confuſion of matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he treats. This will not be thought ſtrange by thoſe, who conſidering the multitude of accidents, which that Author hath ſhuffled into his <hi>Centuries,</hi> whereof the varieties are ſo great, that it is no hard matter to find therein moſt occurrences of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life; as we ſee that in ſyllables diverſly tranſpos'd and put together, all things in the world may be found.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Ancients are not be thought ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, as to attribute ſuch authority to the Sibylls, if there had not been ſome young Maids and Women, who had effectually fore-told things to them. True it is, chance may be fortunate in one or two caſes, as a blind Archer may caſually hit the mark; but it is very unlikely, that one who cannot ſhoot at all, ſhould have the reputation of a good Archer all the world over. And yet Authors are full in aſſerting the authority, wherein the anſwers made by thoſe women were. <hi>Virgil</hi> grounding his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe on that common perſwaſion ſays,
<q>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltima <hi>Cumaei</hi> venit jam carminis aetas:</q>
And the <hi>Satyriſt</hi> confirms what he had ſaid, with another verſe, to wit,
<q>Credite me vohis folium recitare Sibyllae.</q>
And it was ordinary to inſcribe on Monuments the names of thoſe who were appointed for the keeping of thoſe books of the Sibylls and took care for the Sacrifices, which the <hi>Romans</hi> offered up, to appeaſe the wrath of the Gods, according to the counſel, which, as occaſion requir'd, they took from their verſes. Nay, there was ſuch a ſtrict prohibition that any ſhould have them in their private Libraries, that one of thoſe who were entruſted with the cuſtody of the Sibylline Books, named <hi>Marcus Atilius,</hi> was ſown up in a bag, and caſt into the Sea, for lending <hi>Petroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Sabinus</hi> one of thoſe Books to be tranſcrib'd, or, as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, only their ſimple Commentary, containing the ſecrets of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:66371:210"/>
the Sacrifices which were made according to them. Upon the ſame conſideration that it pleas'd God to ſanctifie <hi>Job,</hi> though out of the <hi>Judaick</hi> Church, the only one wherein ſalvation was then to be found, I may ſay, there is no inconvenience to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that he might as well beſtow the Spirit of Prophecy, on thoſe Virgins at leaſt commonly accounted ſuch. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, what is ſaid to the contrary, deſerving rather to paſs for adulterate and ſuppoſititious, then that there ſhould be any queſtion made of what divers of the holy Fathers have affirmed of them: the gift of Prophecy having been communicated alſo to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and God having miraculouſly opened the eyes, and unloos'd the tongue of his <hi>Aſs.</hi> What remains to this day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the minds of a great number of perſons, concerning <hi>Merluzina,</hi> and other Fairies, contributes ſomewhat to the proof of what hath been ſaid; ſome illuſtrious Families deriving their origin thence. For, as to the inſerting of ſome ſuppoſititious verſes into the body of their Works, it ſhould be no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to them, then it is to thoſe of the moſt excellent Authors, among which the ſpurious productions of others are ſometimes ſhuffled in. And if it be true, that <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verſes were at firſt confuſedly pronounced by him, and that it hath been the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of others, to reduce them into that noble order, wherein we read them, Why ſhould the ſame obſervance of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be cenſur'd in the diſpoſal of the Sibylline Verſes? <hi>Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Theagines,</hi> affirms, That <hi>Socrates</hi> acknowledged them to be Propheteſſes; and in his <hi>Phoedon,</hi> the ſame <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhews, by their example, That extravagance or diſtraction of mind does many times bring great advantages to Mankind. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the firſt queſtion of the thirtieth Section of his <hi>Problems,</hi> affirms, That Women become Sibylls, when the brain is over-heated, not by ſickneſs, but through a natural diſtemper. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he deſcribes the ſubterraneous Palace of a Sibyll, whom he affirms, according to the common report of her, to have liv'd a long time, and continu'd a Virgin. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Treatiſe, <hi>Why the Propheteſs</hi> Pythia <hi>renders not her Anſwers in verſe,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that, by a particular favour of God, a Sibyll had ſpoken things during the ſpace of a thouſand years; <hi>and elſewhere,</hi> that ſhe foretold the deſtruction of ſeveral Cities that were afterwards ſwallow'd up, the fire of <hi>Mount Gibel,</hi> and divers other things, ſetting down near the time when what ſhe had ſaid ſhould come to paſs. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> affirms, that the Sibyll <hi>Herophila,</hi> had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly foretold the bringing up of <hi>Helen</hi> at <hi>Sparta,</hi> and that it ſhould occaſion the deſtruction of <hi>Troy. Juſtin,</hi> having related what account <hi>Plato</hi> made of perſons who foretold things to come who he ſays, deſerve the name of Divine, though they do not themſelves comprehend the great and certain things which they predict, ſays, That that is to be underſtood of the Sibylline Verſes: the Writers whereof, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> had not the ſame power as the Poets have, to wit, that of correcting and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:66371:210"/>
poliſhing their works; inaſmuch as the inſpiration ceaſing, they do not ſo much as remember what they had ſaid, though ſome have been of opinion, that the agitation of Mind, wherewith they have prophesy'd, ſeem'd to be the Effect of the evil Spirit; producing, as a confirmation of this opinion, one of the Sibyls, who ſayes of her ſelf, that, for her enormous crimes, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to the fire. Yet allowing theſe Verſes to be ranked among the ſuppoſititious, there is ſtill a greater probability incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us to judge otherwiſe of them, when we conſider the good inſtructions given us, and the myſteries of our Salvation contain'd therein; it being not the function of Devils and evil Spirits to encourage us to piety. But however it be, this is clearly evinc'd, that there have been <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and that they fore-told things to come.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXV. Whether of two Bodies of different weight, the one deſcends faſter than the other, and why?</head>
            <p>OF Natural Bodies, ſome move from the Centre to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, as Fire; others, from the Circumference to the Centre, as the Earth; others, are in the mean between both, as Air and Water, the latter whereof inclines downwards, but both of them are principally deſign'd to fill the <hi>Vacuum.</hi> Whence it comes, that the Air deſcends as much, nay, faſter to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Well when it is dry'd up, than the Water had done before; which conſideration, hath given occaſion to ſome to attribute a mean, or circular Motion to thoſe two Elements, as they have done a direct Motion to the two firſt. And whereas theſe two kinds of Local Motion, to wit, the direct and the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are the Principles of the Mechanicks, the moſt profitable parts of the Mathematicks, and that among the ſaid Motions, that which tends downwards, which proceeds from weight, is the moſt ordinary Agent, and ſuch as is the moſt commonly us'd in Machins or Engins, where it is the moſt conſiderable, either for the aſſiſtance it gives to fixt and ſetled inſtruments, or for the obſtruction it gives thoſe which are moveable; thence comes that famous diſpute there is, concerning the cauſes of Motion from above to beneath. Which ſince it muſt needs proceed from one of theſe three, to wit, the weight of the Body deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lightneſs of the mean through which the deſcent is made; or from the impulſion of the ſaid mean: Or, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the attraction made by the Centre; the Queſtion is, To which of thoſe three Cauſes that Motion is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd? If it be attributed to the weight, it will follow, that
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:66371:211"/>
the heavieſt Body ſhall deſcend ſooneſt; if to the impulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the celerity or ſlowneſs of the Agent ſhall accordingly render that Motion ſwift or ſlow; but, if only the attraction made by the Centre be the Cauſe of it, the leſſer weight ſhall deſcend as faſt, nay, faſter than the greater, upon the ſame account as that the ſame piece of Loadſtone more eaſily draws a ſmall needle than it does a great key. Nor can Experience always aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us in this caſe, in regard the different compoſure and form of heavy Bodies, as alſo the diverſity of the means, and the variety of the Agents, whereby they are thruſt forwards, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to make an allowable Compariſon between them. Thus a ball of Cork, which deſcended as faſt in the Air as one of Lead, ſhall not do the like in the water, to the bottom whereof the Lead ſhall fall, but not the Cork. And again, the ſame Lead being put into the form of a Gondola, or other hollow veſſel, ſhall ſwim on the water, which it could not before: A Cloak, folded cloſe together into a bundle, ſhall have a ſpeedy deſcent in both Air and Water; but let a Man faſten the ſame Cloak under the arm-pit, ſo as that it may ſpread into a circle, it ſhall ſo ſuſtain him the Air, that he ſhall fall very gently, and receive no hurt by his fall. Hence it alſo comes that many Women have been ſav'd, when, falling into the Water, their Clothes were ſpread all abroad. The ſame thing may alſo be obſerv'd in thoſe frames beſet with Feathers, or cover'd with Paper, which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren call Kites, and ſuſtain in the Air, and ſuffer to be carryed away with the Wind, giving them ever and anon little checks or jerks by drawing the pack-thread to them whereby they are held, imitating in that action the beating of the wings in Birds. In fine, the different manner of giving the firſt ſhock to weighty Bodies, does accordingly diverſifie their Motion towards the Centre. For as the impulſion made downwards haſtens its bent towards the Centre; ſo when it is forc'd circularly, it is retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whence it comes that a glaſs ſo caſt down that it hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain turns by the way, does ſometimes fall to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking. But to ſpeak abſolutely, all conditions being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd equal, it ſhould ſeem that the more weighty a Body is, the ſooner it falls to the Centre: And this is made good by daily Experiences, as may be ſeen in the weighing of Gold and Silver in the balance, which hath a ſpeedier and ſhorter caſt, when the piece is much weightier or lighter, than it hath when there is but half a grain difference between both the ſcales.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the Nature of weight or heavineſs was to be number'd among the occult things. <hi>Aristotle</hi> defines it to be a Quality inclining Bodies downwards and towards the Centre. Others would have it to be an Effect of denſity, which proceeds from the great quantity of Subſtance and Matter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and contracted in a ſmall room. There are yet others, who would have it to be an impulſion or faſtning of one Body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, in order to Motion downwards: But, to come nearer
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:66371:211"/>
the buſineſs, it is only the relation or report there is between a Body and its mean, and its compariſon with another Body. According to this account of it, the ſame piece of Gold is ſaid to be light in reſpect of one weight, and heavy in reſpect of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; Wood is heavy in the Air, and light in the Water; Tin is light in compariſon of Gold, though very weighty in reſpect of Wood. Whence it follows, that weight hath only a reſpective being, and ſuch as depends on ſome other thing, and not on it ſelf: The Cauſe of it therefore is not to be ſought in it ſelf, but elſe-where; as muſt be that of the recoiling of a Tennis-ball, which is not in the Ball, nor in the arm of him that playes, nor yet in the walls of the Tennis-Court, but reſulting from all theſe three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together. And whereas Experience ſeems to decide the Queſtion propos'd, 'tis fit we ſhould refer our ſelves to it. Now it is certain, that of two Bodies of unequal weight, and of the ſame Figure and Matter, equally forc'd, or ſuffer'd to fall, the one will as ſoon come to its Centre as the other; as thoſe may ſee who ſhall let fall at the ſame time from the top of a Tower, two leaden bullets, one of two pounds, and the other of a quarter of a pound, both which will come to the ground at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; the reaſon whereof is, That the ſtronger impulſion in the bullet of two pounds, meets with a ſtronger reſiſtance of the Air to break through as it falls, than that of quarter of a pound. Whence we are to make a diſtinction between the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion which the weightier Body makes upon another Body, and the celerity or ſlowneſs of the Motion wherewith it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends; a hundred weight being heavier on the ſhoulders of a Porter, than one pound, but not coming ſooner to the ground than it. In like manner, a ſtone deſcending ſo much the more ſwiftly the nearer it comes to its Centre, clearly ſhews, that it derives the force of its Motion from the Centre, as its principle; as we conclude, that the ſtrength of a bullet is ſpent, and the Motion of it grows fainter, the further it is at a diſtance from the arm and gun from which it came, and which we hold to have been the cauſe and principle of it.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the weightieſt Bodies make the more haſte to their Centre, the nearer they approach it; for their weight is increas'd by their approaching of it; gravity, in the ſcent of weighty Bodies, increaſing by the continuance of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, quite contrary to violent Motion, which admits of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereby; artifice, it ſeems in this point giving place to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo as that the latter never grows weary, nay, is infallible in all her Motions, and that ſuch a propenſion of weight to the centre, is the only certain rule to draw direct lines to that centre; and which is yet the more certain, the greater the weight is. And whereas the Mind of Man judges the better of things when they are oppos'd one to the other, behold one of thoſe little Atomes which dance up and down in the beams of the Sun ſtriking in at a window, it is a Body ſuſtain'd in the Air only by its ſmalneſs,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66371:212"/>
and requires a long time to make an impreſſion in that part of the Air which is under it, which thing cannot be ſaid of a Muſket-bullet: It is therefore deducible thence, that the heavieſt Bodies deſcend faſteſt to the Centre.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That we are not to ſeek for any other reaſon for the ſpeedier deſcent of heavy Bodies, than there is in all the other Motions of Nature, which proceed from the inſtinct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by her in all things, of loving their good, which is their reſt and natural place, which till they have attain'd, they are in perpetual diſquiet; and whereas the heavier a Body is, the more parts there are in it, concern'd in the purſuance of that good, it is not to be wonder'd if it happens to them as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſollicitors in the ſame cauſe, who preſs it more earneſtly than one alone would do. We may therefore ſay, that the ſame natural inſtinct that makes the Mulberry-tree expect till the cold weather be over before it buds; and the Halcyons till the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts be paſt, before they build their neſts, and makes them to ſecure their young ones before the Rain, may much rather cauſe the moſt maſſie and weighty Bodies to make more haſte. For theſe, fore-ſeeing that the Centre is not able to lodge all the Bodies tending thereto, endeavour to get to it as ſoon as they can, adding to their haſte the nearer they approach it. But the moſt certain reaſon of this ſpeedier Motion, is the general rule, that the more the Cauſe is increas'd, the more is the Effect augmented; whence it follows, that if weight be the Cauſe of Motion downwards, the greater the weight is, the more intenſe ought to be the Motion.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXVI. Of the Silk-worm.</head>
            <p>THe uſe of Silk was brought over from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> above a thouſand years ſince, and was particularly introduc'd into <hi>Italy</hi> by two Religous Men, who brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the grain of it ſomewhat above three hundred years ſince; in which Country of <hi>Italy,</hi> that commodity hath been much cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and that upon ſeveral accounts; as, the preciouſneſs of it, the eaſie tranſportation from one place to another, by reaſon of its lightneſs: And, laſtly, for that it is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inſtruments of Luxury, which never wanted Partizans and Abettors in any Age, not to mention the great advantages and wealth attending the manufacture of it. The Latine word <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,</hi> is receiv'd from that of <hi>Seres,</hi> an Oriental people, who were more ſedulous in the cultivation of it than any other: and the ſame thing hath happen'd to this, as to many other excellent
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66371:212"/>
productions deriv'd from mean and deſpicable Principles. For the Animal, from whoſe labour we have the ſilk, is an Inſect, as are all thoſe which ſpin, to wit, the Spider and the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar, and it differs in nothing from this latter, ſave that the Caterpillar hath a little hairineſs, and the ſilk of the Silk-worm is ſtronger than the web of the Caterpillar, and of another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but as to figure and bulk there is little difference between them. Whereto may be added, that their production is much at one, as being as it were hatch'd of certain eggs, living on leaves, encloſing themſelves in certain webs, out of which they make their way, after they are become a kind of Butterflies, by a ſtrange Metamorphoſis, which forces them from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to another, that is, from the nature of Reptiles to that of Volatiles: which transformation is ſuch, as, were it not for the frequency of it, might be plac'd among the greateſt miracles of Nature, conſidering the great difference there is between thoſe two forms. And that indeed is ſuch as hath given ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to doubt, whether the Silkworm becoming a Butterfly did not change its Species, as it would be true, were it not that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing produces its like; and the Silkworm deriving its birth from the ſeed of the Butterfly, it is an argument that both are of the ſame Species. Thus much as to their progreſs. The Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> commonly furniſhes us with the beſt grain or ſeed of theſe worms, which are like heads of pins, but black, or reſembling Rape-ſeed ſomewhat flatted on both ſides: This grain, ſometime in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> being put between two warm pillows, or expos'd to the Sun, enclos'd in the linings of ones cloaths, or otherwiſe chafed by a moderate heat, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any moiſture, there are produc'd of it little certain worms of the ſame colour, that is, black at their firſt coming forth, which by reaſon of their ſmalneſs, as reſembling the points of needles, paſs through certain little holes made in a paper, wherewith they are cover'd, and faſten themſelves on the Mulbery-leaves, which are alſo placed on the ſaid paper full of little holes, upon which leaves all the beſt grain being hatch'd, within five or ſix days, goes creeping after the firſt worm that gets out of her ſhell; all that is hatch'd afterwards never coming to any good. Theſe worms are thence tranſported, with the leaves laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on little boards or hurdles, into a temperate place, and diſpos'd in a lightſom and ſpacious room, where they are entertain'd with freſh leaves twice a day, among which thoſe of the white Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery makes finer ſilk than thoſe of the black; for want whereof the leaves of the Roſe-buſh, Lettice, and ſome others may be uſed: but though the Worm makes a ſhift to ſubſiſt by that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, yet either it will not ſpin at all, or the Silk will be like the web or clue wrought by the Caterpillars. Thus it feeds for the ſpace of forty days, during which it becomes grey, and changes its colour four times, not eating for ſome days before each change, by reaſon of the fulneſs it is then ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:66371:213"/>
of. The Worm is ſubject to certain diſeaſes; and thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige ſuch as have the care of them to remove them out of one room into another, and that even when they are dying in great quantities; Perfume, Incenſe, Benjamin, Vinegar, and Wine recovering and comforting them; as alſo the ſmell of broyl'd Bacon. To prevent which Diſeaſes, and the aſſaults of Flies and Piſmires, who will make havock among them, they are very carefully to be kept clean, the boards on which the leaves lie to be rubb'd with wormwood, or ſprinkled with Wine, which muſt be well dry'd up before they come near them, all moiſture being hurtful to them, as alſo ſalt, or the hands that have handled it. All harſh ſounds, as thoſe of the diſcharging of Muſkets, Bells, and Trumpets, deſtroys them; nay, the ſtrong breaths of thoſe who come near them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as have eaten or handled Garlick or Onions, are very prejudicial to them. When their time of ſpinning draws nigh, which is about ſix weeks after their being firſt alive, at which time they are about the bigneſs of a man's little finger, more tranſparent than they uſe to be, and the little ſnowt ſo lengthen'd as that it repreſents the form of a Noſe, the Animal by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary motion, expreſſes the inconvenience it endures by reaſon of its burden: Then is it cleans'd oftner, and there is ſo much the leſs given it to eat, and afterwards they ſet on the boards ſome dry'd branches of Heath, Broom, or Vines, and above all of Birch, as being the moſt delicate and leaſt prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leaſt it ſhould prick the Worm, or entangle the Silk. Then you ſhall ſee them faſten their firſt threds, and caſting out of their mouths a kind of coarſe ſleeve ſilk, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which is finer and more perfect, in one continu'd thread, accompany'd by a gum, which makes it ſtick one to another, ſo that the worm does encompaſs it ſelf with that ſilk, which is commonly yellow, very ſeldom greeniſh or white, and being come to the end of the clue, hath only ſo much room as it takes up. Then, for the ſpace of fifteen days, it remains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and is cover'd with a ſkin or film like that which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the fruit of the Pine-tree, under it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhell, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not till after that is broken. But theſe fifteen days being over (of which thoſe will abate ſome, who are deſirous to make advantage of the Silk, and trouble themſelves not what becomes of the grain) the Silkworm, though it ſeem'd to have been dead, breaks through its web, and comes out in the form of a white and horned Butterfly, bearing a certain image of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; then coming together, the Male, which is ſmaller coupling with the Female that is bigger, the latter ſheds her ſeed upon a clean paper, ſpread under her for the reception of it.

if they be deſirous to get ſilk out of it, which is the principal advantage, in order to which the Worms are kept, about fifteen days after they are compleated, theſe webs are caſt into water, ſomewhat better than luke-warm, and the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren employ'd about that work, ſtir the water with an handful of Birch, till they have faſten'd on ſeven or eight ends of ſilk, which having done, they wind it up into ſkains, and that is the raw ſilk.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That it is to be imagin'd the uſe of Silk was abſolutely unknown to the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially when we conſider, that in the works of that magnificent Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſpar'd not any thing of what they thought moſt precious, there is no mention made of Silk, inſtead whereof they made uſe of Goats-hair, and other precious Fleeces. But it was no ſtrange commodity to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>; not to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſince that <hi>Pariſatis,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was commonly wont to ſay, that Kings were always to be ſpoken to in <hi>ſilken</hi> words; nor yet to the latter, inaſmuch as they had ſome gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all of Silk, which they call'd <hi>Vestes holoſericas.</hi> Which is the more creditable, in regard that the Inhabitants of <hi>China</hi> who made uſe of it above a thouſand years before us, have very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Books, whereof the paper is made of Silk. In the interim, through the revolution of times, which makes that unknown in one age, which was familiar in another, it hath happen'd, that <hi>Pliny,</hi> never having ſeen any, relates ſtrange ſtories of it, calling the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm a Fly, though it be not transform'd into a Fly, as was ſaid before, till after it hath finiſh'd its working of Silk. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirms, that this worm makes its neſt in dirt, or clay, and that ſo hard, that inſtruments of iron cannot penetrate it; that in the ſaid neſt it makes more wax, then Bees do, and leavs in it a Worm, bigger than the other Flyes. Afterwards not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfi'd with himſelf, he brings in a diſcourſe, which ſhews indeed that he had heard ſome talk of our Silk-worm, but that he had never ſeen any, nor met with any certain account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when he ſays, That Silk came from a Worm that had two horns, which worm brings forth certain Caterpillars, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender that which is call'd <hi>Bombylius,</hi> out of which comes the Worm, which produces that, which makes the Silk, and all theſe productions, and the making of the Silk perform'd in ſix Months: the laſt Worms, ſaith he, making a web of ſilk like that of a Spider, and that the firſt who ever found out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of unweaving and unravelling that web, that ſo ſome uſe might be made of the Silk, was <hi>Pamphila,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona,</hi> of the Iſland <hi>Coos.</hi> In fine, to make the ſtory yet more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, he ſays, that in the Iſland of <hi>Lango,</hi> the Silkworms are engendred of the Flowers, which the Rain cauſes to fall from Turpentine-trees, Aſhes, Oaks, and Cypreſs Trees, enliven'd by the vapours which exhale out of the earth; being at firſt little naked Butterflies, which afterwards get a little hairineſs, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure

them from the cold, and their feet are ſo rough that they faſten on all the Cotten they meet upon the leaves of Trees, and make their ſilk of it; then they break it with their feet, card it with their claws, and having reduc'd it to ſilk, hang it up between the boughs of Trees, where they comb it, to make it the finer, and that done, they wind themſelves within it, as within a botom of ſilk; and then are they diſpos'd into earthen pots to be kept warm, and are nouriſh'd with noiſe, till they are renew'd again, and re-aſſume their wings, as they were before they had done their work. So pitiful a thing is a deviation from Truth, and ſo hard is it for a man to meet with her, when he is once got out of her own path.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXVII. Why Ice being harder than Water is yet lighter.</head>
            <p>IN this Queſtion, there are ſeveral others comprehended; the firſt, Why Ice is harder than Water; the ſecond, Why it is lighter, inaſmuch as lightneſs is an inſeparable accident of ſoftneſs, as this latter is an inſeparable accident of lightneſs. On the contrary, denſity, hardneſs, and compaction is a ſign, or rather a cauſe of weightineſs, as it is obſervable in Meal, Aſhes, and other Bodies of the like Nature, which weigh heavier, when they are cloſe thruſt together in the Buſhel. Nay further, this Queſtion comprehends in it ſelf the Efficient Cauſes of Ice, which is the coldneſs of the Earth, the Water, or the Air. It is not the firſt, becauſe, if it were, Rivers and Lakes would be frozen at the botom, which, on the contrary, is moſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and ſerves for a retreat to the Fiſh, while the ſurface of the Water is frozen up, which freezing if it be ſo violent as to reach the Center, it is communicated by degrees from the ſurface. Now that Rivers begin to freez on the ſides, does proceed hence, that the Water there moves more ſlowly; the channel, or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Water, which is rougher in the midſt, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the inequality of its courſe. For motion prevents congelation; not upon the account that it warms, inaſmuch as that effect happens not to it, otherwiſe then by the colliſion of two or more ſolid bodies, but becauſe there is no change made, but upon ſome ſolid foundation, which cannot be imagin'd in Water, as long as it is in motion. Nor is the Water congeal'd by that Cold, which is Nature to it ſelf; for that which is in Caves and places under ground, where it continues in its own nature, is not frozen. Nor yet that which lies expos'd to the influence of a cold air, eſpecially when it may eaſily inſinuate it ſelf into it. Whence it comes, that to cauſe water to freeze
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:66371:214"/>
in a ſhort time, it muſt be warm'd before it be expos'd to the Air, which, finding its pores open by the heat, ſo much the more ſpeedily inſinuates it ſelf into it. For as to what is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by ſome Phyſicians, to wit, that the Air is hot and moiſt, ſeems to have been advanc'd by them, rather to make a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence of the four poſſible combinations of qualities to ſo many Elements, than for any convictive reaſon; ſince the Air is never hot if it be not warm'd by ſome other heat then it hath in it ſelf, ſuch as is that of Fire or the Sun-beams, and theſe too muſt be reflected by the Earth. On the contrary, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in its own nature, as it does in the night-time, during the abſence of the Sun, it is actually cold: nay, even in the greateſt heats of Summer, it keeps its coolneſs, provided there be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made to a hot body, as may be ſeen in our Ladie's Fanns, who forcing away the Air from their hot faces, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd by its coolneſs, which then cannot proceed from any other principle than the proper nature of Air, inaſmuch as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be more likely to imprint heat on them, then cold. And this is further confirm'd by the Air we breathe, the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation whereof cools our Lungs, whereas it ſhould warm them, if it were hot, as the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> would have it. It happens therefore that the Air, for that reaſon call'd by ſome Philoſophers <hi>primum frigidum,</hi> the firſt cold, inſinuating it ſelf into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, produces therein the effect which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attributes to it, to wit, that of congregating all things as well of the ſame as of ſeveral kinds. And whereas our common water, what ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoever there may be in it, conſiſts of all the Elements, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Earth and Air, the Air joyning it ſelf to what it meets withal of its own Nature, does in the firſt place render that cold; and being by that means united to the other parts, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Earth unperceivably intermixt with the Water, and to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelf, contracts and compreſſes them ſo as that they take up leſs ſpace then they did before; as may be ſeen in a Bottle fill'd with water, and frozen up, which though it had been full, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs found to contain air in its upper part. And yet this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion cannot be ſo well made, but that there remain ſeveral particles of Air enclos'd in the Spaces of the Ice, which, were it not for that air, would be vacuous; and this, by reaſon the ſurface, as was ſaid before, freezing up firſt, it from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward hinders from making their way out, thoſe parts of air, which either were got in before, or caus'd by the avoiding of vacuity, when the Center and other parts of the Water are forc'd by the Cold to take up leſs place then they did before. We conclude therefore, and ſay, that though the Ice be denſe and hard, by reaſon of that compreſſion of all its parts, yet is lighter than Water, becauſe there is air enclos'd within it, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not return to its ſphere, as that does which gets into the Water, which by reaſon of its liquidity makes way for it. So that it is no more to be wondred at, why Ice is lighter than Water, then
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:66371:215"/>
that cork, being harder, is lighter than the ſame water. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, had the Ice no Air inclos'd within it, as it happens to that engendred in Mines, which in proceſs of time comes to be Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, it would fall to the bottom of the water as the other does. The ſame thing may be inſtanc'd in porous wood, which ſwims upon the water; whereas Ebony, by reaſon of its ſolidity and want of pores, will ſink.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That whether the Air be granted to be light, or not, or that it paſs only for a body leſs weighty than the water, as this latter is leſs heavy than the earth, certain it is, that the intermixt Air, not that comprehended within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities, but that diffus'd through the leaſt parts of the Ice, is that which makes it lighter; inaſmuch as it augments its ſinnuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as may be obſerv'd in a bottle fill'd with water, which breaks when the water is congeal'd, in regard that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Ice, the bottle cannot contain it. So that, as Snow is lighter than Hail, ſo this latter is lighter than Ice; and this laſt is lighter than water, in regard it contains leſs matter in an equal ſpace: Accordingly, it is the Air that freezes the water, yet dos it not follow thence, that it ſhould be the <hi>primum frigidum</hi>; as the Iron which is red hot burnes more vehemently than the elementary fire, yet is not that red hot Iron the <hi>primum calidum</hi>; that diſtinction proceeding from the difference of matter, which as it muſt be the more compact in order to a greater burning; ſo the cold, for its better inſinuation into all the parts of the water, requires the conveyance of the Air. As to the lightneſs of Ice, it ſeems to be the more ſtrange upon this conſideration, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians explicate lightneſs by heat, as they do heavineſs by cold. But the fiery vapors which are in the water, as may be ſaid of that which hath been warm'd, contribute very much to that lightneſs, it being not incompatible that theſe contrary qualities ſhould be lodg'd in the ſame Subject, conſidering the inequality of the one in reſpect of the other; and it is not to be thought a thing more ſtrange, that there ſhould be potentially hot Exhalations in the water, than that the <hi>Nile</hi> ſhould abound in Nitre, which is of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous nature. Now from what matter ſoever the cold proceeds, 'tis evident by its action that it is not a privation of heat, as ſome Philoſophers would have maintain'd; ſince that which is not, as privation, cannot have any effect. But thoſe who have referr'd freezing as well as thawing to the Conſtellations, ſeem to have come near the mark, in as much as thoſe making certain impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Air, which ſerves for a mean, to unite the Influences of the celeſtial bodies to the inferior, diverſly affect them, one while contracting, another, dilating them, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of matter; there being ſome not ſuſceptible of congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Spirit of Wine and Quinteſſences, either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their heat or ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That if the firſt qualities of cold and heat were the Cauſes of freezing and thawing, they would always
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:66371:215"/>
happen accordingly; the former, when it is moſt cold; and the other, when the cold diminiſhes. Now many times we find the contrary, there being ſome dayes without any froſt, on which thaws, we are more ſenſible of cold; and ſometimes we perceive it yet without any perceivable remiſſion of the cold. Whence we may well take occaſion to attribute both to the Influences, which, coming to meet with, and poſſibly to introduce alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water the conditions requiſite, ſuch as is cold in reſpect of ice, do inſinuate themſelves into the water. And whereas there is in theſe Influences ſomewhat of a celeſtial nature, and that they are rather ſpiritual than material Quinteſſences, the ſame thing happens to them as to Spirits, which make thoſe Bodies which they animate, lighter, than they would be if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXVIII. Of Masks, and whether it be lawful for any to diſguiſe themſelves.</head>
            <p>THat the wearing of Maſks, and other ways for people to diſguize themſelves, is of great Antiquity, is apparent by the prohibition which God made to his own people, that the man ſhould not put on the habit of the woman, which is a diſguiſe commonly made with the Maſk, in regard that otherwiſe the hair and beard of the man would diſcover his Sex. So that the Queſtion ſeems to be already decided, and that it follows from this prohibition, that Maſks are not to be allowed. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may enquire, What repute they were in among other Nations. And we find, that they were frequently us'd among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who, about the beginning of the Spring, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a Feaſt in Honor of the Mother of the gods; in the pomp of which ſolemnity, it was lawful for any one to maſk and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe himſelf, and to repreſent what perſon or part he pleas'd, which was done bluntly enough, as the <hi>French</hi> Comedians were heretofore content to have only a certain powder or meal caſt over their faces, as they ſtill have in the Farce. To ſhew the viciouſneſs of that poſture, we need only urge the indecency of it, and alledge that the uſe of it ought not to be allow'd, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that all Diſſimulation and Hypocriſie is a great ſin in the ſight of God and men: Now the Maſk is ſo hypocritical, that the very word it ſelf is commonly taken for Hypocriſie. Thence it comes that <hi>Seneca,</hi> defining the maſked or hypocritical perſon, gives him this Character, <hi>Cum prae ſe fert aliquis quod non eſt,</hi> When any one would ſeem, or appear to be what he is not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if Painting be forbidden, and be accounted a capricious humour ſo prejudicial to decency and good manners, that there
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:66371:216"/>
is no Maid nor Woman, but thinks it an injury to be reproach'd with painting her ſelf, what opinion ought we to conceive of thoſe who diſguiſe themſelves? For it is imagin'd done out of no other end than to cloak their lewd actions, who make uſe of it; as we frequently find in the informations for Murthers and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, that they are committed by diſguis'd perſons, who thereby would prevent the diſcovery of their crimes. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uſe of the Maſk be utterly diſcarded, as a thing which is contrary to that uprightneſs of diſpoſition, the ſigns whereof are modeſty and ſhamefaſtneſs, and by a prevention of bluſhing, uſhers in impudence, abuſiveneſs, and a contempt and falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Image imprinted on the face of man.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That in times of War, the Horſemen, who are commanded out againſt the Enemy, having cloſe head-pieces over their faces, ſeem to be ſo maſk'd and diſguis'd that they are not to be known; not ſo much to prevent their being wounded in the face, as to elude their Enemies, ſo as that they may not diſcover the Commanders and perſons of quality, upon whoſe ſafety the gaining or loſs of a battel depends. And this Diſſimulation hath ſometimes been practis'd with great advantage, when ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldier hath put on the armour, and rid the horſe of the General of the Army, ſo to draw the Enemies Forces from that ſide, while they unexpectedly charge him on the other. And whereas he is commonly the Maſter of his deſires, who can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the counſels of his Enemy, and thoſe cannot be known otherwiſe than by Spies, who would never be admitted either into Cities or the Enemy's Camp, if they did not in their habit and demeanour imitate him; what Queſtion is to be made, but that it is lawful to put on diſguiſes upon ſuch a deſign, to get the more certain intelligence? To divert from Military Affairs to Merchandize, it is the ſafeſt way for him who would travel to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his condition; and whereas Poverty is that which is leaſt of any expoſ'd to dangers, unleſs a man will follow the example of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> who counterfeited himſelf a Beggar or Pedlar, of which profeſſion all are not equally capable, it will not miſbeſeem a great Lord to demean himſelf as an ordinary Gentleman, and ſometimes to avoid ſurprizes, to act the part of his Servant, while the Servant acts that of a Prince. Let us divert thence, and make our appearance before the Courts of Juſtice; and we ſhall there find, that Attorneys and Lawyers, when they ſpeak, are ever maſk'd &amp; diſguis'd in laying open the Cauſes of their Clients, who on their ſide are alſo apt enough to diſſemble &amp; conceal whatever they think might prejudice them. So that the Painters had much more reaſon to repreſent the Lawyers, Attorneys, and their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, with a veil over their Eyes, then Juſtice; ſince that among them, he hath the reputation of the braveſt man, who is the greateſt Orator, and hath the beſt Lungs; and according to their ſaying, who have beſt defin'd the Art of Oratory; It is the Art of perſwading people to what they pleaſe, by making great things
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:66371:216"/>
little, and little things great, which, in other Language, is for a man to diſguiſe all things, and himſelf into the bargain, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he ſeems to believe the contrary to what he ſayes and knows, and that among the rules of Oratory, this is one, that the Orator is to perſonate even to his voice and geſture, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf to what he ſayes, which is properly to maſk himſelf, and that not only the face, but alſo the feet, the hands, the tongue, and all thoſe parts of the body which are employ'd in pronunciation, elocution, and the geſtures ſuitable to the thing treated of. Nor is it to be expected that Divines and Phyſicians are abſolutely exempted from theſe kinds of diſguiſes, ſince that, the better to inſinuate into the affections of their Penitents and Patients, which is the way to gain their hearts, and by that means to Convert and Cure them, they ought to be very complaiſant towards them, comply with their infirmities, and accommodate themſelves to their humors in all things indifferent, that they, on the other ſide, may ſubmit to their advice in thoſe things which are neceſſary. And not to deſcend to particular Inſtances which might be made in all other Profeſſions, this will be the reſult, that thoſe who will find fault with Maſks and Diſguiſes, muſt, with the ſame breath, caſt an aſperſion on all humane ſociety, which, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid at his departure out of this world, is nothing but a Comedy, wherein every one acts his part under a diſguiſe. The ſame thing was ſaid by one of the Satyriſts, but much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly; for being, as we ſay here, upon the <hi>Save-all,</hi> that is, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give up the laſt gaſp, he cry'd out to his friend, <hi>Draw up the Curtain, the Play is done.</hi> For the greateſt part of our Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being only ſo many fictions and flatteries, Traffick and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations being ſo many diſguiſes, and humane life conſiſting in thoſe actions, the conſequence is, that all the world is under a Maſk, and that the leſs dangerous, ſince there are ſome make it their Profeſſion to be maſk'd, as do alſo Ambaſſadors and other perſons of quality in ſome places of <hi>Italy</hi> when they have a deſire not to be known. And as to what hath been ſaid againſt Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſeems to be a little too ſevere to blame that pardonable curioſity, which the women are only guilty of, to preſerve and heighten their greateſt Treaſure, that is, their Beauty, upon the account whereof they are principally recommendable to men; who, were it not for that, would be apt to ſleight them much more than now they do. For what do the poor women do more in that than is daily done in Medicine, whereof one part treats of <hi>Coſmeticks,</hi> that is, of Painting, and is brought in for the reparation of the defects and deformities of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the Maſk or Vizzard, by the <hi>Latines</hi> called <hi>Perſona,</hi> either upon this conſideration that it changes the condition of the perſon, cauſing him to be taken for ſome other; or haply <hi>à per-ſonando,</hi> by reaſon of the new ſound he gives the words pronounc'd through the Vizzard. This invention of Vizzards, as alſo that of ſpeaking Prologues before Playes,

Whence it may be inferr'd, that the deſign of uſing Maſks and Vizards upon the Stage, where it is moſt us'd, is in order to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to heighten the confidence of the Actors, who by that means are not known. And the convenience and decency of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:66371:217"/>
that cuſtom is ſuch, that one of the greateſt reproaches lying on the memory of <hi>Nero,</hi> is, that having brought ſome perſons nobly deſcended upon the Stage for to be Actors, he caus'd them to put off their Vizards while they play'd on the Flute, and forbad the Comedians to appear vizarded upon the Stage. To this may be added, that, according to the Counſel of the Holy Fathers, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and young maids, when they walk abroad, nay, when they go to Church, ought to be not only maſk'd, but alſo veil'd, to prevent the temptations which the full ſight of them might cauſe in men, and the deſtraction of their own and the others devotion. Now the female ſex making up above one half of the world, we cannot, upon any rational grounds univerſally find fault with that thing or cuſtom, the uſe whereof is allow'd to the greater part.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXIX. Of Fables and Fictions, and whether their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences or inconviences be greater?</head>
            <p>OF all the flowers of Rhetorick, lying is one of the worſt, and withal ſo much the more pernicious, the more full it is of artifice. For if the ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be true, That the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar always deſerves to be blamed, there is a certain reſemblance between him who ſimply tells a lie, and him who ſimply takes away another man's life by poyſon; inaſmuch as the latter infects the Heart, and the former viciates and corrupts the ſource of our Ratiocination; the end whereof is only to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth. As therefore the poyſoning of a man is always a heinous and puniſhable crime; but that Steward who ſhould poyſon his Maſter, when he gave ſomewhat to eat or drink, when the other pretended to be exteamly hungry or dry, would be the greateſt villany in the world, and deſerve a far greater pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: So he who ſimply tells a lie is not ſo much to be blamed, as he who covers and diſguiſes his lie under the appearance of ſome probable hiſtory, which is clearly receiv'd by our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and this thus drawn in by the liklyhood of the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grows leſs diſtruſtful of it, than of the other kinds of falſhood, which are deliver'd without any artifice. So that lying, and conſequently Fables, and all the ſpecies thereof, have the ſame proportion to our Underſtanding, as Monſters have to Nature; our Underſtanding cannot endure them, whereas Truth is its ſuſtenance. Thence it comes that thoſe Fables which are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ornament of Truth, which is probability, are not heard with any patience, ſuch as are old Wives Tales, and the like abſurd relations, which are ſo ridiculous, that only the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Children is capable of entertaining them with any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but with ſo much the greater danger to themſelves, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

that thoſe tender Tables receiving the impreſſion of ſome falſe perſwaſion, will not afterwards ſo eaſily part with it; nay on the contrary, it commonly continues there to the end, at leaſt ſome part of it, as if Time were not able ſo fully to eat it out, but there may be ſeen ſome lines of the firſt draught. Whence it comes that ſome eminent perſons do account it a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in the education of Children, to entertain them with Tales and Stories: inſtead whereof, thoſe weak minds, wherein, as in ſoft wax, a man may eaſily imprint what he pleaſes, ſhould rather be acquainted with Hiſtory, which, by reaſon of its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and truth, would be equally delightful, but much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous. And indeed thoſe who make uſe of Fables, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them to teach truth, take a very prepoſterous way to do it. For all the advantage which may be deriv'd from Fables, is only to draw on mens minds with greater delight to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true things: and it is eaſily found to be a way as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to prevail, as if a man ſhould make uſe of ſome place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous and notorious for lewdneſs, as a School wherein he ſhould read Lectures of Chaſtity to young Men and Maids; or lodge a Fuller or Whitener of Cloth with the Collier, one ſoyling all that the other had cleans'd.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, that Man's underſtanding h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ving its diſtaſts and humourſomneſs, as well as his body, and Content being equally requiſite for the ſuſtenance of both, in regard that a coarſer diſh of meat taken with a good ſtomack is preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better chear forc'd down againſt Appetite; it is but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the ſame remedies ſhould be uſed to recreate our minds, when they are wearied, and out of humour with an over-earneſtneſs of ſtudy, as are us'd to retrive and ſharpen the languiſhing appetite. This latter is recover'd by feeding on ſome diſh excellently well-order'd, ſuch as by its haut-gouſts, and picquancy will rather excite, then ſatisfie the Appetite. Such is the bitterneſs of the Olive, Vinegar in Sallets, and the like; which have the ſame effect as the ſtepping back of ſuch as leap, or the appearance of a Fly on a face of an exquiſitely fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Theſe Fables are invented to reduce the wandring and wearied Underſtanding to its former interrupted purſuance of Truth. There are two kinds of them: One may be called a ſimple <hi>Fiction,</hi> ſuch as are old Wives Tales, which deſerve not the name of fabulous Relations, unleſs it be upon the account of their abſurdity; and yet it ought to be ſeaſon'd with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is miraculous and delightful. The other is <hi>Mythologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> which may be divided into four kinds. Firſt, the <hi>Poëtical,</hi> in one continu'd Relation, ſuch as are the Metamorphoſes of <hi>Ovid</hi>; or Drammatick, and accommodated to Perſons, ſuch as as are Comedies and Tragedies. Secondly, the <hi>Emblem,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> which is a real explication of ſome feigned thing, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or otherwiſe repreſented. Thirdly, the <hi>Apologue,</hi> ſuch as are the Fables of <hi>Aeſop</hi>; and theſe are divided into three ſorts,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:66371:219"/>
the <hi>Moral,</hi> the <hi>Rational,</hi> and the <hi>Mixt.</hi> The <hi>Moral,</hi> are thoſe, wherein irrational things are introduc'd, ſuch as is the Fable of the two Pots, the earthen and the brazen; or that of the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the prey between the Lyon, the Aſs, and the Fox. The <hi>Rational</hi> are only of Men, ſuch as is that of the Satyr and his Entertainer, whom he leaves, becauſe he blew hot and cold out of the ſame mouth. Of the <hi>Mixt,</hi> we have an example in the Fable of the Fowler, and the Stork, taken in the net with the Cranes. The fourth kind is the <hi>Romance:</hi> The benefit and advantage of all which kinds of Fable is notorious to all: For beſides that they comprehend that common recreation, which is oppoſite to the conflict of Mind, and ſerious occupation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the reading of Hiſtories, the Poetical kind of Fable, I mean that of the continu'd Relation, where the Poet ſpeaks alone, does make extraordinary diſcoveries of the old Pagan Antiquities, whereof a man cannot be ignorant without a great defect. The Dramatick, where Perſons are introduc'd ſpeaking, when it is repreſented by good Actors, makes a prevalent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the minds of the Spectators and Auditors, and hath nothing comparable to the other kinds of writing and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: ſo that it is the moſt efficacious inſtrument to move and work upon the Paſſions. There may alſo be very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages made of the other fore-mentioned kinds of Fable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Romance, which hath the ſame effect on our minds, in order to their inſtruction in goodneſs and vertue, as well-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd Pictures have to teach us the art of Drawing. For, as there are not to be ſeen now any Pictures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, in point of body, to that of the ſo much celebrated <hi>Venus,</hi> which conſiſted of whatever was handſom in any Woman or Maid, and borrow'd the hair of one, the complexion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the neck of a third, and the breaſt and other members of others; ſo is it impoſſible that Hiſtory ſhould ever come up to the noble height and delight of the Romance. For, Hiſtory, though it be not abſolutely true, yet being oblig'd to repreſent things paſt with as much likeneſs as a picture is taken according to the face of him who is to be drawn, the conſequence of that obligation is, that however it may embelliſh things and actions, yet is it ſtill engag'd to expoſe them to the eye of the Reader as they are, or at leaſt as they are conceiv'd to be. Now the number of unjuſt things much exceeds that of the juſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the bad and ſad examples will much ſhorten the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's delight. Whence it follows, that Hiſtory wants thoſe two principal ends, for which it ought to be ſought after, to wit, content and advantage: whereas the Romance brings both along with it, as being commonly full of the rewards obtain'd by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whereof one is, that a ſincere and conſtant Love ſhould at laſt be crown'd with the greateſt of worldly enjoyments; and on the contrary, there are not wanting the puniſhments and executions of lewd and vicious perſons; whereto add the ſtrange
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:66371:220"/>
variety of the accidents, repreſented therein, which being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with nobler and more unexpected intrigues, extreamly heighten the ſatisfaction of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That for any man to endeavour the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Truth by its contrary, to wit, Fables, is to look for light in the midſt of darkneſs; and as a certain Muſician among the Ancients demanded a double reward, for teaching thoſe who had been inſtructed amiſs in that Art, for this reaſon, as he ſaid, that there was a certain time requiſite for the forgetting of what they already knew, and as much for learning how to play well: ſo that Child, who ſhall have heard of the univerſal Deluge by the Fable of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> will find more difficulty to diſengage his mind of thoſe ſtones, which, they having caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, became men and women, then he will have to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in it the natural Story of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Ark. The ſame thing may be ſaid of all the other Fables, out of which there is any truth to be deriv'd, to wit, that it is like the ordering of Crabs, where there is much more to be picked away, then there is to be eaten. Nay the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, who ſeem to be more inſtructive, may be reproach'd with this, that they have not repreſented to their Readers, the State of life and civil Converſation, as it really is, but have entertain'd them with a <hi>Platonical</hi> Commonwealth. And that diſcourages men very much, when they find the courſe and cuſtoms of the World to be contrary to what they had taken ſo much pains to read: Whereas the young man will be the leſs ſtartled to find himſelf hiſs'd by his Auditors, when he ſpeaks well; and ſlighted by Fortune, when he does well; while the ignorant and the wicked are her greateſt Favourites, after he hath read in Hiſtory of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons of worth ſo treated; than he would be, if he thruſt himſelf into affairs, having never ſeen any thing but examples of Vice puniſh'd, and Vertue rewarded.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXX. Whether it be better to go to bed late, and riſe betimes in the Morning; or do the contrary.</head>
            <p>THough it be a kind of receſſion from the common opinion, to prefer going to bed and riſing late, before the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; yet is it to be noted by the way, that moſt Perſons of great affairs, and the more judicious ſort, obſerving that courſe of life, are of that judgment; ſince that to approve a thing is to do it. Now we ſee that all the great Lords and Ladies about the Court, the moſt refin'd ſpirits, and ſuch are beſt able to judge of all things, nay moſt men who have any thing more than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:66371:220"/>
burthen of affairs, for the moſt part go to bed late, and riſe late; whereof ſeveral Reaſons may be aſſign'd. The firſt and moſt ordinary, me-thinks, are the affairs themſelves, which inſenſibly ſteal away the time from us; and that the more unperceivably, the more delightful that buſineſs is, about which we are employ'd; the time ſliding away faſter from him, who takes a pleaſure in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing, then it does from another who is in ſome trouble of mind or body. Whence it comes, that a tedious Tale, and a bad Book, are ever thought too long. They therefore are to be thought the happieſt, who, if they had their own wills, would go to bed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; not only for that reaſon which made a certain King of this part of the World ſay, That he would be King as long as he could, inaſmuch as when he ſlept, there was no difference between him &amp; the meaneſt of his Subjects: but alſo for this, that night ſurprizing them before they had done all their buſineſs, the Supper or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt be the later, and conſequently the going to bed. The ſecond reaſon is deduc'd hence, that there ought to be a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the tranquillity of the mind and that of the body. It being therefore neceſſary, that he who would take a good ſleep ſhould not be ſubject to any diſturbance of mind, &amp; that indiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancy being procured only by that order which every one hath taken in his affairs, it is to be imagin'd, that the later a man goes to bed, the more buſineſs he hath diſpatch'd, and conſequently there remains the leſs to be done. Upon this ſcore is it, that Merchant's Suppers are accounted the moſt quiet, for having ſpent the whole day in trudging up and down about their Trade, they then enjoy themſelves with greater ſerenity. In the third place, a man ſhould not go to bed, till digeſtion be pretty well advanc'd; from the want or ſlowneſs whereof, hideous Dreams, Crudities, Ventoſities, nay ſometimes Apoplexies, do proceed. Now this digeſtion is ſo much the more advanc'd, the later a man goes to bed: which difference will be beſt obſerv'd by thoſe, who go juſt from the Table to their beds, and lie down as ſoon as the meat is out of their mouths. Fourthly, that Cuſtom is ever the beſt, from which it is in a man's power moſt eaſily to wean himſelf, and in the change whereof he will be ſubject to leaſt inconvenience. Now he who hath contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a habit of going to bed late, will find it a leſs inconvenience to go to bed betimes, that ſo he may riſe betimes, or upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive, then he ſhall, who hath accuſtomed himſelf to go to bed betimes, for he will be ſleepy, and unfit for the doing of any thing, as ſoon as his bed-time is come. Fifthly, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> would not have a man enſlave himſelf to an over-ſtrict courſe of life, grounding his advice on this, that ſuch regular perſons find it the greater difficulty to ſupport the miſcarriages which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cannot be avoided in the ordinary courſe of life; as thoſe who walk upon ropes are more apt to fall, at leaſt find it a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to keep on, then thoſe who walk on the plain ground. Now thoſe who go to bed betimes are commonly more regular in the hours of Supper, and all the other actions of the day, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exact obſervance whereof that of their bed-time does
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:66371:221"/>
depend. Now it is obvious to any one, who ſhall conſider the difference of profeſſions, that there are but few that leave a man at liberty to obſerve ſo exact a rule as this is. So that being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſitated to make a breach of it, the conſequence will be, that thoſe who have the more ſtrictly engag'd themſelves to the obſervance of the rule of going to bed betimes, muſt needs receive a far greater inconvenience from the neglect of it, than they ordinarily do who go to bed late. Sixthly, the ſame reaſon that obliges phlegmatick perſons, and ſuch as are ſubject to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs, to content themſelves with little ſleep, which is this; that their humidity, joyn'd with that of ſleep it ſelf, augments their diſtemper; beſides, that Sleeping which moiſtens and cools, is not ſo well procur'd in that part of the day which is moſt cold and moiſt, that is, from nine at Night till three in the Morning, but rather towards the Morning, at which time the Blood begins to be predominant, inaſmuch as in ſo doing he abates ſomewhat of its Heat, and being to dilate it ſelf till ten in the Morning, at which time Choler begins to be predominant, moderates its acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; as all thoſe will acknowledge, which Sex ſoever they be of, who are ſubject to the Megrim, who find very great eaſe by that Morning ſleep, which accordingly is found to be the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; and hath this further advantage attributed to it, that the Dreams thereof are prophetical, and will come to paſs in a ſhort time; whereas the others are accounted ſuperfluous by thoſe who have been Profeſſors in that Art. Moreover, thoſe who riſe too early in Morning are ſubject to the Headach in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and more eaſily tranſported with Anger all the reſt of the day; to effect which, the conſideration of the Temperament does very much conduce. For, as ſleeping in the day time is born with in Old Men and Children, and that in both, by reaſon of their weakneſs, and for the recruit of their Spirits, and, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in Old Men, to take off ſomewhat of the acrimony of that ſerous phlegm which is predominant in them; ſo, the greater part of Men being ſubject to Choler, (whence haply proceeded the error of ſome Phyſicians, who talk of nothing but refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all diſeaſes) and the coolneſs and moiſture of the Night correcting that hot and dry diſtemper, it is the more convenient, that Sleep ſhould do as much in the Day time, by taking off then ſomewhat of their Choler.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the retrival and reſtauration of the Spirits obliges the Animal to ſleep, which ought to continue at leaſt for ſuch a ſpace of time as amounts to the third part of that a man hath been waking, and ſhould never exceed the one half of it. Far is it therefore from being imaginable, that Nature ſhould be able to endure what is affirmed of the ſeven Sleepers, or the long nap of <hi>Epimenides,</hi> which laſted fifty years. Nor are we to give any more credit to what is related to us concerning a Plant in the Low-Countries, which will keep people waking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nights and dayes together, without any inconvenience; but the time when we ſhould begin or end our ſleep, being left to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:66371:221"/>
our own diſcretion, 'tis requiſite we ſhould accommodate our ſelves to the order preſcrib'd by Nature, which hath appointed the day to labour, and the night to reſt in: Nay, it is alſo the advice of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and all Phyſicians, who think it not enough to direct reſt in the night, and waking in the day, but alſo conceive very great hopes of thoſe, who, in the time of their ſickneſs, are ſo irregular therein. Add to this, that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſilence, and the coldneſs of the night being fit to recruit the Spirits, and promote their retirement within; whereas light, noiſe, and the heat of the day, are more proper to occaſion their egreſs for the exerciſe of actions; which granted, he who obſerves not this rule charges Nature with an erronious proceeding. And that this is her way, is apparent hence, that thoſe Animals which are guided only by her motion, (which is as certain as our reaſon is ordinarily irregular) go that way to work. Cocks and other Birds go to their reſt, and awake with the Sun; if any of our Domeſtick Creatures do otherwiſe, our irregularity is the cauſe thereof and that perverſion is of no leſs dangerous conſequence than that of the Seaſons, which is ever attended by diſeaſes. And who makes any doubt but that the greateſt perfection of the Heavens conſiſts in their regular motion, the principal cauſe of their duration? Which order ſince we are not able to imitate, it is but requiſite we ſhould come as near it as we can in our actions, among which ſleeping and waking, being the hindges on which all the others of our life do hang, if there be any irregularity in theſe, confuſion and diſorder muſt needs be expected in all the reſt, as may be ſeen in the lives of Courtiers of both Sexes, who turn night to day, and day to night, a courſe of life much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which is obſerv'd by the Superiours and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of regulated companies. Beſides, it is the Morning that not only holds a ſtricter correſpondence with the Muſes, but is alſo the fitteſt time for the performance of all the functions of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind. Then is it that Phyſicians preſcribe exerciſes, in regard that the Body being clear'd of the Excrements of the firſt and ſecond concoction, is wholly diſpos'd for the diſtribution of Aliment, and evacuation of the Excrements of the third. So that he who ſpends that part of the day about his affairs, beſides the expedition he meets with, does by that means maintain the vigour of his Body and Mind, which is commonly dull'd by ſleeping in the day time, which fills the Head with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and when exerciſe comes to ſucceed it in the warmeſt part of the day, the heat which is then commonly greateſt makes it leſs ſupportable. Therefore Nature, who is a ſure guide, inclines us to ſleepineſs in the Evening, there being not any thing but the multiplicity and diſtraction of Civil Affairs, which, depriving us of that Function, as it does of divers others, makes the Life of Man ſo much the leſs certain, the more he is involv'd in Affairs; whereas the duration of that of Animals, and, next to them of Country-people, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:66371:222"/>
ſuch as comply with the conduct of Nature, is commonly of a greater length and more certain.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXI. Whether the Child derives more from the Father, or the Mother.</head>
            <p>IF our Fore-fathers may be conceiv'd wiſe enough to have known the nature of things, it is to be acknowledg'd, that the Child derives moſt from the Father, ſince that they thought fit to beſtow on him his name rather than that of the Mother; and that the name is the mark and character of the thing. Beſides, the Male being more perfect, larger and ſtronger than the Female, which indeed is an imperfection and default of Nature, whoſe conſtant deſign it is to make a Male, and is not diſappointed; but through want of heat, vigour, and temperament; it is but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, that what proceeded from theſe two, ſhould have the denomination from the more perfect of them. Thus a Regiment is known by the name of the Colonel; a City, by that of its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; a Law and Ordinance by that of the Law-giver; and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, the Compoſition whereof conſiſts of two ſimple medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hath moſt of the nature of the ſtronger, and that which is of greateſt virtue. This is further confirm'd by the common Compariſon, which is us'd to expreſs the difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Mother in the buſineſs of generation. For the Mother, and particularly, the Matrix, is compar'd to a field, and the paternal ſeed to the grain which is ſown in that field, which ſerves well enough in order to its ſprouting and ſhooting forth, but ſupplies it only with matter, which is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the form of the grain, from which the Plant produc'd of it receives its being. So that the preſent Queſtion amounts to no more, than if a Man ſhould aſk, Whether an ear of Wheat deriv'd more from the ground, or from the ſeed that had been ſowne in it? A further proof hereof may be deduc'd from the inſtruments of generation, which being more apparent in the man than in the woman, are a ſilent inſinuation, that the former contribute more thereto than the latter. And the greateſt and moſt remarkable difference that there is between the Children being that of the Sex, the experiment alledg'd by Phyſicians, that if the right Teſticle be bound, Males will be produc'd, as Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males will if the contrary, clearly ſhews that by the Father's part the Sex is determinated, and conſequently, it is from him that there do alſo proceed the leaſt individual differences and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, wherein the likeneſs or unlikeneſs of Children to their Fathers and Mothers, either in Mind or Body doth conſiſt.
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:66371:222"/>
For if the Males eſpecially ſhould retain more from the Mothers than they do from the Fathers, that proverbial ſaying would prove falſe, which affirms, that
<q>Fortes creantur fortibus—</q>
in regard that moſt women are chargeable with a want of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And daily experience makes it apparent, that one of the greateſt and moſt common cauſes of Valour is deduc'd from the Fathers ſide: Upon which principle is grounded the account we make of Nobility, which comes ſeldom but from the Father's ſide, whereas the want of Nobility on the Mother's ſide, does not make the Child leſs a Gentleman. Nay ſome have made it a Queſtion, whether the Mother did contribute any thing to the formation of the <hi>foetus,</hi> or only found it nouriſhment. But thoſe who have treated more nicely of this matter unanimouſly agree, that the Woman's Seed is much weaker, and more wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than that of the Man, ſerving only to qualifie it, as Water does Wine, yet ſo as that the Water is converted into the nature of the Wine, and is call'd Wine as ſoon as it is mixt with it. As to thoſe Children who chance to be more like their Mothers than their Fathers, 'tis to be conceiv'd one of Nature's fagaries, who delighting in variety cannot produce many children, but there muſt conſequently be a great diverſity of Lineaments in their faces, and figures in their members; among which the idea of a Woman imprinted in the imagination of the Father may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his Seed, which conſequently expreſſes that figure.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, That there were three kinds of reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to wit, that of the Species, that of the Sex, and that of the Effigies, as to the Body, and that of manners, as to the Soul. or The reſemblance of the Species is, when a Man begets a Man, a Woman proceeds from the material Principles of Generation which the Mother contributes more plentifully then the Father: the proof whereof may be ſeen in the copulation of Animals of different Species. For if a Hee-goat couples with a Sheep, he ſhall beget a Sheep, which ſhall have nothing of the Goat in it, ſave that the fleece will be a little rougher then it is wont to be. And if a Ram couples with a She-goat, the production will be a Goat, whoſe hair will be ſomewhat ſofter than otherwiſe. But as to what is related of <hi>Ariſto</hi>'s, having had a Daughter by an Aſs, who for that reaſon was called <hi>Onoſcele</hi>; of <hi>Fulvius Stelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s, having another by a Mare, who was thence called <hi>Hippona</hi>; and of a Sheep, which brought forth a Lyon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the paſtures of <hi>Nicippus,</hi> to whom it preſaged Tyranny; of <hi>Alcippa,</hi> who was deliver'd of an Elephant, having been impregnated by an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, are to be look'd on as monſtrous, and poſſibly fabulous Productions.</p>
            <p>The reſemblance of the Sex depends on the temperature and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:66371:223"/>
predominancy of the Seeds. For if the ſeed of both Male and Female be very hot, Males will be engendred; if cold, Females; and both of them will be either vigorous or weak, according to the predominancy of heat or cold. Whence it follows, that this reſemblance does not proceed more from the one then the other, of thoſe who are joyn'd together: but the reſemblance of Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and the other accidents of the Body, and of the manners is more hard to reſolve, there being a ſecret vertue in both the Seeds, which, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, is continu'd in it to the fourth Generation, as may be confirm'd by the ſtory of <hi>Helida,</hi> who having lain with a Negro, brought forth a white Child; but her Grandchild by that was black. <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms the ſame thing to have happen'd in the fourth Generation of a Negro. And yet this reſemblance proceeds rather from the Mother's ſide than the Father's; for if the cauſes, which communicate moſt to their effects, imprint moſt of their nature into them; by that greater communication, thoſe effects accordingly retain ſo much the more of their Cauſes. Now the Mother communicates more to the Child then the Father does, for ſhe ſupplies him with Seed, thoſe who have maintain'd the contrary being perſons not much skill'd in Anatomy, and after ſhe hath contributed as much as the Father to that Generation, ſhe alone nouriſhes the <hi>foetus</hi> with her menſtrual blood, which then begins not to follow any longer the courſe of the Moon, whereby it was regulated before. Beſides, coming thus to furniſh the ſaid <hi>foetus</hi> with nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, for the ſpace of nine Months, it is no wonder ſhe ſhould abſolutely tranform it into her own nature, which is thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted but one and the ſame, in reſpect of both Mother and Child. Now there is not any thing liker, or can retain more of it then the thing it ſelf; which cannot be ſaid of the Father, who is not only different from the Embryo, whom he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but alſo hath not any thing common with it, after that firſt action. So that there are many Children <hi>posthumi,</hi> and born long after the death of their Fathers, which thing never happens after the death of their Mothers; nay it is ſeldom ſeen that a Child taken out of the body of a Mother ready to dy, ever thrives much afterwards. Though we ſhall not ſtick to acknowledge, that what is related of the firſt perſon of the race of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> from whom that Section was called the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarean,</hi> might poſſibly happen, according to the Relation; yet is it done with this reſtriction, that moſt of the other Stories told of it, are fabulous. But if the Mother comes afterwards to ſuckle her Child, as Nature and the Example of all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals teaches her, which is haply the reaſon of their being more vigorous, and of a continuance of life more regular than that of the man, that ſecond nouriſhment added to the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn from her milk, which derives the quality of the maſs of blood, from which it is extracted, makes him abſolutely conformable to the Mother. For if nouriſhment may, as we
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:66371:223"/>
find it to be true, change the Temperament of Perſons well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in years, with much more reaſon may it work a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alteration in the Body and Mind of a Child newly come into the World, who is as it were a ſmooth Table ſuſceptible of any impreſſion. Whence it is to be concluded, that they proceed very rationally, who are ſo careful of the well-fare of their little ones, (when the Mothers, either by reaſon of ſickneſs, of upon ſome other account, are not able to bring them up) as to be very inquiſitive about the Nurſes they put them to, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Milk. Nay, what is more; are not the changes caus'd by Nurſes in the Body of the Infant as conſiderable, as that which happens to the two ſeeds of Male and Female mixt at the Generation, which recover their increaſe by the irroration of the Maternal Blood which flows thereto; and, if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, does communicate its impurity to it; as, on the contrary, being pure, it is many times able to purifie the corrupted ſeed of the Male. Whence Phyſicians have obſerv'd, that ſound Children have deſcended from Fathers ſubject to the Leproſie and ſuch diſeaſes. Add to this, that the ſafety on the Mothers ſide is greater than on the Father's. Moreover, they are the Mothers, from whom proceeds the Imagination, which acts upon their Embryo all the time they are with Child; and thence it comes, that they are much more fond of their Children than the Fathers; which fondneſs is a ſign that there may be more of the Mothers obſerv'd in the Children, than of the Fathers. For the love we have for our ſelves is ſo great, that God would have it to be the meaſure of that which we ought to bear unto our Neighbour; and that which we bear to God himſelf hath ſome reference to his affection towards us. Thoſe therefore who would inſinuate themſelves into the favour of any one, have no ſurer way to do it, than by complying with his humor, and as much he can become conformable to him.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXII. Whether is harder, for a Vertuous Man to do that which is Evil; or for a Vicious to do that which is Good.</head>
            <p>BEfore we come to the Reſolution of this Queſtion, we are to conſider two things; the former, that Man conſiſts of two parts, the Superiour, which is the Soul; and the Inferiour, which is the Body; and whereas theſe two parts have different objects, and ſuch as which contradict one the other, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be a great Conflict; the body being ſtrongly inclin'd to ſenſuality, and the Soul endeavouring to raiſe her ſelf up to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things. But in regard the Organs ſhe makes uſe of are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:66371:224"/>
ſuch as are alſo the Senſes, which aſſiſt her in her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is not to be thought ſhe can overcome without great pains; inaſmuch as the inſtruments which ſhe ſtands in need of, for the exerciſe of Virtue, hold a greater correſpondence with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and as they derive their Being from matter, ſo they betray the Reſolutions of the Soul, reducing her under a Tyrannical Subjection. Whence it follows, that the wicked or vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finds it the greater difficulty to do well; inaſmuch as being enſlav'd to vice and ſin, he cannot ſhake off that yoke, as having a conſtant inclination to evil.</p>
            <p>The Second thing to be conſider'd, is good and evil in it ſelf; for, according to Nature, there is no evil in Humane Actions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as in appearance they are all good; otherwiſe the Will, the object whereof is that which is Good and pleaſing, would not be inclin'd thereto, ſince good is that which all things deſire. There are therefore two ſorts of good, and as many of evils, one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and the other Moral; the Soul is eaſily enclin'd to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good, and the Body to the Natural; and, conſequently, it is much more eaſie for the Vicious perſon to do a Moral good, than it is for the Virtuous Man to do a Moral Evil.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That it is harder for a good Man to do evil, in regard that to the virtuous man Virtue ſeems ſo fair and taking, that he finds it the greateſt difficulty in the world to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her, and ſo to embrace Vice, which he looks upon as a hideous Monſter, inaſmuch as Beings and Subſtances are more amiable than Privations are odious; in regard that as Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the things that are amiable, and averſion is not extended to that which is not; in like manner, Vice is not ſo much ſhun'd, as Vertue is belov'd: Whence it follows, that it is a greater trouble for the good man to do that which is evil, in regard he knows the perfection of good, as much as the vicious perſon is ignorant of it; and, from that ignorance, there muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a difficulty and backwardneſs of embracing it.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the vicious perſon finds it a harder taſk to do well, in regard that Nature is ſtrongly bent towards that which is evil; and, conſequently, the virtuous perſon, when he does that which is evil, eaſily falls down into the bottom; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deſcent of humane inclinations; and the vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he does that which is good, climes up a high Mountain full of Rocks and Precipices, and engages againſt Nature her ſelf, being in open hoſtility againſt the ſenſual Appetite, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scripture, <hi>We do not the good which we would do, but the evil we would not do, that we do:</hi> To ſhew that the difficulties men find in the purſuance of good are ſo great, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf complains of his <hi>having a Law within him which rebelled againſt the Law of God.</hi> This Nature of ours being full of the imperfections conceiv'd in Original Sin, hath ſo great a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to good, that there was a neceſſity of a Law of Grace to regenerate it, in order to the purſuit of good, a complyance
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:66371:224"/>
with the true ſentiments of Religion, and the knowledge of God; not to urge, that Pleaſure hath ſo great attractions and charms, that it is almoſt impoſſible to over-maſter them. Thence it came that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> order'd himſelf to be bound to the maſt of his Ship, and caus'd his ears to be ſtopp'd, that he might not hear the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious voices of the Syrens; otherwiſe his Reaſon would not have been ſo ſtrong as to over-maſter his ſenſual Appetites, which muſt be either deſtroy'd, or ſo fetter'd, that the Soul may not be drawn away by pernicious temptations.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Virtue was natural to Man before <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, and, from the time of his rebellion againſt God, Vice hath ſeated it ſelf in her place; ſo that when Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence forſook our firſt Parent, all vices and imperfections poſſeſs'd themſelves of his Mind, and are become ſo naturaliz'd there, that it begat a neceſſity of eſtabliſhing Divine and Humane Laws: whereof ſome were for the eradication of Vices; others, for the puniſhment of Crimes; all which trouble might have been ſpar'd, if there had not been ſo much difficulty in the doing of that which is good.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That it being ſuppos'd, (as indeed it is true) that Humane Nature is more inclin'd to Vice than to Virtue for the reaſons before alledg'd, yet is there a certain means to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and deſtroy that Inclination, and advance the Soul to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over the Body, by aboliſhing and deſtroying the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and thoſe intellectual powers whereby the Organs are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd. For if the Body have the Maſterſhip, the Soul will be forc'd to obey; but if the Soul commands, ſhe will bring the Body into ſubjection to all the vertuous actions ſhe pleaſes her ſelf. And then the Vertues will be naturaliz'd in man, and the Queſtion propos'd will meet with a contrary Solution; for in that Caſe, it will be much more hard for the vertuous man to do that which is evil, than for the vicious to do well; inaſmuch as the virtuous perſon by that mortification of the Senſes, will be in a manner reduc'd to the ſtate of original innocence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the glorious condition Man was in before the Fall.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That ſuch a moral regeneration is a great Cabaliſtical Secret, unknown to all the learned; that ſuch a mortification and deſtruction of the Senſes as was propos'd, is a work not yet well diſcover'd to the Curious, as tranſcending all common rules. For, if the Soul acts not without the aſſiſtance of the Organs, and the interior and exterior Senſes, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or deſtroying of theſe will contribute to the weakning of the Soul; and inſtead of making a Prophet, the transformation will be into ſome Hypochondriack, or extravagant Phanatick, as it happens to thoſe who macerate their Bodies by an indiſcreet zeal; inſomuch that having not the perfect knowledg of that Science, it were more expedient that men had a recourſe to the ordinary means of Morality, to regulate the Paſſions of the Soul, and bring her to the purſuance of Virtue. Now according to the rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:66371:225"/>
even thoſe who are good, are much inclin'd to evil, and find it no eaſie matter to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, That it is as hard a matter for the vicious perſon to do well, as it is for the virtuous to do ill, in regard that the inclination, which the good man hath to do good and eſchew evil, is equal to that of the wicked perſon, which is always bent to do evil, it being very difficult for him to embrace Virtue by ſhunning Vice, by reaſon of the averſion which he hath to that which is good. And to make this the more clear, we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find ſome perſons ſo naturally addicted to the exerciſes of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that what they do ſeems to be without any ſtudy. Whence it may be deduc'd, that the firſt ſeeds of Virtue and Good proceed from thoſe natural Diſpoſitions, which are called <hi>Inclinations,</hi> and, conſequently, the difficulties in both are concluded to be equal. And that may alſo be obſerv'd in <hi>Socrates,</hi> who himſelf acknowledg'd, that his natural Inclinations were ſo bent to Vice, that if the dictates of Philoſophy had not wrought things in him beſeeming the perſon, whom the Oracle had declar'd <hi>wiſe,</hi> he would have been carry'd away with ſenſual Appetites, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his natural Inclinations; there being ſome Natures truly Heroick, and ever doing well; and others brutiſh, and always inclin'd to evil. To this we are to add the conſideration of the perſons, their qualities, and age; inaſmuch as there being ſomewhat particular in any of theſe circumſtances, it changes the reſolution in the general propoſition, which being univerſal, and of a large extent, it were neceſſary, in order to the finding out of the Truth, that we confin'd our ſelves to theſe circumſtances, yet ſtill following the forementioned opinion. For as fire finds no difficulty to aſcend, no more than the water does to flow down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and make towards its centre; ſo every one complying with his own Inclinations, ſtands in an equal bent towards good and evil, without any trouble or difficulty; but to proceed contrary to that motion, the virtuous perſon finds the trouble attending the doing of a evil action, equal to that of the vicious in doing a bad one.</p>
            <p>The Eighth ſaid, That this bent of the Inclinations ceaſes in thoſe who are one while inclin'd to the doing of that which is good, another, to the doing of that which is evil, as may be obſerv'd in <hi>Nero,</hi> who, during the firſt five years of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was the mildeſt of any of the Emperours, yet afterwards gave himſelf over to all manner of Cruelty. For what can be ſaid of this alteration, and if a man be naturally inclin'd to good, Why is not the ſame inclination continued in him? Does this inconſtancy proceed from the mind or from the body? If it proceeds from the mind, ſince the powers thereof have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the Good, Why does it not embrace that which is good, anſwerably to its knowledge of the ſame? If it proceeds from the body, ſince this hath a dependance on the mind, why does it not follow the impreſſions which it derives
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:66371:225"/>
from the other? The Profeſſors of Aſtrology, who give ſo much credit to their Influences; affirm, that theſe diverſities proceed from thoſe Conſtellations, whereby that change is cauſed, and by which the Will is moved, and receives a bent either to good or evil; but if Reaſon have the ſovereignty, it ought to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and produce ſuch effects as are anſwerable thereto. There is therefore a great probability, that the cauſes of good and bad actions are to be referr'd to the regeneration of the Elect, and the reprobation of the wicked, who are left to the purſuance of their ſenſuality; and thence it will follow, that it ſhall be as hard for a truly-devout perſon to ſin, as for a reprobate to do well; and ſo the Queſtion is to be referr'd to the deciſion of Theology.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXIII. Whether a piece of Iron laid upon the Cask prevents Thunder from marring Wine contain'd within it, and why?</head>
            <p>SInce we are always to begin with that which is undenyable in matter of fact, whereby we are aſſur'd, that a piece of Iron laid upon a veſſel full of Wine, prevents its being corrupted by Thunder, which, without that precaution, would cauſe it ſome prejudice; which precaution hath alſo the ſame effect in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Eggs which the Hen ſits upon, and in keeping Milk from turning; all the difficulty of this Queſtion is only in the latter part of it, and that is, to find out the reaſon thereof, which muſt either be referr'd to ſome occult vertue in the Iron, or to ſome of its manifeſt qualities. If it be ſaid that this is wrought by the manifeſt qualities of that metal; it ſeems requiſite that the Iron ſhould be within the veſſel with the Wine, that ſo it may oppoſe the poyſon of the Air whereby it is infected. But on the other ſide, to alledge thoſe occult vertues, is an argument of humane ignorance, inaſmuch as they are to act by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſome means: So that, all things conſidered, it is more rationally affirm'd, to be an effect proceeding from the manifeſt qualities of the Iron, which prevent and hinder that bad impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Air. But to give a more evident reaſon hereof, we are to conſult Aſtrology. That Science teaches us, that <hi>Mars,</hi> by which Planet Iron is deſigned, hath its Houſe in <hi>Aries,</hi> which is the ſign of the Ram; and the Naturaliſts obſerve, that the Sun entring into that Houſe, cauſes the ſap and moiſture of the Vine to aſcend, an evident ſign that there is a correſpondence between Wine and Iron, and that the one preſerves the other by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sympathy there is between them. And to make it appear that the Influences exerciſe their vertues even upon things inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:66371:226"/>
yet deriv'd from the root of what had been Vegetable or Animal, we find that Wine, though it be carried ever ſo far, is ſubject to an obſervable alteration, when the grapes of the ſame Vine are near their maturity; that diſtance of Places and Climates not obſtructing the Union and Correſpondence which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the whole and its part, which cannot be joyned together ſave only by means of the Celeſtial Influences.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the foremention'd reaſon deduc'd from Aſtrology was not evident, and that there is more ſubtilty in it than Truth, and, conſequently, that it is to be ſought with greater probability to find it out of Natural Philoſophy, which treats of Meteors, where the greateſt difficulty is to know whether that effect is produc'd by the expulſive, or by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and retentive vertue. That we ſhould affirm it proceeds from the expulſive vertue, cannot with any probability be done, inaſmuch as expulſion is to be wrought by ſomewhat that is more powerful and more ſubtile. Now there is not any likelyhood, that Iron ſhould be more powerful and more ſubtile than Air, inaſmuch as the Iron is of a more weighty matter, paſſive, earthy, and hath ſomewhat of the nature of that Paſſive Element. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather affirm, that this effect is wrought by the attractive and retentive vertue; which opinion is prov'd, in regard there is but one humid matter, which the central fire forces from the deepeſt part of the Earth; and of the more unctuous and weighty part of this matter Metals are made; of the leſs weighty, Minerals and Salts; from the ſubtiler part Vegetables and Animals derive their nouriſhment; of the moſt ſubtile are produc'd the Winds, Thunder, and all the Meteors, which participate of Heat and Drought, which make ſeveral combinations in the Air. Now whereas it is from the moſt imperfect part of this unctuous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Iron is made, of an earthy and impure Sulphur, it is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible thence, that there is a Sympathy between Iron, and the groſs vapours of Thunder and Lightning: To make which out a little more clearly, we find that the places through which Thunder hath paſs'd, ſmell of Sulphur; nay, there is fram'd in the Air that which is commonly called the Thunderbolt, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembles Steel, as it were to ſhew the correſpondence there is between Iron and Thunder. So that the Air, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate by thoſe noiſome terreſtrial vapours, which are of the ſame nature with Iron, meeting with ſome piece of it laid on a veſſel, is joyn'd to the Iron by Sympathy, makes a ſudden ſtop there, and puts a period to its operation; and the Iron by its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive vertue receives them, as by its retentive it retains them, and by that means prevents their effect.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That though that opinion were probable, yet doth it require a more ample diſcuſſion, and we are to examine how this attractive vertue operates. Now there are four Natural Vertues which govern all the operations of Nature and Art; the <hi>Attractive,</hi> which is now under conſideration, acts by heat
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:66371:226"/>
and a temperate drought; the <hi>Retentive,</hi> by drought and cold; the <hi>Expulſive,</hi> by moiſture and heat; the <hi>Digeſtive,</hi> by heat and a temperate moiſture. The Iron then which is ſaid to attract theſe vapours, hath indeed thoſe qualities of heat and drought; yet can it not be eaſily conceiv'd, that a little piece of that mettal can check the malice and infection of a great quantity of Air, ſpread all over a ſpacious place; beſides that it is alſo neceſſary, that the Iron ſhould ſend forth out of it ſelf the effects of its qualities, that ſo the attraction might be made, the marks whereof are neither ſeen on the Iron, nor the effects of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities out of the Subject, inaſmuch as mettals being quench'd in cold Water, are not evaporated but by a violent fire. So that it may as well be ſaid, that the attraction is wrought by ſome occult vertue, which draws; yet ſo as that neither the attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor the manner of it can be obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That the operations of Nature are not like thoſe of Art; her ways and contrivances are more obſcure, and the cauſes of things are occult; as for example, the Load-ſtone draws Iron, yet ſo as that there cannot be any thing perceiv'd of any body of air and ſmoak iſſuing out of the Loadſtone. And the magnetical Balſom, or Weapon-ſalve, cures a wounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though at a great diſtance; having only ſome part of his Cloths, yet can there not any thing be obſerv'd on the Subject which receives the Plaiſter; ſo ſecret and ſilent is Nature in her Operations. On the contrary, the deſigns and contrivances of Art may eaſily be diſcover'd, as thoſe of a Clock or Watch. But the reaſon of this diverſity of operations between Art and Nature, is, that Art goes to work publickly and before the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Nature does her buſineſs within doors and ſecretly; the latter works in the Centre, the other in the Circumference; one produces the ſeed of the combination of the Elements, whereof ſhe keeps an exact account of the weights and proportions; and the other can neither make nor produce any thing, as being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a capacity of making uſe of the ſubſtance and materials of Nature, in order to their joyning together, after ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd and purify'd them. But on the other ſide, Art hath this advantage, that her works are much more perfect, inaſmuch as ſhe makes uſe of purify'd eſſences, and the other of accidents and ſuperfluities, having not inſtruments fit for the purifying of her Materials. So that there are ſome who doubt of the reality of the effect now under conſideration. And therefore, ere we proceed any further to the finding out of the cauſes and reaſons thereof, it were requiſite a ſtrict enquiry ſhould be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be certain that Iron prevents the effects of thunder, by preſerving Wine and Eggs under a Hen that ſits, from receiving in any prejudice.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That what was confirm'd by general experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was not any longer to be queſtion'd, and that whoever ſtood upon the Negative betray'd his own ignorance; that for
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:66371:227"/>
us to think to find ſolutions for all the poſſibilities of nature, were an attempt ſomewhat like that of exhauſting the Sea; That there are certain ſecrets in Nature of things dreadful to humane Reaſon, incredible, according to the principles of Art and of our Knowledge. That Nature is the great <hi>Circe,</hi> the grand Sorcereſs, That the Load-ſtone draws Iron to it; That there is a certain Stone called <hi>Pantarbe</hi> which draws gold to it; That dead Arſe-ſmart being laid under a Stone, cures the wound on which it ſhall be rubb'd, ſooner or later according as the Herb putrifies; That the hair or wool of a mangy beaſt being thruſt in, for a certain time, under the bark of an Aſpen-tree, cures the beaſt of vermine; That the <hi>Menstrua</hi> of Women trouble Springs, ſpoyl Looking-glaſſes and Powdering-tubs; And if there be ſome things that corrupt them, it is not to be imagin'd that Nature is ſo cruel a Step-mother, but that there may be others whereby they are preſerv'd, and ſo the Remedies may come from the ſame hand as caus'd the diſeaſe; That the Hazel-tree diſcovers hidden Treaſures and Mines; That Taliſmans are made againſt Serpents and Inſects, nay againſt ſome Diſeaſes; That there is a mutual friendſhip between the Olive-tree and the Myrtle, whereof it would be as hard a matter to give any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as it would be to give any, of the enmity between the Vine and the Laurel, and the inclination which the Male-palm hath towards the Female; That the crowing of the Cock frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens Lyons, and that that Bird ſhould be ſo exact a Fore-teller of the Sun's approach; That the Fiſh called a Remora, ſtops Ships under ſail; That the eye of a Dog prepar'd after a certain way keeps others from coming near the perſon that hath it; That the powder of Crab-ſhells prepar'd, draws out Arrows and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets ſhot into the Body; That there is a certain Stone got out of the Snake, which cures ſuch as are ſubject to the Dropſie; That Serpents are not found within the ſhade of Aſh-trees; That the Marygold follows the motion of the Sun; That the precious Stone called a Topaze put into ſeething water, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſtayes the ſeething of it; That the Emerald, the Saphire, the Turqueis Stone, and Coral, change their colours, upon the happening of certain accidents to thoſe who have them about them; That there are certain Herbs which chaſe away ſpirits, as well as Muſick does; and that the diſpoſitions of a black and aduſt choler invite and entertain them. Now from all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it may be deduc'd, that, as it is a great preſumption to think to give reaſons of all things, ſo does it argue a certain weakneſs of mind to doubt of all that hath been alledged; ſo great are the abyſſes and inexhauſtible treaſures of Nature, whoſe operations tranſcend humane belief, in thouſands of other things, as well as in the Queſtion now under diſpute.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXIV. Of Stage-Plays; and whether they be advantageous to a State, or not?</head>
            <p>HUmane Life is travers'd by ſuch a viciſſitude of diſtractions and diſturbances, that not only the Civil, but alſo the Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrates have unanimouſly concluded it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that men ſhould have ſome divertiſements, whereby their minds and bodies, not able to undergo continual labour, might receive ſome relaxation, for want whereof they would be cruſh'd under the burthen of their affairs. Now among thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations, there is not any brings greater delight with it, then what is perform'd on the Theatre, that is, Plays; which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us things paſt, heighten'd with all the circumſtances they are capable of, which cannot be done by Hiſtory, as being a thing dead, and not animated by Voice, Geſtures, and Habits. But if we add thereto, that this innocent divertiſement is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by thoſe advantages which may be deduc'd from excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sentences and Inſtructions, we muſt conclude him who finds fault with it, to be of a more than <hi>Timonian</hi> humour, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd enemy to civil Society. The proof hereof is deriv'd from the Uſe of it, the true Touch-ſtone, whereby good and profitable things are to be diſtinguiſh'd from ſuch as are hurtful and unprofitable. For there have been an infinite number of things taught by Men, which have been ſmother'd as ſoon as brought forth; and there are others alſo, which the Inventors of them have out-liv'd; but when an Invention finds a kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment through many Ages, it is the beſt argument that may be of its goodneſs. And ſuch is that of Comedy, which (how weak or ridiculous ſoever it might be at the beginning, at which time <hi>Theſpis</hi> got himſelf drawn through the Streets in a Chariot, as he recited his Poems) preſently met with thoſe who made it their buſineſs to cultivate and heighten it to that pitch of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereto it is now come, which is ſuch that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt minds ſhould yield to the charms of it. For as thoſe things that are ſenſible, are more apt to move and make impreſſions on the ſpirits of men, then ſuch as are purely intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible; ſo Plays, expoſing to our eyes all things with a greater circumſpection, decorum, and order, then is obſervable in the actions of men commonly diſturbed by unexpected emergencies, and the unconſtancy of their paſſions, accordingly raiſe in us a greater averſion for crimes, and greater inclinations to vertue. Nay, theſe cauſe more apprehenſive emotions in our ſouls, than they are apt to receive from any other repreſentations whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not excepting even the precepts of Philoſophy it ſelf, which
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:66371:228"/>
are weak enough when they are deſtitute of their examples, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing in us ſuch Characters as can hardly be blotted out, in regard they force their paſſage into our Minds through ſeveral of our ſenſes; and as Hiſtory prevails more by its Examples than the reaſon of its Precepts, ſo Playes have the advantage of Hiſtory in this regard, that in the former, things act upon us with greater effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. This Influences it hath on us in captivating our Senſes and Underſtanding, is the more remarkable, in that the greateſt Witts are incapable of other reflections, while they behold what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented on the Stage. Beſides, if the great buſineſs of the world be truly conſider'd, it is but a Stage-Play, wherein every one acts a part; he who would avoid Plays, and not ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of humane actions, muſt find out ſome way to get out of the world. Nor are all perſons in a capacity to learn how they ſhould demean themſelves by Books and Precepts, but all are ſuſceptible of ſome inſtruction by Playes; ſince that in theſe, there are ſuch ſenſible Leſſons, that the moſt ignorant may find in them certain encouragements to Vertue, which on the Stage appears to them in her luſtre, and attended by thoſe honourable rewards which the Poets beſtow on Heroick Actions. And as Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Maps cannot ſo well acquaint thoſe who ſtudy them with the diſpoſitions of people, together with all the circumſtances of places, as Travels and Relations may: In like manner, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy ſmites not the Senſes, as thoſe paſſages do which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented on the Theatre, where ſuch as are in Love (the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject thereof) may obſerve their own Adventures perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and take notice of their vain purſuits, and the unhappy events of thoſe which are carried on by unjuſt wayes. In fine, if immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality flatters ours labours with promiſes to tranſmit our Memory to Ages; yet at a great diſtance from us, what greater ſatisfaction can there be, than to hope that our noble actions ſhall be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on Theaters before Princes and Magiſtrates?</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Humane Nature being more enclin'd to evil than to good, thoſe confus'd repreſentations which are made on the Stage, of all ſorts of good and bad things, are more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make impreſſions of evil in the minds of men, than to render them more inclinable to that which is good. Whence it is to be inferr'd, that the danger and inconveniences of Plays will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh their advantages. This conſideration occaſion'd the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of them out of ſeveral States. And whereas the Subjects of them are commonly taken from the Loves of ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant perſons, and the crimes attending them, the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt be anſwerable to the means, which are lewd Artifices, whereby it is compaſſed, and where-with mens minds are imbu'd, and ſo inclin'd to wicked actions, and ſuch as are moſt likely to promote the execution of their pernicious deſigns; which would not happen, were they ignorant of them. Nay, to go to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this kind of entertainments, the moſt ancient of them, acted in the time of <hi>Romulus,</hi> was contriv'd for the ſurprizal and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:66371:228"/>
carrying away of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins; it being eaſily inferr'd, that what produc'd ſo bad an effect muſt of neceſſity have been a bad cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Playes conſider'd in themſelves were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but that according to the diverſity of their Minds who frequent them, they have a different operation; as Wine exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively taken beſots and layes ſome aſleep, and enlivens others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference of their Temperaments. For if they meet with weak Minds, they imprint in them the Paſſions of the things that are repreſented, much more eaſily than Books uſually do. But if they are perſons of a ſtrong Conſtitution of Intellectuals, they conſider what they ſee as a pure Fiction, and a draught of Painting, in the intrigues whereof they find a certain divertiſement, much like that of excellent P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inters in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectives; they are pleas'd to ſee a miſt caſt before the eyes of the vulgar, while they themſelves are ſufficiently ſatisfi'd, that what others think repreſented to the life, is only perform'd by the interpoſition of Scenes: So that, from this diverſity of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, this only can be inferr'd, that Playes and Opera's are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and innocent divertiſements to ſuch as are well-vers'd in the affairs of the world, who, being over-preſs'd with a continu'd earneſtneſs in the proſecution of their more ſerious concerns, find a certain relaxation therein; not in a melancholy ſloath, ſuch as is inconſiſtent with the activity which is natural to them, but in thoſe leſs ſerious employments; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thoſe perſons who are already too much enclin'd to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity, and effeminacy, ought not to be admitted to Plays, in regard they can have no other effect on them, than to make them more effeminate.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That as Women are juſtly forbidden the uſe of the Sciences, ſo ought they alſo to be forbidden the ſight of Plays; inaſmuch as it is not expedient, in order to frugal Houſe-keeping, that that Sex ſhould be allow'd an acquaintance with thoſe curioſities which might divert them from the care they ought to have of their domeſtick affairs. For, beſides the loſs of time, idleneſs is extreamly prejudicial to that Sex, whoſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be aſſiduity in labour, frugality, and a conſtant keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Houſe, which is not conſiſtent with the frequenting of Shews and Play-houſes, and ſeeing the repreſentations made there: Which, the more inſtructive they are, and the more likely to fill Womens heads with new things, the more ought they to be forbidden the ſight of them; there being not any thing a Huſband ſhould fear ſo much in his Wife, as an exceſs of Wit, upon the conceit whereof ſhe aſſumes to her ſelf a certain autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over him, contrary to the Inſtitution of Matrimony, or at leaſt thinks her ſelf equal to him, which is not much leſs to be fear'd, inaſmuch as it is a great diſturbance to the domeſtick tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. This may be the better apprehended by the example of two Men equally learned, who diſputing one againſt the other,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:66371:229"/>
ſeldom come to any agreement, as a knowing and an ignorant perſon many times do; for if the latter chance to contradict himſelf, he is eaſily convinc'd, and acquieſces. And though the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſometimes admitted Women in their Academies, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the functions of Profeſſors and Regents, yet are not thoſe examples to be introduc'd into this Age, whereof the corruption is ſuch, as is able to change Vertues into Vices. But, from this general Rule we are to except ſuch <hi>Heroina's,</hi> as are the great Exemplars of all Vertues, who ſurpaſſing the greateſt part of Men in Wit and Intellectuals, it were injurious to think them ſuſceptible of thoſe bad impreſſions, which the Men are able to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the example of the <hi>Romans</hi> who gave extraordinary ſalaries to Comedians, as <hi>Cicero</hi> aſſures us they did to <hi>Roſcius,</hi> ſufficiently ſhews the advantages of publick repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And indeed, if there be any thing to be blam'd in Plays, it is this, that they are too Pathetick, that is, too apt to raiſe and expreſs Humane Paſſions. For as an Oration mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd in Verſe, is more elaborate than Proſe; ſo Verſes, diſpos'd by a ſound Judgement for the Stage, are extreamly beyond thoſe of Exegematick Poems, wherein only the Poet ſpeaks himſelf. Moreover, the obſervance of Time, whereto all the Acts are confin'd, and the other Laws of Dramatick Pieces, diſcover their excellency above all others. So that to queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are advantageous, is to bring into doubt, Whether the Maſter-pieces of Poets, Orators, and Hiſtorians, are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to a State.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXV. Whether that Temperament of the Body which conduces moſt to Health, be alſo the moſt convenient for the Mind.</head>
            <p>I Shall not here inſiſt on the diviſion of the Temperaments, as for inſtance, into <hi>Simple,</hi> to wit, when one Quality is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant over its oppoſite, the other two remaining equal, as we affirm him to be of a hot Temperament, who ſhall be more hot than cold, humidity and drought remaining in an <hi>aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>; and <hi>Compound,</hi> to wit, that which is the reſult of the ſame combination of qualities, which makes the four Elements: into the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> to wit, of the whole Body; and <hi>Particular,</hi> viz. that which is proper to each part: into that which is <hi>of Weight,</hi> wherein all thoſe qualities are as it were in a balance, one not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the other; and that <hi>of Juſtice,</hi> wherein thoſe qualities bear a certain proportion one to the other: Not inſiſting, I ſay, on theſe Diviſions, but preſuppoſing them as common doctrines; I ſhall here think it ſufficient to examine, in the firſt place, Which
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:66371:229"/>
of all theſe Temperaments is moſt convenient, in order to health, and in the ſecond, whether the ſame will alſo be moſt convenient for the acquiſition of a good mind, that is, for the better exerciſe of the functions of the rational Soul; in a word, whether the moſt healthy perſon ſhall always be the moſt wiſe? <hi>Galen</hi> hath writ an expreſs Treatiſe, to prove that the Manners follow the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body, and therefore ſince thoſe manners are the effects of the Will, the nobleſt of all the faculties of the Soul, in regard it hath a Soveraignty over all the others, it ſhould ſeem that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative is to be maintain'd, eſpecially if we lay this for a ground, that thoſe perſons who are ſubject to Melancholy are the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, foraſmuch as they are the moſt healthy; cold and drought making up a more ſolid and firm maſs, then any other two qualities; and heat and moiſture being too variable, and too much ſubject to corruption. Upon which conſideration, <hi>Galen,</hi> in his firſt Book of the <hi>Temperaments,</hi> chap. 4. denies, <hi>That the Spring is hot and moiſt; on the contrary,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is the worſt of all the Temperaments of the Air whereby we are encompaſs'd, and that is commonly the conſtitution obſervable in ſickly and contagious ſeaſons.</hi> In his eighth Book of the <hi>Method of curing Diſeaſes,</hi> chap. 7. he adds, That <hi>a hot and moiſt diſtemper makes our health incline to corruption.</hi> The hot and dry is alſo too eaſily inclinable to be enflam'd, as the cold and moiſt is too much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to defluxions; and withal to ſharp Diſeaſes, ſuch as are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Feavers, for the firſt; Burning Feavers, for the ſecond; and Apoplexies, Palſies, and Dropſies, for the laſt. On the other ſide, cold and drought are enemies to corruption, and by thoſe very qualities which are contrary thereto, they more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully oppoſe external injuries, by reaſon of the ſolidity of the ſkin, and the denſity of its parts; as the diſpoſitions of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly perſons are not ſubject to the paſſionate diſturbances of the Cholerick, the inconſtancy of the Sanguine, the ſlothfulneſs of the Phlegmatick; and communicate the ſame Stability which is in them to the Spirits, which act anſwerably thereto. Of this Conſtitution were all thoſe laborious and ſtudious people, and all the great Perſons, whoſe aſſiduous employments have made them famous in their own and ſubſequent Ages.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That if we may believe the ſame <hi>Galen,</hi> in the ſixth Book of the preſervation of Health, the hot and moiſt Temperament is the moſt healthy, <hi>as being the moſt proper to man's nature</hi>; and he-further writes, That <hi>thoſe who are very moiſt, are long-liv'd, and when their bodies are come to their full ſtrength, they are more healthy then others, and are more robuſt and hardy then other men of the ſame Age, and ſo continue till they grow old. And thence it is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That all the Phyſicians and Philoſophers, who have diligently examined the Elements of man's body have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that Temperament.</hi> For, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms in his Book of a long and ſhort life, <hi>Our life conſiſts in heat and moiſture, as cold and drought diſpoſe us towards death, and the ſooner the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:66371:230"/>
grows cold and dry, the ſooner it grows old and dies.</hi> But theſe two contrary ſentiments of <hi>Galen</hi> may be reconcil'd well enough, by affirming his meaning to be, that exrernal heat and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture are enemies to health; whereas on the contrary, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat and radical moiſture are friends to it; inaſmuch as theſe are never chargeable with exceſs, but always moderate, one ſerving for aliment to the other; and they are ſo far from being capable of receiving any diſtemper, that, what reſults from them, ſerves for a rule whereto all the other Temperaments are referred; which the Vulgar improperly calls by the name of the four Humours, that are predominant in them; but that abuſe being fortify'd by cuſtom, we muſt follow it, though for no other reaſon then that we may be the better underſtood. Whence it follows, that the Sanguine Temperament is the moſt healthy, as being the moſt conformable to life. This Temperament is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the likelieſt to produce a good Wit, inaſmuch as it exerciſes better then any other the functions of the Rational Soul, which being diſtributed between the natural, vital, and animal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and theſe being better exercis'd when they moſt abound with clear and purify'd ſpirits, it is certain, that the Sanguine Temperament, the only treaſury of the Spirits, ſupplies more plentifully, and with ſuch as are more pure, thoſe in whom it is predominant, then it can be imagin'd to do others, in whom that blood is either puffed up by an exceſſive froath of Choler, or drown'd in the wateriſhneſs of Phlegm, or bury'd in the mud of Melancholy. And this may be obſerv'd in the gentileneſs, and the ſingular ſleight, nay the eaſineſs, wherewith perſons of a ſanguine Conſtitution demean themſelves in all things they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, betraying ſuch a ſmiling chearfulneſs in their eyes and countenance, as diſcovers their interiour joy and ſatisfaction; and is no leſs delightful to thoſe that are preſent, then the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſallies of the Cholerick give diſtate, the ſluggiſh delays of the Phlegmatick are tedious, and the profound reveries of the Melancholy hateful and importunate. But as for the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, the only Objection, which the other Temperaments make againſt the Sanguine, it is not to be accounted vicious in them, but look'd on as a divertiſement, wherewith they are pleas'd, and which they put themſelves upon, only that their labours may, by that ohange, be the more delightful to them. Which change is ſo much the more excuſable in them, that they court it not, to the end they ſhould be idle, but they may apply themſelves to ſome other employment, which ſuits better with their humour, ſuch as the over-long contemplation thereof might not dry up that noble blood which runs in their veins, and, by converting it into dregs, turn the ſanguine into a melancholick Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which the obſtinacy, wherewith it perſiſts a long time in the proſecution of one and the ſame deſign, is a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, than the inconſtancy imputed to the ſanguine is to that, inaſmuch as the latter makes advantage of it, to wit
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:66371:230"/>
that of attempting, and many times executing ſeveral deſigns together, eſpecially when it undertakes ſuch as it is ſure to maſter, ſuch as may be Dancing, Muſick, Courtſhip, well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contriv'd Stories, and ſuch other pleaſant things. And indeed, it is impoſſible to exerciſe the functions of the mind well, when the body is indiſpos'd; as on the contrary, when the body is in perfect health, the mind acts its part ſo much the better.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That it were very unjuſt to deprive of the honour due to them, the Heroes and Worthies of the World, whoſe temperament muſt needs have been cholerick, by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to any of the others the great and noble actions of the mind, which belong to them. Now to demonſtrate that the temperament of the Heroes conſiſted of heat and drought, we need bring in no further evidence, than the ſuddenneſs and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherewith they undertake and execute all their deſigns, as it were complying with the activity of Fire, which hath the ſupremacy among the Elements, as they have the preheminence amongſt men. Nay it may be urged, that great enterprizes would never be executed without ſome degree of choler, which ſerves as it were for ſalt to all humane actions. This premis'd, as out of all diſpute, we now come to conſider whether the hot and dry Temperament be the moſt conſiſtent with health. I affirm then, that it is more conſiſtent with it, than the Phlegmatick, which abounds in excrements; then the Sanguine, which eaſily admits of alterations; nay alſo then the Melancholick, whoſe groſs humours are more ſubject to obſtruction, then Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is, the vivacity whereof is to be ſeen upon all occaſions; thoſe of the Cholerick Conſtitution having always their Veſſels large, and, as ſuch, much more unlikely to be ſtopp'd up.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, that ſo far as the ſoul and body are different, ſo far are alſo their qualities ſuch. From which conſideration <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> took occaſion to affirm, That robuſt bodies are deſign'd to obey, as the weak are to command, inaſmuch as commonly they are the receptacles of a ſtronger ſoul. This rais'd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion in ſome, that the moſt imperfect bodies have commonly the moſt perfect ſouls, alledging to that purpoſe, the example of the crooked and ill-ſhap'd Tree, which ſupplies us with the beſt of Liquors, Wine; whereas the ſtrait and fair-ſpreading Oaks, bear nothing but acorns, for the feeding of Swine. Beſides, as the word <hi>ſpirit</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> is ſometimes taken for the Invention which principally conſiſts in the Imagination; ſometimes for the Judgment, or Underſtanding; and might be alſo taken for the Memory, among which this laſt requires a hot and moiſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, as the firſt is pleas'd with a hot and dry; and the ſecond, to wit the judgment, conſiſts in the dry and cold, which makes men ſtaid and ſettled: ſo is it accordingly requiſite, that we ſhould diſtinguiſh, of which of theſe three faculties the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be underſtood. But generally ſpeaking, it is not eaſily imaginable, that there ſhould be a well-fram'd mind in a much-indiſpos'd
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:66371:231"/>
body, inaſmuch as there is the ſame proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as there is between the mold and the figure caſt in it; a Palace, and him who dwells in it. The ſame thing may much more rationally be ſaid of the humours, from which the ſpirits being drawn bring their quality along with them: ſo that the Temperament which is moſt convenient in order to health, will alſo be the moſt convenient for the functions of the Soul.</p>

         <div n="226" type="conference">
            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXVI. Whether it be more expedient for a Man to have only one Friend or many.</head>
            <p>SInce Man is no further to be called ſo, then as he is ſociable, and that there is no Society more delightful then that of Converſation, which cannot be better maintain'd then by the relation and correſpondence there is between ſuch as are of a like diſpoſition, which preſuppoſe a Friendſhip; it ſhould ſeem, that it is not grounded only on Reaſon, but alſo on Nature her ſelf, which ſubſiſts altogether by that Union, as ſhe is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy'd by diſcord. And this is principally made apparent in civil life, wherein Friendſhip is ſo powerful, that, being reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerv'd, there will be no need of Juſtice, ſince every one would voluntarily render that to another which is due to him, which is the proper Work of that Vertue: which being in like manner well adminiſtred, that of Fortitude would alſo be unneceſſary; and it would be ſuperfluous to uſe the rigour of the Laws, to oblige men to the doing of a thing which they exerciſed without any compulſion. Hence it came that the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Law-givers, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirms in his Ethicks, took more pains in eſtabliſhing the Laws of Friendſhip among their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, then thoſe of Juſtice; inaſmuch as theſe latter take place, only upon the non-obſervance of the former, which are ſo much the more durable, in regard they are grounded upon the pure freedom of the Will, without any other obligation, then that which our own choice hath impos'd on it ſelf, of its own accord, in a legal friendſhip. Its nature alſo is as much conceal'd as its effects are manifeſt, which are ſo convincing, that thoſe, who have ſpoken moſt advantageouſly of them, affirm that to take away Friendſhip were to deprive the World of the light of the Sun; and that humane Society may as well be without it, as want the uſe of Fire and Water. Nor is it their meaning to ſpeak of that irregular Paſſion, produc'd by the motion of the concupiſcible Appetite, which is inclin'd towards a delightful good, and which only flattering the Senſes, thoſe who are carry'd away with it are called amorous Perſons, and not Friends; but, of that Queen
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:66371:231"/>
of Vertues, which is enthron'd in the rational Appetite, excited by a vertuous Good, which being conceiv'd as amiable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the Will, ſhe loves and ſtrictly embraces it, cauſing ſuch a perfect union between him who loves, and him who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, that they are but one heart and one ſoul, which, for that reaſon is ſaid to be rather where it loves then where it lives. So that it being not to be imagin'd, that ſuch an union can be among many, neither can true friendſhip be among many, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, whoſe mutual correſpondence being the greater, their Friendſhip is conſequently more firm and durable. And it is more compleat between theſe two Relatives, then it can be among many, whoſe correſpondence being more difficult, for want of the conditions requiſite to Friendſhip, which are not ſo eaſily met with in a greater number, it is poſſible they may have a certain kindneſs and good-will one towards another, but not a ſolid and ſincere Friendſhip, which looks on a friend, as a ſecond Self, a relation that hath place only between two, whom Antiquity, for that reaſon, order'd always to go by Couples.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Friendſhip could not continue long only between two friends, in regard that there being not any one but is chargeable with ſome imperfection, it is impoſſible but that it ſhould produce ſome coldneſs and indifference, in his apprehenſions who takes notice of it, and that in time will come to an alienation, as it commonly happens in Friendſhip. And this is yet the farther from being wel-ſetled, upon this accompt, that continual familiarity coming to diſcover the weakneſſes of one or the other, it can never be long without ſome punctilio's and diſputes, which are many times advanc'd to ſuch a height, that there is a neceſſity of a third perſon to compoſe their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Now this muſt be done by one who is a common friend to both, and conſequently, to eſtabliſh a permanent friendſhip, it is requiſite there ſhould be three, a number the more highly to be eſteemed, in that the Graces conſiſt of it; without which, Friendſhip will be but of a ſhort continuance. Upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it was that the Tyrant <hi>Dionyſius</hi> wiſh'd that he might make up the third, with thoſe two intimate, friends <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias.</hi> The <hi>Scythians</hi> alſo, as <hi>Lucian</hi> affirms, to make up a perfect friendſhip, requir'd that there ſhould be three perſons, who drunk together out of a Veſſel, into which they had ſpilt ſome drops of their blood, wherewith they dy'd the points of their ſwords.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Friendſhip, in reſpect of our Will, was as Science in reſpect of our Underſtanding. For as this latter hath a natural inclination to Knowledge, ſo the Will is endu'd with ſuch another to Love, inaſmuch as in it ſhe finds her ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign good. Thence it comes, that as there are ſome ſpirits ſo ſublime, that, not content with one only knowledge, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſeveral, whereas there are others ſo circumſcrib'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, that only one Science wholly takes them up ſo, as that they
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:66371:232"/>
are not able to make any progreſs into others; ſo are there ſome Souls ſo limitted in their affection, that it can be dilated but to one object, which checks, and makes them incapable of loving any more, as thoſe generous and heroick hearts do, which have ſo ſtrong a bent to do well and to love; that, not ſatifi'd with one object, they diffuſe their affections to all thoſe whom they think worthy thereof. And ſo the deciſion of the queſtion ſhould depend on the Capacities of thoſe who love, ſince that, conſidering the amiable objects, whether they be ſuch, and, conſequently, there be cauſe for the loving of them, or are not really ſuch, but only ſo conceiv'd by the apprehenſive faculty, they are equally fit to move the Will to love them, and to gain its affections; and they ought to be the more agreeable to it, in that it finds in them its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and the accompliſhment of its deſires. And ſo the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Friends is ſo far from being any prejudice to Friendſhip, that it ſets a greater eſteem upon it, as alſo on him who loves.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Friendſhip, taken generally, is a mutual Good-will between thoſe who are deſirous to do one another ſome reciprocal kindneſs; but taking it more preciſely, it may be defin'd a Vertue, by means whereof vertuous perſons are ſo united in Affection and Will, that they become abſolutely like one another, through a hearty good Will, Concord, and good Turns mutually done and receiv'd. The former reſides particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the interior motions of the mind; the ſecond, in words and diſcourſe; the third, in effects. Theſe are the three eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial marks of a vertuous Friendſhip; which, not regarding its proper intereſt, as thoſe do, who love upon the account of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit, courts not the objects it loves, out of any other conſideration than that of the Vertue or Science which render it recommendable. Now theſe qualities being ſeldom found among many, who ought to be equally furniſh'd therewith, that the Friendſhip may be reciprocal, it is very hard to meet with ſo many Subjects capable of ſo ſublime a Vertue as that; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that combination of Vertues, requiring much experience, and a great proceſs of time that we might not be deceiv'd in the choice of Friends, (with each whereof a Man, according to the common ſaying, ſhould eat a buſhel of Salt before he contracted a Friendſhip) it will be found a much harder taſk to make ſuch a ſtrict examination of the qualities and diſpoſitions of many, than it will be to do it of one alone; with whom, conſequently, it is more ſafe to enter into Friendſhip, than it can be with many.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That Friendſhip being grounded on conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and there being not any more divertive and delightful than that between thoſe who eat and drink together, the Caſe is the ſame with friends as it is with gueſts, which ought not to be under the number of three, nor exceed that of nine; whence came the ancient Proverb, that a well-ordered Feaſt ſhould not be under the number of the Graces, nor tranſcend that of the Muſes. In a word, ſince converſation is the ground-work of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:66371:232"/>
perfect Friendſhip, as the former cannot be pleaſant among leſs than three, and muſt be confus'd and weariſome among above nine; but is moſt divertive, when five or ſix perſons well-qualifi'd, and perfectly underſtanding one the other, fall into mutual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; ſo Friendſhip cannot be of long continuance between two, but there muſt be a third to encourage it; yet with this further caution, that it is better maintain'd among a greater number of perſons equally vertuous, provided nevertheleſs it exceed not that of nine, to prevent the confuſion and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending a greater.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That though there be an abſolute neceſſity of Friendſhip, in all he tranſactions of humane life, in order to the more pleaſant expence of it, yet are there principally two cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, wherein its neceſſity is more apparent, to wit, thoſe of Proſperity and Adverſity. In the former, our friends par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of our happineſs, in the latter, of our misfortunes; and whereas theſe laſt are commonly more frequent than good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the plurality of Friends, who are our ſecond-ſelves, making the burthen the more ſupportable by the part every one takes in our misfortunes; it is much more expedient that a Man ſhould have many, then content himſelf with a ſmall number, which being not able to bear the brunt of ſo violent an aſſault, he would be in danger of being overcome thereby. Nay, though all things ſhould happen according to our wiſhes, yet were it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to have a conſiderable number of Friends, the more to congratulate our good fortune, which will make the greater noiſe in the world, the greater their number is who approve and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it.</p>
            <p>The Seventh ſaid, That the plurality of Friends was equally inconvenient, as well in good as bad fortune. For, in the latter, it muſt needs trouble us very much to give occaſion of grief to a great number of Friends, who though they bemoan us ever ſo much, yet are we ſtill in the ſame period of misfortune; nay, our unhappineſs is the greater, in that it is contagiouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to ſo many perſons at the ſame time. In the former, there cannot be any thing more troubleſom then that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people who love, or pretend to love us in our proſperity, it being then impoſſible for us equally to ſatisfie them all, as we might eaſily do one ſingle Friend, from whom we may alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive greater comfort in Adverſity, than from many addreſſing themſelves to us at the ſame time; to whoſe humours to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves well, we muſt ſtudy an unconſtancy equal to that of <hi>Proteus,</hi> and put on as many Countenances as they have different Inclinations.</p>
            <p>The Eighth ſaid, That ſince a good thing is ſo much the more excellent, the more it is communicated and diffus'd ſeveral ways, Friendſhip ought to derive its eſteem from that communication, which the greater it ſhall be, the more recommendable ſhall it make the Friendſhip, which, conſequently, is the more perfect
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:66371:233"/>
among many, to whom it is always advantageous, ſince it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the three kinds of Goods, the profitable, the pleaſant, and the vertuous. For, is there not much to be gain'd in a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which the more numerous it is, the greater advantages and aſſiſtances may be deriv'd from it? There is not any thing ſo highly delightful as to love and to be belov'd of many. But whereas Friendſhip is the Livery of Vertue, whoſe inſeparable attendant ſhe is, Can there be any thing more vertuous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable then after that manner to love ſeveral others who love us, and by that reflux of mutual kindneſs give aſſurances of our Vertue, anſwerable to the acknowledgements we had made of their merit; the multitude of Friends not abating any thing of the eſteem of civil Friendſhip, no more than the great number of charitable perſons does prejudice Charity which is a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Love, and equally embraces all?</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXVII. Of Oracles.</head>
            <p>THere is not anything diſquiets the Spirit of Man ſo much as the deſire he hath to know things to come; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he cannot of himſelf attain thereto, by reaſon of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his knowledge, which he derives from, the Senſes and other corporeal powers; he will needs try what he can do out of himſelf, and there is no place into which his curioſity hath not found a way to diſcover what he ſo much deſir'd. But in fine, after he had to no purpoſe ſought this knowledge in the Elements and all Natural Bodies conſiſting of them, ſuperſtitious Antiquity be thought it ſelf of another way to gain it, which was to addreſs it ſelf to thoſe counterfeit Divinities, whom the Holy Scriptures aſſures us have been no other than Devils, whom it elſewhere calls the Gods of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For theſe, after they had, by ſin, loſt the gift of Grace, having conſerv'd that of a moſt perfect Science, and ſo general, that there is not any thing in all Nature which they know not, and cannot foretell (excepting only ſuch effects as are purely free, which are known only to God) thoſe ancient Idolaters have oftentimes been inform'd by them of things to come, conſulting them to that purpoſe, when they were upon the undertaking of ſome Affair of great importance, the ſucceſs whereof was doubtful, reſolving upon the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, according to the Anſwers of thoſe falſe Gods called Oracles, in regard they were pronounc'd either by their mouths, or thoſe of their Miniſters. The manner of declaring them was two-fold; one, by Dreams, or Nocturnal-Viſions; the other, by an expreſs Voice, which was diſtinctly heard by thoſe who came to conſult them. The Oracles, which were deliver'd in
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:66371:233"/>
Dreams, though they were not ſo clear as thoſe receiv'd by the Voice, were nevertheleſs conſiderable proportionably to the eſteem made of the perſons who were the Interpreters of them, and the places where they were deliver'd. That of <hi>Amphiara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was the moſt remarkable of any; in which, after the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med expiations, thoſe who came to conſult him, laid themſelves down on the ground upon the skins of ſuch Rams as had been ſacrific'd to the Gods, whoſe names were written upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and were in that poſture inſtructed in what they deſired to know. The ſame Ceremonies were heretofore uſed among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the Temples of <hi>Serapis</hi> and <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> where thoſe mute Divinities return'd their Anſwers only to ſuch as were aſleep, who conſulted them principally for the cure of their Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond way, which was by expreſs voice, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perform'd by the whiſpering-places of certain Grots; or by the mouths of ſuch Statues as were dedicated to the ſaid Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which Statues, for that reaſon, had their mouths always open, and ready to ſpeak;, or by the mouths of the Prieſts and Sibylls, who being ſeiz'd by a ſacred fury pronounced the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles with a certain impetuouſneſs of voice, and violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſions of the countenance, not unlike thoſe of diſtracted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among us; or laſtly, by the mouths even of brute beaſts, which the ſtupidity of thoſe poor blinded people alſo made uſe of to that end. Thus the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> worſhipped and conſulted an Ox, under which figure they repreſented their God <hi>Apis,</hi> whoſe Oracles were accounted favourable, when he chearfully receiv'd the fodder preſented to him, but it ſignify'd the contrary, when he refuſed to open his mouth to receive it; and this was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted a preſignification of the death of <hi>Germanicus.</hi> The <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedians</hi> obſerved the ſame Ceremonies towards a Cow, big with Calf; the <hi>Nubians,</hi> a people of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the ſame towards a Dog, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> towards a Cock, the different accents of whoſe crowing diſtinguiſh'd their Oracles. Among theſe, the Oracles which ſome went to hear in the vaſt deſerts beyond the Country of the <hi>Garamantes,</hi> at the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> though they were the moſt venerable of any, as being the moſt ancient, were nevertheleſs as ridiculous as any of the reſt, being grounded only on a ſimple motion of the body, a bowing of the head, a wink with the eye, which thoſe that were preſent imagin'd they had obſerved in the Statue of that Controller of the Gods, ador'd in that deſolate place, with the head and horns of a Hee-goat. He was a little more familiar in the City of <hi>Dodona</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus,</hi> where he had alſo a very magnificent Temple, taking the pains to pronounce his Oracles ſometimes with his own divine mouth, and ſometimes uſing thoſe of two Virgins, whereof one, called <hi>Periſtera,</hi> which ſignifies a Dove, gave occaſion to the Fable, wherein it was reported, that, in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> at <hi>Dodona,</hi> there were Doves that ſpoke, as well as Oaks, which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:66371:234"/>
anſwer'd the queſtions that had been put to them. The manner thus; thoſe high Trees being ſhaken by the ordinary Winds of thoſe Countries made a great noiſe there, which was encreas'd by that of a great number of Braſs-kettles faſten'd to the branches of them, amidſt the ſound whereof thoſe Oracles were deliver'd, that they might be receiv'd with greater reverence. But whereas the Art of Divination was by a ſpecial priviledge reſerv'd to <hi>Apollo</hi> among all thoſe Gods, his Oracles were accordingly look'd upon as the moſt certain. Thence it alſo came, that he was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, upon that account, in ſeveral parts of the World, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Iſland of <hi>Delos,</hi> one of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> the place of his Birth, where there was an Altar built of horns taken from the right ſide of the heads of ſeveral Animals, neatly laid one upon the other with incomparable dexterity; the horns of the left ſide being not it ſeems ſo proper for Divination. He there return'd his Anſwers under a humane ſhape, as in <hi>Lycia</hi> he did it under that of a Wolf: But in his Temple at <hi>Delphi,</hi> a place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for its ſcituation, as being in the midſt of the World, whence it was conceiv'd to be as it were the navel of it, he made his Anſwers ſometimes through the throat of a Dragon, under which form he was there honoured, ſometimes by the mouths of his Prieſteſſes, who, after they had been ſhaken for a certain time by a violent wind, which iſſu'd out of a deep and obſcure cave, whereby they felt themſelves animated and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated into a more then natural motion, pronounc'd their Oracles, ſometimes in Proſe, ſometimes in Verſe, according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of that Divinity whereby they were inſpir'd. But to render theſe yet more Majeſtick, thoſe Prieſteſſes affected certain preciſe days, as for example thoſe of the Calends and Ides, and requir'd certain particular diſpoſitions, that they might the more inſolently impoſe upon the more credulous: And theſe conſiſted in certain expiations and preparations, in order to their being more worthily ſuſceptible of that divine inſpiration, which the <hi>Pythian</hi> Prieſteſs pretended her ſelf fit to entertain, after ſhe had drunk of the Water of the fountain of <hi>Delos</hi>; as another, who ſerv'd the ſame God at <hi>Colophon,</hi> imagin'd her ſelf worthy of it, when ſhe had drunk of a neighbouring Spring, the Water whereof put her into an immediate fury. At <hi>Argos</hi> there was a neceſſity of drinking the blood of a Lamb, and at <hi>Aegira,</hi> that of a Bull, ere the Oracles could be gotten out of them. But what moſt diſcovers their vanity, is, that even thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted them (which they did only to comply with the weakneſs of the people, and gain reputation among the ſimple) if they found them not favourable, either went on nevertheleſs in the proſecution of their deſigns, or forc'd them to pronounce ſuch as ſhould be to their advantage. This courſe was taken by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great and <hi>Cleomenes</hi>; by the former, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the <hi>Pythian</hi>; by the other, when he conſulted the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle, both which they forc'd to ſay what they pleas'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:66371:234"/>
Thence it came, that moſt of the ancient Philſophers exclaim'd againſt them, and the Platoniſts, who made a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of them then any of the other Sects, acknowledge, that they are no other then the moſt deſpicable Devils, and thoſe of the loweſt rank, who engage themſelves in that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which they muſt needs practiſe in deſert and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful places, to the end there might be fewer witneſſes of their weakneſs and impoſtures. Theſe are apparent in their very Anſwers, which, if not falſe, were ſo ambiguous, or at leaſt ſo obſcure, that many times there needed another Oracle to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them. Nor were they in vogue, but during the darkneſs of Paganiſm, which being diſpell'd by the light of the Goſpel, thoſe Oracles never durſt appear in that glorious day, which would have diſcover'd their lying and falſhood.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the Art of Divination being conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and grounded on experience, as well as ſeveral others of that nature, it is not to be admir'd, that the Anſwers of thoſe who heretofore made profeſſion thereof were not always true: and therefore it is as irrational a procedure to draw any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thence to its prejudice, as to infer, that the Precepts of Medicine are falſe, becauſe the Phyſician does not always make his Prognoſticks aright. The General of an Army may ſometimes proceed upon wrong grounds; and the expert Pilot may run upon thoſe ſhelves and rocks which he moſt endeavours to avoid. True it is that the ſubtilty of the Devil, and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs of Mankind have foiſted abundance of abuſes into the buſineſs of Oracles, eſpecially in the erecting of thoſe Statues to thoſe fabulous Divinities, which they commonly made of Olive-tree, Lawrel, Vine, Cedar, or ſome ſuch kind of wood, full of unctuous moiſture, which they ſaid were the tears or ſweat of their falſe Gods; as alſo in the pompous Ceremonies, wherewith they amuſed the credulous Vulgar. Such were thoſe of <hi>Tropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> among the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who anſwer'd only thoſe who being clad in white deſcended through a hole of the cave into his Temple, and there offered cakes to the Spirits which inhabited it; after which they were convey'd out at another place of the cave, where they drunk the Water of the Fountain of Memory, which caus'd them to remember whatever they had heard; as they had drunk that of <hi>Lethe</hi> before they had entred into it, which had caus'd them to forget all affairs of the World. But we are not hence to conclude, that all Oracles were falſe, nor doubt of the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of that ſublime Art, upon its being diſparag'd by thoſe who have profeſs'd it, ſince it hath its grounds, not only in the inclination of mens minds, who having an extraordinary earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to know things to come, there muſt needs be ſome Science for the attaining of that Knowledge; otherwiſe Nature, who had imprinted that deſire in him, ſhould, contrary to her cuſtom, have done ſomething in vain; but alſo in the diſpoſitions of that Temperament which is ſubject to Melancholy, or black
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:66371:235"/>
Choler. For, the former of theſe is the Temperament of the more ingenious ſort of people, according to the Philſopher in his Problems; and the other, being more reſplendent, is that of perſons enclin'd to Divination, occaſion'd by the clear repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Species in that humour, which being bright and ſmooth as a Mirrour, cannot ſo well be diſcover'd by thoſe who are not of that Conſtitution; to which <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Memnon</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the cauſe of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Prieſteſſe's pronouncing the Oracles in Hexameter Verſe, though ſhe had never learnt Poeſie; and <hi>Pompanatius</hi> in his Books of Enchantments, affirms, that it caus'd a Woman, who never was out of <hi>Mantua,</hi> where ſhe was born, to ſpeak ſeveral ſtrange Languages.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That Divination being above the reach of our Underſtanding, as much as this latter is below the Divinity, which hath reſerv'd to it ſelf the priviledge of a diſtinct knowledge of things to come, it is to no purpoſe to ſeek for the true cauſes of it in our ſelves, but we are to find them in the Heavens, whence, if we may believe the Profeſſors of Aſtrology, that quality of Divination or Prediction is communicated to Men by the interpoſition of the Intelligences, whereby thoſe vaſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are moved, and that Science taught, by making it appear how great a correſpondence there is between the effects of the ſublunary Bodies, and the ſuperior cauſes on which they depend, and wherein they are potentially comprehended, even before they are actually exiſtent. Whereto if you add the concourſe of the Univerſal Spirit, which equally animates the whole world, and the parts whereof it conſiſts, and which meeting with convenient diſpoſitions in the minds of men, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places where Oracles have been given, inſpir'd thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary motions, which have rais'd the Spirit of man, and open'd its way into effects the moſt at a diſtance from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Admitting, I ſay, ſuch a concourſe, there may ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon be given of theſe Predictions, not only of things, whoſe cauſes being natural and neceſſary, their effects are infallible, ſuch as are Eclipſes, the Riſing, Setting, and Regular Motions of the Planets; or of thoſe whoſe cauſes are only probable, as it is reported that <hi>Pherecydes</hi> foretold a dreadful Earth-quake, by the boyling up of the water in his own Well; and <hi>Thales</hi> foreſaw the ſcarcity of Olives in the Territories of <hi>Athens:</hi> But alſo of effects, which having only contingent or free cauſes, lie not ſo obvious to diſcovery; and yet theſe being denoted by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, ſuch as are the Heavens and the Univerſal Spirit, thoſe perſons who have clear-ſighted and illuminated Souls may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them therein, even before they happen.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That there are three general cauſes of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, one <hi>Supernatural</hi>; another, <hi>Artificial</hi>; and the third, <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>; and that, not to ſpeak any thing of the Supernatural, whereof the Devils were the Authors, and made uſe of it to continue ſtill in their firſt Rebellion, when they attempted to
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:66371:235"/>
aſcend into the Throne of God, and be like him; nor yet of their Artificial Cauſe, which was certain perſons devoted to their worſhip, who retiring into Caves and Subterraneous places, were incited by thoſe evil Spirits to that ſordid Miniſtry, that ſo by that means they might lay ſnares for the ſimple, who were eaſily drawn away by theſe falſe Lights. The Natural Cauſe of thoſe Oracles, eſpecially ſuch as were pronounc'd out of the celebrated Caves and Grots of Antiquity, was a ſubtile Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rais'd out of thoſe places, which, faſtening on the Spirits of the Prophet or Propheteſs already diſpos'd to receive that impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had the ſame Influence on them as the fumes of Wine have on thoſe who drink it to exceſs; whether that evaporation be caus'd by the quality of the Earth or Waters, or proceed from the Metals, Minerals, and other Foſſile Bodies, contained within their entrails. For if it be acknowledg'd, that the waters paſſing through them, derive certain particular qualities, Why may not as well thoſe vapours do the like, nay, haply in a greater meaſure, and, conſequently, work thoſe extraordinary effects? Nay, upon conſideration, they will not be found more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than what is related of an Exhalation which iſſues out of a Cave near <hi>Hieropolis,</hi> which, as it is affirm'd, is fatal only to Men, and not to thoſe who have not loſt their Virginity; nor yet than the water of a Fountain in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> which cauſes Mares to run mad, as that which was in the Temple of <hi>Bacchus</hi> at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dros,</hi> had the taſte of Wine; that of <hi>Delphi</hi> lighted thoſe Torches which were within a certain diſtance of it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd thoſe which were thruſt into it. Now ſuch qualities as theſe are, depending on the properties of the places; it may be as eaſily conceiv'd, that thoſe, where ſuch Anſwers of the falſe Gods were given, had the like: and thence it is to be imagin'd, that thoſe having ceas'd by the ordinary viciſſitude of all things, the ſaid Oracles accordingly receiv'd alſo their period.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXVIII. Of the Tingling of the Ears.</head>
            <p>AS the Ear is the Inſtrument of that Senſe which is called the Senſe of the Diſciple, and is more ſerviceable to us in order to Inſtruction, than all the reſt put together; ſo is it not to be wondred, the Ancients ſhould be of Opinion, that it contributed ſo highly thereto, that the moſt inconſiderable motions of it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe us of things which ſeem to be fartheſt from our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Thence it came that they deduc'd certain conjectures of things to come from the tingling of the Ears, which they held to ſignifie good luck when it was on the right ſide; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when it happen'd on the left Ear: which is to repreſent
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:66371:236"/>
enemies, as the former does friends; yet with this proviſion, that nothing contributed thereto from without, as for example, noiſe might do, or ſome other agitation of the air, ſtirr'd by ſome external cauſe, but the tingling muſt proceed from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; <hi>ſonitu ſuopte tinniunt aures,</hi> without which condition it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies neither good nor bad luck, that is, nothing at all. And what ſeems ſomewhat to confirm this obſervation, is, that it hath not been caſt out among all the other rubbiſh of ſuperſtitious Antiquity, but reigns even in the preſent Age, wherein not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many among the Vulgar commonly ſay, that they are well or ill-ſpoken of, when their ears glow or tingle, but alſo ſome of the better ſort are alſo of the ſame perſwaſion. They ground this belief on the Sympathy or Antipathy there is between Friends and Enemies, which are ſuch, that not being confin'd by the diſtance of places, which yet according to their opinion ought not to be too great, they force the ſpecies of voice and words towards the organs of Hearing, which are thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, through the communication of thoſe Magnetick Vertues, and theſe are not leſs ſenſible then thoſe which the objects direct towards the ſame inſtruments in ordinary ſenſation; though they be more delicate and ſubtile. As the Lynx, the Eagle, and other ſharp-ſighted Animals ſee the ſpecies of viſible objects far beyond their reach who are ſhorter-ſighted; and the Birds of prey ſmell carcaſſes though they are very far from them.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That it was a little too far fetcht, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thoſe Effects to Sympathy, which being as abſtruſe as what ſome pretend to deduce from it, amounts to as much, as if one would prove one obſcure thing by another which is yet more obſcure. As therefore there is no action done beyond the limits appointed to every Agent, which comprehend the ſphere of their activity, ſo can there not be any ſuch between the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous Species, and the Hearing of him who feels this Tingling, unleſs it be within the reach of his ear; which ſince it cannot be, when, for example, we are ſpoken of in our abſence, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Hearing ſhould receive the impreſſion of the voice pronounc'd in a place at too great a diſtance to be conveyd to it, inaſmuch as it is neceſſary in all ſenſation, that, beſides the good diſpoſition of the ſenſitive Faculty and the Mean, there ſhould be a proportionate diſtance between the ſenſible object and the organ, ere it can judge well of it. So that thoſe who imagine they hear what is ſaid of them afar off upon no other reaſon then that their ears tingle, have not their Hearing more ſenſibly, but, on the contrary, worſe qualifi'd then others, through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance caus'd therein by groſs humours, which occaſion the ſame diſorder in the Ear as ſuffuſions do in the eye, when it ſees the Objects in the ſame colour and figure as the vapours or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, whereby it is clouded, though they be not effectually ſo. In like manner, the ſound or noiſe, heard by thoſe whoſe ears tingle, though it makes them conceive the ſpecies of ſuch a ſound
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:66371:236"/>
proceeding from without, is only illuſory, and caus'd by the diſorder of the ill-affected organ, but it communicates its irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity to the Imagination, when it frames to it ſelf favourable conſequences from ſuch a humming in the right Ear, and ſome misfortune from the like in the left, there being not any reaſon, by which ſo fantaſtick and chimerical an opinion can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That it is injuriouſly done to deny Man that advantage which we find by experience, that ſome, not only brute Beaſts, but alſo Plants have, to wit that of having a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious feeling of the good or evil which are to happen to them by a property beſtow'd on them by Nature for their conſervation. Thus we find Rats forſake the houſe which will ſoon after fall down; Lice take leave of one that is dying; Birds of prey come from far diſtant places to their food; the Swallow comes to give us a viſit in the Spring, and ſpends that delightful ſeaſon with us; which once paſt, ſhe goes to find out other Springs in unknown Countries. The Ox gives us notice of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhower, when, having lifted up his head very high, and breath'd withall, he immediately falls a licking his thighs; The Cat makes the ſame Prognoſtication, when ſhe combs her ſelf as it were, with her paws; The ſame thing is done by the Water-fowl called the Ducker, and the ordinary, Drake, when they ſettle their feathers with their beaks; The Frogs do the ſame by their importunate croaking; The Ants, by the extraordinary earneſtneſs they expreſs in hoarding up their corn; and the Earth-worms, when they appear above ground; Nay, the poor Trefoyl will cloſe it ſelf upon the approach of a Tempeſt, as do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo moſt Plants in foul weather; which being over, they ſpread abroad their leaves and flowers, and ſeem newly blown, as it were to congratulate the return of the Sun, as is done, among others, by the Marigold, which for that reaſon is called <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropium</hi>; for the great correſpondence there is between it and that all-enlivening Star. Nay, that correſpondence is alſo ſo remarkably obvious in the other Plants, that thoſe who have obſerv'd them moſt exactly, affirm, that there is not any herb ſo deſpicable, but it hath an interiour character, anſwerable to that of ſome Star, which communicates its vertues and qualities to it, and thence it comes to be called a terreſtrial Star. Why therefore ſhould it come into diſpute, whether Man hath ſuch a Priviledge, as that he may be ſenſible of what is prejudicial or advantageous to him, by that tingling of the Ear, which may well be the ſign thereof though the cauſe be not abſolutely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt? For, experience it ſelf and the effects conſequent to the obſervation do very much confirm it, for thoſe being commonly anſwerable to what had been conceiv'd by thoſe to whom that kind of Divination by the Ears had happened, there is as much ground to give it ſome credit, as there is to deduce any thing from ſome other leſs conſiderable accidents, from which the like
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:66371:237"/>
conjectures are made; ſuch as are, for example, among others, the twinkling of the Eyes, ſneezing, the meeting of ſomething extraordinary, eſpecially a Negro, an Eunuch, or ſome other defective perſon; and the ſtriking of ones feet againſt the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old of his own door, which prov'd fatal to <hi>C. Gracchus,</hi> who was murther'd the very day that ſuch an accident had happened to him; as alſo to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> the day he was defeated by the <hi>Parthians.</hi> In all which ſigns there is much leſs likelihood of declaring the accidents, which ſome would attribute thereto, than may be imagin'd in the Tingling of the Ear, as being the ſeat of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which the Ancients for that reaſon were wont to ſtir up, by plucking the tip of it; and if it be true what <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that all our Knowledge is but Reminiſcence, and that we only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Species of things, which had been before in our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it will be no hard matter to find out ſome ground for this praeſenſion.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That there was no other conjecture to be drawn from this Tingling of the Ear, than that the Perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereto, hath a weak and ill-diſpos'd Brain, which breeding abundance of ill humours, if they come to make any ſtoppage in the paſſages of the Ear, its action is vitiated and obſtructed by that Tingling, which is a ſymptom of a deprav'd Hearing, and cauſes the party to hear an importunate ſound or noiſe, though there be not any made without, and that there be not any application of the hollowneſs of the hand to the Ear, in which caſe it hears ſome ſuch noiſe. 'Twould therefore be ridiculous to look after any other cauſes thereof than what may be in the diſpoſition of the Brain, and the excrements it produceth, on the diverſity whereof as alſo on that of their Motion in the Ears, that Tingling depends; as do alſo the Breathing, the Ringing, the Buzzing, and the Swimming of the Ear, which are Symptoms of a deprav'd Hearing; the breathing or blowing being done by a little blaſt which gets out gently; the Tingling by the interruption of its motion; the ringing proceeds from a more groſs vapour, and ſuch as blows more ſtrongly; as the reſounding does from an impulſion yet more vehement; and laſtly, the Swimming is caus'd by the agitation of theſe as well vaporous as ſpirituous matters, which being different and differently moved, produce thoſe different ſounds. And therefore it is abſurd, to derive any other marks of what ſhould happen to us, then thoſe laid down in Medicine, which teaches us, that they who are ſubject to theſe frequent tinglings and ringings of the Ears are in their way to Deafneſs, by reaſon of the danger there is, that theſe vaporous humours ſhould make ſo ſtrong an obſtruction in the organs of Hearing, that the auditory air cannot get into it, to make ſenſation: and if this happen in a burning Feaver, together with dimneſs of the eyes, it is a certain preſage of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction or madneſs, which ordinarily follows that noiſe of the Ear.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXIX. Of Philtres, and whether there be any proper Remedies for the procuring of Love.</head>
            <p>THere is not any thing ſo pleaſant and delightful as to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd; To procure that, it is requiſite there ſhould be ſome perfection, which being conceiv'd ſuch by the perſon whoſe favour is courted, it prevails ſo far upon his Inclinations, that he cannot forbear being in Love with it. Thus is it that a known Truth doth ſo fully ſatisfie our Underſtanding, that it cannot deny its conſent thereto: Thus is the Will ſo ſtrongly engag'd upon the purſuance of a Good which ſeems delightful to her, that it is hardly in her power to gain-ſay it; nay, ſhe is of her ſelf inclin'd thereto, not needing any other Charms to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her thereto, than thoſe ſhe meets with in the goodneſs of the Object which ſhe loves. Theſe are real Philtres which never fail to raiſe Love in thoſe that have them; there is no neceſſity of looking after other Remedies, all which are us'd either to a bad end, or to none at all. <hi>Deianira,</hi> deſirous to make uſe of them, in order to her being better belov'd by her Huſband <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> prov'd the occaſion of his death, by the means of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhe ſent him dy'd with the Blood of the Centaur <hi>Neſſus.</hi> Another Woman, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms in his greater work of Ethicks, brought her Huſband to the ſame Fate, after ſhe had made him take a Medicine of that kind. <hi>Lucilia</hi> adminiſtring ſuch a Philtre to the Poët <hi>Lucretius</hi> her Huſband, put him into ſuch a diſtraction that he kill'd himſelf. The like was done by the Emperour <hi>Lucilius,</hi> after he had taken ſuch a one from the hands of <hi>Calliſthenes</hi>; as alſo by <hi>Caligula,</hi> after he had drunk off one of theſe potions into which there had been put a piece of that fleſh which is found on the fore-heads of young Colts as ſoon as they are caſt, called in Latine <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> an ingredient par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly recommended among theſe Medicaments. In which Receipts, we find alſo the brains of Cows when they would go to Bull, and thoſe of young Aſſes, the bones of a green Frog, the little Fiſh called the <hi>Remora,</hi> the Matrix of the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> and the little Bird call'd <hi>Motacilla,</hi> the Wagtail, from its continual wagging of the tail, which it ſeems is ſo effectual a Remedy for the procuring of Love, that <hi>Pindar,</hi> in his fourth Ode of the <hi>Nemaea,</hi> acknowledges that his Heart was ſo ſtrongly drawn away and charm'd by the means thereof, that he could not forbear Loving. But though it were granted, that theſe Remedies had ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vertues to excite Love in thoſe to whom they had been adminiſtred, yet would it not follow thence, that they ſhould make that Love mutual, by obliging them to love thoſe by whom
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:66371:238"/>
they are belov'd. For thoſe to whom they are given common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not knowing, nay, many times having an averſion for the others, it is impoſſible that theſe Philtres ſhould be able to force People's Wills and Inclinations, which are always free to love what they know not; or if they know it, have a horrour and averſion for it. Otherwiſe it would amount to as much, as to give them a certain Sovereignty over a free power; ſuch as the Will is, which it cannot endure, as being above all Corporeal Agents, ſuch as theſe Medicaments are. Among which, as there are ſome have the vertue of extinguiſhing the flames of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence and Carnal Love, by correcting the heat of the Blood, diminiſhing the quantity of the Seed, and diſperſing the Spirits whereby it is raiſed; ſo on the contrary, there are others, which as it were awake and excite that Paſſion, by the production they make of abundance of good and ſpirituous ſeed, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, may indeed invite thoſe who uſe them, to that baſe and unbridled Love, but not to a mutual Love, ſuch as is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly directed to him, who finding his affection ſleighted, is forc'd to give theſe Remedies that he may be belov'd by the perſon whom he courts.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That Love and the Graces, if we may credit thoſe Authentick Authors the Poets, always kept company with <hi>Venus,</hi> whereby they would ſignifie to us, that the moſt effectual means which any one can uſe to inſinuate himſelf into the Love of another, was, to become himſelf amiable and agreeable; and that thoſe who pretend to do it by other wayes, do many times come ſhort of their intentions; or if they at laſt come to be lov'd, it is by ſuch a perverſion of the party's imagination whom they court, that, inſtead of framing a rational and well-regulated Paſſion, they raiſe therein that fury and rage, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians call <hi>Erotomania.</hi> Thence it comes that to accompliſh their deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res, beſides ſuch means as are natural, they alſo make uſe of all the diabolical Artifices and Inventions that Magick can furniſh them withall, to compaſs that piece of Witchcraft. To that purpoſe, they make uſe of Mandrakes, wherewith the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men prepare a certain Drink for the men, adminiſtring the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male to procure themſelves to be lov'd by them; and the men cauſe them to take the male, that they may belov'd by the women They aſſign the ſame properties to the Herb <hi>Calamint,</hi> affirming, that it gains the Heart, and raiſes it into ſuch a heat, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to love him who gives it, and the ſame thing is ſaid of ſeveral other odoriferous Herbs, which ſeem to have a ſtricter connexion with the effect they promiſe themſelves from them, than an infinite number of other impious and abſurd things, whereof they make an extraordinary account. As for inſtance, among others the Menſtrua of Women; the Navel-ſtring of a Child newly born, reduc'd to powder, and taken in a potion; as alſo the ſkin of ſuch a one where-with they make their Virgin-parchment, on which they write their Characters; Eggs dipp'd in the Blood of
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:66371:238"/>
a Toad; a certain bone taken out of the throat of a ſalt Bitch; the feathers of a Scrich-Owle; and eſpecially the parings of the Nails, together with the Hair of the Head, or of any other part of the Body; and for want of thoſe, ſome ſmall thread of the perſon's garment whom they would engage to love, which theſe impious Miniſters of Sathan hide under her bolſter; or if that cannot be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the threſhold of ſome door through which ſhe is to paſs, adding thereto, according to their common practiſe, certain words and figures, forg'd by the old Spirit of Lying. Nor are they content with all theſe palpable fooleries, but they muſt add thereto ſome enormous ſacriledges, by their abuſing the moſt ſacred Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning not only the Olive-Branches and hallow'd Palms, the holy Oyls, the Habits and Ornaments of Prieſts, whereof they make uſe of ſome parcels, as they do alſo of the ſcrapings of the hallowed ſtones of our Altars, but alſo the ſacred Hoſt it ſelf, on which they grave certain Marks and Characters with Blood; and having reduc'd it to powder, put it into the meats of ſuch as they would bewitch with thoſe Love-Sorceries. There are alſo others who pretend to do the ſame things by Images of Wax, made like the perſons whoſe Love is deſir'd, which they melt at a fire made of Cypreſs, or ſome rotten pieces of wood taken out of Sepulchres, imagining that by vertue of the words which they pronounce during that Ceremony, the Heart of the perſon belov'd will be ſoftned and grow more tender, the hardneſs whereof if they cannot overcome by ſimple melting, they prick the waxen figure with the points of needles, preſuming that the thing which it repreſents, will be ſenſible of the like treatment. There are others yet who content themſelves with this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that is, to burn the leavs of Lawrel, or the ſtones of Olives, uſed anciently, according to the teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Baruch,</hi> by Women, to reproach their gallants with their neglect towards them. But the famous Sorcereſs <hi>Canidia,</hi> makes it her boaſt, in <hi>Horace,</hi> that ſhe had wrought this effect with the marrow of the Bones and the Liver of a young Child, which ſhe had taken out of his Belly, after ſhe had ſtarv'd him to death buried in the ground up to the chin; promiſing her ſelf, by means of this powerful Philtre, ſo far to recover the affections of her Gallant <hi>Var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is it, that there is not any crime, how heinous ſoever, which this furious Paſſion will not inſpire into thoſe, who ſo earneſtly endeavour the ſatisfaction of it, which for that reaſon the Laws puniſh with ſo much ſeverity. Nor do they leſs condemn the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious remedies which ſome others propoſe for the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, as being ſuch as are no leſs dangerous than the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they would hinder, of which kind are theſe, to carry about one the privy parts of a Wolf, a Secret recommended by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Pompanatius</hi>; to drink of the Urine of a Hee-goat; to caſt

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXX. Of Atoms.</head>
            <p>IT is a Truth not queſtion'd by any of the Philoſophers, what Sect ſoever they were of, that there muſt be certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whereof Natural Bodies conſiſt. Their Generation and Corruption confirm it; ſince that according to the former, there being not any thing made of nothing; and according to the latter, it being not imaginable that any thing can be reduc'd to nothing, there muſt be ſome firſt Principles, from which, primarily, and of themſelves natural things do proceed, and whereto they are at laſt reſolv'd. But it hath not yet been fully decided, to what this prerogative is to be granted. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> would beſtow it on Fire; <hi>Anaximenes</hi> on the Air; <hi>Pherecydes,</hi> to the Earth; <hi>Thales,</hi> on the Water; <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> on the two latter, joyntly; <hi>Hippon,</hi> on Fire and Water; <hi>Parmenides</hi> on Fire and Earth; <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and moſt of the other Naturaliſts, on thoſe four Elements toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which yet, as ſome affirmed, could not execute the function of Principles without the aſſiſtance of other Superiours, ſuch as <hi>Heſiod</hi> maintains to be Chaos and Love; <hi>Antiphanes,</hi> Silence and Voice; the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> Light and Darkneſs; the <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> Numbers, and among others the Tetrad, which the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> affirm to be the ſource of all things; the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi> Matter, Form, and Privation; <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Parts; and <hi>Democritus,</hi> his Atoms, ſo called by reaſon of their ſmalneſs, which renders them inviſible, and incapable of being diſtinguiſh'd and divided into other leſſer Particles, though they have quantity, and are of ſo great a bulk as to be thereby diſtinguiſh'd from a Mathematical Point, which hath not any; as being defin'd to be what hath not any part, and what is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible and ſmall, that it can hardly fall under our External Senſes, but is only perceivable by reaſon. The ſame thing may alſo be ſaid of the other qualities of theſe Atoms, which <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who receiv'd them from <hi>Democritus,</hi> as he had the knowledge of them from <hi>Leucippus</hi>; and he again from one <hi>Moſchus,</hi> Phoenician, who liv'd before the Trojan Warr, made it not ſo much his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to lay them down for the firſt Cauſes and general Principles of Natural Things, as to take away the four common Elements, ſince he does not deny but that theſe are conſtitutive parts of the world, and whatever is comprehended therein. But his main work is to maintain, that they not the firſt ſeeds and immediate Principles thereof, as conſiſting themſelves of Atoms or little Bodies ſo ſubtile and ſmall, that they cannot be broken or made
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:66371:239"/>
leſs, and being the moſt ſimple and next pieces, whereof mixt bodies are made up, and whereto they are afterwards reducible by diſſolution, there is ſome reaſon to give them the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt material and ſenſible principles of natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That if theſe Atoms be allow'd to be the principles of natural bodies, theſe laſt will be abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, as being made, up of infinite principles, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incapable of falling under our knowledge, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to come to that of the mixt bodies which are to conſiſt of them. Whence it will follow, that though the Atoms ſhould be ſuch as the Philoſophers would perſwade us they are, yet would not our Underſtanding, which cannot comprehend any thing but what is finite, be ever the more ſatisfy'd, ſince it would not be able to conceive them, nor conſequently the things which ſhould be produc'd of them. Nor is it to be imagin'd that thoſe things would differ among themſelves, ſince that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſentiment, thoſe little chimerical bodies are not any way diſtinguiſh'd, but all of the like nature, and of the ſame ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That though there be not any eſſential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Atoms, yet is it certain, That they make remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diverſity in the production of things, by the properties and different qualities that are in each of them, whereof there are two kinds, <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Proper.</hi> The proper are, Largeneſs of Bulk, Figure, Motion, and Reſiſtance; the common are, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, Connexion, Situation, and Order, which are generally competible to all Atoms, as the four others are proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to them. Their bulk is not to be conſider'd as if they had any conſiderable quantity; there being no Atom, how great ſoever it may be, but is infinitely leſs then the leaſt body in the World, being for that reaſon ſo imperceptible, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the ſight to diſtinguiſh it. Yet does not that hinder but that they are bodies, and conſequently have quantity, which is a property inſeparable from bodies; as Mites, Hand-worms, and ſuch other little Animals, which by their extreme litleneſs elude our ſight, do nevertheleſs conſiſt of diverſe parts, miraculouſly diſcoverable by Magnifying-glaſſes, nay to the obſervance of Veins, Arteries, Nerves, and ſuch like obſcure parts, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thoſe which reaſon obliges us to admit, though our ſenſes cannot attain thereto. It being the property of figure to follow quantity, which it determinates and qualifies, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that if the atoms are different as to bulk, they ſhould be the ſame alſo as to figure: which being obſervable when bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are broken into great pieces, and thoſe appearing with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, angles, and points diverſly figur'd, they muſt ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome figure even after they are pounded in a mortar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall parcels and particles, though our ſenſes by reaſon of their weakneſs, are not able to comprehend it. To the ſame
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:66371:240"/>
weakneſs it is to be attributed, that we are not able to diſcern the diverſity of figures in grains of corn and other ſeeds, which ſeem to be in a manner alike, though they are not ſuch, no more than the leaves of Trees and Plants. Nay even in Drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Eggs, though in appearance there is a likeneſs ſo great, that it is come into a Proverb; yet is there ſo remarkable a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, when it is ſtrictly obſerv'd, that there were heretofore in the Iſland of <hi>Delos</hi> certain people ſo expert, that, among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eggs, they would tell which had been laid by ſuch or ſuch a Hen. The hair of our heads (a thing, to ſome would ſeem incredible) have particular figures whereby they are diſtinguiſh'd one from another. The figures of Atoms are of that rank, as are alſo thoſe of the Moats which are ſeen playing and dancing up and down in the beams of the Sun, when darted in at a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſage: for though they ſeem to be all round, yet exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd with that inſtrument which magnifies the ſpecies of things, we find in them an infinite number of other figures. In like manner is it requiſite, that the Atoms ſhould have the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of figures, that they may the more fitly concur to the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and generation of Bodies. To that end, the maintainers of this opinion affirm, that ſome are round, ſome oval, ſome oblong, ſome pointed, ſome forked, ſome concave, ſome convex, ſome ſmooth and even, ſome rough and rugged, and of other ſuch like figures, as well regular as irregular, in order to the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their motions. Of theſe there are three kinds aſſigned; according to the firſt, the Atom moves downwards by its own weight; according to the ſecond, it moves upwards; and according to the third, it moves indirectly and from one ſide to another. Theſe two laſt are violent motions, but the firſt is natural to the Atom; to which <hi>Epicurus</hi> attributes a perpetual motion, which cauſing it to move inceſſantly towards the loweſt place, it ſtill makes that way of its own nature, till ſuch time as in its progreſs it hath met with other Atoms, which coming to ſtrike againſt it, if they are the ſtronger, they force it upwards, or of one ſide, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the part of it which had receiv'd the ſhock; and ſo clinging one to another, they make ſeveral mixtures, as, when they come to ſeparate after their union, they are the cauſes of the corruption of mixt bodies. And theſe bodies have ſo much the more Reſiſtance, which is the laſt property of theſe Atoms, the more denſe and ſolid theſe laſt are; as on the contrary, when they are leſs denſe and ſolid, by reaſon of the vacuity there is between their parts, the bodies conſiſting of them have ſo much the leſs vigour and force to oppoſe external injuries.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That there is not any better inſtance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the nature of Atoms can be explicated then thoſe little Motes, which move up and down the air of a Chamber, when the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams come into it at ſome little hole or cranny. For from this very inſtance, which is ſo ſenſible, it may eaſily be concluded, not only that they are bodies, which have a certain bulk and
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:66371:240"/>
quantity, how little and indiviſible ſoever it may be, but alſo that they are in continual motion, by means whereof, as thoſe little <hi>corpuſcula,</hi> or Motes, inceſſantly move and ſtrike one againſt another, and are confuſedly intermixt one among another; ſo the Atoms, by their perpetual agitation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, cauſe the mixtures and generations of all natural things. So that, all conſider'd, it is as ridiculous on the other ſide to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they are only imaginary principles, becauſe they are not ſeen, as to maintain, that thoſe little Motes are not in the air, becauſe they are not perceiv'd to be there in the abſence of the Sun-beams, which we muſt confeſs renders them viſible, but with this aſſurance, that they are nevertheleſs there, even when they are not diſcern'd to be there.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That it is certain, there are abundance of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in Nature, which are in a manner imperceptible to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and yet muſt be granted to be real bodies, and conſequently endow'd with length, breadth, profundity, ſolidity, and the other corporeal qualities. Such as theſe are, among others, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Species, which continually iſſue out of the Objects, and are not perceiv'd by the ſenſes, but only ſo far as they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and material, eſpecially the Odours, exhaling from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bodies, which after their departure thence, in proceſs of time, decay and wither. Of this we have inſtance in Apples, and other Fruits, which grow wrinkled, proportionably to their being drain'd of thoſe vaporous Atoms, (whereof they were at firſt full) which evaporate in a leſſer or greater ſpace of time, the more cloſely thoſe little bodies ſtick one to another, or the more weakly they are joyned together. Nay, the intentional Species, how ſublimated ſoever they be, by the defaecation made by the agent Intellect, are nevertheleſs bodies, as are alſo the Animal Spirits, which are charged therewith, and the vital and natural, whereby the former are cheriſh'd. In like manner, Light, the beams of the Sun and of other Stars, their Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their Magnetick Vertues, and other ſuch Qualities, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in an infinite number of things, between which there is a mutual inclination and correſpondence, or antipathy, cannot be imagin'd to act otherwiſe then by the emiſſion of certain little bodies; which being ſo ſmall and ſubtile that they are incapable of further diviſion, may with good reaſon be called the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and material Principles of all Bodies, ſince there is not any one but conſiſts of them.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That the concourſe of theſe Atoms being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, if we may credit <hi>Epicurus,</hi> we cannot attribute thereto the cauſes of the generations happening in this World; inaſmuch as an accidental cauſe not being able to produce a regular effect, ſuch as is that of Nature in Generation, it is ridiculous to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it rather to theſe Atoms, than to ſome other cauſe, which is ſuch <hi>per ſe,</hi> and always regular in its operations, ſuch as
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:66371:241"/>
is Nature her ſelf. But what further diſcovers the abſurdity of that opinion is this, that it thinks it not enough to refer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the other effects, which are obſerv'd in all natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to that of the Atoms, whereof they conſiſt; but pretends alſo by their means, to give an account of that of our Spirits, which thoſe Philoſophers would repreſent unto us made of thoſe orbicular atoms, and accordingly eaſily mov'd by reaſon of that round figure, and that thoſe in whom it is moſt exact, are the moſt ingenious and inventive perſons, as others are dull and blockiſh, becauſe their Spirits have a leſſer portion of thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Atoms. But this ſpeculation may be ranked among pure chimaera's, ſince that the functions of our Underſtanding, being abſolutely ſpiritual and immaterial, have no dependence on the different conſtitutions of thoſe little imaginary bodies; nay though there were any correſpondence between them and the actions of our minds, their round figure would not be ſo much the cauſe of our vivacity, as might be the pointed or forked; as being more likely to penetrate into, and comprehend the moſt difficult things than the circular, which would only paſs over them, without any fixt faſtning on them.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXI. Whether the <hi>King's Evil</hi> may be cur'd by the touching of a Seventh Son, and why?</head>
            <p>THough this noiſom Diſeaſe ſometime faſtens on ſeveral parts of the body, yet is there not any more ſenſible of its malice than the neck, which by reaſon of its being full of glandules, is extreamly troubled therewith, which happens as well by reaſon of their thin and ſpongy conſtitution, as their nearneſs to the brain, from which they receive the phlegmatick and excrementitious humours, more conveniently, than any of the other parts can be imagin'd to do, which are at a greater diſtance from it. And yet theſe laſt, notwithſtanding that diſtance, are extremely troubled therewith, nay ſometimes to ſuch exceſs, that, if we may credit <hi>Johannes Langius</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Medicinal Epiſtles,</hi> a Woman at <hi>Florence</hi> had the Evil in one of her Thighs, which being got out weigh'd ſixty pound; and a Goldſmith of <hi>Amberg</hi> had another of the ſame bigneſs in a manner, neer his Knee. And what is much to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, is, that though the Evil ſeems to be only external, yet is it commonly preceded by the like ſwellings, which ly hid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and whereof thoſe without are only the marks: which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is confirm'd by the diſſections made of thoſe who are troubled with it, in whoſe bodies, after their death, there are
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:66371:241"/>
abundance of theſe Evils, whereof the Glandules of the <hi>Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium</hi> and the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> which is the moſt conſiderable of any about Man's Body, are full, and which are commonly produc'd by Phlegm, the coldneſs and viſcoſity whereof do indeed contribute to their rebellion; but it is very much augmented by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and common Cauſes, ſuch as are Air, Aliment, and Waters infected with ſome malignant qualities, which render it Endemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and peculiar to certain Nations; as for inſtance, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, eſpecially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are more infected with this foul diſeaſe than any others, which is alſo communicated by ſucceſſion, as moſt of the other diſeaſes, which become hereditary by means of the Spirits, employ'd by the Formative Faculty in Generation, and carrying along with them the Character of the parts and humours of him who engenders, and imprinting them on the <hi>foetus.</hi> Hence it comes that for the curing of it, there is more requir'd than to adminiſter the remedies commonly us'd in the cure of other tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which muſt be diſſolv'd or ſoftened, that ſo they may be brought to ſuppuration, unleſs they can be conſum'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated; but in this there muſt be ſome particular means uſed. And, not to mention that which is generally known to all, to wit, the touching of thoſe who have this Evil by the King of <hi>France,</hi> and his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whom they heal by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous vertue, and a ſpecial priviledge granted thoſe two great Monarchs by God himſelf; it is commonly affirmed, that the ſeventh Male-child, without any interruption of Females, hath the ſame advantage of healing this diſeaſe, by a favour which Theology calls <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> and whereof many affirm, that they have ſeen the effects. Theſe are attributed to the vertue of the Number <hi>Seven,</hi> ſo highly eſteem'd by the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the firſt odd Number, and the firſt even and ſquare num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which are <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>Four,</hi> and are by them called the Male and Female, whereof they make ſuch account, that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of theſe Philoſophers, the Soul of the world was made up of thoſe two Numbers; and it is by their means that whatever is comprehended in it ſubſiſts. It is alſo for this Reaſon, that Children born in the ſeventh month, live as thoſe born in the ninth; whereas ſuch as are born in the eighth die. To this may be added, That the moſt conſiderable Changes of Man's Life happen in theſe ſeveral Septenaries, which number does not only contribute to his Conception, which is not perfect till the ſeventh day, after the Matter hath receiv'd the Virile Sperme, and to his Birth in the ſeventh month; but alſo to all the other accidents which happen to him in all the ſeveral Septe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. For the Child begins to have ſome appearance of Teeth in the ſeventh month; at twice ſeven months he makes a ſhift to ſtand alone; at three times ſeven his Tongue is ſo far loos'd, that he ſpeaks with ſome Articulation; at four times ſeven he goes ſteadily and confidently; at the age of ſeven years he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:66371:242"/>
new forces, and renews his Teeth; at twice ſeven he is of ripe age, and capable of engendring; at three times ſeven he gives over growing, but becomes ſtill more and more vigorous, till he hath attain'd to ſeven times ſeven, that is, to the forty and ninth year of his age, by ſome called the little climacterical year, as being the moſt compleat of any, in regard it conſiſts of a perfect number multiply'd by it ſelf, and in which there always happens ſome accident proceeding hence, that Nature being not able to forbear the doing of ſomething, when ſhe hath attain'd that ſovereign degree of perfection, is forc'd to decline. It is therefore to be attributed to this compleat number, (which is called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> by a term which ſignifies Venerable) that the ſeventh Son cures the Evil, the cauſe whereof being malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and, indeed, having ſomething in it that is obſcure, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls Divine; it is not to be admired, that the curing of it ſhould depend on a Cauſe equally obſcure, and at ſo great a diſtance from our knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That without having any recourſe to ſo abſtracted a Cauſe, as that of the vertue of the number Seven, which, being a diſcrete quantity, is incapable of action, which is reſerv'd to ſuch qualities only as are active; Nor yet to the Stars, which are at a greater diſtance from us; Nor yet to the force of the Imagination, which many think may produce that effect: Waving all recourſe to theſe, I am of Opinion, that it is rather to be referr'd to the Formative Faculty, which producing a Male when the Seeds of the Parents are ſo diſpos'd, as that what is more vigorous and ſtrong hath a predominancy over the other which is leſs ſuch, that is, when it continues ſtill in the getting of a Male without any interruption to the ſeventh time, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is, that theſe Seeds are ſtill ſo ſtrong and ſpirituous, that a Male is gotten inſtead of a Female, which is the production of thoſe Seeds that are weaker and colder than the Maſculine. Now the heat and ſpirits whereby Males are procreated, may communicate to them ſome particular vertue, ſuch as may be the Gift of healing the Evil; which may be affirm'd with as good ground, as that the ſpittle of a Man faſting being well-temper'd, kills Serpents; and that it is held, many have heretofore had ſuch a prerogative for the healing of certain diſeaſes, by ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular qualities, depending either on thoſe of their Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or of their whole ſubſtance. Thus <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms in the fourth Book of his Hiſtories, reſtor'd his ſight to a blind Man. <hi>Adrian,</hi> as <hi>Aelius Spartianus</hi> relates, healed a Man born blind only by touching him. And <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of the <hi>Epirotae,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Life, heal'd all that were troubled with the Spleen in his time, by touching their Spleen with the great Toe of his right Foot; of which Toe there was a far greater Opinion conceiv'd after his death, in that it was found intire, and not conſum'd by the fire, as all the reſt of his Body was. This vertue of healing thus after an extraordinary manner,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:66371:242"/>
hath been deriv'd into ſome whole Families. There are to this day many in <hi>France,</hi> who affirm themſelves to be of the Family of Saint <hi>Hubert,</hi> and have the gift of healing ſuch as are bitten by mad Dogs. In <hi>Italy</hi> there are others, who make it their boaſt that they are of the Families of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>: whereof the former are not afraid of Serpents, which, for that reaſon, they bear in their Coat; no more than theſe latter are of burning coals, which they handle without burning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In <hi>Spain</hi> alſo, the Families of the <hi>Saludatores</hi> and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalmadores,</hi> have the gift of healing many incurable diſeaſes only by the Touch. Nay, if we may rely on common Tradition, we have this further to add, that it holds for certain, that thoſe Children who come into the world on Good-Friday have the gift of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral ſorts of diſeaſes, eſpecially Tertian and Quartan Agues.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That if the gift of healing the Evil depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the vigour of the Principles of Generation, which meet in the ſeventh Male-child, it would follow that the eighth or ninth coming into the world conſecutively, ſhould more juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that priviledge; inaſmuch as the generative faculty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a greater vertue and vigour in that production of a ninth Male-child without interruption, then it might do in that of a ſeventh. Which being not found true, it were abſurd to look for the Cauſes of it in Nature, whoſe forces are not able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Effect ſo tranſcendent, and ſo much above her reach. It muſt therefore be a ſupernatural gift, which God beſtows on certain perſons, out of a pure gratuitous favour, and more for the eaſe and comfort of others, than out of any advantage to thoſe who receive it; as are alſo the gifts of Prophecy and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles. For it is a demonſtration of God's Omnipotence, not to heal diſeaſes only by ordinary means, the diſpenſation whereof he hath left to Phyſicians, who to that end make uſe of natural remedies, but to do the ſame thing without any aſſiſtance of Nature by extraordinary and ſupernatural means, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof, he ſometimes uſes the Miniſtery of Angels, as in the curing of <hi>Tobit,</hi> and thoſe ſick people who came to the Pool at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after the water had been ſtirr'd by the Angel; ſometimes by the Saints, of whom it is written, that the very ſhadow of their Bodies hath many times been effectual to that purpoſe, as was that of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>; and oftentimes thoſe of other perſons, to whom he had communicated the gift for reaſons unknown to us; as he granted that of Divination to the Sibyls, though they liv'd in Idolatry.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That Man was, potentially, all things; and that conſiſting of a Body exactly temperate, and of ſuch a Soul as is the moſt perfect of forms, he comprehended in an eminent degree within himſelf all the vertues of things as well corporeal as animate. Whence comes it then, that he ſhall not have the vertues and properties which are obſervable not only in ſtones,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:66371:243"/>
wherewith he participates Being, but alſo in Plants which are capable of Vegetation as well as he; Animals, with whom he hath motion, ſenſe, and life; and laſtly, in the ſeparated Spirits, as having, anſwerably to them, certain powers that are ſpiritual and remov'd from materiality? And ſo, ſince the Vertue of healing Diſeaſes is found in moſt Beings, which are of ſome nature with Man, it is but reaſonable he alſo ſhould have the ſame one, ſuch as is the gift of healing the Evil, which happens principally in the Seventh Male-child, by reaſon of the perfection of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which performs all the moſt compleat functions in that number, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> upon that occaſion affirms to be the diſpenſer of life. Nay if there have been ſome who have had the Vertue of communicating ſeveral Diſeaſes, by their ſight and touching, as it is related of the <hi>Pſylli, Tribales, Illyrians,</hi> and other Nations, who bewitch'd thoſe whom they touch'd; and of him, whom <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> makes mention of in the life of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius,</hi> who kill'd with his very aſpect, as the Baſiliſk does; far greater reaſon is there that there ſhould be ſome to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate health. For though this latter, requiring more prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conditions, is ſo much the more difficultly transferr'd from one Subject to another then ſickneſs is, yet the reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries will have it ſo, that if the one is, the other may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and that with the greater juſtice, inaſmuch as health, participating of the nature of good, ought to be more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative from one ſubject to another then ſickneſs.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXII. Of Conjuration.</head>
            <p>THere is as much fault to be found with the exceſſive curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of thoſe, who would know all things, as there is with the unſufferable ſtupidity of ſome others, who are not any way touch'd with that natural deſire of Knowledge: for as theſe latter, by renouncing that accompliſhment, deprive themſelves of the greateſt ſatisfaction of life; ſo the others, being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported beyond the limits preſcrib'd to the mind of Man, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they know not which way, and precipitate themſelves into the abyſſes of errours and impieties. That of the <hi>Necromancers,</hi> who make it their boaſt, that they can command out of their Tombs the Souls of the deceas'd, that they may be, by them, inform'd of what they deſire to know, is ſo much the more enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, in that they have made an Art of it, call'd by them the Black Art, or the Art of Conjuration, a name as ridiculous as the precepts whereof it conſiſts; which having no ground but what they derive from the capriccio's and fantaſtick extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe Impoſtors, they ſufficiently deſtroy themſelves; ſo
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:66371:243"/>
as there needs nothing elſe to diſcover their palpable vanity; no more then there is to make appear the errour of thoſe, who, to confirm that diabolical invention, maintain, that there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of effects above thoſe of Nature, which are to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe ſouls ſeparated from their bodies, eſpecially that of foretelling things to come, and informing thoſe thereof who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult them; it being conſider'd, that, beſides the gift they have of Science, which is common to them with all ſpirits diſengag'd from matter, they have a particular inclination of doing good to men, by advertiſing them of thoſe things which ſo much concern them. But this is not only abſurd in it ſelf, but alſo impious, and contrary to Chriſtian Faith, which teaching us that there are but three places, where theſe ſouls have their abode, to wit, Paradice, Hell, and Purgatory, it is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that thoſe which are confin'd to the laſt never come out thence, but upon a ſpecial permiſſion of God, which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grants them, that they may ſollicit the ſuffrages of the Living; thoſe of the damned are further from being in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to get out of that infernal priſon, to which Divine Juſtice hath condemn'd them, to be there eternally tormented; And the Bleſſed Spirits are yet more unlikely to quit their bliſsful State and the joys of Paradice, wherewith they are inebriated, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the vain curioſities of thoſe who invocate them, and for the moſt part make uſe of them rather to compaſs the miſchievous Sorceries and ſuch like Crimes whereof that Black Art makes profeſſion, then to procure good to any one; or if it happen that at any time they do any, 'tis in order to the doing of ſome greater miſchief afterwards, ſuch as may be that of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, whereto theſe ſpirits inclining thoſe who invocate them, and requiring of them ſuch Sacrifices and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are due only to the Deity, it is more then a preſumption, that they cannot be the ſouls of the Bleſſed, but downright De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who, transform'd into Angels of Light, impoſe upon thoſe who are ſo willing to be ſeduc'd.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That as the employments of the Devils are different, ſo is there alſo a remarkable difference in their natures, which depends principally on the places of their abode, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, if we may believe <hi>Orpheus,</hi> ſome of them are <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial</hi> or <hi>Fiery,</hi> ſome <hi>Aery,</hi> ſome <hi>Watery,</hi> and ſome <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> and <hi>Subterraneous</hi>; and among thoſe the Aerial, to whom <hi>Plato</hi> attributes the invention of Magick, are by the Students of that Art, accounted to be the moſt ingenious to deceive men, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their more eaſie putting on of the groſſer parts of the air, and their appearing under what forms they pleaſe; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it will be no hard matter for them to aſſume that of the bodies of deceas'd perſons, and, by that counterfeit appearance, to deceive the credulity of thoſe, who are perſwaded, that, by this art of Conjuration, they may be oblig'd to make a particular diſcovery of themſelves; and it is an obſervation of <hi>Ananias,</hi> in
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:66371:244"/>
the third Book of the Nature of Devils, when a dying perſon preſented his right Hand to ſome other, who thereupon joyn'd Hands with him. Nor is this any thing leſs ſuperſtitious than for the ſaid two perſons to make a mutual promiſe one to the other, that he, who ſhall die firſt of the two, ſhall appear to the ſurvivor, to give him an account what condition he is in; ſince that, in theſe Apparitions, it is always to be fear'd, that they are the Evil Spirits, whoſe main deſign is to ſeduce them that aſſume their places, and do appear inſtead of thoſe whom we think we ſee.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That he thought it not very ſtrange that the Souls of the deceas'd, having ſtill a certain remembrance of thoſe with whom they convers'd in this Life, and to whom they are ſtill oblig'd by ſome tie of affection, ſuch as was that of the Rich man in Hell towards his living Brethren, ſhould alſo have an Inclination to aſſiſt them as much as they can. It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be inferr'd, that, with the permiſſion of God, they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when they are earneſtly intreated to do it. For, not to ſpeak of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who appear'd on Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> the day of the Transfiguration; the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Onias</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to <hi>Judas Macchabaeus,</hi> as the Soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> did to <hi>Saul</hi>; to whom the Holy Scripture attributing the gift of Prophecy, that apparition was not illuſory, nor procur'd by the Devil aſſuming the ſhape of that Prophet, but certain and real, in which that Holy Man preſented himſelf, and, out of the deſire he had to bring that King, for whom he ſometime had a great affection, into the way of ſalvation, he remonſtrated to him the judgments of God, which would fall upon him, if he turned not from the evil of his wayes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That though there be nothing but confuſion among the Evil Spirits, yet is there to be imagin'd a certain Order in their Nature, and ſuch a Subordination among them, that there are Superiours and inferiours, whereof ſome have a ſovereignty over others. Thence it comes, that among the Magicians, who have unhappily ingag'd themſelves in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, thoſe who have given up their Names to a Devil of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Hierarchy, force the others to obey them, and may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ſame ſuperiority over the Spirits of a lower Claſs, as their Maſter can. It is to theſe Regent or principal Magicians, that ſome would attribute the priviledge of calling up the Souls of the dead, and, for want of them, the Evil Spirits of an inferiour Order, whom they ſhew to thoſe who conſult them; or when they cannot do that, they think it enough to procure an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Spectres and Shades, by that curſed Art of Conjuration, diſtinguiſh'd for that reaſon into <hi>Necromancy</hi> and <hi>Sciomancy,</hi> whereof the former makes the dead appear, or rather Devils, with their very Bodies, and their Clothes and other marks, which they had during their being here: The other ſhews only Phantaſmes, which have ſome reſemblance of them, yet make a
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:66371:244"/>
ſhift to anſwer their Queſtions who come to enquire of them. And whereas the whole myſtery is full of impoſtures, they omit nothing that may cauſe terrours, that ſo mens ſpirits being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd, they might give the greater credit thereto. It was the opinion of ancient Paganiſm, which firſt exercis'd this Art, that the Souls of the dead might be evocated, by pouring on the ground Wine, Milk, and Honey, and mixing it with the blood of certain Animals newly kill'd, the entrails whereof, being ſtill hot, were afterwards carried three ſeveral times about two Altars, garniſh'd with three black or blew fillets, and a Cyprus. But when they were perſwaded that thoſe Souls of the deceas'd, which they call'd <hi>Manes,</hi> were incens'd againſt them, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd them with black Victims, caſting their entrails dipp'd in Oyle, into a fire laid on their Sepulchres made of ſuch Trees as bear no fruit, gave them Incenſe, caſt Wine with the hollow of the Hand, and exercis'd ſuch Ceremonies for the moſt part ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; which alſo were commonly perform'd at mid-night, and in Caves and ſubterraneous places, there being not any thing they thought more contrary to thoſe Spirits of darkneſs, than the light of the day, and eſpecially the riſing of the Sun. Thence it proceeded, that <hi>Homer</hi> ſends his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> into obſcure places, there to conſult the Soul of <hi>Tireſias</hi>; and <hi>Virgil</hi> makes <hi>Aeneas</hi> deſcend under ground, to learn of the Sibyl what he had to do. The Poets alſo have feign'd that <hi>Orpheus</hi> deſcended into Hell, to fetch thence his Wife <hi>Eurydice</hi>; and the Hiſtory of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> tells us, that, to appeaſe the Ghoſt of <hi>Cleonica,</hi> whom he had kill'd, by miſtake, and for which act he was continually tormented in the night time, he offer'd ſome ſuch ſacrifices to it in an obſcure place call'd <hi>Heraclea,</hi> where having appear'd to him, ſhe told him, that he ſhould be deliver'd out of all his ſufferings as ſoon as he were return'd into <hi>Lacedaemonia</hi>; as accordingly he was, having been there ſtarv'd to death with hunger in the Temple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> where he had taken Sanctuary, to avoid the fury of his Fellow-citizens, by whom he was purſu'd.</p>

By this it was that <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Amphion</hi> came to be ſo powerful, as to draw brute beaſts and ſtones after them; and hereby King <hi>Solomon</hi> came to be the wiſeſt of all men; and, laſtly, by the ſtudy of this, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Tyanaeus, Pythagoras, Socrates,</hi> and the other Sages of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity acquir'd the eſteem they were in. But what adds much to the recommendation of it, is, that by its means the three <hi>Magi,</hi> or Wiſe Men in the Goſpel, who were Kings, came from the Eaſt, where this Science flouriſhed, having found out that the Star which they ſaw, being different from all the others, yet no Meteor kindled by ſome Natural Cauſe, was an extraordinary ſign which God had been pleas'd to make appear unto them, to give them notice of the Birth of his Son; there being no rational ground to imagine they were down-right Magicians, as <hi>Theophylact</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in his Commentaries upon Saint <hi>Matthew</hi>; at leaſt this is certain, that, after the adoration of our Saviour, they abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounc'd that Diabolical Magick, if it be ſuppos'd they had any tincture of it before. For as to this latter, which is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſome compact with the Devil, who thereby obliges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do tranſcendent things for him with whom he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, being a kind of Idolatry it is generally abhorr'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by all, ſince it makes uſe of pernicious means to attain its end, which is ever bad. But ſuch is not the other, whoſe end, and the means it employes to compaſs it being good and lawful, there is no doubt, but it may be lawfully uſed. Beſides, as <hi>Pſellus</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> two perſons well ſkill'd in theſe matters, have very well obſerv'd this laſt kind, call'd Natural Magick, is only an exact and perfect knowledge of the ſecrets of Nature, by means whereof, conſequently to the Obſervations which ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently-curious perſons make of the motions of the Heavens, and the influences of the Starrs, with the Sympathies and Antipathies which are almoſt in all ſublunary bodies, they apply things ſo juſtly one to another, and with ſuch an exact conſideration of time, place, manner, and proportion, that they work prodigious effects; which, the more credulous, and ſuch as are ignorant of the correſpondence there is between theſe Effects and their Cauſes, look upon as Miracles and Enchantments. Such as were thoſe of the Magicians of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who could turn their Rods into Serpents, make the Rivers of <hi>Aegypt</hi> red as blood, and fill the whole Country with Froggs, but were not able to go any further, to imitate the other Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they were forc'd to acknowledg wrought by the Finger of God. Nor
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:66371:245"/>
are the Effects of Artificial Magick leſs wonderful, not only in reſpect of its Predictions obſervable in Judiciary Aſtrology, Agriculture, Medicine, the Art of Navigation, and others, grounded upon very probable Conjectures, but alſo of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as well true as falſe, or illuſory. The true ones are grounded on the Principles of the Mathematicks, eſpecially on thoſe of the Mechanicks, which are the nobleſt and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part thereof, and on which do depend all the Water-Engines, Machins moving of themſelves, and other Inventions wherewith the Ancients wrought ſuch Effects as were accounted miraculous. Such were, that Man's Head of braſs made by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magnus,</hi> which fram'd an articulated Man's Voice, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that of <hi>Memnon</hi>; the glazen Sphere of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> the motions whereof naturally repreſented thoſe of the Celeſtial Orbes; his Burning-glaſſes, wherewith he burnt the Fleet of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who beſieg'd the City of <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> where he then was; the wooden Dove of <hi>Archytas,</hi> which flew up and down with the other Doves; as did the little Birds of <hi>Boëtius</hi> made of Copper, which had this further advantage, that they could ſing melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly; as could alſo thoſe which the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> caus'd to be made of Gold; Malleable Glaſs, and ſuch other admirable Effects of this Art, for that reaſon called by <hi>Hero, Thaumaturgica.</hi> Thoſe which it produces by illuſion and jugling, depend on ſome ſleightneſs of hand, and couſening tricks, ſuch as are us'd by the Profeſſors of Legerdemain, to delude our Senſes, and make things appear otherwiſe than they are. Such a performance was that mention'd by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in the xviii. Book of his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> uſed by that falſe Meſſias, <hi>Barchochabas,</hi> who to gain himſelf the eſteem of the true one, had the knack of vomiting flames of Fire out of his Mouth as he ſpoke, by means of a lighted piece of Towe, which he could order as occaſion ſerv'd; which trick, ſuch another Impoſtor ſhew'd more cleverly, by means of a nut-ſhell fill'd with Brimſtone and Fire. And it is a thing now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, that, by certain Artifices no way diabolical, one may make a company of people ſitting at the Table look as if they were dead, or like ſo many Tawny-Moors; nay, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the xxviii. and xxxv. Books of his Hiſtory, they may be made to look as if they had the Heads of Aſſes or Horſes.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That, according to the Doctrine of Paganiſm, re-advanc'd ſince the Light of Chriſtianity by the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and the <hi>Manichees,</hi> as there were two Gods, one called <hi>Oromazus,</hi> the Author of all good, who was the Sun; the other, <hi>Arimanes,</hi> Authour of all miſchief; ſo there were two kindes of <hi>Magick</hi> whereof one, conſiſting of an exact knowledge, and application of things in order to a good end, is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and known by the ſimple denomination of <hi>Magick,</hi> which they affirm to be an invocation of thoſe <hi>Genii,</hi> who are our Guardians and Benefactors, in order to the procuring of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:66371:246"/>
ſome good either to our ſelves or others: The other called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gania,</hi> which they exerciſed by the invocation of the bad <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Daemons,</hi> was ever condemn'd as pernicious, as having no other deſign then to do miſchief by Sorceries and Witchcraft. And though the grounds of that Doctrine are contrary to the Truth of Chriſtian Faith, yet ſince it aſſures us that there are good and bad Angels, which were the <hi>Genii</hi> of Paganiſm; there is ſome probability, that as theſe laſt incline us to Idolatry, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and other Impieties, to divert us from the worſhip of the true God, by the ſtudy of the Black Art; ſo is it the main buſineſs of the former, by a diſcovery of the Secrets of Nature, which is the White and Natural Magick, to incline us to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Author of it. In like manner, as we find, according to the Apoſtle, that, in the order which God obſerves for the good of his Church and the furtherance of our Salvation, there are divers Gifts, ſuch as are thoſe of knowledge, healing, working of miracles, prophecying, ſpeaking of ſtrange languages, and the like; all which do notwithſtanding depend on the ſame Spirit of God, who diſpenſes them according to his good pleaſure: So the Devil, who endeavours to imitate the Works of God, does the like, in the diſtribution of thoſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, which he communicates to his inſtruments, to employ them upon different occaſions, the better to accommodate himſelf to the diverſity of their inclinations, whom he would abuſe, which is his principal deſign. He furniſhes thoſe whoſe reſtleſs curioſity will needs know things to come, with Oracles and Predictions; he entertains the vain with impoſtures and illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the envious with Charms and Sorceries; the revengeful, and ſuch as are inclin'd to ſuch implacable paſſions, are ſuggeſted with all the miſchievous contrivances, which that perverſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is at all times ready to teach any who are deſirous to be his Diſciples, to whom the practice of his inſtructions prove as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as they are intended, to be to thoſe, againſt whom they are employ'd.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXIV. Of the Moles and Marks appearing in the Face.</head>
            <p>AS the Face is the higheſt part of the Body, as to ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the moſt delicate, as being the manſion of the external Senſes, which cannot act without the aſſiſtance of the Spirits, whereby that delicacy is imprinted in it; ſo does it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly lie more expos'd to as well internal as external injuries, then the other parts, which are not ſo much in ſight, nor of ſo exquiſite a complexion. And as the leaſt flaw in a Diamond, or
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:66371:246"/>
a fair Looking-glaſs is ſoon perceiv'd by ſuch as look attentively on them, ſo theſe Marks are ſo much the more obſervable in the Face, then in any other part of the body, the more ſuſceptible it is thereof, by reaſon of its clearneſs and delicacy. I may add to this a thing which would be very improbable, if we had not the aſſurance of experience for it; to wit, that there is not any mark though ever ſo little, in the face, but doth denote ſome other, which though not apparent, it is nevertheleſs eaſie for ſuch as are expert to conjecture whereabout it is, by the inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that are manifeſt. Thus if there be a mark in the midſt of the Fore-head, it ſhews that there is ſuch another in the midſt of the breaſt; but it will be towards one ſide or other of this latter, inclining towards one of the arms, if the mark in the Forehead be not exactly in the middle of it, that is, incline any thing to the right or left ſide: as it muſt be on the briſket or lower part of the breaſt, if it appear at the extremity of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head towards the root of the noſe, between which and the parts devoted to generation, there is ſuch a correſpondence, that the ſimpleſt ſort of people draw conſequences of their good or bad diſpoſition, from the length or figure of the noſe. But the more intelligent, not contenting themſelves with this conjecture, affirm, that, according to the different ſcituations of thoſe marks, there are the like correſpondent to them in thoſe parts, as well of the Man as of the Woman; for whether thoſe on the former be in the middle, on the right ſide or the left, thoſe on the other parts are exactly anſwerable to them. The ſeveral obſervations which have been made of theſe correſpondences of marks in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men we ſhall leave to the examination of the Female Phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnomiſts, ſo far as the parts before-mentioned are under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and confine our ſelves to the Men. In theſe, the mark which is apparent on the higheſt part of the noſe towards the root, as we call'd it before, where the ſpace is between both eyes, always denotes another at the bottom of the Yard, near the Teſticles; between which and the Ey-lids there is ſo great a correſpondence, that thoſe little ſpecks or warts which are many times to be ſeen on the latter, are the ſignificators of the like in the former; even with that obſervance of proportion, that if it be on the upper-lid, thoſe marks will be on that part of the Cods which is neareſt the Yard; if it be on the lower, they ſhall be on that part which is neareſt the Fundament. Moreover, from the appearance of one of theſe marks upon one of the Ey-brows, it is concluded, that there is as much on the ſhoulder on the ſame ſide, which is at a greater or leſſer diſtance from the Back-bone, the nearer to or further off the other is from the ſpace which is between both the eys. There is the like correſpondence between the Cheeks and the Thighs, for if they have a mark juſt in the middle, the thigh ſhall be marked juſt in the ſame part, and on the ſame ſide; if they be near the noſe, the thigh ſhall be marked near the groin; if they incline towards the ears, the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:66371:247"/>
correſpondent marks will be towards the buttocks. The mark appearing between the Eye and the eminent part of the Cheek, diſcovers one under the Arm-pit; that on the tip of the Ear, ſhews there ſhould be one on the upper part of the Arm. It is inferr'd alſo from the mark upon the upper lip adjoyning to the Noſe, in that ſpace which makes a ſeparation been the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, that there is another anſwerable thereto in the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> betwixt the Fundament and the Cods; and from thoſe on the Chin and the lower Lip, that there are others about the bottom of the belly. But though theſe rules are grounded on rational conjectures, yet are they not infallible, no more then thoſe of <hi>Phyſtognomy,</hi> whereof they are a part; as is alſo <hi>Metopoſcopy,</hi> which judges of the ſecret inclinations by the inſpection of the Face. The ſecond ſaid, That, as Man comprehends in himſelf an abbreviation of all the rarities of the World; ſo does his Face comprehend all thoſe of his body, whereof it is an extract. So that as the greater world is known by Man's body, which is the leſſer, it is no hard matter to make a diſcovery of this laſt by the face, which indeed is leſs as to volume, but ſo well compos'd and proportion'd, that it may well be look'd upon as the moſt accompliſh'd Maſter-piece of Nature, who in the ſtructure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath imitated Geography, which, not able to ſhew us all the inhabitable Earth, preſents us with an epitom of it in a Map; or behaves her ſelf like a Whole-ſale-Merchant, who does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all his commodities, but thinks it enough to ſhew patterns thereof, whereby a judgment may be made of their value. Thus it is that there may be a diſcovery made of the moſt ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within, by the figure and compoſition of the parts of the face, inaſmuch as thoſe of the other parts of the body depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, there is a judgment made of the one by the other, and conſequently of the actions and inclinations, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly anſwerable to the conſtitution and temperament of the parts. But it is ſomewhat hard to make this judgment by the ſimple marks of the Face, whether they proceed from Nature, as thoſe do which Children bring along with them into the World, and depend on the imagination of the Mothers, which is an external cauſe; or from ſome other Cauſes, as the heat of the entrails, the abundance of groſs and terrene humours, and the denſity of the pores of the ſkin, which, checking them in their way, makes them appear in freckles, ſpecks, and other kinds of ſpots in the face? For, theſe cauſes never being conſtant, but ſubject to much variety, according to the ſeveral occurrences which either augment or diminiſh them, it is impoſſible to make a certain judgment of a thing, which is in a continual change.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the ſaid Art of gueſſing at the marks of the moſt ſecret parts of the body by the inſpection of thoſe of the face, is ſo ancient, that the Phyſician <hi>Melampus,</hi> cited in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Odyſſ. lib. xv. deliver'd certain precepts of it, above three thouſand years ſince; and after him, <hi>Avenzoar, Septalius, Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilius,</hi>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:66371:247"/>
and ſeveral others have cultivated it, and endeavour'd to ſhew the probability of certain reaſons, which they ground principally upon the correſpondence there is between the face and its parts, and all the other parts of the whole body of Man. It conſiſts in two heads, to wit, in the proportion of greatneſs or meaſure, or in the reſemblance of colour, conſiſtency, figure, ſcituation, number, or ſuch other condition, which may be common between them. The firſt correſpondence between the face and the reſt of the body, conſiſting in greatneſs, which comprehends the three dimenſions, length, breadth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity, is ſo ſenſible, that thoſe who have exactly meaſur'd all the parts of it, have found, that the face is the ninth part of the greatneſs of the body, making the diſtributions of thoſe ſpaces ſo juſt that no one exceed another; provided that the body be well compos'd, and that there be no defect in the conformation, nor any conſiderable diſorder in the temperament of the whole, or its parts. The firſt of theſe ſpaces comprehends the face it ſelf; the ſecond is from the throat to the brisket, where the xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoidal Griſtle is; the third reaches below the Navil; the fourth paſſes by the groin to the beginning of the haunches; the fifth and ſixth comprehend the whole extent of the thigh; at the end whereof is the ſeventh, which with the eighth take up the whole ſpace from the knee to the heel, as the ninth does that of the whole foot: wherein as there are three new regions called <hi>Tharſe, Metatharſe,</hi> and the <hi>Toes,</hi> ſo are there as many in the Face. The firſt whereof, which is the manſion of wiſdom, is from the beginning of the hair to that of the noſe, where there is an interval between the Eye-brows. The ſecond, which is that of beauty, comprehends all from that <hi>interſtitium,</hi> to the end of the noſe; and the third, where the ſeat of goodneſs is, reaches to the lower part of the chin. Now theſe different intervals are in like manner obſervable in the other ſpaces, with ſo exact a proportion, that the countenance is not only anſwerable to any one of thoſe ſpaces, which, with it, make up the whole great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man's body; but there is alſo a correſpondence between every part of it, and thoſe of each of the ſaid ſpaces, as between the higheſt, the midſt, and the loweſt part, and that which is in the ſame ſcituation, as between right and right, and left and left. So that as the face is not only the meaſure of the whole body, being repeated nine times, but alſo the leaſt parts of the face bearing the ſame proportion to thoſe of the reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it ſhould ſeem, that rational conſequences may be drawn of the marks of thoſe parts that are out of our ſight, by thoſe of the Face which are apparent to us. For if it be conſider'd, that, beſides the correſpondence there is between them as to quantity, there is yet another, which we ſaid was that of reſemblance, which makes a ſtrict affinity between them, and ſuch as is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly obſervable between the Forehead and the Breaſt; the Ey-brows, and the Shoulders; the cavities of the Ey-brows, and
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:66371:248"/>
the Arm-pits; the Ears, and the Arms; the Chin, and the Groin; the Cheeks, and the Thighes, and ſo of the reſt; thoſe who have this knowledge, may eaſily gheſs at the Warts, the Moles, and marks that are out of our ſight, by thoſe which are apparent to us; it being probable, that as Nature hath mark'd the one with one ſign, which is as it were the Seal ſhe hath ſet to her work, it muſt needs be found after the ſame manner in that counter-part, between which and the other, there is an alliance, not only by reaſon of its ſubſtance and compoſition, but upon the account of ſeveral other Accidents, which make them alike. Thus the Fore-head by reaſon of its plain figure in the middle, and circular towards the extremities, and by its ſolidity is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient repreſentation of the Breaſt. The eminent ſcituation of the Eye-brows diſcovers the correſpondence there is between them and the ſhoulders, which are the moſt elevated parts of the Body; and the cavities of the Eyes which is under the Eye-Brows, have ſome alliance with thoſe of the Armpits, which are under the Shoulders. The Cheeks, by reaſon of their fleſhy and muſculous compoſition, have a relation to the Thighs, and particularly, to the Buttocks, which are ſituated in the midſt of the Trunk, as the Cheek is in the Face, between the Fore-head and the Chin. The Mouth and the Chin have alſo a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the Belly and the Groin, the former being ſituated in the lower part of the Face, and the latter at the lower part of the Belly; as alſo upon this account, that they are equally fleſhy, and ſoft in their ſuperiour parts, and, in their inferiour parts, bony and hard. But this correſpondence is yet more ſenſible between the Mouth of the Woman and her ſecret parts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lips of both thoſe parts, which for that reaſon have the ſame name; as there is the like between the Noſe, the Eye-brows, and the Eyes, and the Genitals of a Man, the Teſticles and the Cods. Nor can there be any ſign more manifeſt, than ſuch as appear in thoſe places; whence there may be inferr'd the marks of thoſe which Nature hath ſo much conceal'd; which though ſo far out of ſight, are nevertheleſs manifeſt to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have the curioſity to ſtudy this correſpondence. But there is ſuch an aſſociation between the Hand and the Foot, as well in regard of their compoſition and ſtructure, as for the employments they are both put to; that the marks about the Hand and Fingers, have others anſwerable to them on the ſame parts of the Foot, in a correſpondent order and diſpoſition one to another.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That to find out the reaſon of this Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sympathy, we muſt not confine our ſelves to ſublunary Cauſes, but attribute an Effect ſo well order'd, and ſo regular to a Cauſe anſwerable thereto. For my part, I cannot aſſign any but what is derived from the Heavens, whoſe motions and influences being the general Cauſes of what-ever happens here below, that is conſtant and regular, it is to them that we ought
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:66371:248"/>
to attribute an exactneſs, which is ſo certain, that it very ſeldom miſcarries. Thence it comes that the Profeſſors of Aſtrology, with ſome ground of reaſon, affirm, that as there is no Plant ſo inconſiderable but hath its ſignature imprinted on it by that Star, which hath a predominancy over it; ſo is there a far ſtronger reaſon, than Man ſhould have his ſignature, which, as they maintain, is ſet upon him as a ſeal, by the Star on which he hath a dependance; it being certain that the ſeven Planets have an Empire over every part which they govern. Thus <hi>Ptolemy</hi> aſſignes to <hi>Saturn</hi> the right Ear, the Spleen, the Bladder, and the Bones; to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Hands, the Lungs, the Liver, the Blood, and the Seed; to <hi>Mars,</hi> the left Ear, the Reins, and the Teſticles; to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Brain, the Eyes, and the Nerves; to <hi>Venus,</hi> the Noſe, the Mouth, and the Genitals; to <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Tongue, the Underſtanding, and Ratiocination; to the <hi>Moon,</hi> the Mouth of the Stomack, and the Stomack it ſelf. But they attribute theſe marks of the Face to the motion of the Stars of the eighth Sphere, which are as it were expreſſions of the different Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which every one naturally hath, and which are beſtow'd on him at his Nativity; but with this Caution, that it is hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate them, unleſs a Man can decipher thoſe Characters, and find out the true ſignification thereof, which is the chiefeſt of all Sciences.</p>

            <p>THere never was any Opinion ſo erroneous, but it met with ſome Abettors; nor any thing in point of practiſe ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, but was in ſome meaſure authoriz'd.

But that number

was afterwards increas'd to 24. who were conſulted about what-ever concern'd that great Empire, and they continu'd till the time of the Elder <hi>Theodoſius</hi>; when it was ſuppreſs'd, having till then been ſo conſiderable by the nobility and merit of thoſe whereof it conſiſted, that they were the Arbitrators of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Deliberations, which were not taken, till their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been firſt had. Nay, they had this further advantage above all other Magiſtrates, that they could not be put out of their places upon any account whatſoever, but continu'd during their lives in that dignity, as <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> did, who was Augur ſixty two years. Nor was it only requiſite that that they ſhould be free from crimes, but alſo from all bodily imperfection, the leaſt defect of Body being accounted a lawful Cauſe, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Augur from taking place among the reſt; it being, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> affirms in his <hi>Problems,</hi> an undecent thing for any one to preſent himſelf before the Gods, and to treat of the Myſteries of Religion, with anything of uncleanneſs or imperfection about him.

In the mean time, they requir'd ſo much reſpect from the people, that, not thinking it enough to have the Lictors march before them with the <hi>Faſces,</hi> as was done before the chiefeſt Magiſtrates, they had for a further badge of their dignity, a ſtick crooked at one end, call'd <hi>Lituus,</hi> which was that of Kings.

They took upon them alſo the knowledge and diſcovery of things to come, by carefully obſerving certain extraordinary accidents, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd all others by their ſudden and unexpected coming to paſs, and which, by a certain Science and long Obſervation, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to be the ſignificators of what was to come. And this they derived principally from the Heavens, and the different Apparitions of the Air, eſpecially from Thunder and Winds; then from Prodigies and miraculous effects of Nature; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from four-footed Beaſts, but eſpecially from Birds, from which comes the name to that kind of Divination, called <hi>Auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium &amp; Augurium,</hi> wherein thoſe Divinators fore-told things conceal'd, and ſuch as ſhould come to paſs by the ſinging and flight of Birds.

to the Conſulter; whereas, on the contrary, it ſignifi'd ill-luck, if they would not meddle with it at all. And this Opinion was ſo ſtrangely rooted in the Minds of ſome ſuperſtitious people, that <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> attribute the Cauſe of two ſignal defeats of the <hi>Romans</hi> (one under the Command of <hi>Publius Claudius,</hi> in the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War; and the other under that of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> in the ſecond) to their contempt of theſe Auguries.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That of all the ſeveral kinds of foretelling ſecret things, he thought not any more rational than that which was done by the means of Birds, called <hi>Ornithomantia</hi>; the Nature of which Creatures being very ancient, and in a manner celeſtial, they ſeem to be more ſuſceptible of the impreſſions of the Heavens, whereof they are the Inhabitants, and which are the true Cauſes of what-ever happens here below, than any other Animals which have their abode either in the Earth or Waters. Thence it comes, that the Eagle which ſoars up higher than any other of the Volatile Common-wealth, hath been the moſt eſteem'd in the buſineſs of Auguries, by the Profeſſors of this Art, who alſo give him the preheminence, as to the conſtancy and vivacity of his Sight, taking it for a ſignification of good luck, when he began his flight on the right ſide; and that eſpecially, if it were ſo violent, that the noiſe of his wings might be heard. Thus <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> having ſeen an Eagle flying from the Camp of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great towards that of his Enemies, deriv'd thence an Augury of his Victory; as <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus</hi> did the like of his coming (as he afterwards) did to the Crown from this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that an Eagle came and took his Cap off his Head, and ſet it on again, after he had kept it a good while in the Air. But <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> had for an Augury of his exile and the loſs of his Kingdom, the violence done by ſome Vultures to ſome young Eagles, which they caſt down out of their Neſt. Such another Augury had <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, when, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, an Eagle, having ſnatch'd away with his beak a dart out of the hands of one of his Guard, caſt it into the Sea; ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which accident, he was ſhamefully unthron'd, and forc'd away. Yet does this Bird always denote happineſs, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luck, as do alſo the Vultures; to twelve whereof, which were ſeen by <hi>Romulus,</hi> while he was laying the foundations of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is conceiv'd, that that Metropolis of the world ows it fortune and continuance. <hi>Darius,</hi> having ſeen two of them torn to pieces by ſo many Hawks, conceiv'd a hope of enjoying, as he did, the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia</hi>; but he loſt it, together with his Life, after his meeting with a great number of Swallows, as he march'd in the head of his army to engage againſt the <hi>Scythians.</hi> And it is believ'd, that they had been alſo fatal to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of the <hi>Epirotae,</hi> upon whoſe Tent thoſe troubleſom Birds were ſeen; as they had alſo been on the Ship wherein <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> was, before his dyſaſter. The greater kind of Owl hath always been accounted ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:66371:250"/>
that one day, being got into the Capitol, under the Conſulſhip of <hi>S. Papellius Iſter,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Pedonius,</hi> there was a particular ſolemnity perform'd, for the expiation of the City, which the Augurs affirm'd to have been polluted by that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Bird: which yet was not ſuch to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> of whom it is oft related, that the ſaid ill-look'd Bird having appear'd to him in priſon, it prov'd an augury of his reſtauration to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judaea,</hi> whereof he had been diſpoſſeſs'd. The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Owl is alſo of ill preſage; for having one day pearch'd on the top of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s Lance, in his expedition againſt the <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> it was his misfortune to loſe the battle. The Ravens are no leſs unlucky; for they were the fore-runners of the bloody ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi>; and their crokings fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew'd death to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, when he made his entrance into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and did the like to <hi>Cicero,</hi> while he was avoiding the Ambuſhes of his inveterate enemy <hi>Antony.</hi> The Madge-howlets, the Scritch-owls, the Cormorants, and other ſuch mournful and melancholy Birds, make a ſufficient diſcovery of their fatal predictions, by the death of thoſe who hear them. The Pilots fear nothing ſo much as to ſee the Cranes flying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and returning back the ſame way again; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn advertiſing them, that they are threatned with ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary tempeſt. The Stork hath always been favourable to Auſpices, and look'd upon as a Meſſenger of Concord, as the Hawk, and the Buzzard, eſpecially where there was any thing done in order to marriage, or about the acquiſition of riches, which the Falcon, whereof the latter is a Species, was conceiv'd to preſage with ſo much certainty, that the <hi>Thuſcans</hi> built the City of <hi>Capua</hi> only upon their perceiving of one of them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their Augury. The Wood-pecker and the Hern have alſo made ſo happy preſages, that every one reaſſum'd new courage in the heat of a battel, when they appeared in ſight of the Souldiers. The Nightingal, which having pearch'd on the lips of <hi>Steſichorus</hi> whilſt he was yet a Child in the Cradle, ſung there, was a preſignification of that ſweetneſs, which was afterwards to flow from his delightful Poems; as the Bees which made hony on thoſe of <hi>Plato</hi> were a preſage of his Eloquence. Though it muſt be acknowledg'd concerning theſe laſt, that the Augurs were otherwiſe conceited of them; for having obſerved great numbers of them in <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Camp, they oblig'd him to quit it, ſo to avoid the misfortune that threatned him, and which happen'd to the Great <hi>Pompey,</hi> in whoſe Ships theſe Bees were ſeen in exceſſive numbers before the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> defeat. But theſe obſervations are not ſo conſtantly certain, but that there may be much diverſity among them by whom they have been made. Hence is it that <hi>Homer,</hi> among all the good Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, gives the precedence to the Dove, which others will not have to be ſuch, but only when ſhe is accompany'd, otherwiſe being alone they hold that ſhe boads ſome ill luck; as the Swan
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:66371:250"/>
does to all but Mariners. But among the reſt, the ordinary Hen, when ever ſhe makes a noiſe ſomewhat like the crowing of the Cock, foretells ſome ſignal misfortune, though that of the Cock himſelf be numbred among thoſe auguries that denote good ſucceſs, as having foreſhewn victory to <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> the night before he gain'd the battel againſt <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and been repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Solar animal, from the correſpondence there is between him and the Sun, whoſe motions he declares by his crowing, which upon that account is formidable even to Lyons.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That there are two kinds of Auguries, the <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Artificial:</hi> The former depends on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion there is between the Effects and the Agents whereby they are produc'd; which connexion being known, it is no hard matter to give a conjecture of things to come, whereof ſuch as are clear-ſighted obſerve the neceſſity of their coming to paſs, by reaſon of the ſtrict connexion there is between them, and the cauſes whereby they are produc'd. This is confirm'd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible predictions which are made not only at Sea by Pilots, who foreſee Tempeſts and winds by ſuch ſigns as ſeldom fail; but alſo by ſimple Labourers and Huſbandmen on the Land, who do the like in the changes of weather. Now this kind of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is as rational as the other is abſurd, as being a frivolous inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, grounded on certain obſervations, which are for the moſt part vain and impertinent. Such among the reſt, is the diviſion it hath made of the Heavens into its twelve Houſes, which are the Regions or Spaces whereto thoſe Augurs confin'd the extent of their predictions, which they made with their Augural ſtaff, without which the Auguries, according to their judgment, were of no validity, nor was there any more account to be made of them, then of what might be deriv'd from ſuch accidents as happen without or beſides expectation, or rather preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whence they were commonly called <hi>Oblative</hi> Auguries. But thoſe which happen'd conformably to the circumſtances of time and place, which thoſe Divinators had limited, and when they thought of them, were called <hi>Impetrative.</hi> And this is one of the conditions obſerv'd in their diſcipline, wherein there was no account made of what the Augur affirm'd that he had not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſerv'd, no more then then there was of any, thing that paſs'd beyond the compaſs of the places deſign'd to that function. For the better obſervance of the ceremonies thereof, the Augural Houſe was not cover'd but lay open to the air, which, for the better carrying on of the work, ſhould be clear and ſerene, out of a fear that the rain or wind might hinder their making an exact obſervation of the flight and different motions of the Birds; in the choice whereof they were ſo hard to pleaſe, that they employ'd them not in their preſages, but only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Spring. After which, eſpecially towards the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they made no account of them, in regard they were not then in ſo much vigour, nor in ſo good caſe, yet did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:66371:251"/>
ſuch a dependance among them, that the Auguries taken from thoſe that were inferiour, gave place to the others of a higher quality. So that if a Crow chanced to paſs by, while they were attentively divining by the flight of a Dove, this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter auſpice was to no purpoſe, no more then would be that of other Birds upon the arrival of the Eagle, which alſo would ſignifie nothing upon the fall of a thunderbolt, which diſturbed all their myſteries, with much more reaſon then a Rat might do, which had no ſooner appear'd in the Aſſembly, but the whole Ceremony was put off to another more convenient time. True it is then, that ſome advantages may be made of Birds, in order to the drawing of auguries and preſages of natural effects, ſuch as are rain, thunder, tempeſts, winds, heat, drought, cold, froſt, ſnow, hail, and other changes of weather, produc'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Heavens, the Elements, and other Cauſes, as well general as particular; but not to make any predictions thence of ſuch events and accidents as depend on an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of circumſtances of time, place, and perſons, who being purely free agents, their actions are wholly voluntary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently impoſſible to be predicted, what artifices ſoever may be us'd to do it. Whereto we may add this Remark, that thoſe artifices being full of abundance of vain and pernicious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, the ſentence of condemnation paſt againſt them is juſt, not only that of the Canon and Civil Laws, which ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch as make uſe thereof, but alſo that pronounc'd by the mouth of God, who expreſsly forbids his people in the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> to <hi>make their ſouls abominable by beaſt or by fowl,</hi> threatning with death the Wizard, <hi>and him that had a familiar Spirit.</hi>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXVI. Whether thoſe Children who are born with Cawls about their whole or ſome parts of their Bodies are always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and why?</head>
            <p>CHildren do ordinarily come naked out of their Mother's Wombs, when, after their ſtruggling with Nature, they begin their entrance into the World with crying and tears, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their weakneſs, and the miſeries they are likely to be expos'd to in the ſequele of their lives. Yet there are ſome Children excepted from this general Rule; and thence is it that ſome would have them exempted from the misfortunes common to all the reſt, upon this accompt, that they are born with <hi>cawls</hi> about them, that is, are encompaſs'd by a membrane, which
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:66371:251"/>
comes over their heads and their ſhoulders, call'd by the Greeks <hi>Amnios,</hi> which is the innermoſt of the three membranes, wherein the wombe-lodg'd infant is enwrapped, called by ſome Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives the <hi>Coife,</hi> or <hi>Biggin</hi> of the Child, by others the <hi>Childs ſhirt,</hi> and in ſome places known by the name of the <hi>Silihow,</hi> by reaſon of its tender and delicate intertexture, which other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren quit in their Mothers wombs, before they come out thence, with the other Membrane called <hi>Chorion,</hi> of which together with that maſs of fleſh which had ſerv'd them for a cuſhion and ſupport during the time of the praegnancy, are fram'd the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condines</hi> or <hi>After-burthen,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it comes not out till after the Child is born. And as theſe Children born thus cawl'd and coif'd with this tunicle (which like a large Hood or Capouch covers their heads and necks) ſeem not to participate of the nakedneſs of the others, who bring nothing into the World; ſo is it to be imagin'd, that they are not ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the miſeries and calamities inſeparable from the common life of other men, inaſmuch as their beginning being different from that of others, who come after the ordinary way into the World, upon the ſcore of this ſpecial priviledge, of having their heads furr'd and cover'd, the conſequence of it ought in all probability to be extraordinary, and full of happineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if this coif be not the cauſe, yet have ſome at leaſt obſerv'd that it hath always been the ſign, and that all thoſe who have been born after that manner have been very fortunate. The Hiſtory of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> related by <hi>Aelius Lampridius,</hi> in his Life, confirms this obſervation: For being born with ſuch a coif, he afterwards came to the ſoveraign dignity of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the management whereof all things ſucceeded according to his wiſhes. Nay, it hath been generally believ'd, that good fortune was ſo conſtant an attendant of this Coif, that all thoſe who were deſirous to compaſs their affairs carry'd it about them, eſpecially Advocates, who made uſe thereof, to gain reputation in their publick pleadings, being to that end very careful to buy them of the Midwives, who, knowing the excellency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſold them at a very dear rate, after they had ſurreptitiouſly got them away from the children, they had received into the World. For thoſe who have made it their buſineſs to enquire more ſtrictly into this obſervation, maintain, that he who brings this natural coif with him into the world is to expect all manner of good fortune, even ſo far as to be invulnerable, provided he be careful to have it always about him, or, (what contributes more to that effect) to eat it, as is over-ſuperſtitiouſly done by ſome. But the contrary will happen to the Child, if he be robb'd of that precious <hi>exuvium</hi> or coat, or it be ſecretly taken from him, to be given to another, who, by that tranſlation thereof, will receive the whole benefit of it.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That though the foreſaid perſwaſion ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently deſtroy'd it ſelf, there being no connexion or correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:66371:252"/>
between the accidents of humane life and that ſhirt, which ſometimes comes over the whole Body of the Child, commonly falls not much below the Shoulders, and many times does only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Face like a Maſk; yet have many been of Opinion, that it contributed much to happines and the advantage of good fortune; inſomuch that Saint <hi>John Chryſoſtome,</hi> in ſeveral of his Homilies, ſpeaks againſt thoſe of his time, who made uſe thereof to gain eſteem; which a Clergy-man named <hi>Praetus,</hi> being deſirous to acquire, by the means of ſuch a Coif, bought of a Midwife, he was very highly cenſur'd, as <hi>Balſamon</hi> affirms in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon the Canons of the Apoſtles. And <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> an Author of great repute, obſerves, on the Nativity of <hi>Ferdinand Daval,</hi> that the Coif he brought with him from his Mothers Womb, contributed much to his being happy and belov'd of all. From all which we may make this inference, that there is nothing ſo extravagant, but may meet with Favourers and Abettors. For I may lay it down for certain, that this Opinion hath no other ground than what it hath found in the weak Brains of thoſe Midwives, who having nothing in them but the name, have inſenſibly ſcatter'd theſe errours into the Minds of the vulgar, with whom the wiſeſt being oblig'd to comply in matter of Language, it comes to paſs at laſt, that what was before but a common ſaying, finds a degree of aſſent among the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. Nay, what is not any longer to be endur'd, they think it not enough to maintain this groundleſs perſwaſion, but there are ſome ſo ridiculous, as to derive a new kind of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it, which they call <hi>Amniomantia,</hi> whereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to foretel what-ever happineſs or unhappineſs ſhould befall a Child newly born, by the colour of that Membrane, whereof they affirm that the redneſs ſignifies good ſucceſs, and that the blackneſs or blewneſs of it denotes the contrary. To which they add another kind of Divination, call'd <hi>Omphalomantia,</hi> which teaches them to judge by the knots of the ſtring, whereby the Child is faſten'd to the After-burthen, how many Children more the Mother ſhall have; who, according to their judgement, will be Males if thoſe interſections be of a colour inclining to black, and Females if they be white; which Obſervations are not only impertinent, but alſo impious and ſuperſtitious.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That the common perſwaſion, of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs attending Children born with theſe Coifs, is well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, provided that it be taken in the ſenſe wherein the Phyſicians, who, in all probability, are more likely to be the Authors of it, than thoſe ſimple Women who receiv'd it from them, would have it to be underſtood; to wit, that thoſe who thus born cover'd with that fortunate Membrane, (in regard they are not put to ſo much trouble, nor ſuffer ſo great violence in the paſſage, by reaſon of its being open and eaſie) come forth cloath'd out of their Mothers Wombs, without being oblig'd to leave behind them the Membranes, wherein they had been enclos'd in the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:66371:252"/>
Matrix; whereas moſt other Children are forc'd to quit them at their coming into the World, by reaſon of the Obſtructions they meet with in their paſſage through thoſe narrow ſtreights, which conſequently, is ſo much the more painful and laborious to them, than it is to ſuch as are coifed, who are not to be imagin'd ever the more happy, as to the remainder of their lives, whereof the good or bad conduct are the true Cauſes of their happineſs or unhappineſs, and not that Coif, which can neither produce nor ſignifie them.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That thoſe Children, who are born thus coifed, are not only more happy in their Birth, but they are alſo ſuch in all the actions of their lives, as being commonly more peaceable, and of a more quiet Conſtitution, than ſuch as leave that Membrane within their former lodgings; who are accordingly more turbulent and reſtleſs, and, for that reaſon, have not thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations; whereby the former are recommended. For in theſe, the moderation of their manners and demeanour conſequent to that of their humours, gaining the hearts of all thoſe with whom they converſe, raiſes them into the general eſteem of all, and ſo facilitates their acceſſion to Honours and Employments; it being certain, that there may be ſome judgment made of the courſe of Life a Man is likely to take, by the deportment of his Child-hood; ſo is it no hard matter to give a gheſs at the ſame, by that of the Infant, when he makes his firſt ſally out of his Mothers Womb, which is one of the moſt remarkable tranſactions of his Life. Whence it may be inferr'd, that that firſt coming abroad being free from the trouble and agitation, whereof all others are ſenſible, and which makes them forget their Veſture which is left behind by the way, they ought accordingly to be diſpenc'd from the misfortunes incident to others, and enjoy a particular happineſs.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That the moſt reſtleſs and moſt turbulent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are commonly the moſt happy in this world, whereas thoſe who endeavour to walk according to the ſtrict rules of Modeſty and Reſervedneſs, do not carry on their buſineſs ſo well, as the former do, who confidently attempt any thing, and imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the favourites of Fortune. And thence it is that ſhe, on the other ſide, is ſo aſſiſtant to them, that though it be granted the Children born cloth'd are more meek and moderate than thoſe who come into the World after the common rate, yet would the clean contrary to what is pretended follow from it. For, inſtead of being cheriſh'd by Fortune, it is ſeldom that ſhe ſmiles on them, but is much more kind to thoſe ſtirring and tumultuary Spirits, who many times obtain greater favours of her than they durſt hope for, had they demean'd themſelves towards her with leſs earneſtneſs and importunity.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſaid, That if every Man be the Artizan of his own Fortune, thoſe who are of the beſt Conſtitution and ſtrongeſt Temper, ought to be more happy than others, whoſe irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:66371:253"/>
of humors does manifeſtly cauſe that of their Actions and Fortunes. Now the Children born with Cawls and Coifs about them, ſeem to be leſs vigorous, and of a weaker diſpoſition than thoſe who come into the World without any; inaſmuch as the latter, being more earneſt and violent, are no ſooner ſenſible of the time of their Deliverance, but they courageouſly break through the Chains whereby they are detain'd, the Membranes whereby they are encompaſs'd, which thoſe others having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Strength nor Courage to do, it gives a great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they will expreſs but little upon other more preſſing occaſions, and conſequently, they will content themſelves with the mediocrity of their Conditions, and not aſpire to any thing extraordinary.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXVII. Of Antiperiſtaſis.</head>
            <p>SO great is the Indulgence of Nature, that ſhe thought it not enough to beſtow Being and Exiſtence on the things ſhe hath produc'd; but ſhe hath alſo imprinted in them a ſtrong Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to preſerve it, by fortifying them againſt the aſſaults of their Contraries, the preſence whereof ſets them on ſuch an edge, that they become ſo much the more active. And this is not only confirm'd in Animate Beings, ſuch as are Plants and Animals, which vigorouſly oppoſe what-ever is hurtful to them, by ſo powerful a Vertue, that Men have been forc'd to find out a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular name for it, to wit, <hi>Antipathy</hi>; but alſo in other Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bodies, which generouſly ſtand upon the defenſive, when they are ſet upon by External Agents, whoſe contrary qualities coming to engage againſt them, they redouble their Forces, and rally all together as it were into a Body, the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Charge. This is that which the Philoſophers call <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> which is a vigorous reſiſtance of the Subject, caus'd by the contrariety of an Agent, which encompaſſes it of all ſides, purpoſely to deſtroy or corrupt it. It will be to no purpoſe to enter into any Diſpute concerning the Exiſtence of that which we call <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi>; but we ſhall lay it down for granted, though it be conteſted by <hi>Cardan</hi> and ſome other Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who maintain, that Water, Air, and the other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Bodies, are not actually colder at one time than at another, but only ſeem to be ſuch to our Senſes, which, though they ſhould be deſtitute of all qualities, are then endu'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſo that the ſame Well-water which ſeems to be hot in Winter, by reaſon of the coldneſs that is in the Touching, ſeems cold in Summer, by reaſon of the heat of the ſame Organ, which judges of it comparatively. For the contrary is ſeen, in
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:66371:253"/>
that Well-water, in Summer, being tranſported into a hot place, is there nevertheleſs cold; and the fumes and hot vapors which exhale from Springs and Wells in Winter, do ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that, during the ſaid ſeaſon, the water is endu'd with a true and real heat, too ſenſible to be accounted imaginary. But this <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> is further more ſolidly confirm'd by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, whereby we ſee that fire burns more violently, and is more ſparkling in great Froſts, or in the ſhade, than in hot weather, or when it lyes expos'd to the beams of the Sun. In like manner, a little Water caſt upon a great Fire, makes it more violent than it was before; and the Ventricles of our Bodies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his Aphoriſms, are hotter in Winter than in any other ſeaſon of the year; whence it comes that we are apt to feed more plentifully, and Digeſtion is then better perform'd. Nay, if we but go down into our Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, we ſhall find that the heat is more ſenſible there in Winter; but in Summer, when all things are ſcorch'd and burnt up on the ſurface of the Earth, all Subterraneous Places are ſo much the colder, the deeper they are, and the nearer they approach to the Centre; towards which, Cold, which is one of the natural qualities of the Earth, gathers together, and reunites it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that ſo it may be ſecur'd from the heat, whereby it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd of all ſides. And as it is to this, that the generation of Metals in the entrails of the Earth is principally attributed; ſo moſt of the Meteors which are fram'd in the two Regions of the Air, owe theirs to this ſame Cold, which coming to encompaſs, and as it were to encloſe the hot and dry Exhalation which makes the Winds, Lightning, Thunder, and Thunder-bolts, as alſo that which makes the Comets in the Middle Region of the Air; theſe unctuous and eaſily-enflam'd vapors, being encompaſs'd of all ſides, by the extream coldneſs of that Air which encloſes them, they, in order to their Conſervation, re-unite, and take fire, after the ſame manner as the Rayes of the Sun darted againſt ſome Opake Body, or reflected by Burning-glaſſes, ſet on fire the moſt ſolid Bodies, on which they are repercuſs'd; as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who by ſuch an Artifice, conſum'd the Ships of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who beſieg'd the City of <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Which inſtance ſerves as well to prove <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> as the manner whereby it is wrought, to wit, by the repercuſſion of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Species of the Subject caus'd by its contrary. Thus then it comes, that the Water of Springs and Wells is cold in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in regard the Species of the cold, forc'd by the Water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heated Air which is all about it, are darted back again by that oppoſite heat to the place whence they came; whereupon being thruſt cloſer together, they there re-inforce and augment the Cold; which happens not ſo in Winter, when the Species of the coldneſs of the Water, meeting with no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Air, endu'd with the like quality, inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into it without any reſiſtance; and ſo not being reflected
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:66371:254"/>
nor forc'd back towards the Water, it is not then ſo cold as in Summer.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That the intentional Species, being not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to act, but only to make a diſcovery of the beings from which they flow, as may be ſeen in thoſe of all ſenſible Objects, which theſe Species repreſent to the Organs that are to judge of them, cannot contribute any thing to the vigor of the action ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi>; which he conceiv'd ſhould rather be attributed to the ſimple form of the Subject, which having an abſolute ſovereignty over the qualities employ'd thereby, in order to Action, renders them more or leſs active, according to the need it ſtands in of them. And as ſeething Water taken off the Fire becomes cold of it ſelf, without any other aſſiſtance than that of its proper ſubſtantial form, which hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of re-inſtating it ſelf in that degree of Cold, which is naturally due unto it; ſo ought it with greater reaſon to have an equal right of preſerving that ſame quality, when it is aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its contrary, Heat; without having any recourſe to thoſe Emiſſions of Species, which, though we ſhould grant the Tactile qualities (what is much in diſpute) yet would not be able to cauſe an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> inaſmuch as being inſeparable from them, if the intentional Species of the coldneſs of Well-water were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards the warm'd Air, it ſhould take along with it the coldneſs, and, conſequently, it ſhould be ſo far from acquiring any new degree of coldneſs thereby, that it would loſe much of that which it had before. For ſince it is the Nature of theſe Intentional Species to be otherwiſe incapable, by reaſon of their immateriality, of producing any Corporeal and Material Effect, ſuch as is the augmentation of the degrees of any active quality, as Heat and Cold are, there being not any contrariety between the Species thereof, no more than there is between thoſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll other Bodies, whereof they are the Images, there is not any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that obliges the Intentional Species of the Cold to retreat and cloſe together, when they come to meet with thoſe of Heat, or Heat it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no more than there is that the Species of this latter quality ſhould make the other more vigorous by their reflection.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That it muſt be acknowledg'd, that the Species of Cold and Heat, and the other firſt Qualities were not contrary among themſelves, as being in their own Nature inalterable and incorruptible, as the other Intentional Species are, which come near the Condition of Spirits: Yet does it not follow thence, that theſe Species cannot be reflected, inaſmuch as the Viſible Species, Light and Voice, which alſo have no contraries, are not for that the leſs re-percuſs'd by Mirrours and other ſolid Bodies, or thoſe hollow places which make Echoes.</p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That it is not ſufficient, in order to the giving of a reaſon of that effect, to attribute it to the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:66371:254"/>
form of every Agent, but it is to be referr'd to a ſuperiour cauſe, ſuch as is the Soul of the world; whoſe function it being to preſerve every thing in its intireneſs, and to be aſſiſtant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when it comes into any danger, as it happens when it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by its contrary, then bent upon its deſtruction, there lies a certain engagement on this firſt cauſe, to relieve it in ſo great an extremity, by ſupplying it with new forces to help it out of that oppreſſion. Thence it comes that our Cellars are warm in Winter, and cool in Summer, as are alſo all other ground-rooms and low places; That Water ſhrinks up and frames it ſelf into little drops, when it is ſpilt on dry ground, whereas it ſpreads abroad and is diffus'd in moiſt places; That Lime is ſet on fire by the caſting of water upon it; That the fire burns better in froſty than in hot weather; That Wine drinks more cool out of a Glaſs that had been warm'd; That the coldneſs of Snow cauſes an extraordinary heat in their hands who handle it; and, That generally all tactile qualities are rendred more active, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their contraries, by reaſon of the concourſe, and the aſſiſtance they then receive from that general Cauſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it ſelf in their preſervation. Of this we may give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Politicks, affirming, that the procedure of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Cauſe is much like that of great Potentates, who, in a war between ſome petty Princes or neighbouring States, if they find one party ready to be abſolutely ruin'd, ſupply it with ſuch forces as ſhall enable it to recover it ſelf, ſo to bring the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral intereſts into an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> whereof there is as great a neceſſity in Nature, which is kept up by that proportion, wherein all things find their ſubſiſtence, as their deſtruction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from their diſproportion and inequality.</p>
            <p>The Fifth ſaid, That we are not to look for the reaſon of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperiſtaſis</hi> any otherwhere, than in the Subjects themſelves, wherein we find the action, whoſe intenſeneſs and augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are to be referr'd, not to that of the degrees of the active qualities, but to their compreſſion and reinforcement, which renders them more ſenſible, in regard they are more material, as may be ſeeen in a red-hot iron, the heat whereof burns much more violently, then that of a fire of Straw or <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixth ſaid, That according to the principles which allow all things to participate of a certain degree of ſentiment, this condenſation, or compreſſion of the degrees of heat or cold, ought to be the effects of a ſenſitive Agent, which having a knowledge of what may be hurtful or beneficial to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws within it ſelf the qualities which preſerve it intire, when it is preſs'd upon by others that are more violent, and ſuch as the meeting whereof might be prejudicial thereto, which it forces from it, in order to Action. And herein it is that the good of every thing conſiſts; inaſmuch as every thing hath being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far as it hath action, when it is aſſiſted by friendly qualities, and the like; and by this means it is that Cold and Heat act more
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:66371:255"/>
vigorouſly, when they are oppos'd one to the other; and that our cavities are hotter in Winter, by reaſon of the compreſſion of the Spirits and the natural Heat; which are the more diffus'd in Summer, in regard this latter goes to meet with its like, as a little fire is put out by a great one, and a weaker light obſcur'd by a clearer.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXXXVIII. Of the Sympathetical Powder.</head>
            <p>THough this Powder be now as much out of eſteem as it was in vogue, ſoon after the firſt finding of it out, for the expeditious curing of wounds: yet will it haply be a buſineſs of ſome advantage to examine their Motives, who firſt made, and publickly ſold it; as alſo thoſe of ſuch as have ſometimes made uſe of it with good ſucceſs. And whereas novelty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a certain eſteem to Remedies as well as to other things, ſo this <hi>Sympathetical Powder</hi> found ſo great belief at its firſt coming abroad, among Perſons addicted to a military life, who were immediately flatter'd with a ſpeedy and eaſie curing of their moſt mortal wounds by the means thereof, without any trouble of making inciſions or dilatations, many times more painful then the hurt it ſelf, that we have had ſome perſons theſe laſt Campagnes, though deſtitute of learning and experience, who had the ſubtlety to raiſe ſuch a miſt before the eyes of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality with this Powder, that they concluded this remedy to be true balm, and the only <hi>Panacea,</hi> or <hi>All-heal</hi> of all wounds. But time having diſcover'd the vanity of it, as alſo the impoſtures of thoſe by whom it was ſo highly recommended, it hath been clearly found out, that there are few people in this age, but are either deceiv'd themſelves, or make it their main buſineſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. For in fine, this Powder is as much cry'd down at preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ever it was cry'd up; and there is nothing left of it, but the inſolent name of <hi>Sympathetical,</hi> impos'd upon it by the Authors thereof, in imitation of the Unguent of the ſame name, wherewith <hi>Goclenius,</hi> and ſome other Phyſicians, endeavour'd to make good the <hi>Magnetick</hi> cure of wounds, wherein they only dreſs'd the arms or other inſtruments, by which they were given, and apply'd the convenient remedies thereto. But in regard they could not always come at the arms, which had done the miſchief, to keep up their practiſe, and to make the cure yet more eaſie, theſe upſtart Doctors be thought themſelves ſome years ſince, of another expedient to compaſs their deſigns, that is, found out a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, wherewith they make it their boaſt, that they will cure all ſorts of hurts, only by applying this powder to ſome piece of Cloth, which had been us'd either to bind up, or make clean the wounded part. And whereas there are two kinds of wounds,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:66371:255"/>
one ſimple, which makes a ſolution of continuity in the ſoft and fleſhy parts of the body, ſuch as are the veins, the arteries, the nerves, and the muſcles; the other, compound, which happens ih the ſolid parts, eſpecially where bones are broken; theſe Gentlemen have accordingly two different kinds of <hi>Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Powder</hi>; to wit, a ſimple, and a compound. The former is made with <hi>Roman Vitriol,</hi> which is our green and tranſparent Coppreſs, which they beat or pound not over ſmall, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it upon papers, in ſuch quantities as they think fit, lay it in the Sun, when he makes his entrance into the firſt degree of the Sign <hi>Leo,</hi> and leaving it there for the ſpace of three hundred and ſixty hours, which make juſt fifteen days, anſwerably to the like number of degrees, which that Planet travels over, in the ſpace of a year in the Zodiack. During this time it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd into an exquiſite whiteneſs, and then they take it in, and keep it carefully in ſome temperate place, that is not too moiſt, that is, ſuch as may not be likely to melt it, for fear it ſhould by that means loſe its vertue; for which reaſon alſo it is taken in during its calcination, in the cool of the evening, and in the night-time, and when the air is inclinable to rain, or over-moiſt. But there muſt be a great care taken, that it be not ſtirr'd with any inſtrument of iron, when this powder is either in the preparation, or ready made up; theſe Authors affirming, that it takes away its vertue, inſtead whereof they order, that the Artiſt ſhould make uſe of a little Willow-ſtick, which is of great efficacy in theſe magnetick cures. The compound Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical Powder is made of the ſame <hi>Vitriol,</hi> prepar'd after the ſame manner, and the Gum called <hi>Tragacantha,</hi> exactly pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd, mixt together in equal quantities; inſtead whereof, others put <hi>Gum-Arabick, Sarcocolla,</hi> the roots of the great <hi>Comfrey,</hi> and the five-leav'd <hi>Tormentile,</hi> or ſuch other vulnerary and aſtringent Plants. However theſe kinds of Sympathetical Powder may differ, as to the compoſition of them, yet in the uſe of them, they obſerve the ſame circumſtances. For though the ſimple wound require the powder of the ſame name, and the compound, where there is any fracture, requires the compound powder, yet is the manner of employing them ſtill the ſame. And to that end, as well in wounds newly receiv'd, as thoſe that are of ſome ſtanding, and degenerated into ulcers, they apply a clean cloth made of hemp or flax, to receive the blood from them, or the matter, wherewith being imbibed, they caſt the powder upon it, then fold up the cloth, incloſing it in another; and being thus wrapp'd one in the other, they are laid up in ſome temperate place, unleſs it be when the wound is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly enflam'd, or very cold. If either of theſe happen, they remove the cloths from the place where they were firſt laid, diſpoſing them into ſome cold place, ſuch as may be a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or ſome other cool room; if the part affected be exceſſively hot; and on the contrary, into an Oven or Stove, if it be threatned
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:66371:256"/>
with a Gangrene, or the extinguiſhing of the natural heat; and they dayly continue the dreſſing of theſe wounds after the ſame manner, till they are perfectly cur'd; till which time they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerve all the cloaths imbu'd with the blood or matter that came from them. But what palpably diſcovers the vanity of this practice, is, that they affirm the wound to be perfectly cur'd by this means, how great a diſtance ſoever there may be between the wounded part, and the Sympathetical Powder, which, they ſay, equally produces its effect afar off as near at hand. Which is contrary to Reaſon, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that every agent being confin'd to certain limits in its action, beyond which it can do nothing; it is impoſſible that this powder ſhould at ſo diſproportionate a diſtance, produce the effect which they would attribute thereto, nay though it were granted it might, if it were immediately apply'd to the place affected.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That if all Agents were oblig'd to follow that general Rule, whereby they are reſtrain'd from acting otherwiſe then upon the Subjects they touch, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by ſome vertue iſſuing from them, it would be a very hard matter to give a reaſon of the action of that Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Powder upon the wounds it cures, without making uſe of the aſſiſtance of common Surgery, which are many times more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable then the hurts about which they are employ'd. But ſince there is a great number of the like inſtances in Nature, it will be no harder taſk to find ſatisfaction in the cauſes of this, then in thoſe of all the reſt, which act at a diſtance, without any ſenſible tranſmiſſion from the Agent to the Patient; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of the Loadſtone, which draws iron to it; of the North-Star, which does the ſame with the Loadſtone; of the Moon's cauſing the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; of the Sun's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting Metals and Minerals in the bowels of the Earth; and of an infinite number of others, which act upon ſubjects at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by certain occult qualities. Which qualities, in regard they are manifeſt and ſenſible in the Loaſtone, are commonly call'd Magnetick; ſuch as is alſo the cure conſequent to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this powder on the blood, or matter taken from the wound, which is thus treated ſympathetically, and whereof the action is withall animated by that univerſal Spirit, whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral interpoſition and concurrence being requiſite to all Agents, in order to the proſecution and advancement of their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it may be concluded, that he does expreſs it in this Powder, whoſe vertue he conveys to the wounded part, by means of the blood, which iſſu'd from it, which though ſeparated from the body, there is however ſome conformity and correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and its whole.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That he thought it a very ſtrange humour, to attribute to <hi>Roman Vitriol,</hi> and the Gum <hi>Tragacantha</hi> the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of curing that at a diſtance, which they cannot do near at
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:66371:256"/>
hand, and that, being apply'd to the wounds about which they are employ'd. True it was that they were ſometimes cur'd by that kind of procedure; but that it was not to be look'd on as a miracle wrought by the Sympathetical Powder, but as a pure effect of Nature; on which the curing of maladies principally depending, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms, there needs no more for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting that of a wound, then to take away all heterogeneous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to reunite the gaping of the wound, and to keep it clean and at eaſe; for the natural heat, with its balm, the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and the Spirits, will advance the cure in that condition, more then all the ſuppurating, mundifying, cathoeretick, and epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letick medicines, which Art commonly makes uſe of. Thence it comes, that the Maſters of this new doctrine give a great charge, to thoſe who would make uſe of their Sympathetical Powders, to keep the wounds very cloſe, after they have waſh'd them with Urine, Sal-water, or Wine, and to take away the ſplinters of the broken bones, as alſo the clotted and congeal'd blood, and the other heterogeneous bodies which might hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union. And this indeed is no hard matter for them to do in the ſimple fleſhy wounds; but they never could do it in thoſe which are accompany'd with fractures, openings of great Veſſels, hurts in ſome conſiderable part of the body, or ſuch other extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accidents. Otherwiſe that effect being above the reach of the remedy, which is incapable of producing that cure, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by that means, and after that manner, it cannot be wrought otherwiſe then by vertue of a ſecret compact with the evil Spirit, who will be forward enough to promote the welfare of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in thoſe who ſhould make uſe of this remedy, conditionally that they may run the hazard of deſtroying their ſouls.</p>

            <p>NOvelty and things extraordinary, if we may credit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Artificial Memory, have ſo great a power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over our minds, that they do not only force them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, when the objects are preſent, but do alſo much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, and better conſerve the ſpecies then ordinary things can. This it was that oblig'd diverſe Poëts and Hiſtorians to ſpeak of <hi>Hydra's, Chimaera's Baſilisks, Satyrs, Centaurs,</hi> and ſeveral other things invented out of pleaſure or wantonneſs, ſuch as have no ground in truth, and are pure poetical fictions. For thoſe who have endeavour'd a more ſtrict examination of the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have found the intermixture of theſe ſpecies a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not only in reſpect of the matter, which was to receive the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:66371:257"/>
Soul, whereto ſhe is determinated by a certain proportion, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in reſpect of the form which is indiviſible, eſpecially the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Soul. Whence it comes, that the Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> ſpeaks very learnedly, and affirms, that there cannot be any Centaurs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the reaſon is the ſame with that of Satyrs; nay the Generation of Satyrs, according to the reaſon alledged by him, is much more impoſſible than that of Centaurs. Becauſe, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> if that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of a Man's and Horſe's nature were admitted, and it be withall ſuppos'd that Horſes are come to their full ſtrength in three years, at which period of time Children are hardly taken from their Nurſes breaſts, how is it to be imagin'd, that monſtrous Animal ſhould be in its beginning and vigour at the ſame time? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a Horſe being accounted old, when Man enters into his youth, how ſhould the one come to dye, when the other were arriving to his greateſt vigour? Now Goats being ſhorter-liv'd then Horſes, there is yet leſs likelihood of feigning an Animal, conſiſting of a mixture of ſuch a nature and Man's. For which reaſon, <hi>Pliny,</hi> in Book 7. of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> affirms, that a <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocentaur</hi> being foal'd in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> died the very ſame day, and for the continuation of the miracle, was kept in hony (which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be an excellent Balm) and publickly expos'd to the view of all. <hi>Virgil</hi> places them at the entrance of hell, upon this reflection, that ſuch things as are contrary to Nature cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. And St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the Life of S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit, relating how a Centaur had appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> queſtions whether it were a real Centaur, or the evil Spirit, under ſuch a form, and in the proſecution of his diſcourſe, ſeems to conclude it a pure illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Devils, ſince he drove it away with the Sign of the Croſs. So that we are not to attribute theſe Satyrs to any thing, but the licentiouſneſs which the Poëts have always aſſum'd to themſelves, as well as the Painters, to dare and undertake any thing, without any regard to the rule given them by <hi>Horace,</hi> not to make an intermixture and coincidence of ſtrange and oppoſite nature; and that Satyrs, that is, half-men, half-goats, were to be diſpos'd among the Hydra's and Chimera's, in as much as by them they would only repreſent men that were very active, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious, clowniſh, and much inclin'd to railery: and thence alſo the Satyrical Poëm came to have its denomination, as being a compoſition or farce of a Kitchin, whence ſome would have it to deſcend. Which fiction is ſufficiently juſtify'd by the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they attributed to thoſe Satyrical Animals, and by the other fabulous ſtories of <hi>Pan,</hi> whom they affirm to be the god of thoſe Satyrs, as alſo of the Shepherds. We are therefore to make no other account of this invention, then of all the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of their Imagination, what root ſoever they may have taken in the minds of the Ancients; in regard that being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin'd it may be ranked among thoſe ſenſeleſs Old-wives tales, wherewith they amuſe little Children. Unleſs we would rather refer theſe Satyrs to the illuſion of Devils, who aſſume
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:66371:257"/>
their ſhapes, to abuſe ſilly Women. And thence it is that they are, by ſome, called <hi>Incubi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond ſaid, that it was as dangerous for us to involve in impoſſibilities whatever we have not ſeen, as to be over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in believing all. But when Reaſon and Authority, which bring experience with them, and aſſure us of a thing, appear of any ſide, our credulity may well be excus'd. And this is the caſe, in the queſtion concerning Satyrs, inaſmuch as the concurrence of the ſeeds of thoſe two ſpecies, whereof they conſiſt, may as well produce them, as the Mule is engendred of an Aſs and a Mare. Whereto may be added this, as a general acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Nature hath not omitted any thing of that which might compleat her power, as having produc'd from Nothing, even to the moſt excellent Beings, whatever was to come into the mean between both. Beſides, though the Imaginations of Mothers were not capable of all things, and cannot imprint that figure and change of body on the Infant, nay to make what they pleas'd of it, whereof there are daily inſtances, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do; yet the commonage of fields and forreſts, and ſuch nouriſhment as the Children might have taken from Goats, as well as <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> did it from a She-Wolf, might, in proceſs of time, incline them to ſuch or ſuch a form. Whereto it will ſignifie little to oppoſe the reaſon of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> ſince it ſeems erroneous, by what is commonly done in the ordering of Trees, which are promiſcuouſly engrafted in different kinds, as for example, an Apple-tree may be in a Cabbadge-ſtaulk. By which intermixture, the Apples growing on ſuch a Tree, ſhall not only have a little ſcent of the Cabbadge, but alſo, that which is worſe always prevailing over that which is better, whereas the Apple-tree ſhould laſt many years, and the Cabbadg is but of one, from theſe two extremities there ariſes a mean, to wit, a Tree which lives longer then a Cabbadge, and not ſo long as an Apple-tree ſhould: Which thing is alſo to be obſerv'd ingraffing upon different kinds of Tree. Thence it comes that S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit, ſpeaking of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taur that appear'd to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> (for it is true, that the ſubſiſtance of one of theſe Monſters proves that of the other; as the one being deſtroy'd, the other cannot ſubſiſt) does not affirm it to be a pure illuſion, but doubts whether it were a real Centaur, ſuch as thoſe ſpoken of among the Ancients, or a Devil that had aſſum'd that form. But S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> took him for a Man, and not for a Devil whom he knew to be a Lyar, ſince he ask'd him where the Servant of God, whom he ſought for, lodged. Whereto the Centaur reply'd but in a ſavage voice, and ſuch as could not be underſtood, whereupon he drew near to S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> and with his hand ſhew'd him the way he ſhould go, which done he ran away. Whence Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> concludes, that it is a hard matter to know, Whether the Devil had not appear'd under that Figure to frighten that holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:66371:258"/>
or that the Deſart, fruitful in Monſters, had produc'd that Beaſt. And <hi>Plato,</hi> in the Banquet of the <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that a certain Shepherd having preſented <hi>Periander</hi> with a Child, brought forth at his houſe by a Mare, having the Head, Neck, and Hands like thoſe of a Man, in all the other parts reſembling a Horſe, and having the voice of a Child; <hi>Diocles</hi> propos'd, that ſuch Prodigies were the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Seditions, and Diſtraction of mens minds. Whereto <hi>Thales</hi> reply'd, that it was a natural thing, to prevent which for the future, he advis'd him to keep no Grooms but ſuch as were married. 'Tis alſo the advice of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who in the ſeventh Book of his <hi>Natural History,</hi> affirms, that in the Country of the <hi>Cartadulones,</hi> among the Mountains of the <hi>Indies,</hi> there are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, a ſort of very ſwift Animals, running ſometimes on two feet, ſometimes on all four, having a humane ſhape, and ſuch as by reaſon of their activity are never taken, till they are old or ſick. <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo affirms, in the Life of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that in his return from <hi>Italy,</hi> there was brought him a Satyr, like thoſe deſcrib'd by the Ancient Authors, half-man, and half-goat, which had been taken ſleeping. Being aſk'd who he was, his Anſwer was in ſuch a Dialect as favour'd nothing of Man's Language, but in an articulate voice, between that of Goats, and the neighing of Horſes; and the reſult was, that <hi>Sylla</hi> taking compaſſion of him, ſent a Guard to conduct him to the place from whence he had been brought. The ſame Author makes mention of the death of the God <hi>Pan,</hi> who was a Satyr. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> in the place before cited, affirms, that another Satyr ſpoke; and he gives a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, ſaying, that he was of a middle ſtature, having a crooked Noſe, hornes on his fore-head, and feet like thoſe of a Goat; and that he brought Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit ſome Dates, not taken off the bough on which they had grown: Which kindneſs obliges the Saint to aſk him, Who he was? Whereto he made Anſwer, that he was a mortal, and one of the Inhabitants of that Hermitage, whom the abus'd <hi>Pagans</hi> adored for <hi>Fawnes, Satyrs,</hi> and <hi>Incubi.</hi> I come to you, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> as a Deputy from the reſt of our Company, intreating you to pray for us to your God and ours, whom we acknowledge to be come into the world for the common ſalvation of all. Having with thoſe words concluded his Embaſſie, the light-footed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ran away. And that this Relation may ſeem the leſs ſtrange, we have this further to add, that in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> there was one of them brought alive to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was expos'd before the people at the publick Shews, and afterwards dying, his Body was ſalted, and tranſported to the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> to be ſhewn to the Emperour. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> alſo relates, that he had heard it of one <hi>Euphemius,</hi> who, he ſayes, was a perſon worthy of credit, that ſailing into <hi>Spain,</hi> he was hurry'd by a Tempeſt to certain Iſlands full of a ſavage kind of men, who had their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies all over hairy, long tails like thoſe of Horſes, and red
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:66371:258"/>
hair, which they could not force away from about them, otherwiſe then with blows; and that one of the Women-ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges having been left upon the ſhore by the Mariners, thoſe Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges abus'd her with all imaginable violences. So that, to doubt whether there be any Satyrs, after ſo many Teſtimonies that there are, were to have too great a complyance for our own Senſes, and too little for the Teſtimonies of the Ancients.</p>

            <head>CONFERENCE CCXL. Whether it be better to bury or to burn the bodies of the Dead?</head>
            <p>ALL the World ſeems to be very much concern'd in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, inaſmuch as there being not any man but his coming into this world neceſſarily infers his departure out of it; and that conſequently, a ſeparation of Body and Soul, every man ought accordingly to conſider, what will become, after death, of that other part of himſelf, unleſs he hath diſcarded all ſentiments of humanity, and hath aſſum'd the humour of the Cynick whom his friends having aſked, where he would be diſpos'd after his death, he deſir'd they would leave him in the place where he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without troubling themſelves any further. Whereupon they demanding of him whether he was not afraid his body might be devour'd by Dogs, he anſwer'd, that he ſhould be no more ſenſible of their bitings then of the gnawings of worms, if he were put into the earth; but however they would do well to lay his ſtaff by him, to frighten thoſe Dogs that ſhould come near his body. There are whole Nations who have made choice of the bowels of theſe Animals for their burial, eſpecially the <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> who kept Dogs purpoſely that they might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd bp them after their departure. The like was done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> who thought it leſs honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be interr'd, then to be devour'd by Dogs and Birds of prey, eſpecially Vultures, to which the Inhabitants of <hi>Colchos</hi> and <hi>Iberia</hi> expos'd the Carcaſes of thoſe who in their life-time had done gallant actions, but always burnt thoſe of the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly. Nay, what is abſolutely inhumane, (though <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> an ancient and eminent Philoſopher, approves it in a diſcourſe upon that Subject) ſome were ſo barbarous, as to eat the fleſh of their Fathers, and Mothers, and beſt Friends, out of a perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was one of the greateſt demonſtrations of piety, to give their neareſt Relations a burial in their own bellies. The <hi>Perſians</hi> religiouſly preſerv'd them in their Houſes, after they had enclos'd them in wax, to prevent putrefaction: which was better done by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> with honey, ſalt, bitumen, roſin, cedar, aloes, myrrh, and ſuch perfumes, which have preſerv'd their
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:66371:259"/>
Mummyes to this time. The <hi>Scythians</hi> did the ſame with ice and ſnow, wherewith they cover'd the bodies of the deceas'd, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from corruption. The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> us'd, to the ſame purpoſe, the leaves of Poplar, Myrrh, and Aloes, wherewith they cover'd their dead; after which manner <hi>M. Cato</hi> deſir'd to be buried, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was, in Olive-branches. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> inclos'd theirs in Glaſs; the <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Troglodites</hi> put theirs under heaps of ſtones; the <hi>Hyperboreans</hi> and <hi>Icthyophagi</hi> buried them in the waves of the Sea; the <hi>Poeonians,</hi> in Lakes; and the Inhabitants of <hi>Caria</hi> though no Sepulchre more honourable for thoſe who died for their Country, then that of their own Arms, wherein they buried them; as they did Perſons of Quality in the High-ways, that they might be the more conſpicuous, and eſpecially in Mountains which were only for the burial of Kings; whence came the cuſtom of erecting Obeliſks and Pyramids on their Tombes. But though there were a great diverſity in this kind of burying, yet it conſiſted principally in this, that ſome made choice of the Earth, others of the Fire, for their ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The former is not only more natural and more rational, but alſo more advantageous than the latter, ſince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more conſonant to natural reaſon, then to return to the earth thoſe bodies; which having been fram'd thereof, cannot be better conſign'd then to the boſom of that Mother; wherein being once enclos'd, they infect not our Air with corruption and malignant exhalations, as they may when caſt into the fire, the heat whereof forcing the fumes and infected vapours of thoſe Carcaſes to a great diſtance, they may corrupt the purity of the Air, and prejudice their health who are preſent at thoſe funeral Piles, which, for that reaſon, the Law of the Twelve Tables expreſsly forbad to be ſet on fire within the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> leſt the corruption might be communicated to the neighbouring Houſes, but provided it ſhould be done without the walls.</p>
            <p>The Second ſaid, That though the general way of burying the dead now is to enterre them, yet methinks that of burning them, and preſerving their aſhes, is more noble and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in regard the Fire excells the Earth in purity, as far as it tranſcends it in its vicinity to Heaven, the qualities whereof it communicates to the bodies it conſumes, purifying and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from all putrefaction, and making them ſo clear and tranſparent, that, according to the common opinion of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, in the general conflagration, the World and all bodies comprehended within it, will be vitrify'd, by means of the fire. It is therefore more honourable to have our bodies conſum'd by that Element, then to have them devour'd by Worms and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; whereof fire being an enemy, and the Embleme of Immortality, there can be no better expedient to ſecure our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Friends from oblivion, then that of burning their bodies, whereof we have either the bones or aſhes left, which may be preſerv'd whole Ages; there being yet to be ſeen the Urns of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:66371:259"/>
the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> full of ſuch precious <hi>depoſita,</hi> as thoſe who put their Friends into the ground can never ſee. Add to this, that it is a rational thing to make a diſtinction between Man Beaſt, which they do not, who, burying both, treat them after the ſame manner; whereas if Man's body were burnt, and that of the Beaſt left to rot in the ground, it would ſerve for a certain acknowledgment of the diſproportion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and that as the latter is of a mean and deſpicable condition, it is accordingly diſpos'd into the Earth, which is under the other Elements, and as it were the Common-ſhore of the World; whereas the former being deſign'd for Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, Fire, which is the moſt ſenſible Hieroglyphick thereof is more proper for it then the earth; (wherein if we were not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd away rather by opinion than reaſon, and that Tyrant of three Letters in the Latin Tongue, as a learned Author calls Cuſtom, did not corrupt our judgment) it were more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to bury the bodies of Malefactors, then to burn them as is commonly done.</p>
            <p>The Third ſaid, That if we may judge of the goodneſs of a thing by its Antiquity, the way of interring the dead will carry it, as having been from the beginning of the World. Holy Scripture tell us, that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought a Field for the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of himſelf and his; and that a dead body having been diſpos'd into the Sepulchre, where the bones of <hi>Elizeus</hi> were, was rais'd to Life. In other Hiſtories we find, that moſt Nations practis'd it, eſpecially the <hi>Romans,</hi> till the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was the firſt whoſe Body was burnt at <hi>Rome</hi>; which diſpoſal of himſelf he order'd, out of a fear he might be treated as <hi>Marius</hi> had been, whoſe bones he caus'd to be taken out of the ground, and caſt into the River. From that time they began to burn the Bodies of the Dead, which continu'd till the Reign of the <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>'s, when the Cuſtom of burying them came in again, and hath ſince been us'd by all Nations, whoſe univerſal conſent gives a great preſumption, that this manner is to be preferr'd before any other. Add to this, that our Saviour would have his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body ſo diſpos'd, and the Holy Church, which is divinely inſpir'd, ſeems to mind us of the ſame thing, when, upon <hi>Aſh-wedneſday,</hi> ſhe tell us, that <hi>we are duſt,</hi> and that into <hi>duſt we ſhall return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth ſaid, That there were five ways of diſpoſing the dead. One is, to put them into the ground; another, to caſt them into the water; the third, to leave them in the open air; the fourth, to burn them; and the laſt, to ſuffer them to be devour'd by Beaſts. This laſt is too inhumane to find any Abettors, but among <hi>Barbarians</hi>; Men are more careful to prevent the corruption of Water and Air, without which they cannot live, then to ſuffer carrions and dead carkaſſes, which would cauſe infections and inſupportable ſtinks; ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt is only between Fire and Earth. For my part, I give the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:66371:260"/>
precedence to the former, whoſe action is more expeditious than that of the other Elements, which require a long time to conſume dead bodies; whereas Fire does it in an inſtant. Whereto I may add this, that there cannot be any other more likely expedient, whereby men may ſecure themſelves from thoſe contagious infections, which many times occaſion diſeaſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are attended by Malignancy. Nay however, it is to be wiſh'd, whether dead bodies be buried or burnt, that it ſhould be done out of the City, and that the Law of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri,</hi> to wit, <hi>Hominem mortuum in urbe ne ſepelito, neve vrito,</hi> were ſtill punctually obſerv'd.</p>
