         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The occasion of this Worke, was the interring of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>Master Edward Lapworth, Doctor of Physicke:</hi> It is for the method and matter, the very same, that was then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely deliuered by liuely voyce, but is now, not onely amplified, by accesse of those things, that the strictnesse of time would not then permit; but is also further inlarged into a conuenient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise; the waight of the matter, and fitnesse of these times so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring.</p>
            <p>If any desire to know the reason of the publishing of it, I must ingenuously confesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was neuer liberally intended on my part, but rather extorted and wrung from mee: for had it not beene for a <hi>furious and ouer-hasty Midwife,</hi> that drew it out of the wombe by violence, this <hi>Embryon</hi> had neuer seene the light. Yet when I did call to minde,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:15115:4"/>
out of the strong came foorth sweetnesse,</hi> I did willingly set vpon this Worke, hoping that by the blessing of God, some whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some food, and sweet repast might issue out of these bitter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, to the refreshing of the hungry soule.</p>
            <p>But to leaue Parables, and to speake plainely: This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deceased, was noted of all that knew him, to bee inclined to the <hi>Romish Religion.</hi> At the Funerall, I tooke occasion to speake something of the deceased, which either of simple mispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or sinister acception, was misconstrued, and by some officious hearers, carried as newes to such, whose eares are patent, and gates wide open to receiue the tale-bearer. Heereupon the poore <hi>Predicant</hi> was rated, as if it had beene a <hi>Schoole-boy,</hi> by some austere <hi>Pedantee</hi>; and yet the <hi>Censor</hi> had nothing to obiect, <hi>praeter auditum,</hi> but onely by bare heare-say: not one auditor obiecting any thing against the Teacher; but some godly and well-minded, shewing their acceptance, did giue him thanks for his labours.</p>
            <p>Now, forsooth, the criminations or faults obiected, were these:</p>

that bad office, that he did in excuse of himselfe affirme, <hi>That he knew no cause, why any man should count him a Papist, vnlesse it were for keeping the Kings lawes, in abstaining from flesh vpon Fridayes, and such like times.</hi> I call God to record, <hi>I doe the man no wrong, but testifie herein the very truth;</hi> and did expastulate with him, that if the conscience of the Kings Lawes did so preuaile with him in that, why it should not also cause him to come more often to the Church, the reason being the same for both; whereunto, his answere was silence.</p>
            <p>But for the matter of seducing: It makes not a man by and by a settled Professour in his Religion, because hee labours to draw others vnto it: for we see by experience, that if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue well of a Religion, and begin to entertaine it, though they be as yet but very Nouices, they will presently seeke to induce others to the same: this may appeare by those that were Conuerts to the truth,<note place="margin">

               <hi>5.</hi> The next obiection was, that his not comming to Church was excused, for that his memory was decayed. In this point I cannot tell whether I should blame more, the reporters <hi>laesum ingenium,</hi> or <hi>laesam memoriam,</hi> his want of wit, or his want
<pb facs="tcp:15115:5"/>
of memorie: for what reason is there to thinke, that a Papist should refraine comming to Church, because he cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what he doth heare? when in truth hee would willingly bee there starke deafe, or learne the Art of obliuion. But the truth is, that the failing of his memorie was spoken of in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; his not comming to Church, in the end of all the speech, and almost the last point of all, and it was applyed only to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, wherein I said he did practise with good liking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till through weakenesse his memorie began to faile.</p>
            <p>But the substance of the speech which I now come vnto, will cleere all. You may therefore please to vnderstand, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being ended (according to my vsuall manner) I tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speake somewhat of the partie deceased; not by way of commendation or excuse, in regard of his Religion, which I had before taxed for many errours; but onely by way of application of one speciall point in my Sermon; which was, that in a corrupt Church some may bee saued, holding the foundation, though taynted with diuers errours of lesse moment: and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Romish Church; prouided, that they hold not the whole Mysterie of that Iniquity, nor by any doctrine or practice ouerthrow the fundamentall grounds of Faith and Religion. This I did apply to the person of the Gentleman deceased, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably deeming him to be in the number of these, and that (as I did take it) for good reason.</p>
            <p>The effect of my speech concerning him, was digested into these two branches: <hi>His facultie;</hi> and <hi>his Religion.</hi> For the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did onely touch it in a few words, shewing, that hee did practise the Art of <hi>Physicke</hi> with good and commendable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, till such time, as through weakenesse, his memorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to faile: that he was very courteous, and ready to affoord his best helpe, specially to Schollers, as I could testifie of mine owne certaine knowledge; and not wanting therein to poore neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as I had partly seene with mine owne eyes, and neere dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to him could testifie.</p>
            <p>Touching his Religion, I did indeuour to expresse my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, with our Christian reformed Church, that all men might see the difference between Christian and Antichristian Religion.

            </p>
            <p>My reasons why I did so charitably iudge of his estate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, were briefly these:

                     <hi>1.</hi> First, I shewed that he was not infected with the whole Mysterie of Iniquity, nor did appeare to be obdurate and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate that way; because in our Christian families where he came, he was knowne to ioyne with them in Prayer.</item>

                  <item>
                     <hi>4.</hi> His skill in the Vtensils and Vessels of their Religious seruice was so little, that he did not know a <hi>Chalice,</hi> but would pleasantly tell of his mistake, taxed by a Gentlewoman, better skilled in the trade then himselfe.</item>

            <p>If these bee not sufficient arguments to induce my charitie towards him, iudge you: And tell mee, I pray you, whether such a speech, so charitably vttered, need to flee the light, and be glad of the couert of darkenesse; or not rather with boldnesse come into the light, as now it doth, that it may bee approoued of God, and discreet good men.</p>

               <item>The fourth is, the happy end of such as are added to the Church, and that is, <hi>Saluation.</hi> They all, and they onely, are such as shall be saued.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the first obseruation, that I may complete the whole doctrine of it, three things are to bee considered. 1. That the way to saluation, is by the Church. 2. What that Church is, where saluation may be had. 3. By what meanes, and how men are to be added to the Church, that they may be saued.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Demonstrated 1. by <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke.</note>That I may demonstrate this truth, cast but your eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> wherein was most liuely figured, the Church of God.

            <p>Againe, <hi>Baptisme</hi> being the Sacrament of our entrance into the Church of Christ, he doth parallell it, and compare it with the Arke,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.20, 21.</note> intimating thus much, that as onely those <hi>eight soules</hi> were saued in the Arke by water: so there is no hope of saluation,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> but onely in the Church; the solemne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance whereinto, is ordinarily by Baptisme.</p>
            <p>We know, that the head is the fountaine of life,<note n="2" place="margin">By the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the head and the body.</note> sense, and motion to the whole body and euery member of it, but yet onely to that body, whereof it is the head; euen so it is betweene Christ and the Church; Christ is the head, the Church is the body,<note place="margin">Colos. 1.18.</note>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1.22, 23.</note> and euery true Christian is a particular member of that body:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.27.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, the body of Christ, and members in particular.</hi> Now as the head doth naturally performe the office of a head to the body, and to it onely: so Christ doth impart the Diuine influence of sauing grace onely to his Church. Therefore the Apostle, speaking of Christ,<note place="margin">Colos. 2.29.</note> saith, <hi>That from the head, all the body by ioynts and bands,</hi> hauing nourishment ministred and knit together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth with <hi>the increase of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Eph. 4.16.

            <p>This Position, <hi>That saluation is to bee had onely in the Church,</hi> is not obscurely noted, by those sacred similies, so frequent in Scripture,<note n="3" place="margin">By sacred similies.</note> where the Church is resembled to a <hi>House,</hi> to a <hi>Citie,</hi> to a <hi>Mother,</hi> to a <hi>Vine.</hi>

heare the Apostle, shewing the difference betweene men out of the Church, and such as are in it: speaking of their prophanenesse before their calling, he saith, <hi>and such were some of you</hi>:<note place="margin">1.

            <p>To conclude then, if there be no saluation without <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, calling, iustification, and sanctification,</hi> and none of these to be found, but only in the Church of God, it followeth necessarily, that <hi>there is no saluation out of the Church.</hi>

            <p>And first of all, from hence we may deriue the true defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Church, whereunto they must bee vnited that euer looke to bee saued. It is out of all controuersie, that such must be of the number of the Elect, (according to the first Notion of the Church) as hath beene shewed before,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15115:18"/>
vpon the point of Election, being the first grace, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all other graces accompanying saluation. But yet because the Elect are not subiect to the eyes of men, but are onely knowne to God, the sacred Scriptures direct vs euery where to the visible Church, according to the second No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for whomsoeuer God doth elect vnto the end, those he doth appoint vnto the meanes tending to that end.</p>
            <p>Such therefore as desire saluation, must ioyne themselues to the visible Church, by the ordinary way and meanes of Effectuall calling, Iustification, and Sanctification; all which Graces expresse themselues visibly to the eye of the world, by their effects and properties, causing the faithfull to shine as a light in a darke place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The definition of the visible Church.</note>Let vs come then to the definition of the visible Church: which I cannot better commend vnto you, then in the words of our Church of England; and it is this: <hi>The visible Church of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Article 19.</note> 
               <hi>is a congregation of faithfull men, in the which, the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministred, according to Christs Ordinance, in all those things that of necessitie are requisite to the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where we haue the essentiall parts of a true definition: namely, <hi>The generall &amp; common matter,</hi> whereof the Church is materially constituted; in these words, <hi>A congregation of faithfull men.</hi> And the difference, whereby the Church is formally distinguished from all other societies, partly in the former words, partly in these words following, viz. <hi>In the which the pure word of God is preached, and the Sacraments duly ministred, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To open the definition more distinctly and plainely. We call the Church, <hi>A congregation of faithfull men,</hi> to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it, both from Ciuill and Prophane societies, that are without; as also from Hypocrites and vnsound members, that are within the Church, but not of it.</p>
            <p>Againe, we say, that <hi>the Church is a congregation of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments duly ministred, according to Christs ordinance:</hi> to distinguish the Orthodoxe and true Church, from Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15115:18"/>
assemblies, which maintaine doctrine against the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; as also from <hi>Idolatrous and superstitious societies, who serue not God aright, according to his will</hi> reuealed in his Word, but after the inuentions and Traditions of men: concerning whom,<note place="margin">Isa. 29.13. Mat. 15.9.</note> Christ alledging the Prophet, saith, <hi>In vaine they doe worship me, teaching for Doctrines, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We adde further, <hi>In all those things, that of necessitie are requisite to the same</hi>; both to meete with <hi>will-worshippers,</hi> as also with <hi>Schismaticall conuenticles,</hi> who make euery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and indifferent ceremonie, an essentiall part of the worship of God, and therefore flye the assemblies of the most Orthodoxe Churches, for such externall rites, as if they were grosse Idolaters, and not lawfully to bee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withall.</p>
            <p>From this definition thus explained, wee gather three remarkable points, carefully to be noted of all, that laying aside all preiudice and partiality, desire to bee rightly in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in what Church they may finde saluation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That it is wheresoeuer the society of the faithfull may be found, and is not alledged or tyed to any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place or person.</item>
               <item>2. That it is to be discerned from all others, by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and soundnesse of Doctrine; and by the due admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments.</item>
               <item>3. That it admitteth nothing as of necessitie to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or as an absolute and necessary part of Gods worship, that is not consonant to the Word of God, and according to Christs ordinance in the same.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Touching the first point,<note n="1" place="margin">The Church is the society of the faithfull, not tied to any place or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> that wheresoeuer the society of the faithfull is, there is the true visible Church, and is not locally or personally tyed to any: let Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the prime Bishop of Rome, as they call him, determine it: <hi>Of a truth,</hi> saith he, <hi>I perceiue, that God is no accepter of persons: but in euery nation,</hi>

            <p>When the Apostles conuerted any to the Faith, did they direct them to any particular Country, Citie, or Church of note, and namely, to <hi>Rome,</hi> as whereunto they must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be vnited, or else there was no saluation for them? If a man in this case of conscience, being troubled in minde, should demand of a Iesuite or Seminary; What he should doe to attaine euerlasting life? his answere would readily be this; <hi>You must be reconciled to the Church of Rome.</hi> But if S. <hi>Paul</hi> were asked the same question, as sometime hee was by the Iaylour; what would be his answere?

How directly contrary is it to the expresse words of Christ, in the first Institution? For our Lord Iesus, after the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration and blessing, testifieth the elements to remaine in their substance, calling them by their right names, <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>The fruit of the Vine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.26, 27, 28.</note> The like doth S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that often in one short Context. It is an errour, indeed against
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15115:23"/>
common sense: For let the senses of sight, smelling, taste, and feeling report, if there remaine not the substance of Bread and Wine after consecration: insomuch, that if a man haue sufficient quantitie of them, he may well, for a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable time, sustaine nature, with no other food; which could not be, if there remained nothing but the externe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and meere shew of Bread and Wine. It is against the nature of a true body, which is, to be onely in one place, at one time, and that in his due dimension and substance. Now we know and beleeue that Christ is true man, in all things like vnto vs, sinne onely excepted; and therefore to make him to bee without dimension, in so many hundred, nay thousands of places at one instant, doth manifestly imply a tacite denyall of his humane nature. It is against our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Creed, where wee beleeue, that Christ (leauing the world, in regard of his bodily presence) <hi>ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and sitteth on the right hand of God, and from thence hee shall come to iudgement:</hi> which S. <hi>Peter</hi> aptly interpreteth, in these words;<note place="margin">Act. 3.21.</note>

And withall did expresly signifie vnto them, that hee spake not simply of his body, but of his body crucified, and blood shed; which as yet was not then done:<note place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note> 
               <hi>This,</hi> saith our Lord Christ, <hi>is my body,</hi>

               <hi>which is giuen for you:</hi> or as S. <hi>Paul</hi> relateth it, <hi>which is broken for you.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus wee haue opened the first branch of our definition of the Church, shewing that the true Church, <hi>is the company of the faithfull, of what nation or countrey soeuer:</hi> and that it is not tyed to any person or place, no not to Rome: Because many thousands were saued that neuer knew it, and before euer it was Christian: Romes authority ouer others is in no Scripture, in no Creed: it is but a particular Church, and member onely of the Vniuersall, as others are: and subiect to errour as well as others.</p>
            <p>The second branch of the definition of the Church,<note n="2" place="margin">Sound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and due administration of Sacraments, the notes of the Church.</note> is, <hi>That it is discerned from all other societies,</hi> by soundnesse of Doctrine, and due administration of Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Doctrine,</hi> it is the eare-marke of Christs sheepe, <hi>My sheepe heare my voyce.</hi> It is that whereby the faithfull are directed to try the true Pastor from the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.27.</note> the Orthodoxe from the Hereticall.<note n="1" place="margin">For doctrine.</note>

               <note place="margin">Two rules to discerne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> Hee giueth them a double rule, which being obserued, they may discerne of Doctrine; the one concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Hearer, the other the Teacher. The rule concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Hearer,<note n="1" place="margin">Concerning the Hearer.</note> is; <hi>If any man will doe his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my selfe:</hi> that is, <hi>If a man in humilitie and sinceritie of heart seeke to be informed</hi> in the truth, and as God from time to time shall reueale it vnto him, maketh conscience to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice that which hee shall heare: and as <hi>Theophylact</hi> saith, <hi>shall imbrace vertue,</hi>

               <note n="2" place="margin">The Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note>Touching the second rule, which concerneth the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, it is this: <hi>He that speaketh of himselfe, seeketh his owne glory:</hi>

               <hi>but hee that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true.</hi> A good parallell, distinguishing exactly the false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher from the true; the one seeking his owne, the other Gods glory.<note place="margin">1.

            </p>

               <note place="margin">Reu. 2.24, 25.</note> there were many that had not that learning (as the false teachers in their vaine-glorious bragging termed it) nor did know the deepenesse of Satan; but did hold fast the maine truth, though in much weakenesse: and all that God requireth of them, is, that they be constant in that. In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Lord speaketh to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my Word, and hast not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied my Name.</hi> For God doth not so much looke to the measure and quantitie of grace, as to the sincerity and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it.</p>
            <p>Many godly and learned among them did not by and by, vpon the sight of some corruptions, leaue and forsake the societie of the Church of Rome: <hi>Oecolompadius, Capito, Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe; nay, some of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the outward communion of the Romish Church till their dying day, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> and others, who thought well of the cause or matter of Reformation, but did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue Separation, being carried away with the mayne streame of the name of <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Mother Church.</hi> No maruell therefore, if among vs, we haue of meaner learning, or of the simpler sort, that so harpe vpon that string, that they haue no eare to hearken to Christs Pipe. It is no new

thing, to see a child mistake, and cry out after a stranger in stead of the owne Mother: so, why may it not be, that some in their simplicitie may fall into such a misprizion, as to take the <hi>Romish Synagogue</hi> to be their Mother Church, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not so much as a sound member of it, but as a disease, a Pest or Gangrene in the body?</p>
            <p>It is apparant then, that in a corrupt Church some may be sound, and so be saued: and this we hold of the Church of Rome, as corrupt as it is: for our Lord would neuer haue said of <hi>Spirituall Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 18.4.</note> 
               <hi>Come out of her, my people,</hi> if he had none there. And let not our Romanists brag of this our ingenuous confession, and play vpon it, the better to seduce the simple: for in truth, in standeth them in no more stead to patronize their impieties, then the Fathers approouing of the Baptisme of the Donatists and other Heretickes, did countenance their Heresies. For what is the chaffe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because it is acknowledged that there is some wheate hid amongst it? We doe not say absolutely, there is saluation to be found in the Romish Babylon, but, in the middest of so great confusion, there may be saluation for some. There is great difference betweene possibility of saluation, which may be in a corrupt Church; and infallibility, which is euer without doubt in the true and Orthodoxe Church. Is any so simple, as to commit his whole estate into a Ship full of leakes, whereof there is iust cause of doubt, whether euer it shall safely arriue at the desired Port; when he may trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it in a sound and safe vessell?<note place="margin">Gen. 7.13.</note> 
               <hi>Noah</hi> and all his, if they will not perish in the Deluge,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.15.</note> must get into the Arke. <hi>Lot</hi> must not tarry in <hi>Sodom,</hi> if he will be safe and free from the common iudgement.

Where therefore the doctrine is Orthodoxe and sound, the religious worship, seruice, and Sacraments, for the truth and substance of them, the very same with the prime Churches, and best antiquity, as it is this day (bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God) in our Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the rest of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15115:35"/>
reformed Churches, there is the surest and safest repose for the Christian soule: in this society there is infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of saluation: but in an Apostaticall and corrupt Church, as the Romane Church now is, it is not so, though yet God may reserue a remnant,<note place="margin">Iude 23.</note> pulling them, as it were, out of the fire: And that, with this Caueat, <hi>That they tarry not in Babylon.</hi>

               <hi>For,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>I haue much people in this Citie.</hi> And indeed, the conuerting of soules is a great worke; and great workes had need of potent and mighty meanes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it pleaseth God to vse his powerfull Word, which, as

            <p>This calleth the Teacher to a serious consideration of the waight of his Calling, and a conscionable regard to discharge it; hee is put in trust with the precious soules of men, for whom hee must giue account vnto God.

               <hi>is by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing.</hi> This must follow hearing, and goe before Baptisme: for without faith, neither is the Word of force to vs, nor we fit for Baptisme.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note> 
               <hi>The Word preached,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> And the Eunuch desiring Baptisme, is told by <hi>Philip,</hi> that he must first be a beleeuer:<note place="margin">Act. 8.37.</note> 
               <hi>If thou beleeuest,</hi> saith he, <hi>with all thy heart, thou mayest.</hi> Looke into the examples of all that euer were added to the Church, if they will be sound mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they must beleeue, nay, they cannot so much as be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the outward society, but they must at least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse faith,<note place="margin">Act. 8.13.</note> yea euen <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himselfe. Thus <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus beleeued on the Lord, with all his house. Many of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians hearing, beleeued, and were baptized.</hi> And so of all the rest of the Conuerts to Christianity. And there is great reason for it: for no man can be added to the body of the Church, to become a sound member of it, but he must be vnited to the Head Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.15, 16.</note> in whom all the members grow vp into a compleate body. Now we are vnited vnto Christ by none other meanes,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.17.</note> but by faith, whereby hee <hi>dwelleth</hi> in our hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:15115:37"/>Againe, <hi>What is the Church, but a company of beleeuers, a congregation of faithfull men</hi>? Therefore vnlesse a man beleeue, he cannot be of that society. Besides, the Word is the bread of life, the foode of the soule: so that as naturall food cannot sustaine nature, vnlesse it be receiued into the body and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested; no more can the Word, bee a Word of life to the soule, except it be apprehended by faith. It is a sauing Word onely to them that beleeue.<note place="margin">1. Co. 1.21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>They therfore that hearing, beleeue not, are in the same, or rather worse condition, then they that heare not at all. For sinnes of knowledge, are greater then sinnes of ignorance, and the meanes, not profited by, doth aggrauate the sin. Yea the sentence is feareful:<note place="margin">Mark. 16.16.</note> that <hi>He that beleeueth not, shalbe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> And the very same word that is by vnbeliefe so reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, shall iudge the incredulous (that receiue it not by faith) at the Last day.<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.48.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This should mouingly perswade euery Christian Soule to mixe the Word with faith: considering, that as the means of vniting to the Church, on Gods part, is the liuely voice of his Word preached, so on mans part the effectuall meanes is faith. Nay, God for our greater incouragement hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to his, both the meanes, and efficacy thereof. For the meanes, see the Prophet <hi>Esay:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 30.20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Though,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>the Lord giue you the bread of aduersity, and the water of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet shall not thy teachers be remoued into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: And thine eares shall heare a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walke in it.</hi> And as for the efficacie, God hath bound himselfe so to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist his outward ordinance, that his inward working grace shall concurre with it:<note place="margin">Ier. 31.33.</note> 
               <hi>I wil put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,</hi> saith the Lord.</p>
            <p>This also may be a touchstone, to try vs, whether we bee indeede vnited to the Church of God, or in outward shew onely: for we see euidently, that none are incorporated into the body of Christ, but the true Beleeuers. And who are those true beleeuers? Take these briefe notes of them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A true beleeuer doth rely only vpon the mercie of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15115:37"/>
God in Christ, whose mercy he doth so account his al suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent merit,<note place="margin">Psal. 73.25.</note> that he professeth vnfainedly that he hath none in heauen but the Lord, and none on earth but he.</item>
               <item>2. The true Beleeuer liueth no longer in the former course of his ignorance and sinne, he walkes not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, becomming, by the power of the death of Christ, dead to sinne.</item>
               <item>3. The true Beleeuer doth expresse his faith by his workes: knowing that it is not idle, but worketh by loue.</item>
               <item>4. The true beleeuer is constant in his way of piety and vertue, that he may attain to the end of his faith, the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his soule: for he knoweth well, that he cannot receiue the Crowne of life, vnlesse he be faithfull to the death.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Sacrament of Baptisme is the third meanes of entring into the Church:<note n="3" place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> for the couenant being propounded in the Word, and accepted and imbraced of the beleeuer by faith, is ratified and confirmed by the Seale of Baptisme; and so saluation, as by a deede vnder hand and seale, is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually conuaied vnto vs. Therefore Baptisme is called by S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.21.</note> 
               <hi>The like figure, which now saueth vs,</hi> because it is not a naked or bare signe of our regeneration and saluation but an effectuall seale, organe, and instrument, to conuay, and as it were, to set the very stampe and Character of Sauing grace vpon the soule of euery faithfull Christian.

            <p>Thus we see, that Baptisme is an effectuall meanes of our entrance into the Church of God.

Such must suffer themselues to be informed in the truth, and know, that there is as expresse a mandate for Baptisme, as there is for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, praying, or any other pious or morall duty. He that said,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Go and teach,</hi> said also, <hi>Baptize them.</hi> The Apostle did not simply say to those whom he directed in the way to saluation,<note place="margin">Act. 2.28.</note> 
               <hi>Repent ye,</hi> but withall he addeth, and <hi>be baptized euery one of you, for the remission of sinnes.</hi> And it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lords charge giuen in the Apostles commission: which is, that <hi>they teach me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obserue whatsoeuer he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

               <hi>The Lord said vnto my Lord:</hi> there they leaue out the Pronoune, perceiuing how odde and harsh the tone would be, to translate it, <hi>Our Lord said to my Lord.</hi> These Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists doe so glory in the phrase, that it is become a distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing note of a Romish Catholike, insomuch that if any will symbolize with them, he must speake in their language, as some, to please them, doe.</p>
            <p>To come to the point, <hi>It is the Lord that doth adde to the Church such as shall be saued.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9.27.</note> God must perswade <hi>Iaphet:</hi> it is he that must inlarge him, that he may dwell in the tents of <hi>Shem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.6.</note> He giueth vnto Christ such as are ordained to life; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise there is a plaine impossibility of our vnion with Christ and his Church. For our Sauiour doth peremptorily affirme,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.44, 65.</note> that no man can come vnto him, except the Father draw him; and except it were giuen vnto him of his Father.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15115:40"/>
The meanes without this efficient cannot be effectuall.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Paul planted, Apollo watered, but God gaue the increase:</hi> without whom, neither he that planteth is any thing, neither he that watereth.<note place="margin">Act. 16.14.</note> God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> before she could profitably attend to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching. If his Spirit doe not inwardly coworke with the outward voice, it shall but beate the ayre in vaine.</p>
            <p>The reason is euident: for mans deadnesse is such, that he can no more mooue toward heauen,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.1, 2.</note> so much as one step, then a dead man can rise of himselfe.</p>
            <p>Nay, there is in the corrupt nature of man, an opposite disposition &amp; willingnesse to remaine in the state of sin, like <hi>Lot,</hi> to linger in Sodom: so that there is naturally a relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and striuing against the worke of Grace: which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the regenerate in part, causeth them, that they cannot alwayes doe the good that they would.</p>
            <p>Againe, the worke of conuersation and regeneration is a miraculous worke, greater then the worke of creation, and therefore requireth a diuine power to effect it. In the first Creation there was no let: God said the word, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had their being instantly: but in the worke of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there are many obstacles, <hi>Satan, the world, the flesh:</hi> not that any thing can hinder the effect of Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, but in respect of vs.</p>
            <p>This confuteth the errour of freedome of will to good in man by nature; whether wholly as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> held; or in part, as our Romists maintaine. The right Christian and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike veritie is, with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by a negatiue, to exclude na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and extoll grace,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.10.</note> whereby nature of <hi>nilling, is made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For it is God that worketh in vs both to will and to doe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>Nos volumus, sed Deus dat vt velimus. We will,</hi> saith a Father, <hi>but God doth giue vs that power to will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is any man partaker of this grace, is he drawne of God, hath the Lord added him to his Church? Let him giue his Name the praise,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.13.</note> and confesse with the Apostle, <hi>that he hath obtained mercy.</hi> For indeed it is a great mercy of God, to be taken out of the slauery and bondage of Satan, and to be put
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15115:40"/>
into the Lords seruice,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.22.</note> which is perfect freedome, and hath for the end, euerlasting life.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point; Doth any desire to bee sincerely vnited vnto the Church of Christ? Let him goe to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of this grace, and cry with them in the <hi>Song of Salomon, Draw me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 1.4. Psal 86.11.</note> 
               <hi>we will runne after thee.</hi> And with <hi>Dauid, Vnite my heart, to feare thy name.</hi> And with the Prodigall, <hi>O Lord, make me as one of thy houshold seruants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of this addition to the Church,<note place="margin">The time and continuance of this addition.</note> is heere said to be <hi>daily,</hi> or from day to day: it shall not faile, to the last day, nor time be any more, when the number of the elect is once compleate.<note place="margin">Math. 24.22.</note> Yet it is not so to be vnderstood, as if the increase of the Church should be alwaies apparant, and in a flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eminencie, as our Rhemists vpon this Text would haue it: for we know by the Word of God, that there must be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie and falling into error, in these last times, as was said before.</p>
            <p>The consideration of the time is of excellent vse. It shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the patience of God,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.9.</note> in waiting so long from day to day for our conuersion.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.20. Gen. 6.3.</note> It was great to the old world, when the long suffering of God waited in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> by the space of 120. yeeres: but it was nothing to the time of the Gospel, from the first, to the second comming of Christ. This aduiseth vs, to take speciall notice of the day of our visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>For through the tender mercy of our God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.78.</note> 
               <hi>the day-spring from an high hath visited vs.</hi> Haue we the light? Let vs walke in it, while we haue it, and pray the Lord to send it, to them that sit in darkenesse.</p>
            <p>Againe, let vs not rashly censure, nor vncomfortably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of those that are without: <hi>The Lord addeth to his Church daily:</hi> therefore let vs, while there is time, both hope, and helpe forward the worke of God.<note place="margin">Math. 20.3.</note> All are not called in in the prime of the day, but some at the third, some at the sixt, some at the eleuenth houre. He that is to day, with <hi>Saul,</hi> a persecuter, may be to morrow a Conuert, and professe that which before hee persecuted. We say, <hi>Hee runnes farre, that neuer returnes.</hi> But know, that none can outrunne
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15115:41"/>
God, when hee will fetch him home to himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The happines of those that are added to the Church.</note>To close vp this matter in briefe; See here in the last place, the happinesse of those that are added to the Church: it is in one word, <hi>Saluation</hi>; being made the seruants of God, and becomming of his family, which is the Church, <hi>They haue,</hi> saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.21.</note> 
               <hi>their fruit in holinesse,</hi> and the end, euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life. They are kept by the power of God, through faith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>vnto saluation.</hi> They are safe in the Arke, whilest the world of the wicked perish in the Deluge. They are in the little <hi>Zoar</hi> of Gods Church,<note place="margin">Gen. 19 22. Psal. 144.15.</note> out of the danger of the fire of Gods wrath. <hi>Happie are the people that are in such a case, yea thrice happy are they that haue the Lord for their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can allure vs to be of this societie, if this motiue of eternall happinesse preuaile not with vs? Men desire to bee free of those Corporations, that haue great immunities and priuiledges: then know, that no citie can compare with the heauenly Ierusalem: no societie comparable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>
            <p>How prophane then and blasphemous is the conceit of wicked worldlings,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.14. Iob 21.14.</note> that say, It is in vaine to serue God: and what profit is in Religion and religious walking before the Lord: and count the proud and wicked, like themselues, the onely happy men? What a lamentable thing is it, that the god of the world should so blinde their eyes,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.4.</note> that they should not see their owne miserie, and the contrary happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods people,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.23.</note> till with the rich Glutton, it be too late?</p>
            <p>As for those that haue their part in this happines, let them goe on cheerefully,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.58.</note> 
               <hi>abounding in the worke of the Lord: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they know, that their labour is not in vaine in the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.3, 4.</note> Let them from the bottome of their hearts, say, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abundant mercie, hath begotten vs againe vnto a liuely hope, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserued in heauen for vs.</hi> Amen.</p>
