            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Divers not onely that travel abroad, but in the very markets and streets of their towns are mortally pinched and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led withall: so that you shall see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny drop down in the streets, many travellers brought into the towns sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dead and stiff in their fleds. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers lose their noses, the tips of their ears, and the balls of their cheeks, their toes, feet, &amp;c. Many times (when the Winter is very hard and extreme) the bears and wolves issue by troups out of the woods driven by hunger, and enter the villages, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ravening all they can find, so that the inhabitants are fain to flee for safeguard of their lives. And yet in the Summer-time you shall see such a new hue and face of a countrey, the woods (for the most part which are all of firre and birch) so fresh and so sweet, the pastures and medows so green and well grown (and that upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45537:9"/>
the sudden) such varietie of flowers, such noise of birds (specially of Nightingales, that seem to be more loud and of a more variable note then in other countries) that a man shall not lightly travell in a more pleasant countrie.</p>
            <p>And this fresh and speedy growth of the spring there seemeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the benefit of the snow; which all the winter-time being spread over the whole countrey as a white robe, and keeping it warm from the rigour of the frost, in the spring time (when the sunne waxeth warm, and dissolveth it into water) doth so throughly drench and soke the ground, that is somewhat of a slight and sandie mould, and then shineth so hotly upon it again, that it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the herbs and plants forth in great plenty and varietie in a very short time. As the winter exceedeth in cold, so the summer inclineth to overmuch heat, specially in the moneths of June, July, and August, being much warmer then the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-aire in England.</p>
            <p>The countrie throughout is very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45537:9"/>
well watered with springs, rivers, and ozeraes or lakes. Wherein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is to be noted, for that much of the countrey being so farre inland, as that some part lieth a 1000. miles and more every way from any sea, yet it is served with fair rivers, and that in very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that emptying themselves one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another run all into the sea. Their lakes are many and large, some of 60. 80. 100. and 200. miles long, with breadth proportionate.</p>
            <p>The cheif rivers are these; 1. <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gha,</hi> that hath his head or spring at the root of an Aldertree, about 200. verst above <hi>Yaruslave,</hi> and groweth so big by the encrease of other rivers by that time it cometh thither, that it is broad an English mile and more, and so runneth into the <hi>Caspian</hi> sea, about 2800. verst or miles of length.</p>

Their kinds of grain are wheat, rie, barley, oats, pease, buckway, psnytha, that in taste is somewhat like to rice. Of all these grains the countrey yieldeth very sufficient with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus quantitie, so that wheat is sold sometime for two <hi>alteens</hi> or ten pence starling the <hi>Chetfird,</hi> which maketh almost three English bushels.</p>
            <p>Their rye is sowed before the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all their other grain in the spring time, and for the most part in May. The <hi>Permians</hi> and some other that dwell farre North, and in desert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are served from the parts that lie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45537:11"/>
more Southward, and are forced to make bread sometimes of a kind of root (called <hi>Vaghnoy)</hi> and of the middle rine of the firre tree. If there be any dearth (as they accounted this last yeare, <hi>An.</hi> 1588. wheat and rie being at 13. <hi>alteens,</hi> or 5. shillings 5. pence sterling the <hi>Chetfird)</hi> the fault is rather in the practice of their Nobilitie that use to engrosse it, then in the countrey it self.</p>
            <p>The native commodities of the countrey (wherewith they serve both their own turns, and send much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to the great enriching of the Emperour and his people) are many and substantiall. First, furres of all sorts. Wherein the providence of God is to be noted, that provideth a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall remedie for them to help the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inconvenience of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey by the cold of the climate. Their chief furres are these, <hi>Black fox, Sables, Lusernes, Dunne fox, Martrones, Gurnestalles or Armins, Lasets or Miniver, Bever, Wulverins, the skin of a great water Rat that smelleth naturally like musk, Calaber or Gray squirrel, Red squirrel, Red and

white fox.</hi> Besides the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie spent within the countrey (the people being clad all in furres the whole Winter) there are transported out of the countrey some years by the merchants of <hi>Turkie, Persia, Bougha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Georgia, Armenia,</hi> and some other of Christendome 10. the value of foure or five hundred thousand rubbels, as I have heard of the Merchants.

The black fox and red come out of <hi>Siberia,</hi> white and dunne from <hi>Pechora,</hi> whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so come the white wolf, and white bear skin. The best Wulverin also thence, and from <hi>Perm.</hi> The best Martrons are from <hi>Siberia, Cadam, Morum, Perm,</hi> and <hi>Cazan.</hi> Lyserns, Minever, and Armins, the best are out of <hi>Gallets,</hi> and <hi>Ouglites,</hi> many from <hi>Novogred,</hi> and <hi>Perm.</hi> The bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the best sort breedeth in <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monskey</hi> by <hi>Cola.</hi> Other common furres, and most of these kinds grow in many, and some in all parts of the countrey.</p>

the realm a few years since about a 100000. pood yearly, now not past 30000. or thereabouts. The best yield of tallow is in the parts and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Smolensko, Yaruslave, Ouglits, Novogrod,</hi> and <hi>Vologda, Otfer,</hi> and <hi>Gorodet skey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another principall commoditie is their Losh and Cow hide. Their Losh or Buff hide is very fair and large: Their bull and cow hide (for oxen they make none, neither yet weather) is of a small sise. There hath been transported by merchants strangers some years a 100000 hides. Now it is decreased to a 30000. or thereabouts. Besides great store of goats skinnes, whereof great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are shipped out of the countrey. The largest kind of Losh or Buff breedeth about <hi>Rostove, Wichida, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogrod, Morum,</hi> and <hi>Perm;</hi> the lesser sort, within the kingdome of <hi>Cazan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another very great and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall commoditie is their Trane oyl, drawn out of the Seal fish. Where it will not be impertinent to shew the manner of their hunting the Seal, which they make this oyl of, which is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45537:13"/>
in this sort: Toward the end of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (before the frost begin) they go down with their boats into the Bay of S <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to a cape called <hi>Cusce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> or <hi>Foxnose,</hi> where they leave their boats till the next spring tide. When the sunne waxeth warm to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the spring, and yet the ice not melted within the Bay, they return thither again. Then drawing their boats over the sea-ice, they use them for houses to rest and lodge in. There are commonly about 17. or 18. fleet of them, of great large boats, which divide themselves into divers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, five or six boats in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort.</p>
            <p>They that first find the haunt, fire a beacon, which they carrie with them for the nonce. Which being esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by the other companies, by such among them as are appointed of purpose, they come altogether and compasse the Seals round about in a ring, that lie sunning themselves together upon the ice, commonly foure or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand in a shole, and so they invade them every man with his club in his hand. If they hit them on the nose,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45537:14"/>
they are soon killed: If on the sides or back they bear out the blow, and many times so catch and hold down the club with their teeth by main force, that the partie is forced to call for help to his fellows.</p>
            <p>The manner of the Seals is, when they see themselves beset, to gather all close together in a throng or plump, to sway down the ice, and to break it (if they can) which so bendeth the ice, that many times it taketh the sea-water upon it, and maketh the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to wade a foot or more deep. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the slaughter, when they have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what they can, they fall to sharing every boat his part in equall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and so they flay them, taking from the body the skin, and the lard or fat with all that cleaveth to the skin. This they take with them, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the bodies behind, and so go to shore. Where they dig pits in the ground of a fathom and an half deep or thereabout, and so taking the fat or lard off from the skin they throw it into the pit, and cast in among it hot burning stones to melt it withall. The uppermost and purest is sold and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45537:14"/>
used to oyl wool for cloth, the gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, (that is of a red colour) they sell to make sope.</p>
            <p>Likewise of <hi>Iokary</hi> or <hi>Cavery,</hi> a great quantitie is made upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Volgha</hi> out of the fish called <hi>Bellougina,</hi> the <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> the <hi>Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> and the <hi>Sterledey.</hi> Whereof the most part is shipped by <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Netherlandish</hi> merchants for <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> some by English mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <p>The next is of Flax and Hemp, whereof there hath been shipped (as I have heard merchants say) at the port of <hi>Narve</hi> a great part of a 100 ships small and great yearly. Now, not past five. The reason of this aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and decrease of this and other commodities, that were wont to be transported in a greater quantitie, is the shutting up of the port of the <hi>Narve</hi> towards the <hi>Finland</hi> sea, which now is in the hands and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the <hi>Sweden.</hi> Likewise the stoppage of the passage overland. By the way of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> and <hi>Pletsko,</hi> by reason of their wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> with the <hi>Polonian,</hi> which causeth the people
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45537:15"/>
to be lesse provident in maintaining and gathering these and the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, for that they lack sales. Partly also for that the Merchants and Mousicks (for so they call the common sort of people) are very much discouraged by many heavy and intolerable exactions that of late time have been imposed upon them, no man accounting that which he hath to be sure his own. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore regard not to lay up any thing, or to have it beforehand, for that it causeth them many times to be flie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and spoiled not onely of their goods, but also of their lives. For the growth of flax the province of <hi>Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>The countrey besides maketh great store of salt. Their best salt is made at <hi>Stararouse</hi> in very great quantitie, where they have great store of salt wels, about 250. verst from the sea. At <hi>Astracan</hi> salt is made naturally by the sea-water, that casteth it up into great hills, and so it is digged down, and carried away by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45537:15"/>
and others that will fetch it from thence. They pay to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for acknowledgement or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome 3. d. <hi>Russe</hi> upon every hundred weight. Besides these two, they make salt in many other places of the Realm, as in <hi>Perm, Wichida, Totma, Kenitsma, Solovetsky, Ocona, Bomba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi> and <hi>Nonocks,</hi> all out of salt-pits, save at <hi>Solovetskey,</hi> which lieth near to the sea.</p>
            <p>Likewise of tarre they make a great quantitiy out of their firre trees in the countrey of <hi>Duyna</hi> and <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,</hi> whereof much is sent abroad. Besides these (which are all good and substantiall commodities) they have divers other of smaller account, that are naturall and proper to that countrey: as the fish tooth which they call <hi>Ribazuba,</hi> which is used both among themselves, and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> and <hi>Bougharians</hi> that fetch it from thence, for beads, knives, and sword hasts of Noblemen and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and for divers other uses. Some use the powder of it against poyson, as the Unicorns horn. The fish that weareth it is called a <hi>Morse,</hi> and is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45537:16"/>
caught about <hi>Pechora.</hi> These fish teeth some of them are almost two foot of length, and weigh eleven or twelve pound apiece.</p>
            <p>In the province of <hi>Corelia,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the river <hi>Duyna</hi> towards the North sea, there groweth a soft rock which they call <hi>Stude.</hi> This they cut into pieces, and so tear it into thin flakes, which naturally it is apt for, and so use it for glasse-lanthorns and such like. It giveth both inwards and outwards a clearer light then glasse, and for this respect is better then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glasse or horn; for that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breaketh like glasse, nor yet will burn like the lanthorn. Saltpeter they make in many places, as at <hi>Oug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Their iron is somewhat brittle, but a great weight of it is made in <hi>Corelia. Cargapolia,</hi> and <hi>Ustug The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesna.</hi> Other myne they have none growing within the Realm.</p>
            <p>Their beasts of strange kinds are the Losh, the Ollen, the will Horse, the Bear, the Wolvering, or wood
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45537:16"/>
Dog, the Lysern, the Beaver, the Sable, the Martron, the black and dun Fox, the white Bear towards the sea-coast of <hi>Pechora,</hi> the Gurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stale, the Laset or Minever. They have a kind of Squirrel that hath growing on the pinion of the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone a long tuft of hair, much like unto feathers, with a farre broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tail then have any other Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, which they move and shake as they leap from tree to tree much like unto a wing. They skise a large space, and seem for to flie withall; and therefore they call them <hi>Letach Vechshe,</hi> that is, the flying Squirrels. Their Hares and Squirrels in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are of the same colour with ours: in winter the Hare changeth her cote into milk white, the Squirrel into gray, whereof cometh the <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have fallow Deer, the roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck, and goats very great store. Their horses are but small, but very swift and hard; they travell them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shod both winter and summer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all regard of pace. Their sheep are but small, and bear course and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45537:17"/>
harsh wooll. Of fowl, they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the principall kinds: First, great store of Hawks, the Eagle, the Gerfaulcon, the Slightfaulcon, the Goshawk, the Tassel, the Sparhawk, &amp;c. But the principall Hawk that breedeth in the countrey is counted the Gerfaulcon.</p>
            <p>Of other fowls their principall kinds are the Swanne tame and wild (whereof they have great store) the Stork, the Crane, the Tedder, of the colour of a Feasant, but farre bigger, and liveth in the firre-woods. Of Feasant and Partridge they have very great plentie. An Owl there is of a very great bignesse, more ugglie to behold then the Owls of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, with a broad face, and ears much like unto a man.</p>
            <p>For fresh-water fish besides the common sorts (as Carp, Pikes, Pearch, Tench, Roach, &amp;c.) they have divers kinds very good &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: as the <hi>Bellouga,</hi> or <hi>

            <p>They have besides these that breed in the <hi>Volgha</hi> a fish called the <hi>Riba bela,</hi> or white Salmon, which they account more delicate then they do the red Salmon: whereof also they have exceeding great plentie in the rivers Northward, as in <hi>Duyna,</hi> the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Cola,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>The citie of <hi>Mosko</hi> is supposed to be of great antiquitie, though the first founder be unknown to the <hi>Russe.</hi> It seemeth to have taken the name from the river that runneth on the one side of the town. <hi>Berosus</hi> the <hi>Chaldean in</hi> his fifth book telleth that <hi>Nimrod</hi> (whom other profane stories call <hi>Saturn)</hi> sent <hi>Assyrius, Medus, Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> into <hi>Asia</hi> to plant Colonies there, and that <hi>Moscus,</hi> planted both in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> Which may make some probability that the citie, or rather the river whereon it is built, took the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from this <hi>Moscus:</hi> the rather because of the climate or situation, which is in the very furthest part and list of <hi>Europe,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Asia:</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45537:18"/>
The citie was much enlarged by one <hi>Evan</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> sonne to <hi>Daniel,</hi> that first changed his title of Duke into King, though that honour continued not to his posteritie; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was invested into it by the Popes Legate, who at that time was <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth about the year 1246. which was very much misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the <hi>Russe</hi> people being then a part of the Eastern or Greek Church. Since that time the name of this citie hath grown more famous, and better known unto the world: insomuch that not onely the province but the whole countrey of <hi>Russia</hi> is termed by some by the name of <hi>Moscovia</hi> the metropolite citie. The form of this citie is in a manner round, with three strong walls, circuling the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the other, and streets lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, whereof the inmost wall, and the buildings closed within it (lying safest as the heart within the bodie, fenced and watered with the river <hi>Moskua,</hi> that runneth close by it) is all accounted the Emperours castle. The number of houses (as I have heard) through the whole citie (being
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45537:19"/>
reckoned by the Emperour a little before it was fired by the <hi>Chrim)</hi> was 41500. in all. Since the <hi>Tartar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged and fired the town (which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At which news being somewhat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and yet disdaining the villanie of their servants, they made the more speed home: and so not farre from <hi>Novograde</hi> met them in warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner marching against them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon advising what was best to be done, they agreed all to set upon them with no other shew of weapon but with their horse-whips (which as their manner is every man rideth withall) to put them in remembrance of their servile condition, thereby to terrifie them, and abate their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. And so marching on and lash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether with their whips in their hands they gave the onset: which seemed so terrible in the ears of their villains, and stroke such a sense into them of the smart of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45537:20"/>
whip which they had felt before, that they fled altogether like sheep before the drivers. In memorie of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie the <hi>Novogradians</hi> ever since have stamped their coin (which they call a <hi>dingee Novogrod k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But for situation <hi>Jaruslave</hi> farre exceedeth the rest. For besides the commodities that the soil yieldeth of pasture and corn, it lieth upon the famous river <hi>Volgha,</hi> and looketh over it from a high bank very fair and stately to behold, whereof the town take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h the name. For <hi>Jaruslave</hi> in that tongue signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as much as a fair or famous bank. In this town (as may be guessed by the name) dwelt the <hi>Russe</hi> king <hi>Ula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demir</hi> sirnamed <hi>Jaruslave,</hi> that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughter of <hi>Harald</hi> king of England, by mediation of <hi>Sueno</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> as is noted in the <hi>Danish</hi> storie about the year 1067.</p>

The other towns have nothing that is greatly memorable, save ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ruines within their walls. Which sheweth the decrease of the <hi>Russe</hi> people under this government. The streets of their cities and towns in stead of paving are planked with firre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, plained and laid even close the one to the other. Their houses are of wood without any lime or stone, built very close and warm with firre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees plained and piled one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. They are fastened together with dents or notches at every corner, and so clasped fast together. Betwixt the trees or timber they thrust in mosse (whereof they gather plentie in their woods) to keep out the aire. Every house hath a pair of stairs that lead up into the chambers out of the yard of street after the Scottish man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This building seemeth farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for their countrey, then that of stone and brick; as being colder and more dampish then their wooden houses, specially of firre, that is a drie and warm wood, whereof the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God hath given them such store, as that you may build a fair
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45537:21"/>
house for twentie or thirtie rubbels or little more, where wood is most scant. The greatest inconvenience of their wooden building is the aptnesse for firing, which happeneth very oft and in very fearfull sort, by reason of the drinesse and fatnesse of the firre, that being once fired, burneth like a torch, and is hardly quenched till all be burnt up.</p>

For about the year 1059. mention is made of one <hi>Beala</hi> that succeeded his brother <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas,</hi> who reduced the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to the Christian faith from whence they were fallen by Atheisme and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45537:21"/>
perswasion before. The second of that name was called <hi>Beala the blind,</hi> after whom succeeded divers of the same name.</p>
            <p>That their ancestrie came not of the <hi>Russe</hi> nation, <hi>Ivan Vasilowich</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this Emperour would many times boast, disdaining (as should seem) to have his progenie derived from the <hi>Russe,</hi> bloud. As namely to an English man his goldsmith, that had received bullion of him to make certain plate, whom the Emperour commanded to look well to his weight, <hi>For my Russes</hi> (said he) <hi>ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thieves all.</hi> Whereat the workman looking upon the Emperour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to smile. The Emperour, being of quick conceit, charged him to tell him what he smiled at. If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie will pardon me (quoth the goldsmith) I will tell you. Your highnesse said that the <hi>Russes</hi> were all thieves, and forgot in the mean while that your self was a <hi>Russe.</hi> I thought so (quoth the Emperour) but thou art deceived. For I am no <hi>Russe,</hi> my ancestours were <hi>Germanes</hi> (for so they account of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45537:22"/>
part of the <hi>Germane</hi> nation though indeed they come of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> that invaded those countreys and rested in those parts of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> now called <hi>Hungary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How they aspired to the Dukedome of <hi>Volodemer</hi> (which was their first degree, and ingrafting into <hi>Russia)</hi> and whether it were by conquest, or by marriage, or by what other means, I could not learn any certaintie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. That from these begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a small Dukedome (that bare notwithstanding an absolute go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with it, as at that time did also the other Shires or Provinces of <hi>Russia)</hi> this house of <hi>Beala</hi> spread it self forth, and aspired by degrees to the monarchie of the whole countrey, is a thing well known, and of very late memorie. The chief of that house that advanced the stock, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their dominions, were the three last that reigned before this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to wit, <hi>Juan, Basileus,</hi> and <hi>Juan</hi> father to the other that reigneth at this time. Whereof the first that took unto him the name and title of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, was <hi>Basileus</hi> father to <hi>Juan,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:45537:22"/>
and grandfather to this man. For before that time they were contented to be called great dukes of <hi>Mosko.</hi> What hath been done by either of these three, and how much they have added to their first estate by conquest or otherwise, may be seen in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of their colonies or purchases perforce. For the continuance of the race, this house of <hi>Beala</hi> at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is in like case, as are many of the greatest houses of Christendome, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole stock and race concluded in one, two, or some few of the bloud. For besides the Emperour that now is, who hath no child (neither is like ever to have for ought that may be conjectured by the constitution of his body, and the barennesse of his wife after so many years marriage) there is but one more <hi>viz.</hi> a child of six or seven years old, in whom resteth all the hope of the succession, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie of that house. As for the other brother that was eldest of the three, and of the best towardnesse, he died of a blow given him by his father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head in his furie with his walking staff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or (as some say) of a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45537:23"/>
thrust with the prong of it driven deep into his head. That he meant him no such mortall harm when he gave him the blow may appear by his mourning and passion after his sons death, which never left him till it brought him to the grave. Wherein may be marked the justice of God, that punished his delight in shedding of bloud with this murder of his sonne by his own hand, and so end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his dayes and tyrannie, together with the murdering of himself by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme grief, for this his unhappie and unnaturall fact.</p>
            <p>The Emperours younger brother of six or seven years old (as was said before) is kept in a remote place from the <hi>Mosko,</hi> under the tuition of his mother &amp; her kindred of the house of the <hi>Nagaies:</hi> yet not safe (as I have heard) from attempts of making away by practice of some that aspire to the succession, if this Emperour die without any issue. The nurse that tasted before him of certain meat (as I have heard) died presently. That he is naturall sonne to <hi>Ivan Vasilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> the <hi>Russe</hi> people warrant it by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45537:23"/>
the Fathers qualitie that beginneth to appear already in his tender years. He is delighted (they say) to see sheep and other cattel killed, and to look on their throats while they are bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which commonly children are afraid to behold) and to beat geese and hens with a staff till he see them lie dead. Besides these of the male kind, there is a widow that hath right in the succession, sister to the old Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and aunt to this man, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time wife to <hi>Magnus</hi> Duke of <hi>Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t,</hi> brother to the king of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by whom she had one daughter. This woman since the death of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath been allured again into <hi>Russia,</hi> by some that love the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion better then herself, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the sequele. For herself with her daughter so soon as they were returned into <hi>Russia</hi> were thrust into a Nunnerie, where her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter died this last year while I was in the countrey, of no naturall disease as was supposed. The mother remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth still in the Nunnerie, where (as I have heard) she bewa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45537:24"/>
into <hi>Russia,</hi> entised with the hope of marriage, and other fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the Emperours name: Thus it standeth with the imperiall stock of <hi>Russia</hi> of the house of <hi>Beala,</hi> which is like to determine in those that now are, and to make a conversion of the <hi>Russe</hi> estate. If it be into a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some better temper &amp; mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er constitution, it will be happy for the poore people that are now oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with intolerable servitude.</p>

The hymn being ended, the Patriarch with the Emperour mount up the stage, where standeth a seat ready for the Emperour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Patriarch willeth him to sit down, and then placing himself by him upon another seat provided for that purpose, boweth down his head towards the ground, and saith this prayer, <hi>Oh Lord God, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, which by thy prophet Samuel didst choose thy servant Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and anoint him for King over thy people Israel, hear now our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and look from thy sanctuarie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this thy servant Theodore, whom thou hast chosen and exalted for King

oven these thy holy Nations, anoint him with the oyl of gladnesse, protect him by thy power, put upon his head a crown of gold and pretious stones, give him length of dayes, place him in the seat of Justice, strengthen his arm, make subject unto him all the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nations. Let thy sear be in his whole heart, turn him from an evil faith, and from all errour, and shew him the salvation of thy holy and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church, that he may judge thy people with justice, and protect the children of the poore, and finally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain everlasting life.</hi> This prayer he speaketh with a low voice, and then pronounceth aloud, <hi>All praise and power to God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost.</hi> The prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, he commandeth certain Abbots to reach the imperiall robe and cap: which is done very decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with great solemnitie, the Patriarch withall pronouncing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, <hi>Peace be unto all.</hi> And so he beginneth another prayer to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Bow your selves together with us, and pray to him that reigneth over all. Preserve him (O Lord) under thy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45537:25"/>
holy protection, keep him that he may do good and holy things, let justice shine sorth in his dayes, that we may live quietly without strife and malice.</hi> This is pronounced somewhat softly by the Patriarch, whereto he addeth again aloud, <hi>Thou art the King of the whole world, and the Savioun of our souls, to thee the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, be all praise for ever, and ever.</hi> Amen. Then putting on the robe and cap, he blesseth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with the signe of the crosse, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall, <hi>In the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sinne, and the holy Ghost.</hi> The like is done by the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Archbishops, and Bishops: who all in their order come to the chair, and one after another blesse the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with their two forefingers. Then is said by the Patriarch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayer, that beginneth, <hi>O most holy virgin mother of God, &amp;c.</hi> After which a Deacon pronounceth with an high loud voice, <hi>Many years to noble Theodore, good honourable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, great Duke of Volode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of Mosko, Emperour and Monarch of all Russia, &amp;c.</hi> Whereto the other

Priests &amp; Deacons that stand some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farre off by the altar or table answer singing, <hi>Many years, many years, to the noble Theodore.</hi> The same note is taken up by the Priests and Deacons, that are placed at the right and left side of the Church, and then all together they chaunt and thunder out, singing, <hi>Many years to the noble Theodore, good, honourable, beloved of God, great Duke of Volo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer, Mosko, Emperour of all Russia, &amp;c.</hi> These solemnities being ended, first cometh the Patriarch with the Metropolites, Archbishops, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, then the Nobilitie, and the whole companie in their order, to do homage to the Emperour, bending down their heads and knocking them at his feet to the very ground.</p>

of all Russia, great Duke of Volo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer, Mosko, and Novograd, King of Cazan, King of Astracan, Lord of Plesko, and great Duke of Smolensko, of Tweria, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This style containeth in it all the Emperours Provinces, and setteth forth his greatnesse. And therefore they have a great delight and pride in it, forcing not onely their own people but also strangers (that have any matter to deliver to the Emperour by speech or writing) to repeat the whole form from the beginning to the end. Which breedeth much ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and sometimes quarrell betwixt them and the <hi>Tartar,</hi> and Poland Ambassadours: who refuse to call him <hi>Czar,</hi> that is Emperour, and to repeat the other parts of his long style. My self, when I had audience
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45537:27"/>
of the Emperour, thought good to salute him onely with thus much, viz. <hi>Emperour of all Russia, great Duke of Volodemer, Mosko and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vograd, King of Cazan, King of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracan.</hi> The rest I omitted of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, because I knew they gloried to have their style appear to be of a larger volume then the Queens of England. But this was taken in so ill part, that the Chancellour (who then attended the Emperour, with the rest of the Nobilitie) with a loud chafing voice called still upon me to say out the rest. Whereto I answered, that the Emperours style was very long, and could not so well be remembred by strangers; that I had repeated so much of it, as might shew that I gave honour to the rest, &amp;c. But all would not serve till I commanded my Interpreter to say it all out.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. The State or form of their Government.</head>
            <p>THe manner of their government is much after the Turkish fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they seem to imitate as near as the countrie and reach of their capacities in politick affairs will give them leave to do.</p>
            <p>The State and form of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is plain tyrannicall, as applying all to the behoof of the Prince, and that after a most open and barbarous manner, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the <hi>Sophismata</hi> or secrets of their government afterwards set down, aswell for the keeping of the Nobilitie and Commons in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-proportion, and farre uneven ballance in their severall degrees, as also in their impositions and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein they exceed all just <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

sort of people in all parts of the realm wheresoever they come, specially in the place where their lands lie, or, where they are appointed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to govern under him; also to the Commons some small content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that they passe over their lands by descent of inheritance to whether sonne they will, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they do after our <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> and dispose of their goods by gift or testament without any controlement. Wherein notwithstanding both No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and Commons are but storers for the Prince, all running in the end into the Emperours coffers: as may appear by the practice of enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his treasurie, and the manner of exactions set down in the title of his customes and revenues.</p>
            <p>Concerning the principall points and matters of State wherein the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigntie consisteth, (as the <hi>making and annulling publick of Laws, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Magistrates, power to make warre or league with any forein State, to execute or to pardon life, with the right of appeal in all matters, both ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and criminall)</hi> they do so wholly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45537:28"/>
and absolutely pertain to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and his Councel under him, as that he may be said to be both the Sovereigne commander and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of all these. For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Law or publick order of the Realm, it is ever determined of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any publick assembly or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be summoned. Where besides his Councel, he hath none other to consult with him of such matters as are concluded beforehand, but onely a few Bishops, Abbots, and Friers: to no other end then to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the peoples superstitions even against themselves, which think all to be holy and just that passeth with consent of their Bishops and clergie men whatsoever it be. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Emperours are content to make much of the corrupt state of the Church, as now it is among them, and to nourish the same by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favours, and immunities to the Bishops Seas, Abbeys and Frie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: as knowing superstition and false religion best to agree with a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call state, and to be a speciall means to uphold and maintain the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45537:29"/>
Secondly, as touching the publick Offices &amp; Magistracies of the Realm, there is none hereditarie, neither any so great nor so little in that countrey but the bestowing of it is done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the Emperour himself. Insomuch that the very Diacks or Clerks in every head town are for the most part assigned by himself. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the Emperour that now is (the better to entend his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions) referreth all such matters pertaining to the State wholly to the ordering of his wives brother, the L. <hi>Borris Federowich Godonoe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the like is to be said of the jurisdiction concerning matters judiciall, specially such as concern life and death. Wherein there is none that hath any authoritie or publick jurisdiction that goeth by descent, or is held by charter, but all at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and pleasure of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and the same practised by the Judges with such aw and restraint, as that they dare not determine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any speciall matter, but must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the same wholly up to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko,</hi> to the Emperours Councel. To
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45537:29"/>
shew his Sovereigntie over the lives of his subjects, the late Emperour <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Vasilowich</hi> in his walks or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses, if he had misliked the face or person of any man whom he met by the way, or that looked upon him, would command his head to be struck off; which was presently done, and the head cast before him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; for the sovereigne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal &amp; giving of pardons in criminall matters to such as are convicted, it is wholly at the pleasure and grace of the Emperour. Wherein also the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse that now is, being a woman of great clemencie, and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to deal in publick affairs of the Realm (the rather to supplie the defect of her husband) doth behave herself after an absolute manner, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out pardon (specially on her birth-day and other solemn times) in her own name, by open proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any mention at all of the Emperour. Some there have been of late of the ancient Nobilitie that have held divers provinces by right of inheritance with an absolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and jurisdiction over them,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45537:30"/>
to order and determine all matters within their own precinct without all appeal, or controlment of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. But this was all annulled and wrung clean from them by <hi>Juan Vasilowich</hi> father to this Emperour.</p>

            <p>The Court of Parliament (called <hi>Zabore)</hi> is held in this manner. The Emperour causeth to be summoned such of his Nobilitie as himself think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meet, being (as was said) all of his Councel, together with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, who calleth his Clergie, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, the two Metropolites, the two Archbishops, with such Bishops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and Friers as are of best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and reputation among them. When they are all assembled at the Emperours court, the day is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when the session shall begin: Which commonly is upon some fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, for the religion of that day.</p>
            <p>When the day is come, the Clergie men assemble before at the time and place appointed, which is called the <hi>Stollie.</hi> And when the Emperour co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth attended by his Nobilitie, they arise all, and meet him in an out room, following their Patriarch, who blesseth the Emperour with his two forefingers, laying them on his forehead and the sides of his face, and then kisseth him on the right side of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45537:31"/>
his breast. So they passe on into their Parliament house, where they sit in this order. The Emperour is enthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized on the one side of the chamber: In the next place not farre from him at a small square table (that giveth room to twelve persons or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts) sitteth the Patriarch with the Metropolites and Bishops, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the principall Nobilitie of the Emperours Councel, together with two Diacks or Secretaries (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dumnoy dyakey)</hi> that enact that which passeth. The rest place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on benches round about the room, every man in his rank after his degree. Then is there propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of the Secretaries (who representeth the speaker) the cause of their assembly, and the principall matters that they are to consider of. For to propound bills what every man thinketh good for the publick benefit (as the manner is in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland) the <hi>Russe</hi> Parliament allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no such custome nor libertie to subjects.</p>
            <p>The points being opened, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch with his Clergie men have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45537:31"/>
the prerogative to be first asked their vote or opinion, what they think of the points propounded by the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie. Whereto they answer in order, according to their degrees, but all in one form without any discourse, as having learned their lesson before, that serveth their turns at all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alike, whatsoever is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Commonly it is to this effect, <hi>That the Emperour and his Councell are of great wisdome and experience touching the policies and publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Realm, and farre better able to judge what is profitable for the commonwealth then they are, which attend upon the service of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

That instead of their advise they will aid them with their prayers as their duties and vocations do require, &amp;c.</hi> To this or like effect having made their answers every man in his course, up standeth some Abbot or Frier more bold then the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45537:32"/>
to be delivered unto them what his Majesties own judgement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate pleasure is as touching those matters propounded by his <hi>Dyake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereto is replyed by the said Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie in the Emperours name, <hi>That his Highnesse with those of his noble Councell, upon good and sound advise, have found the matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be very good and necessarie for the commonwealth of his Realm. Notwithstanding, for as much as they are religious men, and know what is right, his Majestie requireth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> godly opinions, yea and their censures too, for the approving or correcting of the said propositions. And therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth them again to speak their minds freely. And if they shall like to give their consents, that then the matters may passe to a full conclusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereunto when the Clergie men have given their consents (which they use to do without any great pausing) they take their leaves with blessing of the Emperour: who bringeth the Patriarch on his way so farre as the next room, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to his seat, till all be made
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45537:32"/>
readie for his return homeward. The acts that thus are passed by the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore</hi> or Parliament, the <hi>Dyakeis</hi> or Secretaries draw into a form of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, which they send abroad into every Province, and head town of the Realm, to be published there by the Dukes and <hi>Dyakeis</hi> or Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of those places. The session of Parliament being fully ended, the Emperour inviteth the Clergie men to a solemn dinner. And so they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part every man to his home.</p>

               </gap> of <hi>Russia,</hi> besides the sovereigne State or Emperour himself, are these in their order. 1. The <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> which is of foure sorts: Whereof the chief for birth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, are called the <hi>Udelney Knazey,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:45537:33"/>
that is, the exempt or priviledged Dukes. These held sometime a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall jurisdiction, and absolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie within their precincts, much like unto the States or Nobles of <hi>Germany.</hi> But afterwards (reserving their rights upon composition) they yielded themselves to the house of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ala</hi> when it began to wax mightie, and to enlarge it self by overmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their neighbours. Onely they were bound to serve the Emperour in his warres with a certain number of horse. But the late Emperour <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Vasilowich,</hi> father to this prince, being a man of high spirit, and subtill in his kind, meaning to reduce his government into a more strict form, began by degrees to clip off their greatnesse, and to bring it down to a lesser proportion, till in the end he made them not onely his vassals, but his <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lophey,</hi> that is, his very villains or bondslaves. For so they term and write themselves in any publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument or private petition which they make to the Emperour. So that now they hold their authorities, lands, lives and all at the Emperours pleasure, as the rest do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:45537:33"/>
The means and practise whereby he wrought this to effect against those and other of the Nobility (so well as I could note out of the report of his doings) were these, and such like: First, he cast private emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them about prerogative of their titles and dignities. Wherein he used to set on the inferiours to preferre or equall themselves to those that were accounted to be of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler houses. Where he made his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their malice and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the one against the other, by receiving devised matter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations of secret practise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies to be intended against his person and state. And so having singled out the greatest of them, and cut them off with the good liking of the rest, he fell at last to open pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, by forcing of the other to yield their rights unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He divided his subjects into two parts or factions by a generall schisme. The one part he called the <hi>Oppressini</hi> or <hi>Select men.</hi> These were such of the Nobilitie and Gentrie as he took to his own part, to protect
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45537:34"/>
and maintain them as his faithfull subjects. The other he called <hi>Zemps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> or the <hi>Commons.</hi> The <hi>Zempskey</hi> contained the base and vulgar sort, with such Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as he meant to cut off, as sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to mislike his government, and to have a meaning to practise against him. Wherein he provided that the <hi>Oppressini</hi> for number and qualitie of valour, money, armour, &amp;c. farre exceeded the other of the <hi>Zempskey</hi> side, whom he put (as it were) from under his protection, so that if any of them were spoiled or killed by those of the <hi>Oppressini</hi> (which he accounted of his own part) there was no amends to be sought for by way of publick justice, or by complaint to the Emperour.</p>
            <p>The whole number of both parts was orderly registred and kept in a book, so that every man knew who was a <hi>Zempskey</hi> man, and who of the <hi>Oppressini.</hi> And this libertie of the one part to spoil and kill the other without any help of Magistrate or law (that continued seven years) enriched that side, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45537:34"/>
treasurie, and wrought that withall which he intended by this practise, <hi>viz</hi> to take out of the way such of the Nobilitie as himself mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, whereof were slain within one week to the number of three hundred within the citie of <hi>Mosko.</hi> This ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall practise of making a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Schisme and publick division among the subjects of his whole Realm proceeded (as should seem) from an extreme doubt, and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fear, which he had conceived of most of his Nobilitie, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his Realm, in his warres with the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Chrim Tartar,</hi> what time he grew into a vehement suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion (conceived of the ill successe of his affairs) that they practised trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Chrim.</hi> Whereupon he executed some, and devised this way to be rid of the rest.</p>
            <p>And this wicked policy and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous practise (though now it be ceased) hath so troubled that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and filled it so full of gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dge and mortall hatred ever since, that it will not be quenched (as it seemeth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45537:35"/>
now) till it burn again into a civil flame.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Having thus pulled them and seased all their inheritance, lands, priviledges, &amp;c. save some very small part which he left to their name, he gave them other lands of the tenure of <hi>Pomestnoy</hi> (as they call it) that are held at the Emperours pleasure, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre off in another countrey, and so removed them into other of his Provinces, where they might have neither favour nor authoritie, not being native nor well known there. So that now these of the chief Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie (called <hi>Udelney Knazey)</hi> are equalled with the rest: save that in the opinion and favour of the people they are of more account, and keep still the prerogative of their place in all their publick meetings.</p>
            <p>Their practise to keep down these houses from rising again and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their dignities are these, and such like: First, many of their heirs are kept unmarried perforce, that the stock may die with them. Some are sent into <hi>Siberia, Cazan</hi> and <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> under pretence of service, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45537:35"/>
there either made away, or else fast clapped up. Some are put into Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, and shear themselves. Friers by pretence of a vow to be made volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and of their own accord, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed forced unto it by fear upon some pretended crime objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Where they are so guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some of speciall trust, and the Covent it self (upon whose head it standeth that they make no escape) as that they have no hope but to end their lives there. Of this kind there are many of very great Nobilitie. These and such like wayes, begun by the Emperour <hi>Juan Vasilowich,</hi> are still practised by the <hi>Godonoes,</hi> who being advanced by the marriage of the Empresse their kinswoman rule both the Emperour and his Realm (specially <hi>Borris Federowich Godonoe,</hi> brother to the Empresse) and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all means to cut off or keep keep down all of the best and ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Nobilitie. Whereof divers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready they have taken away, whom they thought likeliest to make head against them, and to hinder their purpose, as <hi>Knez Andreas Guraken,

            <p>But in this number the lord <hi>Borris Federowich Godonoe</hi> is not to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, that is like a <hi>Transcendent,</hi> and in no such predicament with the rest, being the Emperours brother in law, his protectour for direction, for command and authoritie Emperour of <hi>Russia.</hi> His yearly revenue in land and pension, amounteth to the summe of 93700. rubbels and more, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the particulars.

            </p>
            <p>These three degrees of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie (to wit) the <hi>Udelney knazey,</hi> the <hi>Boiarens,</hi> and the <hi>Voiavodey</hi> have the addition of <hi>Wich,</hi> put under their sirname, as <hi>Borris Federowich,</hi> &amp;c. which is a note of honour that the rest may not usurp. And in case it be not added in the naming of them, they may sue the <hi>Bestchest</hi> or penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of dishonour upon them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise shall term them.</p>
            <p>The fourth and lowest degree of Nobilitie with them, is of such as bear the name of <hi>Knazey</hi> or Dukes, but come of the younger brothers of those chief houses, through many descents, and have no inheritance of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45537:38"/>
their own save the bare name or title of Duke onely. For their order is to deliver their names and titles of their dignities over to all their children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, whatsoever else they leave them. So that the sonnes of a <hi>Voiavodey</hi> or Generall in the field are called <hi>Voia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vodey,</hi> though they never saw the field, and the sonnes of a <hi>Knez</hi> or Duke are called <hi>Knazey,</hi> though they have not one groat of inheritance or livelyhood to maintain themselves withall. Of this sort there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the plentie maketh them cheap, so that you shall see Dukes glad to serve a mean man for five or six rubbels or marks a year, and yet they will stand highly upon their <hi>Bestchest</hi> or reputation of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. And these are their severall degrees of Nobilitie.</p>
            <p>The second degree of persons is of their <hi>Sina Boiarskey,</hi> or the sonnes of Gentlemen, which all are preferred, and hold that name by their service in the Emperours warres, being soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by their very stock and birth. To which order are referred their <hi>Dyacks</hi> or Secretaries, that serve the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45537:39"/>
Emperour in every head town, being joyned in Commission with the Dukes of that place.</p>
            <p>The last are their Commons, whom they call <hi>Mousicks.</hi> In which number they reckon their Merchants, and their common artificers. The very lowest and basest sort of this kind (which are held in no degree) are their countrey people, whom they call <hi>Christianeis.</hi> Of the <hi>Sina boiars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> (which are all souldiers) we are to see in the description of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and military provisions: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their <hi>Mousicks,</hi> what their condition and behaviour is, in the title or chapter <hi>Of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>

            <p>THe whole countrey of <hi>Russia</hi> (as was said before) is divided into foure parts, which they call <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firds,</hi> or <hi>Tetrarchies.</hi> Every <hi>Chetfird</hi> containeth divers shires, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

            <p>The second is called the <hi>Roserad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Chetfird,</hi> because it is proper to the <hi>Roserade</hi> or high Constable. At this time it pertaineth by virtue of office to <hi>Basilie Shalcolove,</hi> brother to the Chancellour, but it is executed by one <hi>Zapon Abramove.</hi> His pension is an hundred rubbels yearly.</p>

            <p>The parts and practise of these foure officeo is to receive all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and actions whatsoever, that are brought out of their severall <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firds</hi> and quarters, and to inform them to the Emperours Counsell. Likewise to send direction again to those that are under them in their said Provinces, for all matters given in charge by the Emperour and his Counsell, to be done or put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution within their precincts.</p>
            <p>For the ordering of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Province of these foure <hi>Chetfirds,</hi> there is appointed one of these Dukes, which were reckoned before in the lowest degree of their Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which are resident in the head towns of the said Provinces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of every one hath joyned with him in Commission a Dyack or Secretarie to assist him, or rather to direct him. For in the executing of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission the Dyack doth all.</p>
            <p>The parts of their Commission are these in effect. First to hear and determine in all civill matters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

their precinct. To which purpose they have under them certain offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as <hi>Gubnoy Starets</hi> or Coroners, who, besides the triall of self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are to attach fellons: and the <hi>Soudiae</hi> or under-Justices, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also may hear and determine in all matters of the same nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the countrey people of their own wards or bayliwicks: but so, that in case either partie dissent, they may appeal, and go further to the Duke and Dyack that reside within the head town. From whom also they may remove the matter to the higher court at <hi>Mosko</hi> of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Counsell, where lie all appeals. They have under them also <hi>Sotskey Starets,</hi> that is Aldermen, or Balives of the hundreds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in all criminall matters, as theft, murder, treason, &amp;c. they have authoritie to apprehend, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and to imprison the malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, and so having received perfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45537:41"/>
that Province is annexed, by whom it is referred and propounded to the Emperours Counsell. But to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in any matter criminall, or to do execution upon the partie offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is more then their commission will allow them to do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if there be any publick service to be done within that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince (as the publishing of any Law, or common order, by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damation, collecting of taxes and impositions for the Emperour, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering of souldiers, and sending them forth at the day and to the place assigned by the Emperour or his Counsell) all these and such like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

They that are appointed to govern abroad, are men of this qualitie, save that in the foure border towns that are of greatest importance are set men of more speciall valour and trust, two in every town. Whereof one is ever of the Emperours privie Counsell. These foure border towns are <hi>Smolensko, Vobsko, Novogrod,</hi> and <hi>Cazan,</hi> whereof three lie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> one bordereth farre off upon the <hi>Chrim Tartar.</hi> These have larger commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the other Dukes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that I spake of before, and may do execution in criminall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Which is thought behoovefull for the Commonwealth, for incident occasions that may happen upon the borders that are farre off, and may not stay for direction, about every occurrent and particular matter from the Emperour and his Counsell. They are changed every year (except as before) and have for their stipend 700. rubbels a year he that hath most, some have but 400. Many of these places that are of greatest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and almost the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45537:43"/>
is managed at this time by the <hi>Godonoes</hi> and their clients.</p>
            <p>The citie of <hi>Mosko</hi> (that is the Emperours seat) is governed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Emperours Counsell. All matters there both civill &amp; criminall are heard &amp; determined in the several courts, held by some of the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, that reside there all the year long.</p>
            <p>Onely for their ordinary matters (as buildings, reparations, keeping of their streets decent and clean, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, levying of taxes, impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and such like) are appointed two Gentlemen, and two Dyacks or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, who hold a court together for the ordering of such matters. This is called the <hi>Zempskey</hi> house. If any townsman suspect his servant of these or like matter, hither he may bring him to have him examined upon the <hi>Pudkey,</hi> or other torture. Besides these two Gentlemen and Secretaries that order the whole Citie, there are <hi>Starusts</hi> or Ald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmen for every seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall companie. The Alderman hath his <hi>Sotskey</hi> or Constable, and the Constable hath certain <hi>Deoetskeis</hi> or Decurions under him, which have
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45537:43"/>
the oversight of ten housholds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice, whereby every disorder is soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner spied, and the common service hath the quicker dispatch. The whole number of Citizens poore and rich are reduced into companies. The cheif officers (as the Dyacks and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) are appointed by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himself, the <hi>Starust</hi> by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Dyacks, the <hi>Sotskey</hi> by the <hi>Starust</hi> or Alderman, and the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>skois</hi> by the Constables.</p>
            <p>This manner of government of their Provinces and towns, if it were as well set for the giving of justice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all sorts, as it is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent innovations, by keeping of the Nobilitie within order, and the Commons in subjection, it might seem in that kind to be no bad nor unpolitick way for the containing of so large a Commonwealth, of that breadth and length as is the kingdome of <hi>Russia.</hi> But the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and flaverie is so open and so great, that a man would marvell how the Nobilitie and people should suffer themselves to be brought under in, while they had any means to avoid
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45537:44"/>
and repu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lse it; or being so strengthned as it is at this present, how the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours themselves can be content to practise the same with so open inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and oppressión of their Subjects, being themselves of a Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth how hard a matter it were to alter the state of the <hi>Russe</hi> government, as now it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. First, because they have none of the Nobilitie able to make head. As for the Lords of the foure <hi>Chetfirds</hi> or <hi>Tetrarchies,</hi> they are men of no Nobilitie, but Dyacks advanced by the Emperour, depending on his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and attending onely about his own person. And for the Dukes that are appointed to govern under them, they are but men of a titular dignitie (as was said before) of no power, authoritie, nor credit, save that which they have out of the office, for the time they injoy it. Which doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase them no favour, but rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the people, for as much as they see that they are set over them, not so much for any care to do them right and justice, as to keep them under in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45537:44"/>
a miserable subjection, and to take the fliece from them, not once in the year (as the owner from his sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ep) but to poll and clip them all the year long. Besides the authority and rule which they bear is rent and divided into many small pieces, being divers of them in every great Shire, limited besides with a very short time, which giveth them no scope to make any strength, nor to contrive such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, if happely they intended any matter of innovation. As for the common people (as may better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the description of their state and qualitie afterwards set down) besides their want of armour and practise of warre (which they are kept from of purpose) they are rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed continually both of their hearts and money (besides other means) sometime by pretence of some ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be done for the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, sometimes without any shew at all of any necessitie of Common-wealth or Prince. So that there is no means either for Nobilitie or people to attempt any innovation, so long as the militarie forces of the Emperour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45537:45"/>
(which are the number of 8000. ac the least in continuall pay) hold themselves fast and sure unto him, and to the present state. Which needs they must do, being of the qualitie of Souldiers, and enjoying withall that free libertie of wronging and spoiling of the commons at their preasure, which is permitted them of purpose to make them have a liking of the present state. As for the agreement of the souldiers and commons, it is a thing not to be feared, being of so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite and contrarie practice much one to the other. This desperate state of things at home maketh the people for the most part to wish for some forein invasion, which they suppose to be the onely means to rid them of the heavy yoke of this tyrannous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

The first is the office of <hi>Dwoertsova</hi> or Steward of the houshold. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the office of the <hi>Chetfirds,</hi> which I comprehend under one, though it be divided into foure seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

parts, as was said before. The third is called <hi>Bulsha prech<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de,</hi> on the great income.</p>
            <p>As touching the first, which is the office of the Steward, it receiveth all the rents of the Emperours inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or Crown land, which they call <hi>Vochin.</hi> The <hi>Vochin</hi> or Crown land containeth in it 36. towns with the territories or hundreds belonging unto them. Whereof the chief that yield the greatest rents are these, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrisca, Corelska, Otser, Slobodey, Danielska, Moisaiskoy, Chara, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metzka, Strararouse, Bransove,</hi> &amp;c. The inhabitants or tenants of these and the other towns pay some rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, some other rent-duties (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Obrokey)</hi> as certain <hi>chetfirds,</hi> or measures of grain, wheat, rie, barley, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ow for the Emperours provision certain akers of ground, and to make the corn readie for his use, having for it an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of certain alters of ground for their own proper use.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45537:48"/>
This provision for the houshold, specially of grain served in by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is a great deal more then is spent in his house, or in other allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance served out in liverie, or for the Emperours honour, called <hi>Schalova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi> for which use there is bestowed very much both in grain, and other victuall. This surplus of provision is sold by the Steward to the best hand, and runneth into the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours treasurie.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Juan Vasilowich,</hi> father to this Emperour (who kept a more Princely and bountifull house then the Emperour now doth) this overplus of grain, and other incomes into the Stewards office, yielded to his treasurie not past 60. thousand rubbels yearly, but riseth now by good husbanding of the Steward <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Vasilowich Godonoe,</hi> to 230 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand rubbels a year. And this by the means of the Empresse &amp; her kindred, specially <hi>Borris Federowich Godonoe,</hi> that account it all their own that runs into the Emperours treasure. Much of this surplusage that riseth out of the rent-provision, is employed to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45537:48"/>
the paiment of the wages of his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The second office of receit called the <hi>Chetfirds</hi> (being divided into foure severall parts, as before was said) hath foure head-officers, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the ordering and government of the shires contained within their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Chetfirds</hi> have this also as a part of their office, to receive the <hi>Tagla</hi> &amp; <hi>Podat</hi> belonging to the Emperour, that riseth out of the foure <hi>Chetfirds</hi> or Quarters. The <hi>Tagla</hi> is a yearly rent or imposition raised upon every <hi>Wite</hi> or measure of grain that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within the land, gathered by sworn men, and brought into the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The <hi>Wite</hi> containeth sixtie <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firds.</hi> Every <hi>Chetfird</hi> is three bushels English, or little lesse. The <hi>Podat</hi> is an ordinary rent of money imposed upon every Soak, or Hundred within the whole Realm.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Tagla</hi> and <hi>Podat</hi> bring in yearly to the Offices of the <hi>Chetfirds</hi> a great summe of money: as may appear by the particulars here set

            <p>The third that is called the <hi>Bulsha Prechod</hi> or great Income receiveth all the customes that are gathered out of all the principall towns and cities within the whole Realm, besides the fees and other duties which rise out of divers smaller Offices, which are all brought into this office of <hi>Bulsha Prechod.</hi> The towns of most trade, that do yield greatest customes, are these here set down, <hi>Mosko, Smolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko, Vobsko, Novogrod Velica, Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarouse,

            <p>This may be said for certain, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45537:50"/>
the three tables of receits belonging to this office of <hi>Bulsha Prechod,</hi> when they receive least, account for thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> The first table 160000. rubbels. The second table 90000. rubbels. The third 70000. rubbels. So that there cometh into the office of <hi>Bulsha Prechod</hi> at the least reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as appeareth by their books of customes) out of these and other towns, and maketh the summe of 340000. rubbels a year. Besides this custome out of the towns of trade, there is received by this office of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha Prechod,</hi> the yearly rent of the common Bathstoves, and Cabacks, or Drinkinghouses, which pertain to the Emperour. Which (though it be uncertain for the just summe, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is certain and an ordinary matter, that the <hi>Russe</hi> will bathe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self aswell within as without) yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a large rent to the Emperours treasurie.</p>
            <p>There is besides a certain mulct or penaltie that groweth to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour out of every judgement or sentence that passeth in any of his courts of Record in all civill matters.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45537:50"/>
This penaltie or mulct is 20. <hi>Dingoes</hi> or pence upon every rubble or mark, and so ten in the hundred, which is paid by the partie that is convict by law. He hath besides for every name contained in the writs that passe out of these courts five <hi>Alteens.</hi> An <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> is five pence sterling or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. This is made good out of the office, whence the writ is taken forth. Thence it goeth to the office that keepeth the lesser seal, where it payeth as much more to the Emperours use. This riseth commonly to 3000. rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels a year or thereabouts. Further also out of the office of <hi>Roisbonia,</hi> where all fellonies are tried, is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Emperour the half part of fellons goods, the other half goeth the one part to the informer, the other to the officers.</p>
            <p>All this is brought into the office of <hi>Bulsha Prechod,</hi> or great income. Besides the overplus or remainder that is saved out of the land-rents, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to divers other offices: as namely to the office called <hi>Roserade,</hi> which hath lands and rents assigned unto it to pay the yearly salaries of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45537:51"/>
the souldiers or horsmen that are kept still in pay. Which in time of peace when they rest at home not employed in any service, is commonly cut off, and paid them by halfs, sometimes not the half: so that the remainder out of the <hi>Roserade</hi> office that is laid into the Emperours treasurie cometh for the most part every year to 250000. rubbels.</p>
            <p>In like sort (though not so much) is brought in the surplus out of the <hi>Strelletskoy</hi> offices which hath proper lands for the paiment of the <hi>Strelsey</hi> men or gunners, aswell those at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko,</hi> that are of the Emperours guard (12000. in ordinary) as on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and other garison towns and castles.

He resigned his kingdome to one <hi>Velica Knez Simeon,</hi> the Emperours sonne of <hi>Cazan,</hi> as though he meant to draw himself from all publick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to a quiet private life. Towards the end of the year he caused this new King to call in all Charters granted to Bishopricks and Monasteries,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45537:55"/>
which they had enjoyed many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before, which were all cancelled. This done (as in dislike of the fact and misgovernment of the new King) he resumed the scepter, and so was content (as in favour to the Church and religious men) that they should renew their charters, and take them of himself, reserving and annexing to the Crown so much of their lands as himself thought good.</p>
                  <p>By this practise he wrung from the Bishopricks and Monasteries (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the lands which he annexed to the Crown) an huge masse of money. From some 40. from some 50. from some an hundred thousand rubbels. And this as well for the increase of his treasurie, as to abare the ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his hard government, by a shew of worse in another man. Wherein his strange spirit is to be noted, that being hated of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (as himself knew well enough) yet would venture such a practise to set another in his saddle, that might have ridde away with his horse while himself walked by on foot.</p>

This may seem a strange kind of extortion, by such pleasant cavils to fliece his poore subjects in good sadnesse, but that it agreeth with the qualitie of those Emperours, and the miserable subjection of that poore Countrey. These and such like means are practised by the Emperours of <hi>Russia,</hi> to encrease their Treasurie.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the state of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie, or vulgar sort of people in the countrey of Russia.</head>
            <p>THe condition of the Commons and vulgar sort of people may partly be understood by that which already hath been said concerning the manner of their government, and the state of the Nobilitie, with the ordering of their Provinces, and chief towns of the land. And first, touching their libertie, how it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with them, it may appear by this, that they are reckoned in no degree
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45537:58"/>
at all, nor have any suffrage nor place in their <hi>Zabore,</hi> or High court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, where their laws and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick orders are concluded upon, which commonly tend to the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the commons. For the other two degrees <hi>viz.</hi> of the Nobilitie, and Clergie, which have a vote in the Parliaments (though farre from that libertie that ought to be in common consultations for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick benefit, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and proportion of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) are well contented that the whole burden shall light upon the Commons, so they may ease their own shoulders by laying all upon them. Again, into what servile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition their libertie is brought, not onely to the Prince, but to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (who themselves also are but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, specially of late years) it may further appear by their own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements in their supplications and other writings to any of the Nobles or chief officers of the Emperours, wherein they name and subscribe themselves <hi>Kolophey,</hi> that is, their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45537:58"/>
villains, or bondslaves, as they of the Nobilitie do unto the Emperour. This may truly be said of them, that there is no servant nor bondslave more awed by his Master, nor kept down in a more servile subjection, then the poore people are, and that universally, not onely by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour but by his Nobilitie, chief offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and souldiers. So that when a poore <hi>Mousick</hi> meeteth with any of them upon the high way, he must turn himself about, as not daring to look him on the face, and fall down with knocking of his head to the very ground, as he doth unto his Idol.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the lands, goods, and other possessions of the commons, they answer the name, and lie common indeed, without any fense against the rapine and spoil not onely of the highest, but of his Nobilitie, officers, and souldiers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the taxes, customes, seizures, and other publick exactions done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Emperour, they are so racked and pulled by the Nobles, officers, &amp; messengers sent abroad by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45537:59"/>
the Emperour in his publick affairs, specially in the <hi>Yammes</hi> (as they call them) and through fare towns, that you shall have many villages and towns of half a mile, and a mile long, stand all unhabited, the people being fled all into other places by reason of the extreme usage, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions done upon them. So that in the way towards <hi>Mosko,</hi> betwixt <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logda</hi> and <hi>Yaruslaveley</hi> (which is two nineties after their reckoning, little more then an hundred miles English) there are in sight fiftie <hi>Darieunes</hi> or villages at the least, some half a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, some a mile long, that stand vacant and desolate without any inhabitant. The like is in all other places of the realm, as is said by those that have better travelled the countrey then my self had time or occasion to do.</p>
            <p>The great oppression over the poore Commons maketh them to have no courage in following their trades: for that the more they have, the more danger they are in, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their goods, but of their lives also. And if they have any thing,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45537:59"/>
they conceal it all they can, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conveying it into Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, sometimes hiding it under the ground, and in woods, as men are wont to do where they are in fear of forein invasion: in so much that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times you shall see them afraid to be known to any <hi>Boiaren</hi> or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of such commodities as they have to sell. I have seen them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when they have laid open their commodities for a liking (as their principall furres and such like) to look still behind them, and towards every doore, as men in some fear, that looked to be set upon, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by some enemie: Whereof ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause, I found it to be this, That they have doubted left some Nobleman or <hi>Sinaboiarskey</hi> of the Emperour had been in companie, and so laid a train for them to prey upon their commodities perforce.</p>
            <p>This maketh the people (though otherwise hardened to bear any toil) to give themselves much to idlenesse and drinking, as passing for no more then from hand to mouth. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it cometh that the commodities
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45537:60"/>
of <hi>Russia</hi> (as was said before) as <hi>wax, tallow, hides, flax, hemp, &amp;c.</hi> grow and go abroad in farre lesse plentie then they were wont to do, because the people, being oppressed and spoiled of their gettings, are discouraged from their labours. Yet this one thing is much to be noted, that in all this oppression there were three brethren Merchants of late that traded together with one stock in common, that were found to be worth 300000. rubbels in money, besides lands, cattels, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. Which may partly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to their dwellings farre off from the eye of the Court, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Wichida</hi> a 1000. miles from <hi>Mosko,</hi> and more. The same are said by those that knew them to have set on work all the year long ten thousand men in making of salt, carriages by cart, and boat, hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wood, and such like, besides 5000. bondslaves at the least, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite and till their land. They had also their physitions, surgeons, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, and all manner of artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of <hi>Doutcees</hi> and others, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them. They are said to have
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45537:60"/>
paid to the Emperour for custome to the summe of 23000. rubbels a year (for which cause they were suffered to enjoy their trade) besides the maintaining of certain garrisons on the borders of <hi>Siberia,</hi> which were near unto them. Wherein the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was content to use their purse, till such time as they had got ground in <hi>Siberia,</hi> and made it habitable, by burning, and cutting down woods from <hi>Wichida</hi> to <hi>Perm,</hi> above a 1000. verse, and then took it all away from them perforce.</p>
            <p>But this in the end being envied and disdained, as a matter not stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their pollicie to have any so great, specially a <hi>Mousick,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour began first to pull from them by pieces, sometimes 20000 rubbels at a time, sometime more; till in the end their sons that now are, are well eased of their stock, and have but small part of their fathers substance, the rest being drawn all into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours treasurie. Their names were <hi>Jacove, Gregorie,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Onyka.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the qualitie of their people
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45537:61"/>
otherwise, though there seemeth to be in them some aptnesse to receive any art (as appeareth by the naturall wits in the men, and very children) yet they excell in no kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon art, much lesse in any learning, or literall kind of knowledge: which they are kept from of purpose, as they are also from all militarie practise, that they may be fitter for the servile condition wherein now they are, and have neither reason nor valour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt innovation. For this purpose also they are kept from travelling that they may learn nothing, nor see the fashions of other Countreys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. You shall seldome see a <hi>Russe</hi> a traveller, except he be with some Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, or that he make a scape out of his Countrey. Which hardly he can do, by reason of the borders that are watched so narrowly, and the punishment for any such attempt, which is death if he be taken, and all his goods confiscate. Onely they learn to write, and to reade, and that very few of them. Neither do they suffer any stranger willingly to come into their realm out of any civill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45537:61"/>
for the same cause, further then necessitie of uttering their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and taking in of forein doth enforce them to do.</p>
            <p>And therefore this year 1589. they consulted about the removing of all Merchants strangers to the border towns, to abide and have their resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie there, and to be more wary in admitting other strangers hereafter into the Inland parts of the realm, for fear of infection with better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and qualities then they have of their own. For the same purpose also they are kept within the bounds of their degree by the laws of their countrey, so that the sonne of a <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> artificer or husbandman, is ever a <hi>Mousick,</hi> artificer, &amp;c. and hath no means to aspire any higher, except, having learned to write and read, he attain to the preferment of a Priest, or Dyack. Their language is all one with the <hi>Slavonian,</hi> which is thought to have been derived from the <hi>Russe</hi> tongue, rather then the <hi>Russe</hi> from the <hi>Slavonian.</hi> For the people called <hi>Sclavi,</hi> are known to have had their beginning out of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45537:62"/>
have termed themselves of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest <hi>Sclavos,</hi> that is, famous or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, of the word <hi>Sclava,</hi> which in the <hi>Russe</hi> and <hi>Slavonian</hi> tongue signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth as much as <hi>Glory,</hi> or <hi>Fame.</hi> Though afterwards being subdued and trod upon by divers nations, the <hi>Italians</hi> their neighbours have turned the word to a contrary signification, and term every servant or peasant by the name of <hi>Sclave,</hi> as did the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> by the <hi>Getes</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> for the same reason. The <hi>Russe</hi> character or letter is no other then the <hi>Greek,</hi> somewhat distorted.</p>
            <p>Concerning their trades, diet, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, and such like, it is to be noted in a severall chapter of their private behaviour. This order that bindeth every man to keep his ranck, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall degree, wherein his forefathers lived before him, is more meet to keep the Subjects in a servile subjection, and so apt for this and the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, then to advance any virtue, or to breed any rare or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualitie in Nobilitie or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as having no further reward nor preferment whereunto they may
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45537:62"/>
bend their endeavours, and employ themselves to advance their estate, but rather procuring more danger to themselves, the more they excell in any noble or principall qualitie.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Of their publick Justice, and manner of proceeding in civill, and criminall matters.</head>
            <p>THeir courts of civill justice for matters of contract, and other of like sort, are of three kinds, the one being subject unto the other by way of appeal. The lowest Court (that seems to be appointed for some ease to the Subjects) is the office of the <hi>Gubnoy Starust,</hi> that signifieth an Alderman, and of the <hi>Sotskey Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rust,</hi> or Bailiff of the Soak or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, whereof I spake before in the ordering of the Provinces. These may end matters among their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours within their Soak, or severall Hundred, where they are appointed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45537:63"/>
under the Dukes and Diacks of the Provinces, to whom the parties may remove their matter, if they cannot be agreed by the said <hi>Gubnoy</hi> or <hi>Sots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy Starust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is kept in the head towns of every Province or Shire by the said Dukes and Diacks, that are deputies to the foure Lords of the <hi>Chetfirds,</hi> as before was said. From these courts they may appeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their suits to the chief Court, that is kept at the <hi>Mosko,</hi> where are resident the officers of the foure <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firds.</hi> These are the chief Justices or Judges, every of them in all civill matters that grow within their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Chetfird</hi> or quarter, and may be either commenced originally before them, or prosecuted out of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Courts of the Shires by way of appeal.</p>
            <p>Their commencing and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in civill actions is on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. First, the plaintiff putteth up his supplication, wherein he declareth the effect of his cause, or wrong done unto him. Whereupon is granted unto him a <hi>Wepis,</hi> or warrant, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45537:63"/>
he delivereth to the <hi>Prestave,</hi> or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, to do the arrest upon the partie whom he meaneth to implead, who upon the arrest is to put in sureties to answer the day appointed, or else standeth at the Sergeants devotion, to be kept safe by such means as he thinketh good.</p>
            <p>The Sergeants are many, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell for their hard and cruell dealing towards their prisoners; commonly they clap irons upon them, as many as they can bear, to wring out of them some larger fees. Though it be but for six pence, you shall see them go with chains on their legs, arms, and neck. When they come before the Judge, the plaintiff beginneth to declare his matter after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his supplication. As for At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys, Counsellours, Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Advocates to plead their cause for them, they have no such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but every man is to tell his own tale, and plead for himself so well as he can.</p>
            <p>If they have any witnesse, or other evidence, they produce it before the Judge. If they have none, or if the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45537:64"/>
truth of the cause cannot so well be discerned by the plea, or evidence on both parts, then the Judge asketh either partie (which he thinketh good, plaintife or defendant) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will <hi>kisse the Crosse</hi> upon that which he avoucheth or denieth. He that taketh the Crosse (being so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the Judge) is accounted clear, and carrieth away the matter. This ceremonie is not done within the Court or Office, but the partie is carried to the Church by an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, and there the ceremonie is done: the money in the mean while hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a nail, or else lying at the idols feet, ready to be delivered to the partie as soon as he hath kissed the Crosse before the said Idol.</p>
            <p>This kissing of the Crosse, called <hi>Creustina chelovania,</hi> is as their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall oath, and accounted with them a very holy thing, which no man will dare to violate or prophane with a false allegation. If both parties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to kisse the Crosse in a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie matter, then they draw lots. The better lot is supposed to have the ight, and beateth away the matter.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45537:64"/>
So the partie convicted is adjudged to pay the debt or penaltie whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and withall to pay the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours fees, which is twentie pence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every mark, as before hath been noted.</p>
            <p>When the matter is thus ended, the partie convicted is delivered to the Sergeant, who hath a writ for his warrant out of the office to carry him to the <hi>Praveush</hi> or Righter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, if presently he pay not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or content not the partie. This <hi>Praveush</hi> or Righter is a place near to the office, where such as have sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence passed against them, and refuse to pay that which is adjudged, are beaten with great cudgels on the shinnes, and calves of their legs. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very forenoon from eight to eleven, they are set on the <hi>Praveush,</hi> and beat in this sort till the money be paid: The afternoon and night time, they are kept in chains by the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, except they put in sufficient sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for their appearance at the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veush</hi> at the houre appointed.

And if the price of them do not amount to the full payment, the creditour may take them to be his bondslaves, for years or for ever, according as the value of the debt requireth.</p>
            <p>Such kind of suits as lack direct evidence, or stand upon conjectures and circumstances to be weighed by the Judge, draw of great length, and yield great advantage to the Judge &amp; officers. If the suit be upon a bond, or bill, they have for the most part good and speedy justice. Their bonds or bills are drawn in a very plain sort, after this tenour, <hi>I Juan Vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo have borrowed of Alphonasse De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentio the summe of one hundred rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of going money of Mosko, from the Kreshenea</hi> (or hallowing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>untill the Saburney voscreshenea</hi> (or Counsell Sunday) <hi>without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45537:65"/>
And if this money rest unpayed after that day, then be shall give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest upon the said money, after the common rate, as it goeth among the people,</hi> viz. <hi>for every five the sixth rubbel. Upon this there are witnesses,</hi> Micheta Sydroveskoy, &amp;c. Subscribed, <hi>This bill have I written Gabriel Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covelesni, in the year</hi> 796. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and debter (if he can write) endorse their names on the back side of the bill. Other signing, or sealing have they none.</p>
            <p>When any is taken for a matter of crime (as treason, murder, theft, and such like) he is first brought to the Duke and Diack that are for the Province where the partie is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, by whom he is examined. The manner of examination in such cases is all by torture, as scourging with whips made of sinews, or whitleather (called the <hi>Pudkey)</hi> as bigge as a mans finger, which giveth a sore lash, and entreth into the flesh, or by tying to a spit and rosting at the fire, sometimes by breaking and wresting one of their ribs with a pair of hot tongues, or cutting their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45537:66"/>
flesh under the nails, and such like.</p>
            <p>The examination thus taken, with all the proofs &amp; evidences that can be alledged against the partie, is it sent up to the <hi>Mosko</hi> to the Lord of the <hi>Chetfird</hi> or fourth part under whom the Province is, and by him is presented to the Counsell table, to be read and sentenced there, where onely judgement is given in matter of life and death, and that by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon information, though they never saw nor heard the partie, who is kept still in prison where the fact was committed, and never sent up to the place where he is tried. If they find the partie guiltie, they give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the fact: which is sent down by the Lord of the <hi>Chetfird</hi> to the Duke and Diack to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien. The prisoner is carried to the place of execution with his hands bound, and a wax candle burning held betwixt his fingers.</p>
            <p>Their capitall punishments are hanging, heading, knocking on the head, drowning, putting under the ice, setting on a stake, and such like.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45537:66"/>
But for the most part the prisoners that are condemned in summer, are kept for the winter, to be knockt in the head, and put under the ice. This is to be understood of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon persons. For theft, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they be committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a poore <hi>Mousick</hi> by one of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, are not lightly punished, nor yet is he called to any account for it. Their reason is, because they are accounted their <hi>Kolophey</hi> or bondslaves. If by some <hi>Sinaboiars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> or Gentleman-souldier a murder or theft be committed, peradventure he shall be imprisoned at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours pleasure. If the manner of the fact be very notorious, he is whipped perchance, and this is commonly all the punishment that is inflicted upon them.</p>
            <p>If a man kill his own servant, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing is said unto him, for the same reason, because he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be his <hi>Kolophey,</hi> or bondslave, and so to have right over his very head. The most is some small mulct to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, if the partie be rich:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45537:67"/>
and so the quarrell is made rather against the purse, then against the injustice. They have no written law, save onely a small book that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the time, and manner of their sitting, order in proceeding, and such other judiciall forms and circumstances, but nothing to direct them to give sentence upon right or wrong. Their onely law is their <hi>Speaking Law,</hi> that is, the pleasure of the Prince, and of his Magistrates and officers. Which sheweth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition of this poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are forced to have them for their law, and direction of justice, against whose injustice and extreme oppression they had need to be arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many good and strong laws.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. Their forces for the warres, with the chief officers and their salaries.</head>
            <p>THe souldiers of <hi>Russia</hi> are called <hi>Sinaboiarskey,</hi> or the sonnes of Gentlemen, because they are all of that degree, by virtue of their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary profession. For every souldier in <hi>Russia</hi> is a gentleman, and none are gentlemen, but onely the souldiers, that take it by descent from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours: so that the sonne of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (which is born a souldier) is ever a gentleman, and a souldier withall, and professeth nothing else but militarie matters. When they are of years able to bear arms, they come to the office of <hi>Roserade,</hi> or great Constable, and there present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: who entreth their names, and allotteth them certain lands to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their charges, for the most part the same that their fathers enjoyed. For the lands assigned to maintain the army are ever certain, annexed to this office, without improving or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45537:68"/>
detracting one foot. But that if the Emperour have sufficient in wages, the rooms being full so farre as the land doth extend already, they are, many times deferred, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing allowed them, except some one portion of the land be divided into two. Which is a cause of great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der within that countrey, when a souldier that hath many children shall have sometimes but one enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Emperours pay. So that the rest having nothing are forced to live by unjust and wicked shifts, that tend to the hurt and oppression of the <hi>Mousick,</hi> or common sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This inconvenience groweth by maintaining his forces in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all succession. The whole number of his souldiers in continuall pay is this: First, he hath of his <hi>Dworaney,</hi> that is, Pensioners, or Guard of his person, to the number of 15000. horsemen, with their captains, and other officers, that are alwayes in a readinesse.</p>
            <p>Of these 15000. horsemen, there are three sorts or degrees, which differ as well in estimation as in wages
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45537:68"/>
one degree from another. The first sort of them is called <hi>Dworaney Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shey,</hi> or the company of head Pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that have some an hundred, some fourescore rubbels a year, and none under 70. The second sort are called <hi>Seredney Dworaney,</hi> or the middle rank of Pensioners. These have sixtie, or fiftie rubbels by the year, none under fourtie. The third and lowest sort are the <hi>Dyta Boiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skey,</hi> that is, the low Pensioners. Their salarie is thirtie rubbels a year for him that hath most, some have but five and twentie, some twentie, none under twelve. Whereof the half part is paid them at the <hi>Mosko,</hi> the other half in the field by the Generall when they have any warres, and are employed in service. When they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their whole pay, it amounteth to 55000. rubbels by the year.</p>
            <p>And this is their wages, besides lands allotted to every one of them, both to the greater and the lesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their degrees. Whereof he that hath least, hath to yield him twen tie rubbels, or marks by the year. Besides these 15000. horsemen, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45537:69"/>
are of better choice (as being the Emperours own guard when himself goeth to the warres, not unlike the Romane souldiers called <hi>Praetoriam)</hi> are 110, men of speciall account for their Nobilitie and trust, which are chosen by the Emperour, and have their names registred, that find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them for the Emperours ware to the number of 65000. horsemen, with all necessaries meet for the wartes after the <hi>Russe</hi> manner.</p>
            <p>To this end they have yearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance made by the Emperour for themselves, and their companies, to the summe of 40000. rubbels. And these 65000. are to repair to the field every year on the borders towards the <hi>Chrim Tartar</hi> (except they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for some other service) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be warres-with the <hi>Tartars</hi> or not. This might seem peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture somewhat dangerous for some state to have so great forces under the command of Noblemen to assemble every year to one certain place. But the matter is so used, as that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can grow to the Emperour, or his state by this means. 1. Because these
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45537:69"/>
Noblemen are many, to wit, an 110 in all, and changed by the Emperour so oft as he thinketh good. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have their livings of the Emperour, being otherwise but of very small revenue, and receive this yearly pay of 40000. rubbels, when it is presently to be paid forth again to the souldiers that are under them. 3. Because for the most part they are about the Emperours person, being of his Councel, either speciall, or at large. 4. They are rather as payma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters then Captains to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, themselves not going forth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to the warres, save when some of them are appointed by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall order from the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. So the whole number of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are ever in a readinesse and in continuall pay, are 80000, a few more or lesse.</p>
            <p>If he have need of a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (which seldome falleth out) then he entertaineth of those <hi>Sinaboiar skey,</hi> that are out of pay, so many as he needeth: and if yet he want of his number, he giveth charge to his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, that hold lands of him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

bring into the field every man a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable number of his servants (called <hi>Kolophey,</hi> such as till his lands) with their furniture, according to the just number that he intendeth to make. Which, the service being done, presently lay in their weapons, and return to their servile occupations again.</p>
            <p>Of footmen that are in continuall pay he hath to the number of 12000. all Gunners, called <hi>Strelsey:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 5000. are to attend about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Mosko,</hi> or any other place where the Emperour shall abide, and 2000. (which are called <hi>Stremaney Strelsey,</hi> or Gunners at the stirrop) about his own person at the very Court or house where himself lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The rest are placed in his gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Towns, till there be occasion to have them in the field, and receive for their salarie or stipend every man seven rubbels a year, besides twelve measures apiece of Rie and Oats. Of mercenarie Souldiers, that are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (whom they call <hi>Nimschey)</hi> they have at this time 4300. of <hi>Polonians:</hi> of <hi>Chirchasses</hi> (that are under the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians)</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:45537:70"/>
about 4000. whereof 3500. are abroad in his garisons: of <hi>Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> about 150. of <hi>Greeks, Turks, Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedens,</hi> all in one band, an 100. or thereabouts. But these they use onely upon the <hi>Tartar</hi> side, and against the <hi>Siberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> as they do the <hi>Tartar</hi> souldiers (whom they hire sometimes, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the present) on the other side against the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Sweden:</hi> thinking it best policie so to use their service upon the contrary bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>The chief Captains or leaders of these forces, according to their names and degrees, are these which follow: First, the <hi>Voyavodey Bulshaia,</hi> that is, the <hi>Great Captain,</hi> or <hi>Lieutenant</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall under the Emperour. This commonly is one of the foure houses of the chief Nobilitie of the land, but so chosen otherwise, as that he is of small valour or practice in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall matters, being-thought to serve that turn so much the better, if he bring no other parts with him save the countenance of his Nobilitie, to be liked of by the souldiers for that,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45537:71"/>
and nothing else. For in this point they are very warie, that these two, to wit, nobilitie and power meet not both in one, specially if they see wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome withall, or aptnesse for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</p>
            <p>These great <hi>Voiavod</hi> or Generall at this present in their warres is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly one of these foure: <hi>Knez Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Juanowich Methisloskey, Knez Juan Michailowich Glinskoy, chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaskoy,</hi> and <hi>Trowbetskoy,</hi> all of great Nobilitie, but of very simple qualitie otherwise: though in <hi>Glinskoy</hi> (as they say) there is somewhat more then in the rest. To make up this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the <hi>Voiavod</hi> or Generall, there is some other joyned with him as <hi>Lieutenant Generall,</hi> of farre lesse nobilitie, but of more valour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the warres then he, who ordereth all things that the other countenanceth. At this time their principall man, and most used in their warres, is one <hi>Knez Demetrie Juanowith Forestine,</hi> an ancient and expert captain, and one that hath done great service (as they say) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Polonian.</hi> Next
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45537:71"/>
under the <hi>Voiavod</hi> and his <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall</hi> are foure other that have the marshalling of the whole army divided among them, and may be called the Marshalls of the field.</p>
            <p>Every man hath his quarter or fourth part under him. Whereof the first is called the <hi>Prava Polskoy,</hi> or right wing; the second is the <hi>Levey Polskoy,</hi> or left wing; the third is <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy Polskoy,</hi> or the broken band, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause out of this there are chosen to send abroad upon any sudden exploit, or to make a rescue, or supplie, as occasion doth require; the fourth, <hi>Storeshovoy Polskoy,</hi> or the warding band. Every one of these foure Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalls have two other under them (eight in all) that twice every week at the least must muster and train their severall wings or bands, and hold and give justice for all faults &amp; disorders committed in the camp.</p>
            <p>And these eight are commonly chosen out of the 110. (which I spake of before) that receive and deliver the pay to the souldiers. Under these eight are divers other Captains, as the <hi>Gulavoy,</hi> Captains of thousands,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45537:72"/>
five hundreds, and 100. the <hi>Petyde Setskoy</hi> or Captains of fifties, and the <hi>Decetskies</hi> or Captains of tens.</p>
            <p>Besides the <hi>Voiavoda</hi> or generall of the Armie (spoken of before) they have two other that bear the name of <hi>Voiavoda:</hi> whereof one is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the great Ordinance (called <hi>Naradna Voiavoda)</hi> who hath divers under Officers, necessary for that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the other is called the <hi>Voiavoda gulavoy,</hi> or the walking Captain, that hath allowed him 1000. good horsemen of principall choice, to range and spie abroad, and hath the charge of the running Castle, which we are to speak of in the Chapter following. All these Captains and men of charge must once every day resort to the <hi>Bulsha Voiavoda,</hi> or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Armie, to know his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and to inform him if there be any requisite matter pertaining to their office.</p>

            <p>WHen wars are towards (which they fail not of lightly every year with the <hi>Tartar,</hi> and many times with the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Sweden)</hi> the foure Lords of the <hi>Chetfirds</hi> send forth their summons in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours name to all the Dukes and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks of the Provinces, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the head Towns of every Shire, that all the <hi>Sinaboiarskey,</hi> or sonnes of gentlemen, make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to such a border where the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is to be done, at such a place, and by such a day, and there present themselves to such and such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains. When they come to the place assigned them in the summons or proclamation, their names are taken by certain Officers that have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for that purpose from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serade,</hi> or high Constable, as Clerks of the Bands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:45537:73"/>
If any make default and fall at the day, he is mulcted, and punished very severely. As for the Generall and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chief Captains, they are sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Emperours own hand, with such Commission and charge as he thinketh behovefull for the present service. When the souldiers are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, they are reduced into their Bands, and Companies, under their severall Captains of tennes, fifties, hundreds, thousands, &amp;c. and these Bands into foure <hi>Polskois</hi> or Legions (but of farre greater numbers then Romane Legions were) under their foure great Leaders, which also have the authoritie of Marshals of the field (as was said before.)</p>
            <p>Concerning their armour, they are but slightly appointed. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon horseman hath nothing else but his bow in his case under his right arm, and his quiver, and sword hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the left side, except some few that bear a case of dagges, or a jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, or short staff along their horse side. The under-captains will have commonly some piece of armour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as a shirt of male, or such like.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45537:73"/>
The Generall with the other chief Captains and men of Nobilitie will have their horse very richly furnished, their Saddles of cloth of gold, their Bridles fair bossed and tasselled with gold and silk fringe, bestudded with pearl and precious stones, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in very fair armour, which they call <hi>Bullatnoy,</hi> made of fair shining steel, yet covered commonly with cloth of gold, and edged round with arm in furre, his steel helmet on his head of a very great price, his sword how and arrows at his side, his spear in his hand, with another fair hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and his <hi>Shesta pera,</hi> or horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans sceptre carried before him: Their swords, bows, and arrows are of the Turkish fashion. They practise like the <hi>Tartar</hi> to shoot forwards and backwards, as they flie and retire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Strelsey</hi> or footman hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his piece in his hand, his striking hatchet at his back, and his sword by his side. The stock of his piece is not made caliever-wise, but with a plain and strair stock (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a fowling piece) the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is rudely and unartificially made,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45537:74"/>
very heavie, yet shooteth but a very small bullet. As for their provision of victuall, the Emperour alloweth none, either for Captain, or souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, neither provideth any for them, except peradventure some corn for their money. Every man is to bring sufficient for himself, to serve his turn for foure moneths, and if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to give order for more to be brought unto him to the Camp from his tenant that tilleth his land, or some other place. One great help they have, that for lodging and diet every <hi>Russe</hi> is prepared to be a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier beforehand; though the chief Captains and other of account carry tents with them after the fashion of ours, with some better provision of victuall then the rest. They bring with them commonly into the camp for victuall a kind of dried bread (which they call <hi>Sucharie)</hi> with some store of meal, which they tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with water, and so make it into a ball or small lump of dough, called <hi>Tollockno,</hi> and this they eat raw in stead of bread. Their meat is bacon, or some other flesh or fish dried, after
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45537:74"/>
the Dutch manner. If the <hi>Russe</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier were as hardie to execute an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, as he is hard to bear out toil and travell, or were otherwise as apt and well trained for the warres, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>They have drummes besides of a huge bignesse, which they carry with them upon a board laid on foure hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that are sparred together with chains, every drumme having eight strikers or drummers, besides trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and shaums, which they sound after a wild manner, much different from ours. When they give any charge, or make any invasion, they make a great hallow or shout altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as loud as they can, which with the sound of their trumpets, shaums, and drummes, maketh a confused and horrible noise. So they set on first discharging their arrows, then dealing with their swords, which they use in a braverie to shake and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45537:75"/>
brandish over their heads, before they come to strokes.</p>
            <p>Their footmen (because otherwise they want order in leading are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly placed in some ambush or place of advantage, where they may most annoy the enemie, with least hurt to themselves. If it be a set bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or if any great invasion be made upon the <hi>Russe</hi> borders by the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> they are set within the <hi>running</hi> or <hi>moving Castle</hi> (called <hi>Beza</hi> or <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay gorod)</hi> which is carried about with them by the <hi>Voiavoda Gulavoy</hi> (or the <hi>walking Generall)</hi> whom I spake of before. This walking or moving Castle is so framed, that it may be set up in length (as occasion doth require) the space of one, two, three, foure, five, six, or seven miles: for so long it will reach. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a double wall of wood to defend them on both sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind and before, with a space of three yards or thereabout betvvixt the two sides: so that they may stand within it, and have room enough to charge and discharge their pieces, and to use their other weapons. It is closed at
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45537:76"/>
both ends, and made with loop holes on either side, to lay out the nose of their piece, or to push forth any other weapon. It is carried with the Armie wheresoever it goeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken to pieces, and so layed on carts sparred together, and drawn by horses that are not seen, by reason that they are covered with their carriage as with a shelf or penthouse. When it is brought to the place where it is to be used (which is devised and chosen out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the <hi>walking voiavod)</hi> it is planted so much as the present use requireth, sometime a mile long, sometimes two, sometimes three, or more: Which is soon done without the help of any Carpenter, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because the timber is so framed to clasp together one piece within an other, as is easily understood by those that know the manner of the <hi>Russe</hi> building.</p>
            <p>In this Castle standeth their shot well fenced for advantage, specially against the <hi>Tartar,</hi> that bringeth no ordinance, nor other weapon into the field, with him, save his sword,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45537:76"/>
and bow and arrows. They have also within it divers field-pieces, which they use as occasion doth require. Of pieces for the field they carrie no great store, when they warre against the <hi>Tartar:</hi> but when they deal with the <hi>Polonian</hi> (of whose forces they make more account) they go better furnished with all kind of munition, and other necessary provisions. It is thought that no prince of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath better store of munition then the <hi>Russe</hi> Emperour.

            <p>The <hi>Russe</hi> souldier is thought to be better at his defence within some castle or town, then he is abroad at a set pitched field.

            <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of their Colonies, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their conquests, or purchases by force.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Russe</hi> Emperours of late years have very much enlarged their dominions and territories. Their first conquest after the Dukedome of <hi>Mosko</hi> (for before that time they were but Dukes of <hi>Volodomer,</hi> as before was said) was the Citie and Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45537:77"/>
of <hi>Novograd</hi> on the West<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Northwest side, which was no small enlargement of their dominion, and strengthning to them for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the rest. This was done by <hi>Juan</hi> great grandfather to <hi>Theodore</hi> now Emperour, about the year 1480. The same began likewise to encroch upon the countreys of <hi>Lituania,</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> but the conquest onely intended, and attempted by him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some part of those countreys, was pursued and performed by his sonne <hi>Basileus,</hi> who first wonne the Citie and Dukedome of <hi>Plesko,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Citie and Dukedome of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> and many other fair towns, with a large territorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto them, about the year 1514. These victories against the <hi>Lettoes</hi> or <hi>Lituanians</hi> in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> their Duke, he atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rather by advantage of civil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions, and treasons among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, then by any great policie, or force of his own. But all this was lost again by his sonne <hi>Juan Vasilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> about eight or nine years past, upon composition with the <hi>Polonian</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:45537:78"/>
king <hi>Stepan Batore:</hi> whereunto he was forced by the advantages which the <hi>Pole</hi> had then of him, by reason of the foil he had given him before, and the disquietnesse of his own state at home. Onely the <hi>Russe</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at this time hath left him on that side his countrey, the cities of <hi>Smolensko, Vitobsko, Cheringo</hi> and <hi>Beala gorod</hi> in <hi>Lituania.</hi> In <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> not a town, nor one foot of ground.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Basileus</hi> first conquered those countreys, he suffered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to keep their possessions, and to inhabite all their towns, onely pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a tribute, under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his <hi>Russe</hi> Captains. But by their conspiracies and attempts not long after, he was taught to deal more surely with them. And so coming upon them the second time, he killed and carried away with him three parts of foure, which he gave or sold to the <hi>Tartars</hi> that served him in those warres, and in stead of them placed there his <hi>Russes,</hi> so many as might overmatch the rest, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain garrisons of strength besides.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45537:78"/>
Wherein notwithstanding this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight was committed, for that (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away with him the upland, or countrey people that should have tilled the ground, and might easily have been kept in order without any danger, by other good policies) he was driven afterwards many years together, to victuall the countrey (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the great towns) out of his own countrey of <hi>Russia,</hi> the soil lying there in the mean while waste, and untilled.</p>
            <p>The like fell out at the port of <hi>Narue</hi> in <hi>Liefland,</hi> where his sonne <hi>Juan Vasilowich</hi> devised to build a town, and a castle on the other side the river, called <hi>Juan gorod,</hi> to keep the town and countrey in subjection. The Castle he caused to be so built, and fortified, that it was thought to be invincible. And when it was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, for reward to the Architect (that was a <hi>Polonian)</hi> he put out both his eyes, to make him unable to build the like again. But having left the natives all within their own countrey, without abating their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or strength, the town and castle
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45537:79"/>
not long after was betrayed, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred again to the king of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the South-east-side they have got the kingdomes of <hi>Cazan,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracan.</hi> These were wonne from the <hi>Tartar,</hi> by the late Emperour <hi>Juan Vasilowich,</hi> father to the Emperour that now is: the one about 35. the other about 33. years ago North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward out of the countrey of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,</hi> he hath laid unto his realm, a great breadth and length of ground, from <hi>wichida</hi> to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Obba,</hi> about a 1000. miles space: so that he is bold to write himself now, <hi>The great Commander of Siberia.</hi>

            <p>That which the <hi>Russe</hi> hath in his present possession, he keepeth on this sort. In his foure cheif border towns

of <hi>Vobsko, Smolensko, Ast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

These he changeth sometime every year, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time every second or third year, but exceedeth not that time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon very speciall trust, and good liking of the partie, and his service: lest by enlarging of their time, they might grow into some familiaritie with the enemie (as some have done) being so farre out of sight.</p>
            <p>The towns besides are very strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fenced with trenches, castles, and store of munition, and have garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons within them, to the number of two or three thousand apiece. They are stored with victuall if any siege should come upon them, for the space of two or three years beforehand.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45537:80"/>
The foure castles of <hi>Smolensko, Vobs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko, Cazan</hi> and <hi>Astracan,</hi> he hath made very strong to bear out any siege: so that it is thought that those towns are impregnable.</p>
            <p>As for the countreys of <hi>Pechora</hi> and <hi>Permia,</hi> and that part of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,</hi> which he hath now under him, they are kept by as easie means, as they were first got. <hi>viz.</hi> rather by shewing, then by using of arms. First, he hath stored the Countrey with as many <hi>Russes</hi> as there are natives, and hath there some few souldiers in garrison, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eep them under. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Officers and Magistrates there, are of his own <hi>Russe</hi> people, and he changeth them very often, <hi>viz.</hi> every year twise or thrise: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there be no great fear of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation. Thirdly, he divideth them into many small governments, like a staff broke in many small pieces: so that they have no strength being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which was but little neither when they were all in one. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he provideth that the people of the Countrey have neither armour, nor
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45537:80"/>
money, being taxed and pilled so often as he thinketh good without any means to shake off that yoke, or to relieve themselves.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Siberia</hi> (where he goeth on in pursuing his conquest) he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers castles and garrisons, to the number of six thousand souldiers of <hi>Russes,</hi> and <hi>Polonians,</hi> and sendeth many new supplies thither, to plant and to inhabite, as he winneth ground. At this time besides he hath gotten the kings brother of <hi>Siberia,</hi> allured by certain of his Capt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This may be said of the <hi>Russe</hi> practise, wheresoever he ruleth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by right of inheritance, or by conquest, First, he bereaveth the countrey of armour and other means of defence, which he permitteth to none but to his <hi>Boiarskeis</hi> onely. Secondly, he robbeth them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45537:81"/>
of their money, and dommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and leaveth them hare with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their bodies and lives, within certain years, compasse. Thirdly, he renteth and divideth his territories into many small pieces by severall governments, so that none hath much under him to make any strength, though he had other opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities. Fourthly, he governeth his countreys by men of small reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no power of themselves, and strangers in those places where their government lieth. Fiftly, he changeth his governours once a year ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there grow no great liking nor intirenesse betwixt the people and them, nor acquaintance with the enemy if they lie towards the borders. Sixthly, he appointeth in one and the same place adversary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the one to be as controller of the other, as the Dukes and Diacks: where (by means of their envies and emulations) there is lesse hurt to be feared by their agreement, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is better informed what is done amisse.

known to these parts of <hi>Europe</hi> then are the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that are further off from us (as being of <hi>Asia)</hi> and divided into many tribes, different both in name, and government one from another. The greatest and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest of them is the <hi>Chrim Tartar,</hi> (whom some call the <hi>Great Cham)</hi> that lieth South, and Southeastward from <hi>Russia,</hi> and doth most annoy the Countrey by often invasions, commonly once every year, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entring very farre within the inland parts. In the year 1571. he came as farre as the citie of <hi>Mosko,</hi> with an armie of 200000. men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any battel or resistance at all, for that the <hi>Russe</hi> Emperour (then <hi>(Juan Vasilowich)</hi> leading forth his armie to encounter with him, marched a wrong way: but as it was thought of very purpose, as not daring to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the field, by reason that he doubted his Nobilitie, and chief Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, of a meaning to betray him to the <hi>Tartar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The citie he took not, but fired the Suburbs, which by reason of the buildings (which is all of wood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45537:82"/>
any stone, brick, or lime, save certain outrooms) kindled so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and went on with such rage as that it consumed the greatest part of the citie almost within the space of foure houres, being of 30. miles or more of compasse. Then might you have seen a lamentable spectacle: besides the huge and mighty flame of the citie all on light fire, the people burning in their houses and streets, but most of all of such as laboured to passe out of the gates furthest from the enemie, where meeting together in a mighty throng, and so pressing every man to prevent another, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themselves so fast within the gate, and streets near unto it, as that three ranks walked one upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers head, the uppermost treading down those that were lower: so that there perished at that time (as was said) by the fire and the presse, the number of 800000. people or more.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chrim</hi> thus having fired the Citie, and fed his eyes with the sight of it all on a light flame, returned with his armie, and sent to the <hi>Russe</hi> Emperour a knife (as was said) to

The prnicipall cause of this continuall quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Russe</hi> and the <hi>Chrim,</hi> is for the right of certain border parts claimed by the <hi>Tartar,</hi> but possessed by the <hi>Russe.</hi> The <hi>Tartar</hi> alledgeth that besides <hi>Astracan &amp; Cazan</hi> (that are the ancient possession of the East <hi>Tartar)</hi> the whole countrey from his bounds North and Westward, so farre as the citie of <hi>Mosko,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko</hi> it self, pertaineth to his right. Which seemeth to have been true by the report of the <hi>Russes</hi> themselves, that tell of a certain homage that was done by the <hi>Russe</hi> Emperour every year to the Great <hi>Chrim</hi> or <hi>Cham,</hi> the <hi>Russe</hi> Emperour standing on foot and feeding the <hi>Chrims</hi> horse (himself sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his back) with oats out of his own cap, in stead of a bowl or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that within the castle of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko.</hi> And this homage (they say) was done till the time of <hi>Basileus</hi> grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to this man. Who surprising
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45537:83"/>
the <hi>Chrim</hi> Emperour by a stratagem, done by one of his Nobilitie (called <hi>Juan Demetrowich Belschey)</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this ransome, <hi>viz.</hi> with the changing of this homage into a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of furres: which afterwards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was denied to be paied by this Emperours father.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they continue the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, the <hi>Russe</hi> defending his countrey, and that which he hath wonne, the <hi>Chrim Tartar</hi> invading him once or twice every year, sometime about Whitsuntide, but oftner in Harvest. What time if the great <hi>Cham</hi> or <hi>Chrim</hi> come in his own person, he bringeth with him a great armie of 100000. or 200000. men. Otherwise they make short and sudden roads into the countrey with lesser numbers, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about the list of the border as wild geese flie, invading and retiring where they see advantage.</p>
            <p>Their common practice (being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry populous) is to make divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and so drawing the <hi>Russe</hi> to one or two places of the frontiers, to invade at some other place that is left without defence. Their manner
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45537:84"/>
of fight, or ordering of their forces, is much after the <hi>Russe</hi> manner (spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before) save that they are all horsemen, and carrie nothing else but a bow, a sheaf of arrows, and a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con sword after the <hi>Turkish</hi> fashion. They are very expert horsemen, and use to shoot as readily backward as forward. Some will have a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans staff like to a bore spear, besides their other weapons. The common souldier hath no other armour then his ordinary apparel, <hi>viz.</hi> a black sheeps skin with the wool side out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the day-time, and inward in the night-time, with a cap of the same. But their <hi>Marseys</hi> or Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men imitate the <hi>Turk</hi> both in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and armour. When they are to passe over a river with their armie, they tie three or foure horses toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taking long poles or pieces of wood, bind them fast to the tails of their horse: so sitting on the poles they drive their horse over. At handie strokes (when they come to joyn bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel) they are accounted farre better men then the <hi>Russe</hi> people, fierce by nature, but more hardie and bloudie
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45537:84"/>
by continuall practice of warre, as men knowing no arts of peace, nor any civil practice.</p>
            <p>Yet their subtiltie is more then may seem to agree with their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition. By reason they are practised to invade continually, and to robbe their neighbours that border about them, they are very pregnant and ready-witted to devise strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems upon the sudden for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage: As in their warre against <hi>Beala</hi> the fourth king of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> whom they invaded with 500000. men, and obtained against him a great victorie. Where among other, having slain his Chancellour, called <hi>Nicholas Schinick,</hi> they found about him the Kings privie seal. Whereupon they devised presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly to counterfeit letters in the Kings name, to the cities and towns next about the place, where the field was fought, with charge that in no case they should convey themselves; and their goods out of their dwellings, where they might abide safely without all fear of danger, and not leave the countrey desolate to the possession of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45537:85"/>
so vile and barbarous an enemie, as was the <hi>Tartar</hi> nation, terming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in all reprochfull manner. For notwithstanding he had lost his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, with some few straglers that had marched disorderly, yet he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but to recover that lossé, with the accesse of a notable victorie, if the savage <hi>Tartar</hi> durst abide him in the field. To this purpose having written their letters in the <hi>Polish</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by certain young men whom they took in the field, and signed them with the Kings seal, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched them forth to all the quarters of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> that lay near about the place. Whereupon the <hi>Ungarians,</hi> that were now flying away with their goods, wives, and children, upon the rumour of the Kings overthrow, taking comfort of these counter feit letters, stayed at home. And so were made a prey, being surprised on the sudden by this huge number of these <hi>Tartars,</hi> that had compassed them about before they were aware.</p>
            <p>When they besiege a town or fort, they offer much parley, and send ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny flattering messages to perswade a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45537:85"/>
surrendrie, promising all things that the inhabitants will require; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once possessed of the place, they use all manner of hostilitie, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie. This they do upon a rule they have, <hi>viz.</hi> that Justice is to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed but towards their own. They encounter not lightly, but they have some ambush, whereunto (having once shewed themselves, and made some short conflict) they retire, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed for fear, and so draw the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into it if they can. But the <hi>Russe,</hi> being well acquainted with their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, is more warie of them. When they come a roving with some small number, they set on horseback coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit shapes of men, that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may seem greater.</p>
            <p>When they make any onset their manner is to make a great-shout, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all out together, <hi>Olla, Billa, Olla Billa, God help us, God help us.</hi> They contemne death so much, as that they choose rather to die then to yield to their enemie, and are seen when they are slain to bite the very weapon, when they are past striking, or help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves. Wherein appeareth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45537:86"/>
how different the <hi>Tartar</hi> is in his desperate courage from the <hi>Russe</hi> and <hi>Turk.</hi> For the <hi>Russe</hi> Souldier, if he begin once to retire, putteth all his safetie in his speedie flight; and if once he be taken by his enemie, he neither defendeth himself, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth for his life, as reckoning straight to die: The <hi>Turk</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he is past hope of escaping, falleth to intreatie, and casteth away his weapon, offereth both his hands, and holdeth them up, as it were to be tied, hoping to save his life by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himself bondslave.</p>
            <p>The chief bootie the <hi>Tartars</hi> seek for in all their warres, is to get store of captives, specially young boyes and girls, whom they sell to the <hi>Turks,</hi> or other their neighbours. To this purpose they take with them great baskets made like bakers pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers to carrie them tenderly, and if any of them happen to tire, or to be sick on the way, they dash him against the ground, or some tree, and so leave him dead: The souldiers are not troubled with keeping the captives, and the other bootie, for hindering
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45537:86"/>
the execution of their warres, but they have certain bands that intend nothing else, appointed of purpose to receive and keep the captives and the other prey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Russe</hi> borders (being used to their invasions lightly every year in the summer) keep few other cattel on the border parts, save swine onely, which the <hi>Tartar</hi> will not touch nor drive away with him: for that he is of the <hi>Turkish</hi> religion, and will eat no swines flesh. Of Christ our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our they confesse as much as doth the <hi>Turk</hi> in his Alcoran, <hi>viz.</hi> that he came of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> that he was a great Prophet, and shall be the Judge of the world at the last day. In other matters likewise they are much or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered after the manner and direction of the <hi>Turk,</hi> having felt the <hi>Turkish</hi> forces, when he wonne from them <hi>Azou,</hi> and <hi>Caffa,</hi> with some other towns about the <hi>Euxine</hi> or <hi>Black sea,</hi> that were before tributaries to the <hi>Chrim Tartar.</hi> So that now the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the <hi>Chrims</hi> for the most part is chosen some one of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45537:87"/>
whom the <hi>Turk</hi> doth commend: whereby it is brought now to that passe, that the <hi>Chrim Tartar</hi> giveth to the <hi>Turk</hi> the tenth part of the spoil, which he getteth in his warres against the Christians.</p>
            <p>Herein they differ from the <hi>Turkish</hi> religion, for that they have certain idole puppets made of silk or like stuff, of the fashion of a man, which they fasten to the doore of their walking houses, to be as <hi>Janusses</hi> or keepers of the house. And these idoles are made not by all, but by certain religious women, which they have among them for that, and like uses. They have besides the image of their King or great <hi>Cham,</hi> of an huge bignesse, which they erect at every stage when the armie marcheth: and this every one must bend and bow unto it as he passeth by it, be he <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> or stranger. They are much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to witchcraft, and ominous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, upon every accident which they heare or see.</p>
            <p>In making of marriages they have no regard of alliance or consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Onely with his mother, sister,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45537:87"/>
and daughter, a man may not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Under the Emperour they have certain Dukes, whom they call <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis</hi> or <hi>Divoymorseis,</hi> that rule over a certain number of 10000. 20000 or 40000. a piece, which they call <hi>hoords.</hi> When the Emperour hath any use of them to serve in his warres they are bound to come, and to bring with them their souldiers to a certain number, every man with his two horse at the least, the one to ride on, the other to kill, when it cometh to his turn to have his horse eaten. For their chief victuall is horse-flesh, which they eat without bread, or any other thing with it. So that if a <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> be taken by a <hi>Russe,</hi> he shall be sure lightly to find a horse legge, or some other part of him at his saddle bow.</p>

This last year when I was at the <hi>Mosko,</hi> came in one <hi>Kiriach Morsey</hi> nephew to the Emperour of the <hi>Chrims</hi> that now is (whose Father was Emperour before) accompanied with 300. <hi>Tartars,</hi> and his two wives, whereof one was his brothers widdow. Where being entertained in very good sort after the <hi>Russe</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he had sent unto his lodging for his welcome, to be made ready for his supper and his companies, two very large and fat horses, ready flayed in a sled. They preferre it before other flesh, because the meat is stronger (as they say) then beef, mutton, and such like. And yet (which is marvell) though they serve all as horsemen in the war r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Towns they plant none, nor other standing buildings, but have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houses, which the Latines call <hi>Veji,</hi> built upon wheels like a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds cottage. These they draw with them whithersoever they go, driving their cattell with them. And when they come to their stage or-standing place, they plant their cart-houses ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry orderly in a rank, and so make the form of streets, and of a large town. And this is the manner of the Emperour himself, who hath no other seat of his Empire but an <hi>Agora,</hi> or town of wood, that moveth with him whithersoever he goeth. As for the fixed and standing building used in other countreys, they say they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome and unpleasant.</p>
            <p>They begin to move their houses and cattell in the spring time from

And so dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on till they have grased all up to the furthest part Northward, they return back again towards their South countrey (where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue all the winter) by ten or twelve miles a stage: in the mean while the grasse being sprung up again, to serve for their cattell as they return. From the border of the <hi>Shalcan</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Caspian</hi> sea, to the <hi>Russe</hi> frontiers, they have a goodly countrey, specially on the South and Southeast parts, but lost for lack of tillage.</p>
            <p>Of money they have no use at all, and therefore preferre brasse and steel before other mettals, specially bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, which they use for swords, knives and other necessaries. As for gold and silver they neglect it of very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (as they do all tillage of their ground) to be more free for their wandring kind of life, and to keep their countrey lesse subject to invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Which giveth them great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against all their neighbours, ever invading, and never being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. Such as have taken upon

Then when they begin to want victuall and other necessaries (as needs they must where nothing is to be had) to stop up the passages, and inclose them with multitudes.

            <p>In the storie of <hi>Pachymerius</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> (which he wrote of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of <hi>Constantinople</hi> from the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Michael Palaeologus</hi> to the time of <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:45537:90"/>
the elder) I remember he telleth to the same purpose of one <hi>Nogas</hi> a <hi>Tartarian</hi> captain under <hi>Cazan</hi> the Emperour of the East <hi>Tartars</hi> (of whom the citie and kingdome of <hi>(a zan</hi> may seem to have taken the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination) who refused a present of pearl and other jewels sent unto him from <hi>Michael Palaeologus:</hi> asking withall, for what use they served, and whether they were good to keep away sicknesse, death, or other misfortunes of this life, or no. So that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth they have ever or long time been of that mind to value things no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by the use, and necessitie for which they serve.</p>
            <p>For person and complexion they have broad and flat visages, of a tanned colour into yellow and black, fierce and cruell looks, thin haired upon the upper lip, and pit of the chinne, light and nimble bodied, with short legs, as if they were made naturally for horsemen, whereto they practise themselves from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, seldome going afoot about any businesse. Their speech is very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and loud, speaking as it were
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45537:90"/>
out of a deep hollow throat. When they sing, you would think a cow lowed, or some great bandogge how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Their greatest exercise is shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein they train up their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their very infancie, not suffering them to eat, till they have shot near the mark within a certain scantling. They are the very same that sometimes were called <hi>Scythae Nomades,</hi> or the <hi>Scythian Shepherds,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines.</hi> Some think that the <hi>Turks</hi> took their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the nation of the <hi>Chrim Tartars.</hi> Of which opinion is <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus Chalcocondylas</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer, in his first book of his <hi>Turkish</hi> storie. Wherein he followeth divers very probable conjectures. The first taken from the very name it self, for that the word <hi>Turk</hi> signifieth a shepherd, or one that followeth a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and wild kind of life. By which name these <hi>Scythian Tartars</hi> have ever been noted, being called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <hi>Scythian</hi> shepherds. His second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because the <hi>Turks</hi> (in his time) that dwelt in <hi>Asia the lesse,</hi> to wit, in

               <hi>Lydia, Coria, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> spake the very same language that these <hi>Tartars</hi> did, that dwelt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the river <hi>Tanais</hi> or <hi>Don,</hi> and the countrey of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> which (as is well known) are these <hi>Tartars</hi> called <hi>Chrims.</hi> At this time also the whole nation of the <hi>Turks</hi> differ not much in their common speech from the <hi>Tartar</hi> language. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Chrim Tartar</hi> agree so well together, as well in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as in matter of traffick, never invading or injuring one another, save that the <hi>Turk</hi> (since <hi>Laonicus</hi> his time) hath encroched upon some towns upon the <hi>Euxin</hi> sea, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pertained to the <hi>Chrim Tartar.</hi> Fourthly, because <hi>Ortogules</hi> sonne to <hi>Oguzalpes,</hi> and father to <hi>Otoman</hi> (the first of name of the <hi>Turkish</hi> nation) made his first rodes out of those parts of <hi>Asia</hi> upon the next borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, till he came towards the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys about the hill <hi>Taurus,</hi> where he overcame the <hi>Greeks</hi> that inhabited there: and so enlarged the name and territorie of the <hi>Turkish</hi> nation, till he came to <hi>Eubea</hi> and <hi>Attica,</hi> and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45537:91"/>
other parts of <hi>Greece.</hi> This is the opinion of <hi>Laonicus,</hi> who lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Turks</hi> in the time of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> the sixth <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour, about the year 1400. when the memorie of their originall was more fresh; and therefore the likelier he was to hit the truth.</p>
            <p>There are divers other <hi>Tartars</hi> that border <hi>upon</hi> Russia, as the <hi>Nagaies,</hi> the <hi>Cheremissens,</hi> the <hi>Mordwites,</hi> the <hi>Chircasses,</hi> and the <hi>Sbalcans,</hi> which all differ in name more then in regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or other condition, from the <hi>Chrim Tartar,</hi> except the <hi>Chircasses</hi> that border Southwest, towards <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuania,</hi> and are farre more civil then the rest of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> of a comely person, and of a stately behaviour, as applying themselves to the fashion of the <hi>Polonian.</hi> Some of them have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themselves to the kings of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and professe Christianitie. The <hi>Nagay</hi> lieth Eastward, and is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the best man of warre among all the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but very savage, and cruel above all the rest. The <hi>Chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missen Tartar,</hi> that lieth betwixt the <hi>Russe</hi> and the <hi>Nagay,</hi> are of two
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45537:92"/>
sorts, the <hi>Lugavoy</hi> (that is of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley) and the <hi>Nagornay</hi> or of the hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie countrey. These have much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Emperours of <hi>Russia.</hi> And therefore they are content now to buy peace of them, under pretence of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a yearly pension of <hi>Russe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to their <hi>Morseis</hi> or <hi>Divoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morseis,</hi> that are chief of their tribes. For which also they are bound to serve them in their warres, under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conditions. They are said to be just and true in their dealings; and for that cause they hate the <hi>Russe</hi> people, whom they account to be double and false in all their dealing. And therefore the common sort are very unwilling to keep agreement with them, but that they are kept in by their <hi>Morseis</hi> or Dukes, for their pensions sake.</p>
            <p>The most rude and barbarous is counted the <hi>Mordwite Tartar,</hi> that hath many self-fashions, and strange kinds of behaviour, differing from the rest. For his religion, though he acknowledge one god, yet his manner is to worship for god that living thing that he first meeteth in the morning,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45537:92"/>
and to swear by it all that whole day, whether it be horse, dog, cat, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else it be. When his friend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he killeth his best horse, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving flayed off the skin he carrieth it on high upon a long pole before the corps to the place of buriall. This he doth (as the <hi>Russe</hi> saith) that his friend may have a good horse to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie him to heaven: but it is likelier to declare his love towards his dead friend, in that he will have to die with him the best thing that he hath.</p>
            <p>Next to the kingdome of <hi>Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> that is the furthest part South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eastward of the <hi>Russe</hi> dominion, lieth the <hi>Shalcan,</hi> and the countrey of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi> whither the <hi>Russe</hi> merchants trade for raw silks, syndon, saphion, skins, and other commodities. The chief towns of <hi>Media</hi> where the <hi>Russe</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth are <hi>Derbent</hi> (built by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, as the inhabitants say) and <hi>Zamachie,</hi> where the staple is kept for raw silks. Their manner is in the Spring-time to revive the silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms (that lie dead all the Winter) by laying them in the warm sunne, and (to hasten their quickning that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45537:93"/>
they may sooner go to work) to put them into bags, and so to hang them under their childrens arms. As for the worm called <hi>Chrinisin</hi> (as we call it <hi>chrymson)</hi> that maketh coloured silk, it is bred not in <hi>Media</hi> but in <hi>Assyria.</hi> This trade to <hi>Derbent</hi> &amp; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machie</hi> for raw silks, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of that countrey, as also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Persiae,</hi> and <hi>Bougharia,</hi> down the riuer <hi>Volgha,</hi> and through the <hi>Caspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> sea, is permitted as well to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, as to the <hi>Russe</hi> merchants, by the Emperours last grant at my being there. Which he accounteth for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry speciall favour, and might prove indeed very beneficiall to our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish merchants, if the trade were well and orderly used.</p>
            <p>The whole nation of the <hi>Tartars</hi> are utterly void of all learning, and without written Law. Yet certain rules they have which they hold by tradition, common to all the <hi>Hoords</hi> for the practice of their life: Which are of this sort, 1. <hi>To obey their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and other Magistrates, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they command about the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick service. 2.

            <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>Of the</hi> Permians, Samoites, <hi>and</hi> Lappes.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Permians</hi> and <hi>Samoites</hi> that lie from <hi>Russia</hi> North and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east, are thought likewise to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their beginning from the <hi>Tartar</hi> kind. And it may partly be ghessed by the fashion of their countenance, as having all broad and flat faces, as the <hi>Tartars</hi> have, except the <hi>Chirchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> The <hi>Bermians</hi> are accounted for a very ancient people. They are now subject to the <hi>Russe.</hi> They live by hunting, and trading with their furres, as doth also the <hi>Samoit,</hi> that dwelleth more towards the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea. The <hi>Samoit</hi> hath his name (as the <hi>Russe</hi> saith) of eating himself: as if in times past they lived as the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals, eating one another. Which they make more probable, because at this time they eat all kind of raw flesh, whatsoever it be, even the very carrion that lieth in the ditch. But as the <hi>Samoits</hi> themselves will say, they were called <hi>Samoie,</hi> that is of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45537:94"/>
as though they were <hi>Indigenae,</hi> or people bred upon that very soil, that never changed their seat from one place to another, as most nations have done. They are subject at this time to the Emperour of <hi>Russia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I talked with certain of them, and find that they acknowledge one God: but represent him by such things as they have most use and good by. And therefore they worship the Sunne, the Ollen, the Losh, and such like. As for the storie of <hi>Slata Baba</hi> or the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hagge</hi> (which I have read in some maps, and descriptions of these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, to be an idole after the form of an old woman) that being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Priest, giveth them certain Oracles concerning the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and event of things, I found it to be but a very fable. Onely in the province of <hi>Obdoria</hi> upon the Sea-side, near to the mouth of the great river <hi>Obba,</hi> there is a rock which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally (being somewhat helped by imagination) may seem to bear the shape of a ragged woman, with a child in her arms (as the rock by the North cape the shape of a Frier)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45537:95"/>
where the <hi>Obdorian Samoites</hi> use much to resort, by reason of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the place for fishing: and there sometime (as their manner is) conceive and practise their sorceries, and ominous conjecturings about the good or bad speed of their journeys, fishings, huntings, and such like.</p>
            <p>They are clad in Seal skins, with the hairie side outwards down as low as the knees, with their breeches and netherstocks of the same, both men &amp; women. They are all black haired, naturally beardlesse. And therefore the men are hardly discerned from the women by their looks: save that the women wear a lock of hair down along both their ears. They live in a manner a wild and savage life, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving still from one place of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to the other, without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of house or land more to one then to another. Their loader or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour in every company is their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> or Priest.</p>
            <p>On the North-side of <hi>Russia</hi> next to <hi>Corelia,</hi> lieth the countrey of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> which reacheth in length from the furthest point. Northward (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45537:95"/>
the Northcape) to the furthest part Southeast (which the <hi>Russe</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Sweetnesse</hi> or Holie nose, the English men <hi>Capegrace)</hi> about 345. verst or miles. From <hi>Sweetnesse</hi> to <hi>Gandelox</hi> by the way of <hi>Versega</hi> (which measureth the breadth of that countrey) is 90. miles or thereabouts. The whole countrey in a manner is either lakes, or mountains, which towards the Sea-side are called <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi> because they are all of hard and craggie rock; but the inland parts are well furnished with woods, that grow on the hills fides, the lakes lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. Their diet is very bare and simple. Bread they have none, but feed onely upon fish and fowl. They are subject to the Emperour of <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> and the two Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> which all exact tribute and custome of them (as was said before) but the Emperour of <hi>Russia</hi> beareth the greatest hand over them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts of them farre more then the rest. The opinion is that they were first termed <hi>Lappes</hi> of their brief and short speech. The <hi>Russe</hi> divideth the whole nation of the <hi>Lappes</hi> into two sorts.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45537:96"/>
The one they call <hi>Nowremanskoy Lapary,</hi> that is, the <hi>Norvegian Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes:</hi> because they be of the <hi>Danish</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norvegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> they account for one people. The other that have no religion at all, but live as brute and Heathenish people, without God in the world, they call <hi>Dikoy Lapary,</hi> or the wild <hi>Lappes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whose nation is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, having not so much as the use of any Alphabet, or letter among them. For practice of witchcraft and sorcerie they passe all nations in the world: Though for the enchanting of ships that sail along their coast (as I have heard it reported) and their giving of winds good to their friends, and contrary to other, whom they mean to hurt, by tying of certain knots upon a rope (somewhat like to the tale of <hi>Aeolus</hi> his windbag) is a very fable, devised (as may seem) by themselves, to terrifie sailers for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming near their coast. Their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are the long bow, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, wherein they excell, as well for quicknesse to charge and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, as for nearnesse at the mark,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45537:96"/>
by reason of their continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice (whereto they are forced) of shooting at wild fowl. Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is in Summer time to come down in great companies to the sea-side, to <hi>Wardhuyse, Cola, Kegor,</hi> and the bay of <hi>Vedagoba,</hi> and there to fish for Cod, Salmon, and But-fish which they sell to the <hi>Russes, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Norvegians,</hi> and now of late to the English men that trade thither with cloth, which they exchange with the <hi>Lappes</hi> and <hi>Corelians</hi> for their fish, oyl, and furres, whereof also they have some store. They hold their mart at <hi>Cola</hi> on S. Peters day, what time the Captain of <hi>Wardhuyse</hi> (that is resiant there for the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark)</hi> must be present, or at least send his deputie to set prices upon their stockfish, trane-oyl, furres, and other commodities; as also the <hi>Russe</hi> Emperours customer, or tribute-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, to receive his custome, which is ever payed before any thing can be bought, or sold. When their fishing is done, their manner is to draw their carbasses or boats on shore, and there to leave them with the keel turned

            <head>CHAP. XXI. Of their Ecclesiasticall state, with their Church offices.</head>
            <p>COncerning the government of their Church, it is framed alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after the manner of the Greek, as being a part of that Church, and never acknowledging the jurisdiction of the Latine Church usurped by the Pope. That I may keep a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter measure in describing their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; then they in the using them (wherein they are infinite) I will note briefly, First, what Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call degrees or offices they have, with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45537:97"/>
the jurisdiction and practise of them. Secondly, what doctrine they hold in matter of religion. Thirdly, what liturgie, or form of service they use in their Churches, with the manner of their administring the Sacraments. Fourthly, what other strange cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and superstitious devotions are used among them.</p>
            <p>Their offices or degrees of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are as many in number, and the same in a manner both in name and degree, that were in the Western churches. First they have their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,</hi> then their <hi>Metropolites,</hi> their <hi>Archbishops,</hi> their <hi>Uladikey</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> their <hi>Protopapes</hi> or <hi>Archpriests,</hi> their <hi>Papes</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> their <hi>Deacons, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Monks, Nunnes,</hi> and <hi>Eremites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Patriarch</hi> or chief directour in matter of religion, untill this last year, was of the citie of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> (whom they called the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> of <hi>Sio)</hi> because being driven by the <hi>Turk</hi> out of <hi>Canstantinople</hi> (the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at of his Empire) he removed to the Isle <hi>Sio,</hi> sometimes called <hi>Chio,</hi> and there placed his Patriarchicall sea. So that the Emperours, and cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45537:98"/>
of <hi>Russia,</hi> were wont yearly to send gifts thither, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a spirituall kind of homage and subjection due to him, and to that Church. Which custome they have held (as it seemeth) ever since they professed the Christian religion. Which how long it hath been, I could not well learn, for that they have no story or monument of antiquitie (that I could hear of) to shew what hath been done in times past within their countrey, concerning either Church or Common wealth matters. Onely I heare a report among them, that about three hundred years since there was a marriage betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the kings daughter of that countrey, who at the first denied to joyn his daughter in marriage with the <hi>Greek</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, because he was of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion. Which agreeth well with that I find in the storie of <hi>Laonicus Chalcacondylas</hi> concerning Turkish affairs in his fourth book, where he speaketh of such a marriage betwixt <hi>John</hi> the Greek Emperour, and the Kings daughter of <hi>Sarmatia.</hi> And
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45537:98"/>
this argueth out of their own report, that at that time they had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Christian religion: as also that they were converted to the faith, and withall perverted at the very same time, receiving the doctrine of the Gospel corrupted with supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even at the first when they took it from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which it self then was degenerate, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with many superstitions and foul errours, both in doctrine and discipline, as may appear by the story of <hi>Nicephorus Gregoras,</hi> in his 8. and 9. books. But as touching the time of their conversion to the Christian faith, I suppose rather that it is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the <hi>Russe,</hi> for that which I find in the <hi>Polonian</hi> Storie the second book the third chapter: where it is said that about the year 990. <hi>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45537:99"/>
yet it falleth out all to one reckoning, touching this point, <hi>viz.</hi> in what truth and sinceritie of doctrine the <hi>Russe</hi> received the first stamp of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, forasmuch as the <hi>Greek</hi> church at that time also was many wayes infected with errour and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</p>
            <p>At my being there, the year 1588. came unto the <hi>Mosko</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Sio,</hi> called <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymo,</hi> being banished (as some said) by the <hi>Turk,</hi> as some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the <hi>Greek</hi> clergie deprived. The Emperour, being given altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to superstitious devotions, gave him great entertainment. Before his coming to <hi>Mosko,</hi> he had been in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> with the Pope, as was reported then by some of his companie. His errand was to consult with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour concerning these points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First about a league to passe betwixt him and the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> as the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Prince to joyn with him in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against the <hi>Turk.</hi> To which purpose also Embassages had passed betwixt the <hi>Russe</hi> and the <hi>Persian.</hi> Likewise from the <hi>Georgians</hi> to the

His second purpose (whereto the first served as an introduction) was in revenge of the Turk and the Greek clergie, that had thrust him from his seat, to treat with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reducing of the <hi>Russe</hi> Church under the Pope of Rome. Wherein it may seem that coming lately from Rome, he was set on by the Pope, who hath attempted the same many times before, though all in vain, and namely in the time of the late Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Juan Vasilowich,</hi> by one <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> his Legate; But thought this belike a farre better mean to obtain his purpose by treatie and mediation of their own Patriarch. But this not succeeding, the Patriarch fell to a third point of treatie, concerning the resignation of his Patriarchship, and translation of the Sea from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> or <hi>Sio</hi> to the citie of <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko.</hi> Which was so well liked, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the Emperour (as a matter of high religion and policie) that no other treatie (specially of forein Embassages) could be heard or regarded till that matter was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:45537:100"/>
The reasons wherewith the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch perswaded the translating of his Sea to the citie of <hi>Mosko</hi> were these in effect: First, for that the Sea of the Patriarch was under the <hi>Turk</hi> that is enemie to the faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be removed into some other countrey of Christian profession. Secondly, because the <hi>Russe</hi> Church was the onely naturall daughter of the Greek at this time, and holdeth the same doctrine and ceremonies with it, the rest being all subject to the Turk, and fallen away from the right profession. Wherein the subtill Greek, to make the better market of his broken ware, advanced the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that would grow to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and his countrey, to have the Patriarchs seat translated into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hief citie and seat of his Empire. As for the right of translating the Sea, and appointing his successour, he made no doubt of it, but that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained wholly to himself.</p>
            <p>So the Emperour and his Counsell, with the principall of his clergie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assembled at the <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Mosko</hi> should become Patriarch of the whole Greek Church, and have the same full authoritie and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that pertained before to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Sin.</hi> And that it might be done with more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and solemnitie, the 25. of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> 1588. the Greek Patriarch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the <hi>Russe</hi> Clergie went to the great Church of <hi>Preche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,</hi> or our Ladie, within the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours castle (having first wandred through the whole citie in manner of a procession, and blessing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with his two fingers) where he made an Oration, and delivered his resignation in an instrument of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and so layed down his Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall staff, which was presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Metropolite of <hi>Mosko,</hi> and divers other ceremonies used about the inauguration of this new Patriarch.</p>
            <p>The day was holden very solemn by the people of the citie, who were commanded to forbear their works, and to attend this solemnitie. The great Patriarch that day was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with rich presents, sent him from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45537:101"/>
the Emperour and Empresse, of plate, cloth of gold, furres, &amp;c. carried with great pomp through the streets of <hi>Mosko,</hi> and at his departing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many gifts more, both from the Emperour. Nobilitie, and Clergie. Thus the Patriarchship of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> or <hi>Sio</hi> (which hath continued since the Councel of <hi>Nice)</hi> is now translated to <hi>Mosko,</hi> or they made believe that they have a Patriarch with the same right and authoritie that the other had. Wherein the subtil <hi>Greek</hi> hath made good advantage of their superstition, and is now gone away with a rich bootie into <hi>Poland,</hi> whether their Patriarchship be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or not.</p>
            <p>The matter is not unlike to make some schisme betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Russe</hi> Church, if the <hi>Russe</hi> hold this Patriarchship that he hath so well payed for, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> elect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other withall, as likely they will, whether this man were banished by the Turk, or deprived by order of his own Clergie. Which might happen to give advantage to the Pope, and to bring over the <hi>Russe</hi> Church to the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45537:102"/>
Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> (to which end peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he devised this stratagem, and cast in this matter of schisme among them) but that the Emperours of <hi>Russia</hi> know well enough, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of other Christian Princes, what inconvenience would grow to their state and countrey by subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to the Romish Sea. To which end the late Emperour <hi>Juan Vasilowich</hi> was very inquisitive of the Popes authoritie over the Princes of Christendome, and sent one of very purpose to <hi>Rome,</hi> to behold the order and behaviour of his Court.</p>
            <p>With this Patriarch <hi>Hieronimo</hi> was driven out at the same time by the great <hi>Turk</hi> one <hi>Demetrio,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Larissa,</hi> who is now in <hi>England,</hi> and pretendeth the same cause of their banishment by the Turk (to wit) their not admitting of the Popes new Kalender for the alteration of the year. Which how unlikely it is, may appear by these circumstances: First, because there is no such affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor friendly respect betwixt the Pope and the Turk, as that he should banish a subject for not obeying the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45537:102"/>
Popes ordinance, specially in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of some sequele for the alteration of times within his own countreys. Secondly, for that he maketh no such scruple in deducting of times, and keeping of a just and precise account from the incarnation of Christ, whom he doth not acknowledge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then I noted before. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that the said Patriarch is now at <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> where it may be ghessed he would not have gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Popes reach, and so near to his nose, if he had been banished for opposing himself against the Popes decree.</p>
            <p>This office of Patriarchship now translated to <hi>Mosko</hi> beareth a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our authoritie over all the Churches, not onely of <hi>Russia</hi> and other the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours dominions, but throughout all the Churches of Christendome that were before under the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> or <hi>Sio:</hi> or at least the <hi>Russe</hi> Patriarch imagineth himself to have the same authoritie. He hath under him as his proper diocesse the Province of <hi>Mosko,</hi> besides other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars. His court or office is kept at the <hi>Mosko.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:45537:103"/>
Before the creation of this new Patriarch they had but one <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> that was called the <hi>Metropolite</hi> of <hi>Mosko.</hi> Now for more state to their Church and new Patriarch, they have two Metropolites, the one of <hi>Novogrod velica,</hi> the other of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stove.</hi> Their office is to receive of the Patriarch such Ecclesiasticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as he thinketh good, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the charge of them over to the Archbishops, besides the ordering of their own diocesse.</p>
            <p>Their Archbishops are foure: of <hi>Smolensko, Cazan, Vobsko,</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logda.</hi> The parts of their office is all one with the Metropolites, save that they have an under jurisdiction, as Suffragans to the Metropolites, and superiours to the Bishops. The next are the <hi>Uladikeis,</hi> or Bishops, that are but six in all: of <hi>Crutiska,</hi> of <hi>Rezan,</hi> of <hi>Otfer</hi> and <hi>Torshock,</hi> of <hi>Collomenska,</hi> of <hi>Volodemer,</hi> of <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla.</hi> These have every one a very large diocesse, as dividing the rest of the whole countrey among them.</p>
            <p>The matters pertaining to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall jurisdiction of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polites,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45537:103"/>
Archbishops, and Bishops, are the same in a manner that are used by the Clergie in other parts of Christendome. For besides their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie over the Clergie, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such matters as are mere Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, their jurisdiction extendeth to all testamentarie causes, matters of marriage, and divorcements, some pleas of injuries, &amp;c. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose also they have their Officials, or Commissaries (which they call <hi>Boia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Uladitskey)</hi> that are Laymen of the degree of Dukes, or Gentlemen, that keep their Courts, and execute their jurisdiction. Which, besides their other oppressions over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, reigne over the Priests, as the Dukes and Diacks do over the poore people within their precincts. As for the Archbishop or Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he beareth no sway in deciding those causes that are brought into his Court: But if he would moderate any matter, he must do it by intreatie with his Gentleman Officiall. The reason is, because these <hi>Boiarskey,</hi> or Gentlemen Officials, are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Bishops, but by the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:45537:104"/>
Emperour himself, or his Councel, and are to give account of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to none but to them. If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop can intreat at his admission to have the choice of his own Officiall, it is accounted for a speciall great favour. But to speak it as it is, the Clergie of <hi>Russia,</hi> as well concerning their lands and revenues, as their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and jurisdiction, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordered and overruled by the Emperour, and his Councel, and have so much and no more of both as their pleasure doth permit them. They have also their assistants or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Councels (as they call them) of certain Priests that are of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesse, residing within their cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall cities, to the number of foure and twentie a piece. These advise with them about the speciall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie matters belonging to their charge.</p>
            <p>Concerning their rents and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to maintain their dignities, it is somewhat large. The Patriarchs yearly rents out of his lands (besides other fees) is about 3000. rubbels or marks. The Metropolites and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:45537:104"/>
Archbishops about 2500. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops some a 1000. some 800. some 500, &amp;c. They have had some of them (as I have heard say) ten or twelve thousand rubbels a year, as had the Metropolite of <hi>Novograde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their habit or apparel (when they shew themselves in their Pontificali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus after their solemnest manner) is a mitre on their heads, after the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish fashion, set with pearl and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone, a cope on their backs, commonly of cloth of gold, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with pearl, and a Crosiers staff in their hands, layed over all with plate of silver double guilt, with a crosse or shepherds crook at the upper end of it. Their ordinary habit otherwise when they ride or go abroad is a hood on their heads of black colour, that hangeth down their backs, and standeth out like a bongrace before. Their upper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which they call <hi>Reis)</hi> is a gown or mantle of black Damask, with many lists or gards of white Satten laid upon it, every gard about two fingers broad, and their Crosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers staff carried before them. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45537:105"/>
follow after, blessing the people with their two forefingers, with a marvellous grace.</p>
            <p>The election and appointing of the Bishops and the rest pertaineth wholly to the Emperour himself. They are chosen ever out of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, so that there is no Bishop, Archbishop, nor Metropolite, but hath been a Monk, or Frier before. And by that reason they are, and must all be unmarried men, for their vow of chastitie when they were first shorn. When the Emperour hath appointed whom he thinketh good, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in the Cathedrall church of his Diocesse with many ceremonies, much after the manner of the Popish inauguration. They have also their Deans, and their Archdeacons.</p>
            <p>As for preaching the word of God, or any teaching, or exhorting such as are under them, they neither use it, nor have any skill of it: the whole Clergie being utterly unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both for other knowledge, and in the word of God. Onely their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is twice every year, <hi>viz.</hi> the first of September (which is the first day
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:45537:105"/>
of their year) and on S. <hi>John</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists day, to make an ordinarie speech to the people, every Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, Archbishop, and Bishop in his Cathedrall Church, to this or like effect; That if any be in malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his neighbour, he shall leave off his malice; if any have thought of treason or rebellion against his Prince, he beware of such practise; if he have not kept his fasts, and vows, nor done his other duties to the holy Church, he shall amend that faule, &amp;c. And this is a matter of form with them, uttered in as many words and no more, in a manner, then I have here set down. Yet the matter is done with that grace and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in a pulpit of purpose set up for this one Act, as if he were to discourse at large of the whole substance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie. At the <hi>Mosko</hi> the Emperour himself is ever present at this solemn exhortation.</p>
            <p>As themselves are void of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of learning, so are they warie to keep out all means that might bring any in, as fearing to have their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ungodlinesse discovered.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45537:106"/>
To that purpose they have perswaded the Emperours that it would breed innovation, and so danger to their state, to have any noveltie of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come within the Realm. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they say but truth: for that a man of spirit and understanding, helped by learning and liberall education, can hardly indure a tyrannicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Some years past, in the other Emperours time, there came a Presse and Letters out of <hi>Polonia</hi> to the citie of <hi>Mosko,</hi> where a printing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house was set up, with great liking and allowance of the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: But not long after, the house was set on fire in the night time, and the presse and letters quite burnt up, as was thought, by the procurement of the Clergie men.</p>
            <p>Their Priests (whom they call <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paes)</hi> are made by the Bishops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great triall for worthinesse of gifts, before they admit them, or ceremonies in their admission, save that their heads are shorn (not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for that they like not) about an hand-breadth or more in the crown, and that place anointed with oyl by
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:45537:106"/>
the Bishop, who in his admission putteth upon the priest, first his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plesse, and then setteth a white crosse on his breast of silk, or some other matter, which he is to wear eight dayes, and no more; and so giveth him authoritie to say and sing in the Church, and to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p>They are men utterly unlearned; which is no marvell, forasmuch as their makers, the Bishops themselves (as before was said) are clear of that qualitie, and make no further use at all of any kind of learning, no not of the Scriptures themselves, save to reade and to sing them. Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary charge and function is to say the Liturgie, to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments after their manner, to keep and deck their idols, and to do the other ceremonies usuall in their Churches. Their number is great, because their towns are parted into many small parishes without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion for dividing them into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent numbers of housholds, and people for a just congregation, as the manner in all places, where the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45537:107"/>
means is neglected for increasing of knowledge, and instruction towards God. Which cannot well be had, where by means of an unequall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the people, and parishes, there followeth a want and unequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of stipend for a sufficient mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.</p>
            <p>For their priests, it is lawfull to marrie for the first time. But if the first wife die, a second he cannot take, but he must lose his Priesthood and his living withall. The reason they make out of that place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> 1. 3. 2. not well understood, thinking that to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of divers wives successively, that the Apostle speaketh of at one and the same time. If he will needs mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie again after his first wife is dead, he is no longer called <hi>Papa,</hi> but <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papa,</hi> or <hi>Priest quondam.</hi> This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Priests to make much of their wives, who are accounted as the matrones, and of best reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the women of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
            <p>For the stipend of the Priest, their manner is not to pay him any tem the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45537:107"/>
of corn, or ought else; but he must stand at the devotion of the people of his parish, and make up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commes towards his maintenance, so well as he can, by offerings, shrifts, marriages, burials, dirges, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead and the living (which they call <hi>Molitua)</hi> For besides their publick service within their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, their manner is for every, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to have a prayer said for him by the Priest, upon any occasion of businesse whatsoever, whether he ride, go, sail, plough, or whatsoever else he doth. Which is not framed according to the occasion of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, but at randome, being some of their ordinary and usuall Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayers. And this is thought to be more holy and effectuall if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by the Priests mouth, rather then by his own. They have a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome besides to solemnize the Saints day that is patrone to their Church, once every year, what time all their neighbours of their countrey and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes about come in to have prayers said to that Saint for themselves, and their friends; and so make an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45537:108"/>
to the Priest for his pains. This offering may yield them some ten pounds a year, more or lesse, as the patrone or Saint of that Church is of credit, and estimation among them. The manner is on this day (which they keep anniversarie) for the priest to hire divers of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-priests to help him, as having more dishes to dresse for the Saint, then he can well turn his hand unto. They use besides to visit their parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners houses, with holy water, and perfume, commonly once a quarter: and so having sprinkled and becensed the good man and his wife, with the rest of their houshold, and houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuff, they receive some devotion more or lesse, as the man is of abilitie. This and the rest laid altogether may make up for the priest towards his maintenance about thirty or fourty rubbles a year, whereof he payeth the tenth part to the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papa</hi> or Priest is known by his long tufts of hair, hanging down by his ears, his gown with a broad cape, and a walking staff in his hand.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45537:108"/>
For the rest of his habit, he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled like the common sort. When he saith the Liturgie or service, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, he hath on him his surplesse, and sometimes his cope, if the day be more solemn. They have besides their <hi>Papaes</hi> or Priests, their <hi>Churnapapaes</hi> (as they call them) that is, <hi>Black Priests:</hi> that may keep their Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>fices though they be admitted Friers withall within some Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. They seem to be the very same that were called Regular Priests in the Popish Church. Under the Priest is a Deacon in every Church, that doth nothing but the office of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-clerk. As for their <hi>Protopapaes,</hi> or Archpriests, and their Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons (that are next in election to be their <hi>Protopapas)</hi> they serve onely in the cathedrall Churches.</p>
            <p>Of Friers they have an infinite rabble, farre greater then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countrey, where Popery is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. Every citie, and good part of the countrey, swarmeth full of them. For they have wrought (as the Popish Friers did by their superstition and hypocrisie) that if any part of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:45537:109"/>
Realm be better and sweeter then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there standeth a Friery or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery dedicated to some Saint.</p>
            <p>The number of them is so much the greater, not onely for that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> augmented by the superstition of the countrey, but because the Friers lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is the safest from the oppressions and exactions that fall upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Which causeth many to put on the Friers weed, as the best ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to bear off such blows. Besides such as are voluntarie, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that are forced to shier them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Friers, upon some displeasure. These are for the most part of the chief Nobilitie. Divers take the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s as a place of Sanctuary, and there become Friers, to avoid some punishment that they had deserved by the laws of the Realm. For if he get a Monastery over his head, and there put on a cowl before he be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, it is a protection to him for ever against any law, for what crime soever, except it be for treason. But this <hi>Proviso</hi> goeth withall, that no man cometh there (except such as are commanded by the Emperour to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45537:109"/>
be received) but he giveth them lands, or bringeth his stock with him, and putteth it into the common Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Some bring a 1000. rubbles, and some more. None is admitted under 3. or 4. hundred.</p>
            <p>The manner of their admission is after this sort. First, the Abbot strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth him of all his secular or ordinary apparel: Then he puteth upon him next to his skinne a white flannell shirt, with a long garment over it down to the ground, girded unto him with a broad leather belt. His up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost garment is a weed of <hi>Garrus,</hi> or <hi>Say,</hi> for colour and fashion much like to the upper weed of a Chimney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweeper. Then is his crown shorn a hand-breadth or more, close to the very skinne, and these or like words pronounced by the Abbot whiles he clippeth his hair, <hi>As these hairs are clipped off, and taken from thy head, so now we take thee, and separate thee clean from the world, and worldly things, &amp;c.</hi> This done, he anointeth his crown with oyl, and putteth on his cowl, and so taketh him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Fraternitie. They vow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:45537:110"/>
chastity, &amp; abstinence from flesh</p>
            <p>Besides their lands (that are very great) they are the greatest merchants in the whole countrey, and deal for all manner of commodities. Some of their Monasteries dispend in lands 1000. or 2000 rubbles a year. There is one Abbey called <hi>Troils,</hi> that hath in lands and fees the summe of 100000. rubbles or marks a year. It is built in manner of a Castle, walled round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, with great ordinance planted on the wall, and containeth within it a large breadth of ground, &amp; great varietie of building. There are of Friers within it (besides their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and other servants) about 700. The Empresse that now is hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vows to <hi>Saint Sergius,</hi> that is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone there, to intreat him to make her fruitfull, as having no children by the Emperour her husband. Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every year she goeth on pilgrimage to him from the <hi>Mosko</hi> on foot, about 80. English miles, with 5. or 6000. women attending on her, all in blue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, &amp; 4000. souldiers for her guard. But S. <hi>Sergius</hi> hath not yet heard her prayers, though (they say) he hath a speciall gift and faculty that way.</p>

What learning there is among their Friers, may be known by their Bishops, that are the choice men out of all their monasteries. I talked with one of them at the Citie of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logda,</hi> where (to trie his skill) I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him a <hi>Russe</hi> Testament, and turned him to the first Chapter of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel, where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reade in very good order. I asked him first what part of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it was, that he had read? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that he could not vvell tell. How many Evangelists there were in the new Testament? He said, he knew not. How many Apostles there were? He thought there were twelve. How he should be saved? Whereunto he answered me with a piece of <hi>Russe</hi> doctrine, that he knew not whether he should be saved or no: but if God would <hi>Poshallovate</hi> him, or gratifie him so much, as to save him, so it was, he would be glad of it; if not, what remedie. I asked him, why he shore himself a Frier? He answered, because he would eat his bread with peace. This is the learning of the Friers of <hi>Russia,</hi> which though it be

            <p>Of this kind there are not many, because it is a very hard and cold profession to go naked in <hi>Russia,</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Winter.

Another there was that died not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ago (whom they called <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo)</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:45537:112"/>
that would take upon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the old Emperour for all his crueltie &amp; oppressions done towards his people. His bodie they have translated of late into a sumptuous Church, near the Emperours house in <hi>Mosko,</hi> and have canonized him for a Saint. Many miracles he doth there (for so the Friers make the people to believe) and many offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are made unto him, not onely by the people, but by the chief Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and the Emperour, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse themselves, which visit that Church with great devotion. But this last year, at my being at <hi>Mosko,</hi> this Saint had ill luck in working his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For a lame man that had his limbs restored (as it was pretended by him) was charged by a woman that was familiar with him (being then fallen out) that he halted but in the day time, and could leap merrily when he came home at night. And that he had intended this matter six years before. Now he is put into a Monasterie, and there raileth upon the Friers, that hired him to have this counterfeit miracle practised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45537:112"/>
him. Besides this disgrace, a little before my coming from thence, there were eight slain within his Church by fire in a thunder: Which caused his bels (that were tingling before all day and night long as in triumph of the miracles wrought by <hi>Basileo</hi> their Saint) to ring somewhat soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, and hath wrought no little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to this miracle-worker. There was another of great account at <hi>Ples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko</hi> (called <hi>Nicola</hi> of <hi>Plesko)</hi> that did much good, when this Emperours fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to sack the town, upon sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of their revolting and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against him. The Emperour, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had saluted the <hi>Eremite</hi> at his lodging, sent him a reward. And the <hi>Holy man,</hi> to requite the Emperour, sent him a piece of raw flesh, being then their Lent time. Which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour seeing, bid one to tell him that he marvelled that the <hi>Holy man</hi> would offer him flesh to eat in the Lent, when it was forbidden by order of holy Church. And doth <hi>Evasko</hi> (which is as much to say, as Jack) think (quoth <hi>Nicola)</hi> that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to eat a piece of beasts flesh
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45537:113"/>
in Lent, and not to eat up so much mans flesh as he hath done already? So threatning the Emperour with a prophesie of some hard adventure to come upon him, except he left mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his people, and departed the town, he saved a great many mens lives at that time.</p>
            <p>This maketh the people to like ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well of them, because they are as <hi>Pasquils,</hi> to note their great mens faults, that no man else dare speak of. Yet it falleth out sometime that for this rude libertie, which they take upon them, after a counterfeit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by imitation, of Prophets, they are made away in secret, as was one or two of them in the last Emperours time, for being overbold in speaking against his government.</p>

               </gap>ins. It is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45537:113"/>
done in this order. The Priest enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Church with his Deacon following him. And when he is come to the middle of the Church, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to say with a loud voice, <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slavey Uladika</hi> (that is) <hi>Blesse us heavenly Pastour,</hi> meaning of Christ. Then he addeth, <hi>In the name of the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost, one very God in Trinitie:</hi> and <hi>Aspody Pomeluy,</hi> or, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> repeated three times. This done, he marcheth on towards the Chancel, or <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> (as they use to call it) and so entreth into the <hi>Scharsuey Dwere,</hi> or the heavenly doore, which no man may enter into but the Priest onely. Where standing at the altar or table (set near to the upper wall of the chancell) he saith the Lords prayer, and then again <hi>Aspody Pomeluy,</hi> or <hi>Lord have mercie upon us, Lord have mercie upon us, &amp;c.</hi> pronounced twelve times. Then, <hi>Praised be the Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, for ever and ever.</hi> Whereto the Deacons, and people say, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:45537:114"/>
Next after the Priest addeth the Psalmes for that day, and beginneth with <hi>O come let us worship, and fall down before the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall himself with the Deacons, and people, all turn themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Idols or Images that hang on the wall, and crossing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, bow down three times, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads to the very ground. After this, he readeth the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and <hi>Athanasius</hi> Creed out of the Service book.</p>
            <p>This being done, the Deacon that standeth without the heavenly doore or chancell readeth a piece of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend out of a written book (for they have it not in print) of some Saints life, miracles, &amp;c. This is divided into many parts, for every day in the year, and is read by them with a plain singing note, not unlike to the Popish tune when they sung their Gospels. After all this (which reacheth to an houre and an half, or two houres of length) he addeth certain set Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects or prayers upon that which he hath read out of the Legend before: and so endeth his Service. All this
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45537:114"/>
while stand burning before their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols a great many of wax candles (whereof some are of the bignesse of a mans wast) vowed, or enjoyned by penance upon the people of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
            <p>About 9. of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they have another service, called <hi>Obeidna</hi> (or <hi>Compline)</hi> much after the order of the Popish Service that bare that name. If it be some high or Festivall day, they furnish their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice beside, with, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>We praise thee O God,</hi> &amp;c. sung with a more solemn and curious note.</p>
            <p>Their Evening service is called <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherna,</hi> where the Priest beginneth with <hi>Blaslavey Uladika,</hi> as he did in the morning, and with Psalmes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the <hi>Vecherna.</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, he singeth, <hi>My soul doth magnifie the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And then the Priest, Deacons, and people, all with one voice sing, <hi>Aspody pomeluy,</hi> or <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> thirty times together. Whereunto the boyes that are in the Church answer all with one voice, rowling it up so fast as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45537:115"/>
their lips can go, <hi>Verii, Verii, Verii, Verii,</hi> or <hi>Praise, Praise, Praise,</hi> &amp;c. thirty times together, with a very strange noise. Then is read by the Priest, and upon the holydayes sung, the first Psalm, <hi>Blessed is the man,</hi> &amp;c. And in the end of it is added <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luia</hi> repeated ten times. The next in order is some part of the Gospel read by the Priest, which he endeth with <hi>Alleluia</hi> repeated three times. And so having said a collect in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Saint of that day, he endeth his evening service. All this while the Priest standeth above at the altar or high table, within the Chancel, or <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> whence he never moveth all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice time. The Deacon or Deacons (which are many in their cathedrall Churches) stand without the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel by the <hi>Scharsuey dwere,</hi> or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly doore: for within they may not be seen all the service time, though otherwise their office is to sweep, and keep it, and to set up the wax candles before their Idols. The people stand together the whole ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice time in the body of the Church,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45537:115"/>
and some in the Church porch; for pew or seat they have none within their Churches.</p>
            <p>The Sacrament of baptisme they administer after this manner: The child is brought unto the Church, and this is done within eight dayes after it is born. If it be the child of some Nobleman, it is brought with great pomp in a rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led or wagon, with chairs and cushions of cloth of gold, and such like sumptuous shew of their best furniture. When they are come to the Church, the Priest standeth readie to receive the child within the church-porch, with his tub of water by him. And then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to declare unto them that they have brought a little Infidell to be made a Christian, &amp;c. This ended, he teacheth the witnesses (that are two or three) in a certain set form out of his book, what their dutie is in bringing up the child after he is baptized, <hi>viz.</hi> That he must be taught to know God, and Christ the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. And because God is of great Majestie, and we must not presume to come unto him without Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45537:116"/>
(as the manner is when we make any suit to an Emperour, or great Prince) therefore they must teach him what Saints are the best and chief mediatours, &amp;c. This done, he commandeth the devil in the name of God after a conjuring manner to come out of the water: and so after certain prayers he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the child thrise over head and ears. For this they hold to be a point necessary, that no part of the child be undipped in the water.</p>
            <p>The words that bear with them the form of baptisme uttered by the Priest, when he dippeth in the child, are the very same that are prescribed in the Gospel, and used by us, viz. <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Ghost.</hi> For that they should alter the form of the words, and say <hi>by the holy Ghost</hi> (as I have heard that they did) following cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hereticks of the Greek church, I found to be untrue, as well by report of them that have been often at their baptismes, as by their book of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi> it self, wherein the order of baptisme is precisely set down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:45537:116"/>
When the child is baptized, the Priest layeth oyl and salt tempered together upon the forehead, and both sides of his face, and then upon his mouth, drawing it along with his finger over the childs lips (as did the Popish priests) saying withall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prayers to this effect, that God will make him a good Christian, &amp;c. all this is done in the Church-porch. Then is the child (as being now made a Christian, and meet to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived within the Church doore) carried into the Church, the Priest going before, and there he is present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the chief Idol of the Church, being laid on a cushion before the feet of the image, by it (as by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour) to be commended unto God If the child be sick or weak (specially in the winter) they use to make the water lukewarm. After baptisme the manner is to cut off the hair from the childs head, and having wrapped it within a piece of wax to lay up as a relique or monument in a secret place of the church.</p>
            <p>This is the manner of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, which they account to be the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45537:117"/>
best and perfectest form: As they do all other parts of their religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (as they say) by tradition from the best Church, meaning the Greek. And therefore they will take great pains to make a proselyte or convert either of an infidell, or of a forein Christian, by rebaptizing him after the <hi>Russe</hi> manner. When they take any <hi>Tartar</hi> prisoner, commonly they will offer him life with conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be baptized. And yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade very few of them to redeem their life so, because of the naturall hatred the <hi>Tartar</hi> beareth to the <hi>Russe</hi> and the opinion he hath of his fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and injustice. The year after <hi>Mosko</hi> was fired by the <hi>Chrim Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> there was taken a <hi>Divoymorsey,</hi> one of the chief of that exploit with 300. <hi>Tartars</hi> more: who had all their lives offered them, if they would be baptized after the <hi>Russe</hi> manner. Which they refused all to do, with many reproches against those that perswaded them. And so being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the river <hi>Mosko</hi> (that runneth through the citie) they were all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed after a violent manner, being
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45537:117"/>
thrust down with a knock on the head into the water, through an hole made in the ice for that purpose. Of <hi>Lieflanders</hi> that are captives, there are many that take on them this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Russe</hi> baptisme to get more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and somewhat besides towards their living, which the Emperour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily useth to give them.</p>
            <p>Of Englishmen since they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the countrey there was never any found that so much forgot God, his faith, and countrey, as that he would be content to be baptized <hi>Russe,</hi> for any respect of fear, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment or other means whatsoever, save onely <hi>Richard Relph,</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing before an ungodly trade by keeping a <hi>Caback</hi> (against the order of the countrey) and being put off from that trade, and spoiled by the Emperours officers of that which he had, entred himself this last year in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Russe</hi> profession, and so was rebaptized, living now as much an idolatour, as before he was a riotour, and unthriftie person.</p>
            <p>Such as thus receive the <hi>Russe</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme are first carried into some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45537:118"/>
to be instructed there in the doctrine and ceremonies of the Church. Where they use these cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: First, they put him into a new and fresh suit of apparell, made after the <hi>Russe</hi> fashion, and set a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet or (in Summer) a garland upon his head. Then they anoint his head with oyl, and put a wax can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light into his hand, and so pray over him foure times a day, the space of seven dayes. All this while he is to abstain from flesh, and white meats. The seven dayes being ended, he is purified and washed in a bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stove, and so the eighth day he is brought into the Church, where he is taught by the Friers how to behave himself in presence of their idols, by ducking down, knocking of the head, crossing himself, and such like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, which are the greatest part of the <hi>Russe</hi> religion.</p>
            <p>The Sacrament of the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they receive but once a year, in their great Lent time, a little before Easter. Three at the most are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at one time, and never above. The manner of their communicating
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45537:118"/>
is thus: First they confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of all their sinnes to the Priest, whom they call their ghostly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then they come to the Church, and are called up to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on table, that standeth like an altar, a little removed from the upper end of the Church, after the Dutch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Here first they are asked of the Priest whether they be clean or no, that is, whether they have never a sinne behind that they left unconfes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. If they answer, <hi>No,</hi> they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the table. Where the Priest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with certain usuall prayers, the communicants standing in the meanwhile with their arms folded one within another, like penitentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or mourners. When these prayers are ended, the Priest taketh a spoon, and filleth it full of claret wine, then he putteth into it a small piece of bread, and tempereth them both together, and so delivereth them in the spoon to the Communicants that stand in order, speaking the usuall words of the Sacrament, <hi>Eat this,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Drink this,</hi> &amp;c. both at one time without any pause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:45537:119"/>
After that he delivereth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain bread by it self, and then wine carded together with a little warm water, to represent bloud more right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as they they think) and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter withall, that flowed out of the side of Christ. Whiles this is in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the communicants unfold their arms, and then folding them again, follow the Priest thrice round about the communion toble, and so return to their places again. Where having said certain other prayers, he dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the communicants, with charge to be merry, and chear up themselves for the seven dayes next following; which being ended, he enjoyneth them to fast for it as long time after, which they use to observe with very great devotion, eating nothing else but bread and salt, except a little cabbage, and some other herb or root, with water or quasse mead for their drink.</p>
            <p>This is their manner of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the Sacraments. Wherein what they differ from the institution of Christ, and what ceremonies they have added of their own, or rather
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45537:119"/>
borrowed of the Greeks, may easily be noted.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of the doctrine of the Russe Church, and what errours it holdeth.</head>
            <p>THeir chiefest errours in matter of faith I find to be these: First, concerning the word of God it self they will not read publickly certain books of the Canonicall Scripture, as the books of <hi>Moses,</hi> specially the foure last, <hi>Exodus, Leviticus, Numeri,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> which they say are all made disauthentick, and put out of use by the coming of Christ, as not able to discern the difference betwixt the morall, and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall law. The books of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets they allow of, but reade them not publickly in their churches for the same reason, because they were but directours unto Christ, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as they say) to the nation of the Jews. Onely the book of Psalmes they have in great estimation, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45537:120"/>
sing and say them dayly in their Churches. Of the new Testament they allow and read all, except the <hi>Revelation:</hi> which therefore they read not (though they allow it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they understand it not, neither have the like occasion to know the fulfilling of the prophesies contained within it, concerning especially the apostasie of the Antichristian church, as have the Western Churches. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they have had their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists of the Greek Church, and may find their own falling off, and the punishments for it by the Turkish invasion in the prophecies of that book.</p>
            <p>Secondly (which is the fountain of the rest of all their corruptions both in doctrine and ceremonies) they hold with the Papists, that their Church <hi>Traditions</hi> are of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the written word of God. Wherein they preferre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before other Churches, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have the true and right traditions delivered by the Apostles to the Greek Church, and so unto them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:45537:120"/>
3. That the Church (meaning the Greek, and specially the Patriarch and his Synod, as the head of the rest) have a sovereigne authoritie to interpret the Scripture, and that all are bound to hold that interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as sound and authentick.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Concerning the divine nature and the three persons in the one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God, that the holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father onely, and not from the Sonne.</p>
            <p n="5">5. About the office of Christ they hold many foul errours, and the same almost as doth the Popish church: namely, that he is the sole media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of redemption, but not of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. Their chief reason (if they be talked withall) for defence of this errour is that unapt and foolish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison betwixt God and a Monarch or Prince of this world, that must be sued unto by Mediatours about him: wherein they give speciall preferment to some above others, as to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Virgin,</hi> whom they call <hi>Precheste,</hi> or undefiled, and S. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> whom they call <hi>Scora pomosnick,</hi> or the <hi>Speedy helper,</hi> and say that he hath

300. angels of the chiefest appointed by God to attend upon him. This hath brought them to an horrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of idolatry, after the grossest and prophanest manner, giving unto their images all religious worship of prayer, thanksgiving, offerings, and adoration, with prostrating and knocking their heads to the ground before them, as to God himself. Which because they do to the picture, not to the portraiture of the Saint, they say they worship not an idol, but the Saint in his image, and so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not God, forgetting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, that forbiddeth to make the image or likenesse of any thing, for any religious worship or use whatsoever. Their church-walls are very full of them, richly hanged and set forth with pearl and stone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the smooth table. Though some also they have embossed, that stick from the board almost an inch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. They call them <hi>Chudovodites,</hi> or their miracle-workers: and when they provide them to set up in their Churches, in no case they may say that they have bought the image,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45537:121"/>
but exchanged money for it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For the means of justification, they agree with the Papists, that it is not by faith onely apprehending Christ, but by their works also; and that <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> or the work for the work sake, must needs please God. And therefore they are all in their numbers of prayers, fasts, vows, and offerings to saints, alms-deeds, crossings and such like, and carrie their numbring beads about with them continualy, as well the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and his Nobilitie as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, not onely in the Church, but in all other publick places, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at any set or solemn meeting, as in their fasts, law courts, common consultations, entertainment of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, and such like.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They say with the Papists that no man can be assured of his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the last sentence be passed at the day of judgement.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They use auricular confession, and think that they are purged by the very action from so many sinnes as they confesse by name and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the Priest.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:45537:122"/>
9. They hold three Sacraments, of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> the <hi>Lords supper,</hi> and <hi>the last an oyling,</hi> or <hi>unction.</hi> Yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Sacrament of extreme unction, they hold it not so necessary to salvation as they do baptisme, but think it a great curse and punishment of God if any die without it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They think there is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of baptisme, and that all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that die without it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. They rebaptize as many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (not being of the Greek church) as they convert to their <hi>Russe</hi> profession, because they are divided from the true church, which is the Greek, as they say.</p>
            <p n="12">12. They make a difference of meats and drin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, accounting the use of one to be more holy then of another. And therefore in their set fasts they forbear to eat flesh and white meats (as we call them) after the manner of the Popish superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which they observe so strictly, and with such blind devotion, as that they will rather die then eat one bit of flesh, egges, or such like, for the health of their bodies in their extreme sicknesse.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:45537:122"/>
13. They hold marriage to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for all the Clergie men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the priests onely, and for them also after the first wife, as was said before. Neither do they well allow of it in Lay-men after the second marriage. Which is a pretence now used against the Emperours onely brother, a child of six years old, who therefore is not prayed for in their Churches (as their manner is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for the Princes bloud) because he was born of the sixth marriage, and so not legitimate. This charge was given to the priests by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himself, by procurement of the <hi>Godonoes:</hi> who make him believe that it is a good pollicie to turn away the liking of the people from the next successour.</p>
            <p>Many other false opinions they have in matter of religion. But these are the chief, which they hold partly by means of their traditions (which they have received from the Greek Church) but specially by ignorance of the holy Scriptures. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they have in the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> tongue, (that is all one with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45537:123"/>
theirs some few words excepted) yet few of them read them with that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care which they ought to do: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they (if they would) books sufficient of the old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the common people, but of their Liturgie onely, or book of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon service, whereof there are great numbers.</p>
            <p>All this mischief cometh from the Clergie, who being ignorant and godlesse themselves, are very wary to keep the people likewise in their ignorance and blindnesse, for their living and bellies sake; partly also from the manner of government set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled among which the Emperours (whom it specially behoveth) list not to have changed by any innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to retain that religion that best agreeth with it. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it is not to be doubted, but that having the word of God in some sort (though without the ordinary means to attain to a true sense and understanding of it) God hath also his number among them. As may partly appear by that which a <hi>Russe</hi> at <hi>Mosko</hi> said in secret to one of my
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45537:123"/>
servants, speaking against their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and other superstitions, That God had given unto England light to day, and might give it to morrow (if he pleased) to them.</p>
            <p>As for any inquisition or proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against men for matter of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I could hear of none; save a few years since against one man and his wife, who were kept in a close prison the space of 28. years; till they were overgrown into a deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fashion, for their hair, nails, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of countenance, and such like, and in the end were burned at <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko,</hi> in a small house set on fire. The cause was kept secret, but like it was for some part of truth in matter of religion; though the people were made to believe by the Priests and Friers, that they held some great and damnable heresie.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIV. Of the manner of solemnizing their Marriages.</head>
            <p>THe manner of making and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing their marriages is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the manner of other countries. The man (though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw the woman before) is not permitted to have any sight of her all the time of his woing, which he doth not by himself, but by his mother or some other ancient woman of his kinne (aswell by the parents as by the parties themselves, for without the knowledge and consent of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the contract is not lawfull) the fathers on both sides, or such as are to them in stead of fathers, with other chief friends, having a meeting and conference about the dowrie, which is commonly very large, after the abilitie of the parents: so that you shall have a market man (as they call them) give a 1000. rubbels or more with his daughter.</p>
            <p>As for the man it is never required of him, nor standeth with their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45537:124"/>
to make any joynter in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the dowrie. But in case he have a child by his wife, she enjoyeth a third deal after his decease. If he have two children by her or more, she is to have a courtesie more, at the discretion of the husband. If the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band depart without issue by his wife, she is returned home to her friends without any thing at all, save onely her dowrie, if the husband leave so much behind him in goods. When the agreement is made concerning the dowrie, they signe bonds one to the other, as well for the paiment of the dowrie, as the performing of the marriage by a certain day. If the woman were never married before, her father and friends are bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to assure her a maiden. Which breedeth many brabbles and quarrels at Law, if the man take any conceit concerning the behaviour and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of his wife.</p>
            <p>Thus the contract being made, the parties begin to send tokens the one to the other, the woman first, then afterwards the man, but yet se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> house, with her marriage-apparel and bedsted with her, which they are to lie in. For this is ever provided by the Bride, and is commonly very fair, with much cost bestowed upon it. Here she is accompanied all that night by her mother, and other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but not welcomed, nor once seen by the Bridegroom himself.</p>
            <p>When the time is come to have the marriage solemnized, the Bride hath put upon her a kind of hood, made of fine knitwork, or lawn, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth her head and all her body down to the middle; and so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with her friends, and the bridegroom with his, they go to Church all on horseback, though the Church be near hand, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but of very mean degree. The words of contract, and other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in solemnizing the marriage, are much after the order, and with the same words that are used with us, with a ring also given to the Bride.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45537:125"/>
Which being put on, and the words of contract pronounced, the Brides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and is delivered into the hand of the Bridegroom, which standeth all this while on the one side of the altar or table, and the Bride on the other. So the marriage knot being knit by the Priest, the Bride cometh to the Bridegroom (standing at the end of the altar or table) and falleth down at his feet, knocking her head upon his shoe, in token of her subjection and obedience. And the Bridegroom again casteth the lap of his gown or upper garment over the Bride, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his dutie to protect, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish her.</p>
            <p>Then the Bridegroom and Bride standing both together at the tables end, cometh first the father, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends of the Bride, &amp; bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves down low to the Bridegroom; and so likewise his friends bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Bride, in token of affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and love ever after betwixt the two kindreds. And withall, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Bridegroom offereth to the Priest a loaf of bread, who delivereth it straight again to the father, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45537:126"/>
other friends of the Bride, with atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station before God and their idols, that he deliver the dowrie wholly and truly at the day appointed, and hold love ever after, one kindred with another. Whereupon they break the loaf into pieces, and eat of it, to testifie their true and sincere mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for performing of that charge, and thenceforth to become as grains of one loaf, or men of one table.</p>
            <p>These ceremonies being ended, the Bridegroom taketh the Bride by the hand, and so they go on together with their friends after them, towards the Church-porch, where meet them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with pots and cups in their hands, with mead and <hi>Russe</hi> wine: whereof the Bridegroom taketh first a chark or little cup full in his hand, and drinketh to the Bride, who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hood or veil below, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cup to her mouth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it (for being seen of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom) pledgeth him again.

               </gap>ogether from the Church, the Bridegroom goeth not home to his own, but to his fathers house, and she likewise to hers, where either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain

their friends apart. At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the house, they use to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Evening is come, the Bride is brought to the Bridegrooms fathers house, and there lodgeth that night, with her veil or cover still o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her head. All that night she may not speak one word (for that charge she receiveth by tradition from her mother, &amp; other matrons her friends) that the Bridegroom must neither heare, nor see her, till the day after the marriage. Neither three dayes after may she be heard to speak, save certain few words at the table, in a set form, with great manners, and reverence to the Bridegroom. If she behave herself otherwise, it is a great prejudice to her credit, and life ever after; and will highly be disliked of the Bridegroom himself.</p>
            <p>After the third day they depart to their own, and make a feast to both their friends together. The marriage day, and the whole time of their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivall,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:45537:127"/>
the Bridegroom hath the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be called <hi>Moloday Knez,</hi> or young Duke, and the Bride <hi>Moloday Knezay,</hi> or young Dutchesse.</p>
            <p>In living with their wives, they shew themselves to be but of a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition, using them as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, rather then wives; except the Noble-women, which are, or seem to be of more estimation with their husbands then the rest of meaner sort. They have this foul abuse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to good order and the word of God it self, that upon dislike of his wife, or other cause whatsoever the man may go into a Monasterie, and shier himself a Frier, by pretence of devotion, and so leave his wife to shift for herself so well as she can.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXV. Of the other Ceremonies of the Russe Church.</head>
            <p>THe other ceremonies of their Church are many in number, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, the abuse about the signe of the Crosse, which they set up in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:45537:127"/>
their high-wayes, in the tops of their Churches, and in every doore of their houses, signing themselves continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with it on their foreheads and breasts, with great devotion, as they will seem by their outward gesture. Which were lesse offence, if they gave not withall that religious reverence and worship unto it which is due to God onely, and used the dumbe shew and signing of it instead of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and of all other duties which they ow unto God. When they rise to the morning, they go commonly in the sight of some steeple that hath a crosse on the top, and so bowing themselves towards the crosse, signe themselves withall on their foreheads and breasts. And this is their thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God for their nights rest, without any word speaking, except peradventure they say, <hi>Aspody Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luy,</hi> or, <hi>Lord have mercie upon us.</hi> When they sit down to meat, and rise again from it, the thanksgiving to God is the crossing of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and breasts, except it be some few that adde peradventure a word or two of some ordinarie prayer, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:45537:128"/>
to that purpose. When they are to give an oath for the deciding of any controversie at Law, they do it by swearing by the Crosse, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et of it, making it as God, whose name onely is to be used in such triall of justice. When they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any house (where ever there is an idol hanging on the wall) they signe themselves with the crosse, and bow themselves to it. When they begin any work, be it little or much, they arm themselves first with the signe of the crosse. And this commonly is all their prayer to God for good speed of their businesse. And thus they serve God with crosses, after a crosse and vain manner, not understanding what the crosse of Christ is, nor the power of it. And yet they think all strangers Christians to be no better then Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks in comparison of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (and so they will say) because they bow not themselves, when they meet with the crosse, nor signe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with it, as the <hi>Russe</hi> manner is.</p>
            <p>They have holy water in like use and estimation as the Popish Church
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:45537:128"/>
hath. But herein they exceed them, in that they do not onely hallow their holy water stocks, and tubs full of water, but all the rivers of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey once every year. At <hi>Mosko</hi> it is done with great pomp and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Emperour himself being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at it, with all his Nobility marching through the streets towards the river of <hi>Moskua,</hi> in manner of procession, in this order as followeth. First go two Deacons, with banners in their hands, the one of <hi>Precheste</hi> (or our Ladie) the other of S. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> fighting with the dragon. Then follow after the rest of the Deacons and the priests of <hi>Mosko,</hi> two and two in a ranck, with copes on their backs, and their idols at their breasts, carried with girdles or slings, made fast about their necks. Next the priests come their Bishops in their pontificalibus; then the Friers, Monks, and Abbots; and after, the Patriarch in rich attire, with a ball or sphere on the top of his mitre, to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie his universalitie over that Church: Last cometh the Emperour with all his nobility. The whole train
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:45537:129"/>
is of a mile long, or more. When they are come to the river, a great hole is made in the yce, where the market is kept, of a rod and a half broad, with a stage round about it to keep off the presse. Then beginneth the Patriarch to say certain prayers, and conjureth the devil to come out of the water: and so casting in salt, and censing it with frankincen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, maketh the whole river to become ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water. The morning before all the people of <hi>Mosko</hi> use to make crosses of chalk over every doore, and window of their houses, lest the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil being conjured out of the water should flie into their houses.</p>
            <p>When the ceremonies are ended, you shall see the black guard of the Emperours house, and then the rest of the town, with their pails and buckets, to take of the hallowed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for drink, and other uses. You shall also see the women dip in their children over head and ears, &amp; many men and women leap into it, some naked, some with their clothes on when some man would think his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would frieze off if he should but
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:45537:129"/>
dip it into the water. When the men have done, they bring their horse to the river, to drink of the sanctified water, and so make them as holy as a horse. Their set day for this solemn action of hallowing their rivers, is that we call <hi>Twelfthday.</hi> The like is done by other Bishops, in all parts of the Realm.</p>
            <p>Their manner is also to give it to their sick, in their greatest extremity, thinking that it will either recover them, or sanctifie them to God. Whereby they kill many, through their unreasonable superstition, as did the <hi>Lord Borris</hi> his onely sonne, at my being at the <hi>Mosko,</hi> whom he killed (as was said by the physicians) by pouring into him cold holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and presenting him naked into the Church to their Saint <hi>Basileo,</hi> in the cold of the Winter in an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of sicknesse.</p>
            <p>They have an image of Christ, which they call <hi>Neruchi</hi> (which si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth as much as <hi>Made without hands)</hi> for so their priests and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition withall perswadeth them it was. This in their processions they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:45537:130"/>
carrie about with them on high upon a pole, enclosed within a pix, made like a lanthorn, and do reverence to it as to a great mysterie.</p>
            <p>At every brewing, their manner is likewise to bring a dish of their wort to the Priest within the Church, which being hallowed by him is poured into the brewing, and so gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it such a virtue, as when they drink of it they are seldome sober. The like they do with the first fruits of their corn in Harvest.</p>
            <p>They have another ceremonie on Palmsunday, of ancient traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what time the Patriarch rideth through the <hi>Mosko</hi> the Emperour himself holding his horse bridle, and the people crying <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and spreading their upper garments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his horse feet. The Emperour hath of the Patriarch for his good service of that day 200. rubbels of standing pension. Another pageant they have much like to this, the week before the nativitie of Christ, when every Bishop in his Cathedrall Church setteth forth a sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the three children in the Oven, where
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:45537:130"/>
the Angel is made to come flying from the roof of the Church with great admiration of the lookers on, and many terrible flashes of fire are made with rosen and gun-powder by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> (as they call them) that run about the town all the twelve dayes, disguised in their players coats, and make much good sport for the honour of the Bishops pageant. At the <hi>Mosko</hi> the Emperour himself, and the Empresse never fail to be at it, though it be but the same matter plaid every year, without any new invention at all.</p>
            <p>Besides their fasts on Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes and Fridayes throughout the whole year (the one because they say Christ was sold on the Wednesday, the other because he suffered on the Friday) they have foure great Fasts or Lents every year. The first (which they call their great Lent) is at the same time with ours. The second, about Midsummer. The third, in Harvest time. The fourth, about Hallontide: which they keep not of policie, but of mere superstition. In their great Lent for the first week

they eat nothing but bread and salt, and drink nothing but water, neither meddle with any matter of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but intend their shrieving and fasting onely. They have also 3. <hi>Vigils</hi> or <hi>Wakes</hi> in their great Lent, which they call <hi>Stoiania,</hi> and the last Friday their great <hi>Vigil,</hi> as they call it, what time the whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish must be present in the Church, and watch from nine a clock in the Evening till six in the morning, all the while standing, save when they fall down and knock their heads to their idols, which must be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and seventie times just through the whole night.</p>
            <p>About their burialls also they have many superstitious and profane ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as putting within the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the corps a letter to Saint <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> whom they make their chief mediatour, and as it were the porter of heaven gates, as the Papists do their <hi>Peter.</hi>

            <p>In Winter time, when all is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with snow, and the ground so hard frozen, as that no spade nor pikeax can enter, their manner is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45537:131"/>
not to burie their dead, but to keep the bodies (so many as die all the Winter time) in an house, in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, or out parts of the town, which they call <hi>Bohsedom,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods house,</hi> where the dead bodies are piled up together like billets on a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stack, as hard with the frost as a very stone, till the Springtide come, and resolveth the frost, what time every man taketh his dead friend, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth him to the ground.</p>
            <p>They have besides their years and moneths minds for their friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, what time they have prayers said over the grave by the Priest, who hath a penie ordinary for his pains. When any dieth, they have ordinary women mourners, that come to lament for the dead par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and stand howling over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, after a profane and heathenish manner (sometimes in the house, sometimes bringing the bodie into the backside) asking him what he wanted, and what he meant to die.

Many other vain and superstitious ceremonies they have, which were long and tedious to report. By these it may appear how farre they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the true knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Christian religion, having exchanged the word of God for their vain traditions, and brought all to externall and ridiculous ceremonies, without any regard of spirit and truth, which God requireth in his true worship.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVI. Of the Emperours domestick, or private behaviour.</head>
            <p>THe Emperours private behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, so much as may be, or is meet to be known, is after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He riseth commonly about 4. a clock in the morning. After his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelling and washing, in cometh his ghostly father or priest of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is named in their tongue, <hi>Otetz Duhouna,</hi> with his crosse in his hand, wherewith he blesseth him, laying it first on his forehead, then
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:45537:132"/>
upon his cheeks, or sides of his face, and then offereth him the end of it to kisse. This done, the Clerk of the crosse (called <hi>Chersby Deyack Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)</hi> bringeth into his chamber a paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed image, representing the Saint for that day. For every day with them hath his severall Saint, as it were the patron for that day. This he placeth among the rest of his image gods, wherewithall his chamber is decked, as thick almost as the wall can bear, with lamps and wax candles burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them. They are very cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gorgeously decked with pearl, and precious stone. This image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed before him, the Emperour beginneth to crosse himself after the <hi>Russe</hi> manner, first on the forehead, then on both fides of his breast, with <hi>Aspody Pomeluy, Pomeluy mena hosp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, sacroy mena gresuick Syhodestua:</hi> which is as much to say, as, <hi>Help me O Lord my God, Lord comfort me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and keep me a sinner from doing evil, &amp;c.</hi> This he directeth towards the image or Saint for that day; whom he nameth in his prayer, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our Ladie (whom they call
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:45537:133"/>
               <hi>Precheste) Saint Nicholas,</hi> or some other, to whom he beareth most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, bowing himself prostrate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, with knocking his head to the very ground. Thus he continueth the space of a quarter of an houre or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>Then cometh again the ghostly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or chamber priest with a silver bowl full of holy water, which they call in <hi>Russe, Tweta Voda,</hi> and a sprinkle of Basill (as they call it) in his hand: and so all to besprinkleth first the image-gods, and then the Emperour. This holy water is brought fresh every day from the Monasteries, farre and near, sent to the Emperour from the Abbot or Prior, in the name of the Saint, that is patron of that Monasterie, as a speciall token of good will from him.</p>
            <p>These devotions being ended, he sendeth in to the Empresse, to ask whether she hath rested in health, &amp;c. And after a little pause goeth himself to salute her in a middle room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both their chambers. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse lieth apart from him, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not one chamber nor table with
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:45537:133"/>
the Emperour ordinarily, save upon the eve of their Lents, or common Fasts, what time she is his ordinary guest at bed and boord. After their meeting in the morning, they go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to their private Church or Chapel, where is said or sung a morning Service (called <hi>Zautrana)</hi> of an houre long or thereabouts. From the Church he returneth home, and sitteth him down in a great chamber, to be seen and saluted by his Nobilitie, such as are in favour about the Court. If he have to say to any of them, or they to him, then is the time. And this is ordinary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his health, or some other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion alter the custome.</p>
            <p>About nine in the morning he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to another Church within his Castle, where is sung by Priests and Choristers the high Service (called <hi>Obeadna</hi> or <hi>Complin)</hi> which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lasteth two houres, the Emperour in the mean time talking commonly with some of his Councel, Nobilitie, or captains, which have to say to him, or he to them: And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel likewise conferre together among
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:45537:134"/>
themselves, as if they were in their councel house. This ended, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth home, and recreateth himself untill it be dinner time.</p>
            <p>He is served at his table on this manner. First, every dish (as it is delivered at the dresser) is tasted by the Cook, in the presence of the high Steward, or his Deputie, and so is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Gentlemen wayters (called <hi>Shilshey)</hi> and by them carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the Emperours table, the high Steward or his Deputie going before: There it is received by the Sewer (called <hi>Erastnoy)</hi> who giveth a taste of every dish to the Taster, and so placeth it before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The number of his dishes for his ordinarie service is about seventy, dressed somewhat grossely, with much garlick and salt, much after the Dutch manner. When he exceedeth upon some occasion of the day, or entertainment of some Ambassadour, he hath many more dishes. The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is sent up by two dishes at a time, or three at the most, that he may eat it warm, first the baked, then the rost meats, and last the broths. In his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45537:134"/>
dining chamber is another table, where sit the chief of his Nobilitie that are about his Court, and his ghostly father, or Chaplain. On the one side of the chamber standeth a cupboard or table of plate, very fair and rich, with a great cistern of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by it, full of ice and snow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in stand the pots that serve for that meal. The taster holdeth the cup that he drinketh in all dinner time, and delivereth it unto him with a say, when he calleth for it. The manner is to make many dishes out of the service after it is set on the table, and to send them to such Noblemen and officers as the Emperour liketh best. And this is counted a great favour and honour.</p>
            <p>After dinner he layeth him down to rest, where commonly he taketh three houres sleep, except he employ one of the houres to bathing, or box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this custome for sleeping after dinner is an ordinary matter with him, as with all the <hi>Russes.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his sleep, he goeth to evensong (called <hi>Vechurna)</hi> and thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, for the most part recreateth
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:45537:135"/>
himself with the Empresse till supper time, with jesters, and dwarfs, men and women, that tumble before him, and sing many songs after the <hi>Russe</hi> manner. This is his common recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt meals, that he most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in. One other speciall recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the fight with wild Bears, which are caught in pits, or nets, and are kept in barred cages for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, against the Emperour be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to see the pastime. The fight with the Bear is on this sort. The man is turned into a circle walled round about, where he is to quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so well as he can, for there is no way to flie out. When the Bear is turned loose, he cometh upon him with open mouth. If at the first push he misse this aim, so that the Bear come within him, he is in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But the wild Bear, being very fierce, hath this qualitie, that giveth advantage to the Hunter; his manner is when he assaileth a man to rise up right on his two hinder legs, and so to come roring with open mouth upon him: And if the Hunter then can push right into the very breast of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:45537:135"/>
him, betwixt his forelegges (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he will not misse) resting the other end of their boarspear at the side of his foot, and so keeping the pike still towards the face of the Bear, he speedeth him commonly at one blow. But many times these Hunters come short, and are either slain, or miserably torn with the teeth and talents of the fierce beast. If the partie quit himself well in this sight with the Bear, he is carried to drink at the Emperours seller doore: where he drinketh himself drunk for the honour of <hi>Hospodare.</hi> And this is his reward for adventuring his life, for the Emperours pleasure. To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this pastime the Emperour hath certain huntsmen that are appointed for that purpose to take the wild Bear. This is his recreation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on the holy dayes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he spendeth his time in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his goldsmiths, and jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, taylers, embroiderers, painters, and such like, and so goeth to his supper. When it draweth towards bed time, his priest saith certain pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and then the Emperour blesseth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:45537:136"/>
and crosseth himself, as in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for a quarter of an houre or thereabouts, and so goeth to his bed.</p>
            <p>The Emperour that now is (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Theodore Juanowich)</hi> is for his person of a mean stature, somewhat low and grosse, of a sallow complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; inclining to the dropsie, hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosed, unsteadie in his pace by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some weaknesse of his limbs, heavie and unactive, yet commonly smiling almost to a laughter. For qualitie otherwise, simple and slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted, but very gentle, and of an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie nature, quiet, mercifull, of no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall disposition, nor greatly apt for matter of policie, very superstitious, and infinite that way. Besides his private devotions at home, he goeth every week commonly on pilgrimage to some Monasterie or other that is nearest hand. He is 34. years old, or thereabouts, and hath reigned almost the space of six years.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVIII. Of the private behaviour or qualitie of the Russe people.</head>
            <p>THe private behaviour and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Russe</hi> people may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be understood by that which hath been said concerning the publick state and usage of the countrey. As touching the naturall habit of their bodies, they are for the most part of a large size, and of very fleshly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: accounting it a grace to be somewhat grosse and burley, and therefore they nourish and spread their beards to have them long and broad. But for the most part they are very unwieldie and unactive withall. Which may be thought to come partly of the climate, and the numbnesse which they get by the cold in winter, and partly of their diet, that standeth most of root<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, onions garlick, cabbage, and su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h like things that breed grosse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which they use to eat alon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and with their other meats.</p>
            <p>Their diet is rather much then cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:45537:138"/>
At their meals they begin commonly with a <hi>Chark</hi> or small cup of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> (which they call <hi>Russe</hi> wine) and then drink not till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of their meals, taking it in largely, and altogether, with kissing one another at every pledge. And therefore after dinner there is no talking with them, but every man goeth to his bench to take his after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons sleep, which is as ordinary with them as their nights rest. When they exceed, and have varietie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, the first are their baked meats (for rost meats they use little) and then their broaths or pottage. To drink drunk, is an ordinary matter with them every day in the week. Their common drink is <hi>Mead:</hi> the poorer sort use water, and a thin drink called <hi>Quasse,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else (as we say) but water turned out of his wits, with a little branne meashed with it.</p>
            <p>This diet would breed in them many diseases, but that they use bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoves or hot-houses in stead of all Physick, commonly twice or thrice every week. All the winter-time,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:45537:139"/>
and almost the whole Summer, they heat there <hi>Peaches,</hi> which are made like the <hi>Germane</hi> bathstoves, and their <hi>Potlads</hi> like ovens, that so warm the house, that a stranger at the first shall hardly like of it. These two extremities, specially in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of heat within their houses, and of extreme cold without, together with their die<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, maketh them of a dark and fallow complexion, their skinnes being tanned and parched both with cold and with heat; speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the women, that for the greater part are of farre worse complexions then the men. Whereof the cause I take to be their keeping within the hot houses, and busying themselves about the heating and using of their bathstoves and peaches.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Russe,</hi> because that he is used to both these extremities of heat and of cold, can bear them both a great deal more patiently then strangers can do. You shall see them sometimes (to season their bodies) come out of their bathstoves all on a froth, and fuming, as hot almost as a pig at a spit, and presently to leap into the

               </gap> their bodies, and that in the coldest of all the winter-time. The women to mend the bad hue of their skinnes use to paint their faces with white and red colours, so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that every man may perceive it. Which is made no matter, because it is common, and liked well by their husbands: who make their wives and daughters an ordinary allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to buy them colours to paint their faces withall, and delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves much to see th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m of fowl wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to become such, fair images. This parcheth the skin, and helpeth to deform them when their painting is off.</p>
            <p>They apparel themselves after the Greek manner. The Noblemans at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire is on this fashion: First a <hi>Taffia,</hi> or little night cap on his head, that covereth little more then his crown, commonly very rich, wrought of silk and gold thread, and set with pearl &amp; precious stone. His head be keepeth shaven close to the very skin, except he be in some displeasure with the Emperour: Then he suffereth his hair
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:45537:140"/>
to grow and hang down upon his shoulders, covering his face as uggly and deformedly as he can. Over the <hi>Taffia</hi> he weareth a wide cap of black Fox (which they account for the best furre) with a <hi>Tiara</hi> or long bonnet put within it, standing up like a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> hat. About his neck (which is seen all bare) is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler set with pearl and precious stone, about three or foure fingers broad. Next over his shirt (which is curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wrought, because he strippeth himself into it in the Summer time, while he is within the house) is a <hi>Shepon,</hi> or light garment of silk, made down to the knees, buttoned before: and then a <hi>Caftan</hi> or a close coat buttoned, and girt to him with a <hi>Persian girdle,</hi> whereat he hangs his knives and spoon. This commonly is of cloth of gold, and hangeth down as low as his ancles. Over that he weareth a loose garment of some rich silk, furred and faced about with some gold lace, called a <hi>Ferris.</hi> Another over that of chamlet, or like stuff called an <hi>Alkaben,</hi> sleeved and hanging low, and the cape commonly

called <hi>Obrosa</hi> of white colour over that her cap (made after the coif fashion of cloth of gold) called <hi>Shapka Zempska,</hi> edged with some rich furre, and set with pearl and stone. Though they have of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to disdain embroidering with pearl about their caps, because the Dyacks and some Merchants wives have taken up the fashion. In their ears they wear ear-rings (which they call <hi>Sargee)</hi> of two inches or more compasse, the matter of gold set with Rubies, or Saphires, or some like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stone. In summer they go often with kerchiefs of fine white lawn, or cambrick, fastned under the chinne, with two long tassels pendent. The kerchief spotted &amp; set thick with rich pearl. When they ride or go abroad in rainie weather, they wear white hats with coloured bands (called <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa Zemskoy.)</hi> About their necks they wear collers of three or foure fingers broad, set with rich pearl and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone. Their upper garment is a loose gown, called <hi>Oposken,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of skarlet, with wide loose sleeves, hanging down to the ground, but

Which hath hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over it, fastned under the cap, a large broad cape of some rich furre, that hangeth down almost to the middes of their backs. Next under the <hi>Oposken</hi> or upper garment, they wear another, called a <hi>Leitnick,</hi> that is made close before with great wide sleeves, the cuff or half sleeve up to the elbows, commonly of cloth of gold, and under that a <hi>Ferris Zems<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy,</hi> which hangeth loose buttoned throughout to the very foot. On the handwrests they wear very fair bracelets, about two fingers broad of pearl and precious stone.

The poorer sort of them have their <hi>Odnoratkey,</hi> or upper garment, made of Cows hair. This is their winter habit. In the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time commonly they wear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their shirts on their backs and buskins on their legges.

            <p>As touching their behaviour, and quality otherwise, they are of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

capacities, if they had those means that some other nations have to train up thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which they might bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the <hi>Polonians,</hi> and other their neighbours, but that they refuse it of a very self pride, as accounting their own fashions to be farre the best. Partly also (as I said before) for that their manner of bringing up (void of all good learning and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil behaviour) is thought by their governours most agreeable to that State, and their manner of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which the people would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear, if they were once civilled, and brought to more understanding of God, and good policie. This causeth the Emperours to keep out all means of making it better; and to be very warie for excluding all peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that might alter their fashions. Which were lesse to be disliked, if it set not a print into the very minds of his people. For as themselves are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly and cruelly dealt withall by their chief Magistrates, and other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; so are they as cruell one against another, specially over their
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:45537:143"/>
inferiours, and such as are under them. So that the basest and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edest <hi>Christianoe</hi> (as they call him) that stoopeth and croucheth like a dog to the Gentleman, and licketh up the dust that lieth at his feet, is an intolerable tyrant where he hath the advantage. By this means the whole Countrey is filled with rapine and murder. They make no account of the life of a man. You shall have a man robbed sometime in the very streets of their towns, if he go late in the evening, and yet no man to come forth out of his doores to rescue him, though he hear him crie out. I will not speak of the strangenesse of the murders, and other cruelties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted among them, that would scarcely be believed to be done among men, specially such as professe themselves Christians.</p>
            <p>The number of their vagrant and begging poore is almost infinite, that are so pinched with famine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme need, as that they begge after a violent and desperate manner, with <hi>give me and cut me, give me and kill me,</hi> and such like phrases. Whereby
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:45537:143"/>
it may be ghessed what they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards strangers, that are so unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and cruell, towards their own. And yet it may be doubted whether is the greater, the crueltie or intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie that is used in that countrey. I will not speak of it, because it is so foul, and not to be named. The whole countrey overfloweth with all sinne of that kind. And no marvell, as having no law to restrain whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, adulteries, and like unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life.</p>
            <p>As for the truth of his word, the <hi>Russe</hi> for the most part maketh small regard of it, so he may gain by a lie, and breach of his promise. And it may be said truly (as they know best that have traded most with them) that from the great to the small (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some few<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
