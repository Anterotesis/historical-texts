         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By the Commissioners of the late Parliament,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE best endeavours, and
greatest workes wherein the
hand and providence of God
have been most evident and
sensible, and the hearts and
intentions of men called to
be the instruments most pious
and sincere, though they
found approbation with the
wiser sort, and such as are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to observation, yet they have ever been subject to
be misconstrued by blind suspition, to be reproved by
cavilling censure, which maketh place for it self to enter
where it findeth none, and to be condemned of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and of such as are at ease, but most of all of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
who can not be pleased even when God is best
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155:3"/>
pleased, and when men seek to approve themselves to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every
ones conscience; But in their hearts wish ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <hi>the Temple should not be built, Religion never
reformed, and they themselves coutch betwixt the two bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
then that they should be in their worldly projects
or possessions opposed or troubled. <hi>The deliverance of
the people of God of old from the Egyptian servitude; The
redemption of the Kirk by the Son of God, and the planting
of Christian Religion by his servants, and the vindication
of Religion from Romish superstition and tyranny,</hi> which
are the greatest and most wonderfull works of GOD,
have been most bitterly calumniated, and spitefully
spurned against by the wicked.</p>
            <p>The nature and quality of this great Work, wherein
the Lord hath honoured us to be Agents, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
which we have found of continuall opposition,
since the beginning, may teach us, if we be not as the
horse and muse which have no understanding, that we
are to expect the gainsaying of sinners; and that nothing
can be hatched in hell by Satan, or prompted by his
Supposts on Earth, which will not be produced to
make us and the cause of God, which we maintaine odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all men, but most of all to our Neighbours and
dearest Brethren. When we shall now enter into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it will be layed to our charge, that we minde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but invasion, and that no lesse hath been intended
by us from the beginning, then under the pretext of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our Religion and Liberties, to enrich our selves
with their possessions and goods: But our peaceable
carriage many yeares past, before the time of those late
troubles, our Informations, Declarations, and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances
published to the world, wherein we have cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155:3"/>
all Nationall invasion, and our willingnesse when
we were in Armes, to lay them downe upon the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
assurances of enjoying our Religion and Liberties,
will be conceived by the wise and well affected, to bee
more plaine and sure evidences of our meaning, then
all that malice can devise, or calumnie can expresse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us.</p>
            <p>Neither have any new emergents altered, but rather
confirmed our former resolutions. for although both
before and since the late pacification, wee have beene
highly injuried by some Papists, and Prelats, and their
adherents there, who have beene, and are still seeking
no lesse then that wee should no more bee a Kirk or a
Nation, and therefore themselves can not thinke, but
we must accompt of them as Gods enemies and ours;
yet above all the favours wee have received from the
good people and Body of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi>
One there is, which hath highly honoured them before
the world, and endeered them unto us more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which shall never be forgotten by us, and wee hope
shall be thankfully remembred by our Children, and
Childrens Children after us, to all generations; That
when upon mis-information, the Councell of <hi>England</hi>
had concluded to use force against us, when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Ireland</hi> had offered their Persons and Estates
for supply against us, when all plots and policies were
set on work, and publick Declarations by authority
were made, and the Parliament called for this very end,
when we had been traduced and proclaimed as tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
and rebels at every Paroch Kirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet so wise, so
grave, so just was that High Court of Parliament (to
their everlasting honour be it remembred) that no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155:4"/>
threatnings, nor feares, nor promises, nor hopes, could
moove them to decerne a Warre, or grant any Subsidie
for a Warre against us; but rather by their speeches,
complaints, and grievances paralell to ours, did justifie
the Cause which we defend.</p>
            <p>This rich and recent favour doth so binde our hearts,
that were our power never so great, we should judge
our selves the unworthiest of all men, and could look
for no lesse then vengeance from the righteous GOD,
if we should moove hand or foot against that Nation,
so comfortably to us represented in that honourable
meeting. In this our than full acknowledgment, wee
desire that the City of <hi>London</hi> may have their owne
large share, as they well deserve by the noble proofes
they have given of their constant affection to Religion,
and the peace of both Kingdomes, notwithstanding the
continuall assaults of the mis-leaders of King and Court
living amongst them, and alwayes sounding the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of Sedition in their eares: And if this which doth
so convince us, shall not be thought sufficient to satisfie
all the good people of <hi>England,</hi> VVee now before
GOD and the world, make offer in generall, and will
make offer to so many of them as will require it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
of the strongest and most inviolable bond of our
solemne Oath and religious attestation of the great
Name of GOD, who is our feare &amp; our dread, &amp; from
whom we hope for a blessing upon our Expedition, that
we intend no enimitie or rapine, and shall take no mans
goods, nor ingage our selves in blood by fighting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we be forced unto it, which we may look for from
the Papists, Prelats, and others of that faction; but that
any such thing shall come from godly men, or good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155:4"/>
who love the trueth of Religion, or the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and their owne Libertie, both the rule of charity,
which entertaineth no suspition, where there is no evill-deserving,
and the rule of wisedome, which teacheth,
that both Nations must now stand or fall together, doe
forbid us to apprehend.</p>
            <p>All the designe of both Kingdomes is, for the trueth
of Religion, and for the just Liberty of the Subject; and
all the devices and doings of the enemy are for oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of both, that our Religion may bee turned into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and Atheisme, and our Libertie into base ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
and bondage: To bring this to passe, they have
certainly conceived, that the blocking up of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by Sea and Land, would proove a powerfull and
infallible meane: for either within a very short time
shall wee through want of trade, and spoyling of our
goods, bee brought to such extreamity, poverty, and
confusion, that we shall miserably desire the conditions
which wee now despise and declyne, and bee forced to
embrace their will for a Law, both in Kirk and Policie,
which will bee a precedent for the like misery in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
taught by our example to be more wise. Or upon
the other part, we shall by this invasion bee constrayned
furiously, and without order, to breake into <hi>England,</hi>
which we beleeve is their more earnest desire, because a
more speedy execution of their designe: For we doubt
not but upon our comming, clamours will bee raysed,
posts sent, and Proclamations made through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to slander our pious and just intentions, as if this
had been our meaning from the beginning, To stirre up
all the English against us, that once being entered in
blood, they may with their owne swords, extirpat their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155:5"/>
own Religion, lay a present foundation with their own
hands for building of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the midst of them, and be
made the authors both of their own and our slavery, to
continue for ever.</p>
            <p>But in this admirable opportunity of vindication of
true Religion and just Liberty, if divine providence bee
looked upon with a reverent by, and men fearing GOD,
and loving the Kings honour, and peace of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
shall walke worthy of their Profession, although
the enemies have obtained so much of their desires, as
by coards of their own twisting to draw us into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
yet may their maine designe be disappointed, the
rope which they have made, brought upon their owne
necks, and their wisedome turned into foolishnes, which
we have reason to hope for from that Supreame wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and power, which hath in all the proceedings of
this VVork, turned their devices upon their own pates
that plotted them.</p>
            <p>In our <hi>Informations, Remonstrances,</hi> and the <hi>True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of our proceeding; since the late pacification,</hi>
we have so farre expressed the wrongs which wee have
sustained, and the distresses which wee suffer, as may
make manifest our pressing necessity, to take some other
course for our present relief, then such Petitions, Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and Commissions, as we have used before, with
lesse successe, then could have beene expected of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from their own native King. Before we stirred so
much as with a Petition, wee endured for many yeares,
not onely the perpetuall opposition of the trueth and
power of Religion by <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> but also the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of all our Liberties, and almost the totall subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Religion, which was our comfort in the sight
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:155:5"/>
of God, and the glory of this Nation in the sight of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kirkes, who by the testimony of their Divines,
made our Reformation the measure of their wishes, and
would have redeemed it with their greatest worldly
losses. When grosse Popery was notoriously obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon us in the books of Canons and Common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
without consent or knowledge of the Kirke, and the
plot of the <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> wholly discovered, how
to settle it in both Nations, wee added to our former
sufferings, no other Armes but Prayers and teares unto
GOD: and Petitions unto our King, which were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected; The books and corruptions against which
we petitioned, highly exalted, and by the insolent advice
of those who governe now his Councells, and labour to
establish their own evill acquired greatnesse, upon our
oppression, and the ruines of our Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we were forbidden to insist, under the pain of high
Treason. When wee found our selves thus opposed
and borne downe, still insisting in our humble desires,
we solemnely renewed our Nationall Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
for preserving of our Religion and Liberties, and
of his Majesties authority, knowing the violation of that
Oath, to bee the guiltinesse which had procured our
woes, and that our repentance and turning to GOD,
were the meanes by his blessing for good successe.
VVhen contrary to our deserving and expectation, His
Majesty was moved by wicked counsell, to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
us with an Army, we were very soon pleased, and
choosed rather to neglect such courses, as might serve
for our humane safety, then to fall in seeming disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to our King, Or to give the smallest distaste to our
dear Brethren in <hi>England:</hi> And therfore disbanded our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:155:6"/>
Forces, delivered all holds which were craved in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our obedience: and so farre complyed with his
Majesties pleasure, that notwithstanding the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our lawfull former Assembly called by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
we were contented that a new free Assembly and
Parliament should be appointed, where all things both
concerning our Religion and Liberties, might again be
considered and established. VVhen matters Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
were determined in the Assembly, according to the
constitutions of the Kirk, in the presence, and with the
consent of his Majesties Commissioner, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was conveened for perfecting the VVork, although
we walked therein so warily, that no just provocation
was given to his Majesty, yet contrary to the Lawes
and custome of this Kingdome, the Parliament so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
promised, when his Majesty was free of those bad
Counsellours, was by their evill advyce prorogued;
which, to shew our invincible obedience, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to suffer, and did sent up our Commissioners to
<hi>London,</hi> to render the reasons of our demands. When
our Commissioners and Petitions of the Parliament,
called by his Majesty, were so farre rejected, that they
were never seen nor heard, we send up our Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
again with our Propositions, which contained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what was necessary for the good and peace of
the Kingdome, and was granted unto us before, under
his Majesties hand, yet could they finde no answer at all,
which will be wondered at, and hardly beleeved by so
many as are strangers at Court, and know not that the
Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Lievtenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
with the assistance of the too too powerfull Faction of
the Papists, labour to show their zeale for his Majesties
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:155:6"/>
greatnesse, by the oppressing the just Liberties of the
Subjects, and the Reformed Religion in all the three
Kingdomes. But in place of the gracious answer which
we expected, Our Commissioners were restrained, and
one of the Noblemen imprisoned; Garrisons of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
set over our heads, in an insolent and barbarous
way, exercising their cruelty even against women and
children; Our ships and goods taken and sunke, and the
Owners stripped naked, and more inhumanely used at
the commandement of abused authority by the subjects
of our owne King, then by Turkes and Infidels. And
great Armies prepared against us, with a terrible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to subdue and destroy our selves, our Religion,
Liberties, Lawes and all.</p>
            <p>In this extreamity for us to send new Commissioners
or Petitions, were against sense and experience; those
that governe the Kings Counsels being far from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
or intention to satisfie the just desires and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Subjects, as they have made manifest by
breaking up of the Parliaments in both Kingdomes. To
sit still in senselesnesse and stupiditie, wayting for our
owne destruction at the discretion of our mercilesse ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
(which were it not at this time joyned with the
cause of God, would move us the lesse) is not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Religion, but Nature; teaching and commanding
us to study our own preservation. To endure continuall
threatnings, and so great hostility and invasion from
yeare to yeare, which is the professed policie of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
is impossible; and when wee have examined our
own Strength, more then we are able to beare. We have
therefore after much agitation and debating, with, and
amongst our selves, resolved to have our proceedings,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155:7"/>
which have been canvassed by so many, and brought to
some point of determination in our own Parliament, to
be better known to the Kings Majesty, and the world,
and especially to the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> that against
all false and artificiall relations, they being nakedly seen
to be what they are, wee may obtaine a better grounded
and more durable peace, for enjoying of our Religion
and Lawes: and as wee desire the unworthy authors of
our troubles, who have come out from our selves, to be
tryed at home, and Justice to be done upon them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our owne Lawes: So shall wee presse no further
processe against these pernicious Counsellours in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the authors of all the miseries of both Kingdomes,
then what their own Parliament shal decerne to be their
just deserving.</p>
            <p>When we look back upon this Work of Reformation
from the beginning, and perceive the Impressions of the
providence of God in it, wee are forced in the midst of
all our difficulties and distresses, to blesse God for his
Fatherly care and free love to this Kirk and Kingdome,
and to take courage and spirit to proceed in patience &amp;
perseverance, whither he shall goe before us, and leade
us on. When the Prelats were growne by their rents &amp;
lordly dignities, by their power over all sorts of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Subjects, Ministers, and others, by their places in
Parliament, Councell, Colledge of Justice, Exchequer,
and high Commission, to an absolute dominion &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and setting their one foot on the Kirk, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the State, were become intollerably insolent, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then did the Work begin, and this was the Lords
opportunity. The beginnings were small, and promised
no great thing, but have been so seconded and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155:7"/>
followed by Divine providence, pressing us from
step to step, that the necessity was invincible, and could
not be resisted. It cannot be expressed what motions fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the hearts, what teares were powred forth from the
eyes, and what cryes came from the mouthes of many
thousands in this Land at that time, from the sense of the
love and power of God, raysing them as from the dead,
and giving them hopes after so great a deluge and vasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to see a new world, wherein Religion and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
should dwell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When wee were many times at a
pause, and knew not well what to doe, the feares, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the peevishnesse, and the plots also of our dementat
adversaryes, opened the wayes unto us, and taught us
how to proceed; and what they devised to ruine us, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
most against themselves, and for raysing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooving
the Worke. Although neither Councell, nor
Session, nor any other Judicature, hath been all this time
sitting, and there have beene meetings of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
at some times, yet have they been keeped without
tumult or trouble, and without excesse or ryot, in better
order, and greater quietnesse, then in the most peaceable
times hath been found in this Land. VVhen we were
content at the pacification, to lay down Armes, &amp; with
great losse, to live at home in peace, our wicked enemies
have been like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest,
whose waters cast up mire and dirt, and will have us to
doe that which it seemeth the Lord hath decreed against
them. The purity of our Intentions f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rre from base and
earthly respects: The bent and inclination of our hearts
in the midst of many dangers: The fitting of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not onely with a desire and disposition, but with
spirit and ability to overcome opposition, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155:8"/>
peace of heart accompanying us in our wayes,
which beareth us out against all accusations and asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
are to us strong grounds of assurance, that GOD
hath accepted our worke, and will not leave us. VVee
know that the Lord may use even wicked men in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and may fill their sailes with a faire gale of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and carry them on with a strong hand, which should
make us to search our hearts the more narrowly: But as
this ought not to discourage his own faithfull servants,
who out of love to his Name, intend his honour, walk in
his wayes, finde his peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comforting them, his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
directing them, and his prefence blessing them in
th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir affaires; So it cannot be any just ground of quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against the work of GOD.</p>
            <p>Yet all those our encouragements, which have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
our hearts in the midst of many troubles, could
not make our <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntry into <hi>England</hi> warrantable, if our
peace, which we earnestly seek and follow after, could
be found at home, or elsewhere. Where it is to be found,
we must seek after it; and no sooner shall we finde it, but
by laying down our Armes, and by the evidences of our
peaceable disposition, wee shall make it manifest to the
world, and especially to the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> that
we are seeking nothing else, and that our taking up of
Armes, was not for invasion, but for defence. No man
needeth to plead by positive Law for necessity: it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in every mans heart by Nature, and in all Nations
we find men have received it by practise; That Necessity
is a Soveraignitie, a Law above all Lawes, is subject to no
Law, and therefore is said to have no Law: where Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
commandeth, the Lawes of Nature and Nations
give their consent, and all positive Lawes are silent and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155:8"/>
give place. This Law hath place sometimes to excuse,
sometimes to extenuat, and sometimes to justifie and
warrand actions otherwayes questionable. And no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
necessity can be, then the preservation of Religion
which is the Soule; of the Countrey which is the Body;
of our Lyves who are the members, and of the honour
of the King who is the Head: All those at this time are in
a common hazard, and to preserve and secure all, wee
know no other way under the Sunne (and if any man be
so wise as to know it, wee desire to heare it, and shall bee
ready to follow it) but to take order with our common
enemies, where they may be found, and to seek our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
where it may be given. The question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we shall content our selves with our own poverty,
or enrich our selves in <hi>England,</hi> that question is impious
and absurd. Neither is the question whether we shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our selves at home, or invade our Neighbours and
dearest Brethren, this also were unchristian and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable:
But this is the question, whether it be wisdome
and piety to keep our selves within the Borders till our
throats be cut, and our Religion, Lawes, and Countrey
be destroyed: Or shall wee bestirre our selves, and seeke
our Safeguard, Peace and Liberty in <hi>England:</hi> whether
we shall doe or dye; whether we sha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l goe and live, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
and perish: Or more largely to expresse all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we who are not a few privat persons, but a whole
Kingdome, shall lye under the burden of so many accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
as scarcely in the worst times have beene inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against Christians, Receive the Service booke, and
the whole body of Popery, Embrace the Prelats, and
their abjured Hierarchy, Renounce our solemne Oath
and Covenant, so many times sworne by us, lose all our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:155:9"/>
labours and paines in this Cause, and forget our former
slavery and wonted desires of redemption at the dearest
rate, Tickle the mindes of our enemies with joy, and
strengthen their hands with violence, and fill the hearts
of our friends with sorrow, and their faces with shame,
because of us, Deserte and dishonour the Sonne of God,
whose Cause we have under-taken, whose Banner wee
have displayed, and whose Trueth and Power hath been
this time past, more comfortable unto us, then all that
the peace and prosperity of the world could have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and draw upon our selves all the Judgements
which GOD hath executed upon Apostates since the
beginning; Or shall we fold our hands, and waite for the
perfect slavery or our selves, and our posterity, in our
Soules, Bodies, and Estates, and (which is all one) foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
to stand to our defence, where we know it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
Or shall wee seeke our reliefe in following the
calling of GOD, (for our necessity can bee interpreted
to be no lesse and entering by the doore which his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath opened unto us, when all wayes are stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
beside?</p>
            <p>Our enemies at first did shroud themselves so farre
with the Kings authority, that they behooved to stand
and fall together, and that to censure them, was treason
against the King. But we have showne, that the Kings
Crowne is not tyed to a Prelats Mitre; and that the one
may be cast unto the ground, and the other have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
lustre and glory then before. Now they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to another starting hole, and would have men
thinke, that to come in to <hi>England,</hi> and to pursue them,
although legally, is to invade the Kingdome where they
live; As if the cutting away of an excrescence, or the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:155:9"/>
curing of an Impostume, were the killing of the Body.
Let them secure themselves under the shelter of their
own phantasies; But we are not so undiscerning, as like
mad men, to run furiously upon such as they first meet
with, and come in their way. For although it cannot bee
denyed, but the wrongs done unto us; as the breaking of
the late Peace, Crying us down as rebels and traytours,
The taking of our ships and goods, The imprisoning
of our Commissioners, The acts of hostility done by
the English in our Castles: Had they beene done by the
State or Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> they might have beene
just causes of a Nationall quarrelling: Yet since the
Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> conveened in Parliament, have
refused to contribute any supply against us, have shown
themselves to be pressed with grievances like unto ours,
have earnestly pleaded for redresse and remedy, and a
Declaration made, that his Majesty our of Parliament
will redresse them, which might be a cure for the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of particular Subjects, but Nationall grievances
require the hand of the Parliament for their cure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
preventing whereof, the Parliament was broken up and
dissolved. Neither doe we quarrell with the Kingdome
for the Injuries which we sustain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can they quarrell
with us, for taking order with that prevalent Faction of
Papists &amp; Prelats, the Authors of so many woes to both
Nations, let all who love Religion &amp; their liberty joyn
against the common enemies, and let them be accursed
who shall not seek the preservation of their Neighbour
Nation, both in Religion and Lawes, as their own, as
knowing that the ruine of one, will prove the ruine of
both.</p>
            <p>And as we attest the God of Heaven and Earth, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155:10"/>
those and no other are our Intentions; so upon the same
greatest attestation doe we declare, That for atchieving
those ends, we shal neither spare our pains, fortunes, nor
lyves, which we know cannot be more profitably &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably
spent: That we shal not take from our Friends &amp;
Brethren, from a threed even to a shooe latchet, but for
our own moneyes, and the just payment, that wee come
amongst them as their Friends and Brethren, very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of their by-past sufferings &amp; present dangers, both
in Religion and Liberties, and most willing to doe them
all the good we can. Like as wee certainly expect, that
they from the like sense of our hard condition, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
distresses, which hath forced us to come from
our own Countrey, will joyne and concurre with us, in
the most just and noble wayes, for obtaining our just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
And when our own moneyes and meanes are spent,
we shall crave nothing but upon sufficient surety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment,
how soon possibly it can be made, what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the entertainment of our Army, which wee
are assured so many as love Religion, and the peace of
both Kingdomes, will willingly offer, as that which they
know we cannot want, and in their wise fore-sight will
provide the way to furnish necessaries, and to receive the
surety. This course being keeped by both sides, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
harme our Brethren, for they shall bee satisfied to
the least farthing; nor our selves, who look for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
from the rich providence of God, for whose sake
we have hazarded the losse of all things. The escapes of
some Souldiours (if any shall happen) we trust shall not
be imputed unto us, who shall labor by all means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them more carefully, &amp; to punish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then if done to our selves, &amp; in our own Country. Our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:155:10"/>
professed enemies the Papists &amp; Prelats, with their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
&amp; the receipters of their goods &amp; geir, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive
wilbe more provident, then to refuse us necessary susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when they remember what counsell was given by
them, for declaring all our Possessions to be forfeited, &amp;
to be disposed of to them, as well deserving Subjects.
We shall demand nothing of the Kings Majesty, but the
settling and securing of the true Religion, and Liberties
of this Kingdome, according to the Constitutions and
Acts of the late Assemblies, and Parliament, and what a
just Prince oweth by the Lawes of God and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
to his grieved Subjects, comming before him with
their humble desires and supplications. Our abode in
<hi>England</hi> shalbe for no longer time, then in their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our just grievances and complaints shall be heard
and redressed, sufficient assurance given for the legall
tryall and punishment of the Authors of our evills, and
for enjoying of our Religion and Liberties in peace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the invasion of their Countreymen. Our returning
thereafter shall be with expedition, in a peaceable and
orderly way, farre from all molestation; and wee trust
the effect shall be against Papists the extirpation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
against Prelates the Reformation of the Kirk, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Atheists the flourishing of the Gospel, and against
Traytours and fire-brands, a perfect and durable Union
and Love between the two Kingdomes: which, he grant
who knoweth our intentions and desires, and is able to
bring them to passe. And if any more be required, God
will reveale it, and goe before both Nations; and if he
goe before us, who will not follow, or refuse to put their
necks to the Work of the Lord?</p>
