         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ONce more I preſume to intrench upon your
Candor and Patience, which I requeſt you to
interpret favourably, becauſe I intend not to
make it cuſtomary thus to trouble you.—I
well know, he that writes Books, runs himſelf
in debt to every man that reads him.—Yet I muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
I have been call'd on but by few of you for any my
Obligations of that kind; which Lenity of yours, perſwades
me to believe that the Intereſt in little time will ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
my ſum, that my penury will render me incapable
of payment.—However, I am bold to beg a
Boon of you, <hi>viz.</hi> To add this one kindneſs more unto your
Ten years friendſhips; and (if God permit me life, and my
Stars prove not more inauſpicious then I expect) I intend
to preſent you with an intire <hi>Body of Aſtrologie,</hi> and
therein endeavour a ſatisfaction unto you once for all.</p>
            <p>Of the occaſion of my now appearing publick, I need not
labour much to acquaint you, ſince there is hardly a Page in
the Book but will inform you that. Yet my brevity is ſuch,
that may poſsibly render me the more obſcure unto many;
chiefly, in that each ſubject I handle, afforded me a more
ſpatious Field to walk in, then I have made uſe of; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not one of them (had I affected copiouſneſs) but I might
have raiſed into a Volume in <hi>Folio:</hi> but that had been to
have toyl'd my ſelf, and troubled as well as charged you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101858:4"/>
I have herein (though briefly, yet) ſuccinctly touched
upon the nature of a great Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and ſhewn the Impoſsibility of particular, or indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Judgements to be made from them: for which I expect
both Favour and Fury: The Courteous Reader hath always
afforded me the firſt; the Captious Reader hath conſtantly
beſtowed on me the latter: For which I elect him none of my
Patron, and care not whether he read me, or let me alone. I
am not ſollicitous to enquire how many various cenſures ſhall
paſs on me for the Arguments I have uſed on this ſubject;
yet believe they will not be few, nor yet many of them friendly.</p>
            <p>And in my treating of the pretended Planetary Synod or
Council <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1. 1662. in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> I hope I may
expect, and finde as fair quarter for defending the truth
thereof, as the learned <hi>Serarius,</hi> and others, for aſſaulting it
therefrom. I pop no Impoſsibilities into the mindes of men,
nor threaten them with what is never like to happen. Let
my Reaſons and Allegations be conſidered, as well as their
Fancies and Pretences pondered, and I am ſure the Votes of
the Ingeniouſly Impartial will not be found againſt me.</p>
            <p>Then for my Diſcourſe of Viſions and Prodigies; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
expect to be exclaimed on, by every Vulgar Fanatick Tongue:
I divine each prejudiced Pate will turn it ſelf into a Mint,
and be Coyning ſomewhat of malice againſt me.—They will
be loath to be robb'd of their Titles to Viſions; of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying
and predicting ſtrange things from Prodigies, of
their determining the Fates of Kingdomes, Countries and
Perſons, and the end of the World alſo, by Chronograms, and
ſuch-like fictitious Conceits.—And I adventuring to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
and deprive them of their Darling Fooleries, (to ſay
no worſe of them) what Portion can I hope for, other then
Clamours, Scandals, Contumelies, Scoffs and Diſgraces from
ſo Waſpiſh and Peeviſh a Generation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101858:4"/>
For Defending my ſelf againſt the Sarcaſms of that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
perſon <hi>W. L.</hi> I ſuppoſe all Rational men will excuſe
me; he having fallen foul on me after a Truce was procured
betwixt my ſelf and him, by Captain <hi>G. W.</hi> which I kept
inviolable, (I ſpeak it in the preſence of God, who is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the onely Heart-Judger and Heart-Searcher)
even in very words, from the very time I firſt thereunto
conſented: and not onely ſo, but have reproved others that
(in hopes to pleaſe me) have reproachfully ſpoken of him;
and of this, I have many Witneſſes.—And the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Mr. <hi>Greſham</hi> was written long before that time.
Howbeit, my Charge therein was, and is true, and <hi>L.</hi> well
knows it to be ſo: but he thought becauſe Dr. <hi>Fiske</hi> was dead,
that I could have made no proof thereof; forgetting it ſeems
that himſelf had afforded me a ground ſufficient for that my
aſſertion againſt him, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Prophetick
Merlyn.</hi> And in confidence of that, labours to diſtain my
Reputation; and ſo rubs up, and frets the old Sores, which
before had been ſo happily (and I had hoped for ever) healed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>L's</hi> Lyes and Abuſes, together with the Reproaches
of another Plagiary, (whoſe name (himſelf being not an Ace
above a meer Vagabond) I ſcorn to mention) onely confirm
me in the verity of Aſtrologie, and teach me experimentally
the effects of <hi>Luna ad Quadratum Mercurii:</hi> but I diſpoſe
of the Direction, and conſequently triumph over their Vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.
Let the one of them do ſo upon <hi>Medium Coeli
ad Quadratum Saturni &amp; Solis,</hi> now approaching; and
the other, upon the ſame Significator directed <hi>ad Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Martis in Ariete, &amp;c.</hi> if they can. This cannot
ſure be Ingratitude in me, for giving them ſuch friendly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what may reaſonably requite their <hi>bleſſed Actions.</hi>
But though they both tax me with Ingratitude, yet I believe
<pb facs="tcp:101858:5"/>
themſeves ſuppoſe there's no ſuch thing in nature: If they do,
I can charge them both as notoriouſly guilty. The one of
them I having (at his requeſt) wrote four Books for, and
calculated many Nativities <hi>Gratis,</hi> beſides a <hi>Hicks-hall</hi>
kindneſs, by a grateful perſon not eaſie to be forgotten. And
the other I have not onely preſerved from ſtarving, but after
defended his Ears from the Pillory.</p>
            <p>To conclude: Since my writing this Treatiſe, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Nativities of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> and of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi>
the Emperour of <hi>Germany;</hi> and upon Conſultation
finde they confirm my Judgement of their preſent Difference;
and at convenient opportunity may probably ſee the light. In
the interim, if what I have here emitted into the world, be
but as freely accepted, as I have faithfully intended it, I have
my Wiſhes; and ſhall ſtill remain during Life, a true Friend
to Aſtrologie, and its honeſt and able Profeſſors.</p>

it plainly appeareth unto my ſight, that all of them
are ſo far from being in Conjunction, that not any <hi>two</hi> of
them are <hi>exactly</hi> ſo united. And indeed, if we ſhall but
ſeriouſly conſider this Poſition of the Planets in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
we ſhall finde that (although I have, following the
ſteps of our beſt Ephemeridiſt-Maſters, noted their places
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101858:7"/>
for the Noon-time of the day) they are not all of them

in the Ecliptique: <hi>Jupiter</hi> muſt therefore cut the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon
with that point of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now then, if thus it be, that all the Planets are not in
<hi>Sagittarius,</hi> (as hath been proved) muſt it not be both
vain and frivolous for any man (let him be either Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
or other) to affright, terrifie and amuſe the world
upon a pretended meeting of them all in <hi>the Fiery Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city?
and thence for to threaten a deſtruction of the world by
fire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe we ſhould admit (what ſome Brain-ſick
Prognoſticators would willingly have) that the Planets
were all of them in <hi>Sagittarius</hi> that day; yet unleſs they
had been in Conjunction there, I muſt tell them it is ſuch
a Poſition, and ſo ſtrange a Marvel, that indeed ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing at all! I mean no ſuch general and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
matters or things as are by them pretended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.
Yet I deny not but that the progreſſion of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
through the whole twelve Signes of the Zodiack, or
their Poſition in any part thereof (have a particular (yea,
remarkable) ſignification: but then it is relative onely to
ſuch whoſe Genitures either Sympathize or Antipathize
therewith.<note place="margin">The Tranſits of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of great ſignification in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</note> As for inſtance: <hi>Such Perſons or Natives
that ſhall happen to have</hi> Saturn <hi>or</hi> Mars <hi>paſs the Hylegiacal
points of their Nativities ſhall receive great damage and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
thereby,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But thoſe that ſhall have the benign Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101858:8"/>
Jupiter <hi>or</hi> Venus <hi>upon the principal points of their Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixes,
ſuch will be made proſperous, and obtain conſiderable
advantage therefrom.</hi> And of this, Experience is an aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
Evidence.</p>
               <p>Again ſtill ſuppoſing that all the Planets had then been
in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> as is moſt untruly (you ſee) obtruded upon
the beliefs of many people; yet, unleſs they all of them
had been in Conjunction there, either Platiquely or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly,
(as Aſtrologers ſpeak) <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſame degree, or
within the mediety of their Orbs; they could not afford
any true or real ground to any ſober or ſerious man, to
threaten or menace the world with a Deſtruction or Ruine
by fire. <hi>For it is the union of Beams that ſignifieth Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or Deſtruction and Ruine, or portendeth Happineſs.</hi>
But on the day before-mentioned, of all the Planets there
is onely <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> which are in Conjunction,
and that not abſolutely Partil, and <hi>Venus</hi> within the moie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Orbs; which according to the opinion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers,
hath no ſuch amazing or terrifying ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the burning of the world.</p>
               <p>Yet a little further,<note place="margin">A Planet hath no ſtrength in a Signe before the Fifth, nor after the five and twentieth Degree thereof.</note> the learned <hi>Ptolomy</hi> tells us, <hi>That
the ſtrength of a Planet is to be obſerved from the Fifth, to
the twenty fifth degree of a Signe.</hi> Which in this matter
ſeriouſly conſidered, we ſhall finde that neither <hi>Jupiter,
Mars</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> can then have any real ſignification of
thoſe ſtrange and amuſing Matters pretended to be porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by this (as 'tis idly and untruly worded) prodigious
meeting of all the Planets in <hi>Sagittary;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> of thoſe
<hi>three Planets</hi> being not in that <hi>Signe,</hi> and the <hi>other two</hi> juſt
going out <hi>thereof.</hi> And there is no man but will (if his
Reaſon be not depraved) judge it moſt abſurd, to <hi>ſuppoſe
that to have ſignification, which wanteth ſtrength or power to
turn ſuch ſignification into act.</hi> Thus we ſee that by this
laſt Argument, here are no leſs then near <hi>half of the ſeven
Planets</hi> in their ſignification, and poſition likewiſe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away <hi>from this pretended mighty Coeleſtial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101858:8"/>
But letting paſs theſe Arguments as too curious and
knotty, for many of our ignorant Aſtrologers either to cut
in two, or untie; I will deſcend to another, but more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Queſtion, and ſuch an one as may better conſort
with the general Reaſon; <hi>viz.</hi> If all the Planets at the
time before-mentioned had been in <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> as is falſly
pretended, I would then fain know, why the burning of
the world, or any ſuch eminent miſchiefs to theſe Nations,
muſt therefore needs have been preſignified more, now
then at other times? For I finde by being converſant in
the ſtudy of the Motions of the Planets, that this is not
the firſt time ſince the (ſuppoſed) time of the Creation of
the world, that they have been thus (yea, more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately)
profited. And it is no news to any man, though but
meanly verſed in Aſtronomy, to finde almoſt all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
poſited in one ſigne of the Zodiack, and that very
often; as I ſhall prove by a few inſtances.</p>

               <p>IN my Ephemeris, or Almanack for this preſent year
1663. I have delivered ſomewhat touching this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and have (I ſuppoſe) fully evinced unto the
Intelligent Reader not onely an improbability, but impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
for any man to predict the certain effects that ſhall
ſucceed this ſo famous Conjunction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not that I believe or ſuppoſe ſuch a Conjunction can
or ſhall want Effects, and thoſe very ſplendid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſay in my</hi> Octobers <hi>Obſervations, againſt the time this
eminent Conjunction happens, thus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Conjunctio mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
<hi>Saturni</hi> &amp; <hi>Jovis.</hi>—It happens but once in ſeven or eight
hundred years; its Effects therefore cannot be diſcovered by
the wiſeſt of Mortals. We may ſay they will be famous:
but what they ſhall be, or when they ſhall appear, Aſtrologie
hath no tongue to declare. Let us therefore warily eye the
Providence of God in thoſe Mutations (whether good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)
that this eminent and unuſual Congreſs is the precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That this eminent Coeleſtial meeting ſhall have very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and glorious Effects, is moſt Rational to be believed,
and that upon ſeveral eminent good grounds, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Planets conjoyned are the two ſuperiour Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
Movers.</item>
                  <item>2. Their congreſs or meeting is in <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> a Signe
of the Fiery Trigon.</item>
                  <item>3. It is a Coeleſtial meeting that (Aſtrologers well know)
very ſeldome happens.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101858:10"/>
Now,<note place="margin">Though the ſpects of this great Conjunction will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, yet it is not in the power or skill of the wiſeſt of men to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize them.</note> the more conſiderable the Planets are that meet,
the more famous will the Effects of that their meeting
prove: and the more worthy and eminent the place is in
which they thus conjoyn, the more admirable are or will
be their ſignifications: and the more rarely and ſeldome
ſuch Bodies do unite, the more ſignificant and illuſtrious
is the Embaſſy they have to deliver to the world: For
thoſe Bodies that do not often meet, when they do, they
joyn together for the greater and more famous purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>But although this be granted, (as indeed it muſt) yet
I hold it impoſſible for the wiſeſt of men to predict or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
the particular effects or ſignification of this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction;
and that for theſe Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) It is a Conjunction that ſeldome happens, <hi>viz.</hi>
but once in ſeven or eight hundred years; no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can have any particular experience of what Effects
may probably ſucceed the ſame.<note place="margin">Chronologie not certain, a cauſe of errour in Predictions of this kind.</note> And if any ſhall preſume
to hope to be aſſiſted by Chronologie, I tell them that is
uncertain, and ſubject to errour.</p>
               <p>(2.) But ſhould I grant that Chronologie could truly
furniſh an Artiſt with the exact and preciſe truth of what
hath happened after the celebration of ſuch Conjunctions,
(which I deem ſomewhat improbable) yet would he be to
ſeek of a certain foundation whereon to build a Judgement
for time to come,<note place="margin">The true Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction not attainable.</note> it being impoſſible to obtain the true
Poſition of Heaven when ſuch a Conjunction <hi>ad punctum</hi>
happens; and without a Figure to pretend to give a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is every whit as vain and idle, as for a Pilot to ſteer
or guide a ſhip without the aſſiſtance of his Compaſs.</p>
               <p>(3.) But ſhould we allow a poſſibility (of what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
impoſſible) that a Figure thereof were attainable,
yet the Artiſt being a Man,<note place="margin">An Artiſt may eaſily miſtake in taking a non-cauſe for a true cauſe.</note> and ſo ſubject to errour, may
be apt to miſtake in his Calculation of the Effects which
(allowing Chronologie likewiſe certain) may have ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſuch a Conjunction formerly: for he may eaſily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
ſuch and ſuch matters or things to the Conjunction
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101858:11"/>
as the Effects thereof, which very probably may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to have been ſignified by Eclipſes, or other leſs
Conjunctions, or Tranſits, or Vernal Ingreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſeriouſly preponderated, I aſſert,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">That this
Great Conjunction affords no ground at all from which either
our Aſtrological or Presbyterian Enthuſiaſts can any way
rationally threaten the world with a deſtruction by ſire; or
<hi>England</hi> in particular with Wars, or other miſchiefs; no,
although it happen in the Fiery Trigon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before I cloſe this Section, give me leave to correct the
groſs errours and miſtakes of ſome Aſtrologers among us,
committed in their Writings this preſent year 1663. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſomewhat relate to this great Conjunction, and
are occaſioned by the ſame.</p>
               <p>One there is among us, who (having made the world
believe he hath had a great deal of skill in theſe matters)
calleth this Conjunction very often a <hi>Little Conjunction,</hi>
and a <hi>Minor Conjunction:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An ignorant Artiſt in his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this great Conjunction juſtly taxed.</note> telling us that ſome able Artiſt
(ſuch another probably as himſelf) intends a particular
Treatiſe thereof: but leſt this Artiſt boaſted of ſhould
fail, and we be deprived of ſome Aſtrological Ignorance,
and (I was about to ſay) Nonſence, to be in Print fathered
upon this <hi>Great Conjunction,</hi> this Author gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Conjunctions Effects in theſe words:—<hi>We
conceive the genuine ſence of this preſent Conjunction is, that
generally mens intentions or actions will wholly intend to ſettle
or unſettle the Laws and Conſtitutions, Cuſtomes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſanees,
of whole Nations, Governments, Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths;
or the full eſtabliſhing, or utter diſturbance of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and their Eſtates, Religion of ſeveral Judgements, and
its attendances, Priviledges,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In which words, if any man can finde either good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection,
true Art, or fair propriety of ſpeech,—</p>
               <q>
                  <l>As great <hi>Apollo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Erit mihi magnus Apollo.</note> he</l>
                  <l>Shall ever be to me.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101858:11"/>
Mens intentions, intend to ſettle, or unſettle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
this is the genuine ſence of the preſent Conjunction.—
To paſs over the apparent Tautologie hereof, I ſuppoſe
it will be a truth believed on all hands, to carry the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
That if Men intend any thing at all about Laws,
Cuſtomes, Conſtitutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it muſt be <hi>either to ſettle or
unſettle them;</hi> Let this intention proceed from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of ſuch a Conjunction, or other leſs conſiderable <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
Phaenomena:</hi> And ſo likewiſe for Families, Eſtates,
Religions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if men intend any thing of, for, or concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, <hi>muſt it not be for, or in order to either their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
or eſtabliſhing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when perſons pretending to give Judgement (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſpecious colour or covert of Science) upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
and Aſpects of the Stars, they can have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
or ſerious grounds for; what wonder is it, that they
thus become Fugitives to Art and Learning, and wander
(as led by the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> of their ignorance or preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
or ſomewhat worſe) <hi>from the grounds of Science<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sence, and Right Reaſon!</hi> Any Man (without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Planets) may be moſt reaſonably ſuppoſed to
be oraculous in ſuch kinde of preſages as theſe: for how
can he be miſtaken in his Divination, whoſe Predictions
purely depent upon I or No? It is impoſſible for any
<hi>Medium</hi> to be found between thoſe terms, which are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradictory. Nor is there any more of Art herein,
(or certainty of the truth pretended hereby) then in the
throwing up <hi>Half a Crown;</hi> by which action we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conclude, that either <hi>Croſs or Pile</hi> ſhall be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame Author in the next Leaf comes to deliver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
kinde of Judgement upon this</hi> Great Conjunction,
<hi>viz.</hi> A firm Eſtabliſhment of new-acquired Dominions, or new
Families, or new Leagues:—and this in many places of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you ſee in this perſons Judgement by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
men will ſometimes intend to ſettle and unſettle
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101858:12"/>
Governments, Kingdomes and Commonwealths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—
and at other times intend onely a firm Eſtabliſhment of
new-acquired Dominions, <hi>&amp;c. And this onely in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Europe.</hi> And in the ſame breath (almoſt) he urges
another paſſage like to the firſt we examined,—<hi>viz.—
It ſecondly intends a Confirmation or Extinguiſhment of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church-matters, Diſcipline or Ceremonies.</hi> Which
Terms every one may ſee are directly oppoſite as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>How ridiculous, contradictory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> idle and vain ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
are, I need not take pains to illuſtrate, but leave
them to be judged of by Perſons able to diſtinguiſh of
Terms, and diſcern the Impoſture, and ignorant juggling
of the Predictor, who rather then he will not be ſeen to
be ſome-body, adventures to make an Enthuſiaſtique
noiſe, though it be Groundleſs, Artleſs, Senceleſs.</p>
               <p>I come in the next place (having briefly examined the
ſubſtance of his Predictions) to demand his Reaſon, why
he calls this Conjunction A Little,<note place="margin">This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction ♄ and ♃ in ♐, not a little or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but a major, or great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</note> or Minor Conjunction:
for as I can perceive he hath rendred no account where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſhould be ſo eſteemed.—There ſeems to me
two things eſſentially to be conſidered in the Conjunction
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which makes their Congreſs to be
called great: <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) The Regality of the Triplicity
they conjoyn in; (2.) The Beginning of their Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for their whole circuit in that Trigon. And both
theſe concur to make this a great Conjunction. For (1.)
it is the Fiery Trigon in which this Coeleſtial Congreſs is
celebrated, the moſt Noble of all the reſt, even as Fire
is the moſt eminent among the Elements. (2.) Albeit
it ſo happened, that there were two Conjunctions of
theſe Planets in the ſame Triplicity, <hi>viz. anno</hi> 1603.
<hi>Dec.</hi> 7. and <hi>anno 1623. June</hi> 8. yet theſe Planets not
continuing their ſeveral Conjunctions in that Trigon, till
they had naturally ended their circuit there, they could
not be called great Conjunctions, but rather mean, or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101858:12"/>
middle Conjunctions.<note place="margin">♄ and ♃ will make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions in the Fiery Triplicity many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years yet before they leave the ſame.</note> But <hi>this Conjunction now in</hi> Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<hi>ſo begins the Fiery Triplicity, that for many Ages theſe
Planets will make their Conjunctions in the ſame Trigon; and
this without any alteration, or mutation into any other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity:</hi>
Ergo, <hi>this muſt be, not a little, or minor Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but a great Conjunction.</hi> Nay, the Gentleman that hath
been pleaſed to call this a Minor Conjunction, hath been
alſo pleaſed to call that in 1603. <hi>December</hi> 7. not onely a
Great, but the greateſt Conjunction: which how truly it
may be ſo termed, I freely confeſs I underſtand not: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he may have learnt a ſecret way to demonſtrate unto
us impoſſibilities, <hi>viz.</hi> why that Conjunction in 1603.
ſhould be called a Great, or the greateſt Conjunction, and
this in 1663. (though greater then that) ſhall be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and termed a Minor or Little one.</p>
               <p>Aſtrologers conſent, that there are three manner of
ways how <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> make their Conjunctions;
whence they have their ſeveral Denominations.<note place="margin">The ſeveral Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ♄ and ♃, and how they are called, and in what time they are ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made.</note> (1.) They
make their Conjunctions in any of the Trigons in the ſpace
of nineteen years, three hundred and ſixteen days; and
this is called a Minor Conjunction. (2.) They make
their Conjunctions from one Trigon to another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the order of the Signes, as out of the Fiery into
the Earthy, in an hundred ninety and nine years, and three
hundred ſixty ſix days; and this is called a middle or mean
Conjunction. (3.) They make their Conjunctions in
ſeven hundred ninety five years, two hundred and twelve
days; as from <hi>Aries</hi> to <hi>Aries,</hi> or <hi>Sagittarius</hi> to <hi>Sagitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
with reſpect to the mutation of the Triplicity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and this is called a great, or the greateſt Conjunction that
can be. But of this ſubject let the ingenious Reader ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelf to <hi>Cardan, in his Commentary upon Ptolomy,
fol.</hi> 362. (that I mean printed a <hi>Lyons, anno</hi> 1555.)
where he may receive exacter ſatisfaction then my preſent
occaſions will permit me to afford him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101858:13"/>
There is another Perſon who pretends to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Calculations and Effects of Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">Another pretended Artiſt taken tardy in his fictitious &amp; groundleſs Predictions upon the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ♄ and ♃, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>
and he ſaith in one place of his Book, <hi>anno 1663. this
Conjunction of</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Jupiter <hi>happens on</hi> Octob. 10.
<hi>near high Noon;</hi> (it may be as neer Midnight, for ought
he or any man elſe knoweth) yet in another place of the
ſame Book he telleth us, it <hi>happeneth the 12 day, neer 7 a
Clock in the morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I know, theſe two Planets will be in Conjunction
at the leaſt ten days (perhaps more) before and after the
tenth day of <hi>October;</hi> but the preciſe day according to the
beſt Aſtronomical Tables, they will make their exact Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
will be on <hi>October</hi> the tenth, <hi>anno</hi> 1663. but
their Orbs touch many days both before and after. But
this pitiful Judger of Conjunctions commits a greater er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
then this immediately following it, in theſe words:—
<hi>There hath been ſix Trigonical Revolutions paſt, before this
laſt entrance of the Planets into</hi> Aries 1603.—In
1603. theſe Planets were in <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> and as far from
<hi>Aries</hi> as a Trine is diſtant from a Conjunction, <hi>viz.</hi> 120
Degrees; and ſo far is this ſtrange Aſtrologer diſtant from
the truth. I ſhould willingly have conceived this to have
been the Printers errour, as not willing to believe any
man pretending Aſtrologie ſo ignorant, and ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
but meeting it in his Book in words at length, and
no way corrected, I cannot do leſs then ſuppoſe it to be a
part of its Authors remarkable property, Ignorance: and
that which confirms me ſo much the more, is, A moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
miſtake by him committed in the moneth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
in his Almanack.<note place="margin">The <hi>Sun</hi> combures all Planets, but can be combured of none.</note> He ſaith there,—<hi>The 28 day,</hi>
♂☉♀, <hi>and</hi> ☿, <hi>viz. Mars, Sol, Venus, and Mercury,
are all Combuſt.</hi> Certainly his Brains and Skill likewiſe
muſt needs be in combuſtion, that ſhall ſay or write, the
<hi>Sun,</hi> which combures all the Planets, can himſelf be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt.
But he proceeds,—<hi>Obſerve, the two Superiours
conjoyn 23 day, and all the reſt the 28 day. Expect great and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101858:13"/>
prodigions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Effects.</hi>—On the twenty third day there is no
ſuch Conjunction of the ſuperiour Planets, as this idle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ignorantly twattles of; nor are the other five in exact
Conjunction that day neither: Although I grant the Moon
is applying to the Conjunctions of the <hi>Sun, Mars, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and <hi>Venus,</hi> but meets with the Sextiles of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Jupiter</hi> by the way. I perceive this forward Aſtrologer
underſtandeth not what <hi>Fruſtration,</hi> in an Aſtrological
ſence, meaneth. Now therefore, if Perſons ſhould expect
from theſe idle ſtories <hi>any great and prodigious Effects,</hi> they
muſt likewiſe expect to be deceived therein, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as before they have been by him in their pretended
cauſes.</p>
               <p>To demonſtrate unto the ingenious Readers, that thoſe
days he mentions, <hi>viz. January</hi> the 23. and 28. there
were no <hi>ſuch cauſes,</hi> and therefore there can be <hi>no ſuch
prodigious Effects,</hi> I will preſent them with the Planets
places in Longitude, thoſe two days at Noon, that either
his ignorance or impoſturiſm, or both, may the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly

word it: or elſe from the obſervation they ſeem to make
of certain Apparitions or Prodigies.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, it is very ſufficiently known, that none
but Melancholy Perſons are ſubject thereunto; and theſe
kind of people pretend unto the acquaintance of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſuch-like myſteries, either from Envy or Frenzy:
for the former, they deſerve cenſure; for the latter, pity.
Hiſtory informs us,<note place="margin">Moor Enth.</note> (as one ingeniouſly notes) that many
men have fancyed themſelves Monarks,<note place="margin">Triumph.</note> Popes and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;
when as in truth they have been but Foot-boys,
Grooms, and Serving-men. And many again, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to theſe matters of Revelation, have been found to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101858:14"/>
have more of Villany, then Melancholy in them; by which
means they have acted, agitated, and brought about very
eminent and conſiderable Deſignes.</p>

their pretences to Revelation, Inſpiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have no
deſigne at all, either againſt the Church or State they live
under; yet it is not enough that becauſe they pretend to
theſe matters, that we muſt therefore believe them to be
more then they are; or that they are able (beyond others)
to approach the preſence of God; or that they are as
Lords of Gods Council, becauſe they pretend ſo highly
to the Spirit: for all theſe their fair and ſpiritual pretences,
are nothing but the effects of an abſurd Melancholy; and
proceed not from any preternatural or ſupernatural cauſe:

times; of whoſe Actions and Exploits, Hiſtory is not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.
<hi>For when this humour predominates in a man, it makes

               <p>But I ſhrewdly fear, the Enthuſiaſts of our days deſerve
no ſuch charitable conſtruction to be made of their actions

that the Viſions and Revelations they lay claim unto, and

Which Act, though it be but their juſt due and merit, yet
gives a pretended occaſion for their Envy to ſit and brood
upon their Melancholy; whence iſſues their pretended
Prophecies, Viſions, and Revelations of the Ruine and

               <p>3. They are not onely perſons deſperate in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,

ſince it hath pleaſed God to reſtore his Majeſty to his

theſe perſons cannot be content to have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
and Treaſons defaced with a Royal <hi>Deleatur,</hi> but
becauſe they have not the power to reign in their inſatiable
pleaſures which they took in Ruine and Deſtruction, as
before, they take upon them (with the greateſt ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
imaginable) maliciouſly, to doom that to death
which gave (and yet continues unto them) Life.</p>
               <p>4. Theſe Perſons uſe this their Engine of Villany and
Politique way of miſchief, for the diſcomfiting and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
this Kingdome, as may be reaſonably preſumed for
this Reaſon; In that they were (many of them) men of
eminent Grandeur, and great Eſtate; which in our late
times of confuſion they had by Rapine, War and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
acquired; and being now in ſome reſpects forced to
refund, and part with much of their ill-gotten Goods,
they labour (with the Dragon or Devil in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)</hi>
and ſtruggle hard, that they may not fall from the
Heaven of their (once not thought of) happineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pulling thence a third part of the Stars with them.
Could they but have the power (as they have the ſtomach)
to lay <hi>Englands</hi> Peace and Glory in the duſt, and once more
embrue us in another Civil War, ſetting us all in a flame,
they would then be contented; though by the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

that they may aſſure themſelves, that neither their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
or their forged Revelations, ſhall either have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
or ſignification of this Kingdomes Ruine, the onely
thing they ſeem ſo zealouſly to thirſt after, I aſſert,—
That the happineſs of this Nation is built upon a Rock, too
mighty for them to attempt, and too powerful for any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to impugn. And this I have demonſtrated at large
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101858:16"/>
in my Treatiſe, entituled, <hi>Britains Royal Star;</hi> unto which
I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid of thoſe that thus thunder of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Revelations, may equally be referred to them that
pretend to lay ſuch great weight upon Prodigies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
I would not have any to ſuppoſe me ſo irrational as
to deny Prodigies, for I acknowledge that God Almighty
oftentimes giveth forth his Premonitions by Prodigies,
eſpecially when he hath an intention of puniſhment either
to Nations or Perſons:<note place="margin">That there are Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not queſtioned; but that all things ſaid to be ſuch, are ſo, is (and ought to be) denied.</note> according to that true ſaying of
<hi>Herodotus, Cum Deus puniturus eſt gentem vel orbem, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiis
id ſolet prius ſignificare:</hi> (i. e.) When God intends to
puniſh a Nation, Country, or City, he is firſt wont to give
them notice thereof by Prodigies,—It is this onely that
I contend againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That many things ſaid and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be Prodigies by the Enthuſiaſts and Diſcontents of
this Age, are neither Properly or Really ſuch. For, if a
Rainbow, or two or three Suns or Moons, or a <hi>Hyatus,</hi>
appear in the Clouds; or if a River abate but of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Quantity of Water; theſe things (I ſay) are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
bruted about for Prodigies, when in truth they
are none at all; for there is hardly a moneth in the year
(a moneth did I ſay! nay a week, perhaps a day) but in
ſome place of this earthy Globe, ſome (if not all) of theſe
things happen. And ſhould we conceive theſe to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies,
we muſt neceſſarily believe, that the whole world
conſiſts of nothing but wonders; and that there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing natural therein, of which a ſober account can be
rendred: but it is equally erroneous to conceive the firſt,
as to conclude the latter.</p>
               <p>I do allow that Prodigies have eminent, wonderful, and
aſtoniſhing ſignifications: but that theſe things are either
ſuch, or have ſuch ſignifications, may be reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
upon the former ground urged. It is true, that the
apparition of them to the eyes of Vulgar men, and ſuch
that are illiterate; whoſe ears before having been abuſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101858:16"/>
with ſtrange ſtories, beget amazement; whereas indeed
they would be leſs terrified and affrighted thereat, very
probably nothing at all, were it not for the forged ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
that the ſubtile and knaviſh Reporter maketh of
them. Now that I may the better evince to the Readers
hereof, that theſe ſeveral things have a real and proper
cauſe in Nature, (and therefore not properly at all to be
eſteemed as Prodigies) I will conſider them briefly apart,

upon any clean and thin object; and the Sun of all Bodies
being the moſt lucid, and the water thin and clear, is the
reaſon why by the Suns reflexion upon a wateriſh Cloud,
a Rainbow is begotten. And this apparition is commonly
to be ſeen; yet never hath any other ſignification but of
Rain, or Fair Weather: Of Rain, becauſe it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

it is ready to fall into drops. Of Fair Weather, becauſe
when the Sun-beams are ſtrong, and the heat is grown ſo
great, that the moiſture of the Cloud is thereby dryed up,
and the drops attenuated into thin Air. Theſe are not
onely naturally the common ſignifications, but the natural
ſignifications of Rainbows. Other ſignifications hereof,

And of theſe gapings or chaps in the clouds, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts; ſome whereof are wide and large, of various

(though in the middle of the Night) of a bright white, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

it conſiſts is very thin. Some are yellowiſh, when the
Exhalation is thicker. And ſome again are ruddy, when
the Exhalation is meanly thick. And ſome are very black,
when the Exhalation is thickeſt of all. and when this
Meteor appeareth ſo wide, that, <hi>ad viſum,</hi> it ſeemeth to
cleave the Heavens aſunder; then is the Exhalation of
which it is made, very thick in the middeſt, and thin on
the edges, ſo that the Light being received into it, cauſeth
it to appear as though the Sky did rend, and fire break
out of it. Secondly, theſe Meteors appearing round, or
like unto deep holes in the Heavens, differ nothing at all
from thoſe wide gapings, but that they are leſs; and
therefore ſeem as if they were certain deep Pits or Holes
in the Heavens, and not at all rending or gaping like to the

That Rivers are cauſed by the aſſembling or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together not onely of many Springs, but of Brooks
and Fords: which being received in divers places as they
paſs, are at length for the moſt part carried into the Sea.
But ſome Rivers there are, which diſappearing, ſeem
to be ſwallowed up of the earth; but probably into the
Sea, by ſome ſecret and unknown Chanels. Some Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
again there be, that hide their heads under the
earth, and in another place far diſtant break out again.
But that the exſiccation or drying up of a River for a time,
or for ever, can be of any evil ſignification or tendencie
unto that Kingdome or Nation where it ſhall happen,
(beyond the loſs of the water) no Philoſopher, or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Naturaliſt ever yet urged. Nevertheleſs here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
a great Pretender to the myſteries of Nature, in his
Book <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. writes,—<hi>The drying up of the River</hi>
Darwent <hi>near the Town of</hi> Derby, <hi>for ſome certain hours,
is no leſs then a Wonder,</hi> &amp;c.—In anſwer, or in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
rather, to which, I aſſert, That that onely is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
wonderful and prodigious, of which no Natural
reaſon is to be rendred, or for which no cauſe can be found.
But we by experience know, it is natural for Rivers to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and to encreaſe.—They then abate or grow leſs,
when the terrene parts at the bottom are of an exſiccating
nature; as it is often ſeen in thoſe Rivers, whoſe bottoms
are of a ſandy quality, and themſelves ſed by Springs deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
from Hills ſomewhat remote from them. This
very commonly happens in a hard Winter, which probably
may be cauſed by the Froſt binding up the mouth of the
Spring that feeds it, and not ſuffering it to perform its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101858:18"/>
Office to the River, unto which it is deſigned.—
They then encreaſe, when from divers certain Ebullitions
or Boylings at the bottom, conſtant Excitations of the
water are made, (for there are Springs moſt certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
or under, as well as above, or without the River,
unto which it is beholding) or from a conſtant and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing

               <head type="sub">Some Reflections upon Dooms-Day, or the
End of the World.</head>
               <p>LEt not the Reader expect that I ſhall trouble my
ſelf much about the Etymologie of the word
<hi>Dooms-Day;</hi> let it ſuffice that we know it is that
Day in which each man ſhall receive his ſentence or Doom
according to merit. In the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
there was a Book made, and kept in the Tower of
<hi>London,</hi> wherein all the ancient Demean Lands of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are Regiſtred, called, <hi>Dooms-Day-Book;</hi> becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any difference, the parties contending thereby received
their Doom. Others call it Dooms-Day, <hi>Quaſi domus Dei.</hi>
But thus much of the Word, now to the Thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the Beginning of the World hath puzled the wiſeſt
Intellects to diſcover, ſo the End of it hath poſed the
greateſt Clerks to determine.</hi> Generatio una abit, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera
advenit; quamvis terra in ſeculum permaneat: One
Generation paſſeth away, another cometh; but the earth abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for ever, <hi>Eccles. 1. 4. Which</hi> [for ever,] <hi>moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
interpret to ſignifie the Laſt day, or Dooms-day,</hi> viz.
<hi>that time, in which</hi> the Heavens ſhall melt with fervent heat,
and the Earth ſhall paſs away, or be changed.</p>
               <p>That the World ſhall have an end, (and this as certain
as ever it had a beginning) is a truth ſo ſplendid, that it
cannot reaſonably be queſtioned; no, not by the ſubtileſt
Critique, or Sceptique therein. But to believe every fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
or idle Notion, that the Melancholy heads either of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101858:19"/>
former Ages, or of our own time, have broached con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the end thereof, would be in an ingenious Perſon
an abſurdity of the groſſeſt kind. Philoſophy teacheth us,
whatſoever hath a birth, paſſeth and haſteth towards death;
and that every thing that hath a beginning, doth neceſſarily
and interchangeably rowle towards its end. And if any
man ſhould ſhew himſelf ſo grand an Infidel, as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this; let him but call to his mind the Annual and
Quotidian Examples hereof in all things Sublunary,
(which are as ſo many certain Demonſtrations in Epitomy
of the end of the World) and he muſt neceſſarily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.
Nevertheleſs, to determine the end of the world,
is (I take it for granted) ſuch a Determination as will
never give the Author cauſe to boaſt of a judicious
Brain.</p>
               <p>There are three manner of ways by which I finde Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
too apt and buſie in prefixing the time of the end of
the world.</p>

pretended to have received from the mouth of an Angel.
After whom in ſeveral years, we have had divers others,
as certain and true Prophets and Propheteſſes as her ſelf.
Story maketh mention of one of <hi>S. Gallus</hi> in <hi>Helvetia, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>

one in <hi>Germany,</hi> pretending to be acted by the Spirit,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101858:20"/>
raves at the ſame rate; and at laſt ſo ſtrongly prevails with
many, to believe that the end of the World was come,
that they grew prodigal of their Goods and Subſtance,
fearing they ſhould want time to conſume them.</p>
               <p>And it is ſtill freſh in memory, that in our late times of
confuſion, here in <hi>London,</hi> many Miniſters of the Goſpel,
as <hi>Saltmarſh, Sedgwick, &amp;c.</hi> (and from their examples,
many illiterate men and women) were conſtantly from the
years 1647. to 1656. canting,—<hi>That the end of the
World was come, and that the day of the Lord was at hand:</hi>
Which perſons we ſee have been no leſs miſtaken then the
former. Enthuſiaſtick and direct Madneſs did ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rage and reign in thoſe years, (and a ſpice thereof we
yet have in theſe) and the end of the World was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and talked of, to be ſo near, That many People (upon
my knowledge I ſpeak it) ſold their Eſtates, and threw
Moneys about the ſtreets, (expecting themſelves to finde
the ſame Quarter as <hi>Solomons</hi> Lily) but afterwards turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Beggers, and were glad to live on the Alms of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Some there were again, that they might be the more
noted for their Meſſage and Embaſſy, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
themſelves the more eminent Converts unto this
great Deluſion, would wear Sackcloth, and ſhave their
crowns, that thereby they might the more aptly ape and
imitate the true Prophets formerly ſent of God. Others
would wear Papers in different ſhapes and figures upon
their Breaſts and Backs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>England</hi> hath had more Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts within this 20 years, then all <hi>Europe,</hi> if not the whole world beſides.</note> with idle Inſcriptions thereon,
pretending to come before as a Guard for the approach of
the King of Heaven, whom they ſaid was coming. But
theſe Mad-men remember not that the Scripture ſaith,
<hi>He ſhall come like a thief in the night.</hi> And others there
were, that ran naked not onely about the ſtreets, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Churches, denouncing deſtruction to the Preachers,
and to Mankind in general, and a ſudden end to the world.
Which wild and unheard-of Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> moved Doctor
<hi>Boreman</hi> in his <hi>Nuntius Propheticus</hi> to ſay,—<hi>That there
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101858:20"/>
ſprang up more Hereſies and ſtrange Opinions in</hi> England <hi>in
one year, then in an Age in any other part of the world there
did before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, no ſure ground whereon to build our Conjectures of the worlds ending.</note> by Mathematical Concluſions. For ſundry
are and have been the Opinions of Mathematicians and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers
about the end of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> As that it
ſhould ſuffer a total and abſolute Deſtruction and Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the finiſhing the great year, or Circle; and this is
at the leaſt 36000 Solar Revolutions, or common Years:
ſo ſlow is the Motion of the eighth Sphear. Nay, <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi>
(as <hi>Plutarch</hi> witneſſeth) ſaith, it conſiſteth of 80000
Solar years. But if we ſhall give credit to the (incredible
indeed) vaſt number of years of the <hi>Chineſſes,</hi> we ſhall
finde that the world, according to this way of reckoning,
ſhould have had ere now many endings. For (ſays <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)</hi>
according to their (the <hi>Chineſſes)</hi> account, this year
of Chriſt 1594. (it being the year in which he wrote his
Book, intituled, <hi>De emendatione temporum)</hi> is, ſince the
Creation, eight hundred eightſcore thouſand and ſeventy
three. And <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us, the world was ſo ancient in
the opinion of the <hi>Caldaeans,</hi> that they reckoned it from
the time they firſt began to obſerve the Stars, unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
of <hi>Alexander</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> no leſs then four hundred
and ſeventy thouſand years; ſuppoſing the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be long before they began their Obſervation.</p>
               <p>But theſe Opinions may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be
as wide of Truth, as the others fall ſhort of it. I onely
urge them to ſhew the impoſſibilitie of their deſignes, who
will needs have the time of the worlds ending concluded
by ſuch a reaſonleſs conceit: As if the Almighty becauſe
he hath tied all the works of his hands to act and perform
his pleaſure, by a certain Rule, the which they cannot
tranſgreſs, (I ſpeak here onely of natural things) ſhould
therefore be tyed unto a Rule himſelf. Others there are,
who ſuppoſe when the Polar Star touches the Pole exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that then the end of the world ſhall be; and now
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101858:21"/>
they ſay it is very near the ſame. But this conceit is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Contra-Aſtronomical, and therefore vain and idle. For
unleſs it were poſſible for the Fixed Stars to alter their
Latitude as they do their Longitude and Declination,
which as Aſtronomy teacheth is impoſſible for them to do,
this opinion cannot have ſo much as the ſhadow of truth
to countenance it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> an eminent Aſtrologer, preſcinding from
his Rules, (as a Learned Divine of our<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Swan.</note> Nation obſerves
of him) unhappily fell into this melancholy errour, and
ſuppoſed the year 1588. ſhould have put a period to the
whole Fabrick and Frame of Nature, becauſe (ſaith he)
that year there was a great Conjunction of <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi>
and <hi>Mars.</hi> But here by the way I muſt acquaint the world,
that either this learned Author was miſtaken in reading
<hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> (for I have not his Predictions for that
year, neither could I ever get them) or elſe <hi>Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was much more erroneous then he reports him. For
in that year there was no ſuch great Conjunction as he
mentioneth: for <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> were in Quartile in a
manner all the year round. It is true, there was that year
a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Taurus,</hi> the 28 of
<hi>April;</hi> but ſuch a Conjunction happens every two years,
and in the ſame Signe once in thirty years conſtantly. But
the end of the world is a Queſtion of ſo curious a nature,
that it even mooketh not onely the Prophecies and Preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Melancholy heads, but many times the ſerious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of the moſt Learned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conceits not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the end of the world by.</note> by Arithmetical Conceits. And that is by
picking out certain Numeral Letters out of Sentences, and
applying them to ſuch and ſuch years, which their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſhall ſeem to agree with. As for inſtance: One there
was, who to make the year 1532. the dangerous year, or
the year in which the world ſhould be diſſolved, collects
the ſame out of theſe words, <hi>VIDebVnt In qVeM pV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pVgerVnt,</hi>
the Numeral Letters in which make up 1532.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101858:21"/>
exactly. Another would have had the world to have ended
in 1645. from ſuch a like fancie, by reaſon of the Numeral
Letters in theſe words, <hi>aDVentVs DoMInI;</hi> which ſignifies
the coming of the Lord; which words make 2012. But now
although theſe words afford more Numerals then makes up
the former ſum,<note place="margin">Viz. 2012.</note> yet the Author hereof was ſo ingenious,
that he could eaſily bring the Mountain to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and
make things exactly to agree; and to this purpoſe out of
2012. ſubſtracts the Numerals in theſe words, <hi>Dles abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIabVntVr,</hi> [the days ſhall be ſhortned,] <hi>viz.</hi> 517. and then
there remains 1495. unto which he adds as many Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
as are to be found in the words <hi>Propter eLeCtos, [for
the elects ſake]</hi> which is 150. and that produces you the
exact number 1645. Now, although this conceit were
witty, and beſpeaks a nimble fancie in the Author thereof,
yet we ſee that the World hath outgrown the danger incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
hereby many years, and is yet likely to continue ſafe.</p>
               <p>Another I have read of, that would have had the world
to have ended <hi>Anno</hi> 1657. becauſe of the Numerals in
<hi>Conf LagratIo MVnDI,</hi> (which ſignifies the burning of
the world) that make up preciſely that number of years.
And many there were (to my knowledge I ſpeak it) of
great Learning, and very ſober Judgements, that began
to be perſwaded into an opinion of the diſſolution of the
world in that year; not onely for the Chronograms ſake,
(which is not ſo fit and appoſite for the purpoſe as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuppoſed) but for another reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe as ſome
opinion, that as the Univerſal Deluge happened <hi>Anno
Mundi</hi> 1657. ſo in the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 1657. ſhall happen
the Univerſal Conflagration. And in the year 1657. was
this Doctrine both from the Preſs and Pulpit eminently
enforced, and that from the words of our bleſſed Saviour,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 37. <hi>Sicut autem erant dies Noe, it a erit &amp; adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Filii hominis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe fancies and conceits are too light and Aiery to
gain a general credit, and accordingly were not long belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
for <hi>anno mundi</hi> 1657. and <hi>anno Chriſti</hi> 1657. likewiſe,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101858:22"/>
are only brought in to father what the Chronogram incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,
and to make the pretended Prophecie the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and famous. Whereas it plainly appeareth by Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie,
compared with Scripture, that the world was 1656
years old when firſt the Flood came upon it; and ſo (but
for the Chronograms ſake) it ſhould have been <hi>anno Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti</hi>
1656. not 1657. in which the Conflagration ſhould have
happened. But that year being now ſix Solar Revolutions
paſt us, hath ſufficiently evinced unto us the folly of the
Chronogram, and indeed the vanity as well as great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of all Numerical Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the end of the World, the Turks hold very
ridiculous and reaſonleſs opinions, as, That</hi> at the winding of
a Horn, not all fleſh onely, but the Angels themſelves ſhall die:
That the earth (with an earthquake) ſhall be kneaded together
like a lump of dough: That a ſecond blaſt of the ſame Horn ſhall
after forty days reſtore all again: That <hi>Cain</hi> ſhall be the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or Ringleader of the damned, who ſhall have the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Dogs and Swine: That they ſhall paſs over the Bridge
of Juſtice laden with their Sins in Satchels: That the great
Sinners ſhall fall into Hell, the leſſer into Purgatory onely.
<hi>With many other vain and idle fopperies needleſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
here, ſeeing the Alcoran it ſelf is commonly to be
had in the Engliſh Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although theſe opinions of the Turks are idle, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſs,
and inconſiderate, yet I do not finde that they are
all out ſo mad and Fanatical, as to aſſigne the particular time
of the worlds diſſolution, as our European Enthuſiaſts are
(almoſt) conſtantly adventuring at.</p>
               <p>To conclude: If men will yet give credit to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Melancholy heads, concerning the worlds ending,
which we ſee ſtill hath failed, as often as preſaged; I ſhall
leave them to the miſery of their own merits, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſtead
of Truth, to hug and embrace a Lye. And if we ſhall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly
adhere to the literal ſence of Sacred Writ, (In relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the matter in queſtion) which tells us, <hi>—before
the end of the world there ſhall be wars, and rumors of wars,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101858:22"/>
&amp;c. (as one learnedly obſerves) it will be very difficult for
us, truly, to term theſe, or any other, the <hi>Laſt Days;</hi> ſince
all times from the beginning have been acquainted with
ſuch reports: And yet the World (as Doctor <hi>Hackwel</hi>
prudently obſerveth) is not grown old, nor doth Nature
ſuffer any real decay, or abatement.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Form onely, not the Eſſence of things that ceaſe
to continue.</p>

            <head>Something touching the Turk's invading the
Empire of Germany, and what may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably

            <p>DIfferent are the opinions among Aſtrologers of the
Aſcendents of Countries in general, as well as of
the Empire of <hi>Turky</hi> in particular. Some would
have the Aſcendent of <hi>Turky</hi> to be the Regal Signe <hi>Leo,</hi>
the great dignity of the Sun, by reaſon of the Majeſty,
Height and Grandeur of that people. Others would have
it to be <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the Dignities of the Fiery and Warlike
Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> in that they are a Nation ſo apt unto War,
and ſo covetous of Victory, that in compariſon thereof,
they value not the loſs of thouſands of their ſubjects.</p>
            <p>This I am ſure of, the Doctrine of Aſcendents is the
meanlieſt ſtudied of all the parts in Aſtrologie: we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould not too rigidly adhere to the one, nor yet too
nimbly reject the other. It is probable that both in ſome
ſence may be true. For, although I ſhall grant that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for both of them to be their true Horoſcope, yet
they may be concerned in both, <hi>viz.</hi> by having one for their
Aſcendent, the other for the place of their Sun or Moon.</p>
            <p>For ſome reaſons, I am partly inclined to believe <hi>Spineu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:101858:23"/>
who in his <hi>Cataſtrophe Mundi,</hi> affirms poſitively, That the
Turks have <hi>Scorpio</hi> for their Aſcendent. For by conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Hiſtory I finde that in the year 1602. the Turks were
exceedingly worſted, and loſt not onely <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> but
60000 of his Men. Now, that year, and a year almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after, the envious Planet <hi>Saturn</hi> was in the ſigne
<hi>Scorpio,</hi> and in the moneth <hi>September</hi> made a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with <hi>Mars</hi> there; which Tranſit and Conjunction had
(in an Aſtrological ſence) moſt remarkable and admirable
ſignification of the ſame, as all perſons verſed in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereal
Science muſt readily acknowledge.</p>
            <p>And in the year 1618. (when <hi>Ottoman</hi> the ſecond (who
ſucceeded his Uncle <hi>Muſtapha)</hi> was unſucceſsful in his war
againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> and was therefore ſlain by his Janizaries)
there happened in <hi>May</hi> that year a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi>
and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Taurus,</hi> the oppoſite Signe to <hi>Scorpio;</hi> and
<hi>Saturn</hi> was tranſiting <hi>Taurus</hi> long before and after, vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Scorpio</hi> (and conſequently all under the ſame) with
his malignant oppoſite Rays. A Conjunction and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
of every whit as miſchievous tendencie as the other.
And (if I could put any Faith in the Effects of Comets)
there happened that year a Comet in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> which (if
Comets operate at all) might heighten the beforeſaid Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>Many more Examples of this kinde, I could inſtance in;
but being onely in part ſatisfied, as I before declared, I dare
not be ſo confident as to be poſitive in the Aſcendent of
this great and numerous people. For it is a very great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether the true year of the Turks Original be
known; and therefore a greater queſtion, Whether the
Day and Hour thereof were truly taken notice of; as we
know it muſt be, if we would diſcover any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from their proper Horoſcope or Aſcendent.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, the ſame <hi>Spineus</hi> undertakes to tell us, That
the great Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter anno</hi> 1603.
ſhould have ſignified the deſtruction of the Empire of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101858:23"/>
               <hi>Mahomet,</hi> together with the change of the <hi>Aux</hi> or <hi>Abſis</hi>
of <hi>Saturn.</hi> For (ſaith he) about the year 1603. when
the <hi>Aux</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> paſſeth into <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the oppoſite
Signe to <hi>Cancer,</hi> (in the which it was at the beginning
of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Law) then ſhall be the end and deſtruction
thereof. But by the word <hi>end,</hi> (ſaith he) we underſtand
not a total Extirpation, but a ſenſible beginning of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
And he pretends to give an Aſtrological De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
thereof in theſe words:<hi>—Seeing the
Faith of</hi> Mahomet <hi>is Martial and Lunar, if we will take
the leſſer years of theſe Planets, they make up the forty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan-years,</hi>
(i. e.) <hi>twenty five of the</hi> Moon, <hi>and fifteen
of</hi> Mars. <hi>Laſtly, take the leſſer, greater, and mean years,
and add them to the</hi> 591 <hi>year of Chriſt, in which year</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
<hi>was born; his deſtruction ſhall begin about</hi> 1648.
<hi>and if to theſe years we add the Affrydary years of thoſe
Planets, his total and laſt Deſtruction ſhall be about the year</hi>
1663.</p>
            <p>Now if this pretended Demonſtration were true, it
would be no ill News for <hi>Europe</hi> to hear, but of very great
encouragement unto them in reſiſting ſo potent an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
But here is the unhappineſs of all, this conceit of
<hi>Spineus</hi> is very liable unto exception. For if we take the
greater, leſſer, and meaner years of theſe Planets, <hi>viz. Mars</hi>
and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and add them unto the year 591. they are
ſo far from making up 1648. that they make not up fully
1000. See the operation.</p>

And then for the Affrydary years of thoſe two Planets,
he muſt mean their Affrydary years either by day or night,
or both; if by day alone, thoſe amount unto one way but
14. if by night alone, they amount unto but 16. if both,
they amount unto but 30. Now the other way, is, by
conſidering the years they particularly govern in mans life;
as the Moon in the Affrydary years by day governs from
the 32 year to the 41. and <hi>Mars</hi> from the 64 unto the 70.
And by night the Moon governs from the firſt year unto
the ninth year, and <hi>Mars</hi> from the 33 unto the 39 year:
but neither way will it make up 1663. This is therefore
a conceit, fit onely to be ranked with the follies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Shipton,</hi> and the forgeries of the Engliſh <hi>Merlyn;</hi> and
no more to be credited then the Prophecies of the one, or
Impoſtures of the other.</p>
            <p>Paſſing therefore by all theſe ſtories as vain and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
I ſhall come unto a more rational ground whereon
to build my probable Conjectures of the grand Seigniors
ſucceſs in invading the Territories of the Germane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
And that is this:—When the Turks began this their
Invaſion, (which was about <hi>July</hi> 1663.) there happened
a moſt cruel Oppoſition of the two grand Infortunes <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
and <hi>Mars:</hi> and certainly we may reaſonably conclude,
whatſoever is begun (let it be either of the loſtieſt or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
concernment) under ſo miſchievous a Configuration,
though it may thrive and proſper, (and that to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a time) cannot be attended with a pleaſant and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
end. Beginnings are adjudged always ominous.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And inſtances enow can I produce herof, both of elderly
as well as latter times: however, take a few within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs

And firſt, let it be remembred, that <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. <hi>Nov.</hi> 3.
that Parliament Sirnamed the <hi>Long,</hi> began in <hi>England;</hi> and
<hi>Sept.</hi> 30. that year, there happened a Conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> (whoſe Horoſcope the Signe of
the Conjunction happened after to be) <hi>Ergo,</hi> under the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of that Conjunction they conven'd. And whether
their prodigious Actions, and afterwards the ends of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, were not equally violent, with the effects of
ſo cruel a Conjunction, I leave the whole world to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. the Mock-Treaty in the Iſle of
<hi>Wight</hi> began: A little before that, there was a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Gemini.</hi> The world knows the
pretences of that Treaty were Serious, Loyal and Pious;
they know likewiſe that the intentions were like to the end
of it, Diſhonourable, Miſchievous, Cruel and Murtherous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1656. there happened in <hi>September</hi> a Conjunction
of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Virgo. Oliver Cromwel</hi> in that year,
and under the effects thereof, did luſtily drive at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of theſe three Kingdoms; his Tyrannical Actions
therein, and the many thouſands of perſons he ruined, and
the Murther, Perjury, Shame and Ignominy he brought
upon the Nation in general, and his own Family in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſufficiently prove and declare his entrance upon
that undertaking to be malicious, unfortunate and cruel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1658. <hi>Sept.</hi> 4. <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> began (at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
deceaſe) to act (as well as he could) his fathers part;
but within five weeks after, <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>Octob.</hi> 11. there was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> and how ſoon
and eaſily the effects thereof blew <hi>Richard</hi> away from the
Government of theſe three Kingdoms, is yet freſh in every
mans remembrance.</p>
            <p>Infinite examples could I give of this kind, as well in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Genitures, as publique Radixes; but theſe I ſuppoſe
ſufficient.</p>
            <p>If then the Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> be of ſuch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101858:25"/>
malefique and cruel ſignification, ſurely their Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cannot be ſuppoſed to portend leſs miſchief and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
And if ſo, it naturally emergeth,—<hi>That the Turks
their invading the Empire being begun under the dangerous
Influence of an</hi> Oppoſition <hi>of</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Mars,—Non
obſtante, <hi>their being a little rampant and victorious at the
firſt, they may (in a little time) fall from their preſent power
and greatneſs, and be glad to retreat and return home again
with conſiderable loſs and damage.</hi> And this I aſſert to be
the natural effect of this their ſo mighty and eminent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>

            <p>IN my <hi>Novice Aſtrologer inſtructed,</hi> the <hi>Spurious Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticator,</hi>
the <hi>King of Swedens Nativity,</hi> and in <hi>Britains

at leaſt to the ſatisfaction of all that knew <hi>W. L.</hi> that I
had need to have ſaid no more of <hi>W. L.</hi> Howbeit, he is
pleaſed to invite me to the field again; and in point of
Credit I am engaged (though not much, becauſe he is
<hi>W. L.)</hi> to meet him.</p>
            <p>The main matter that he ſeems to ſnarl at, and recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
upon me for, now, is a paſſage I printed in Part 3.
Fol. 179. of my <hi>Collectio Geniturarum,</hi> urged in favour
of Mr. <hi>Greſham,</hi> and deſcrying the eminent Plagiariſm of
him the ſaid <hi>L.</hi> in a Book he publiſhed under the Title of
<hi>Englands Prophetical Merlyn.</hi> My words were theſe:—<hi>Mr.</hi>
Greſham <hi>wrote a learned and ingenious Diſcourſe upon a
Conjunction of</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Jupiter, <hi>which by him was never
publiſhed; but ſince his Death, printed by another under the
Title of</hi> Englands Prophetical Merlyn: <hi>and that Book-Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
which publiſhed the ſame, hath never ſo much as once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Mr.</hi> Greſham <hi>therein; but after an uſurping of his
Pains, hath endeavoured to obliviate his Name for ever.</hi>
Of which Injuſtice and Plagiariſm, unleſs I would conſent
to, and wink at, I could not but give the world notice,
that the Aſhes of this worthy (though much abuſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
might not riſe up in Judgement againſt me for my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
herein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101858:26"/>
Now although I knew that <hi>W. L.</hi> was the Man that thus
had abuſed Mr. <hi>Greſham,</hi> yet ſo charitable was I towards
him, as not to mention his Name, being guided by that
known Law of Civility, which enjoyns men,—</p>
            <q>Parcere perſonis, dicere de vitiis.</q>
            <p>Howbeit, <hi>W. L.</hi> is pleaſed to ſpit his venome at me to
purpoſe, for that my reſpect to Mr. <hi>Greſhams</hi> memory, and
this my civility towards himſelf: and is not contented
thus nefariouſly to rob Mr. <hi>Greſhams</hi> Aſhes of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but (with a brow of braſs) would faſten it upon
the belief of the world,—That nothing in the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Merlyn</hi> was Mr. <hi>Greſhams,</hi> but all his own. And is ſo
malitiouſly impudent, as to term me <hi>The moſt ungrateful of
men living,</hi> for offering to vindicate him who is not here
to defend himſelf, in a matter which <hi>L</hi>'s own Conſcience
(if at leaſt he have but ſo much as a Sparrow hath Brains,
or a Pidgeon Liver) knows to be an eminent Truth.</p>
            <p>In return unto which, (that <hi>L.</hi> may ſee I am not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of what I have written in behalf of Mr. <hi>Greſham)</hi> I
muſt tell the world, that <hi>L.</hi> is, and hath ſhewn himſelf
<hi>the more ungrateful of the two,</hi> for offering to bury in the
Urn of forgetfulneſs the Honour, Parts and Pains of him,
without whoſe Labours, <hi>L</hi>'s <hi>Prophetick Merlyn</hi> would have
looked with the ſame complexion and countenance as do
his <hi>Supernatural Sights,</hi> and <hi>Dreadful Dead-man:</hi> fit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for Laughter! whereas now it is furniſhed with the
Calculations and Figures of ſeveral Conjunctions of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
and <hi>Jupiter.</hi>—Yet I will not deny, but <hi>L</hi> may have
ſet the Figures of them: for none but ſuch an Ignorant in
Aſtronomy as himſelf, would adventure at things impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
as is the obtaining a Figure of ſuch a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But ſurely, <hi>L.</hi> will not be ſo impudent as to ſay he Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
the Planets places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for all Aſtronomers know,
that he is not able to perform any thing of that nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:101858:26"/>
And I muſt tell <hi>L.</hi> that his Sophiſtry, whereby he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prove himſelf the Legitimate Author of that
Work, is ſo idle, impertinent and ſapleſs, that a School-Boy
would bluſh to own.—For doth it follow, becauſe
King <hi>James,</hi> Lord <hi>Finch, Campanella, Alſtedius, Keplar,
&amp;c.</hi> perſons not living in Mr. <hi>Greſhams</hi> time, their Names
are mentioned in that Book, that therefore Mr. <hi>Greſham</hi>
was not Author of the better part of it? <hi>L.</hi> might as well
argue, and as truly, that becauſe we finde <hi>W. L.</hi> in the
front of it, Mr. <hi>Greſham</hi> had no hand it; which is a pure
<hi>Non-ſequitur.</hi>—Yet I will not deny, but <hi>L.</hi> having the
advantage of Mr. <hi>Greſhams</hi> pains, might add thereunto
many ridiculous and idle matters, (as I am ſure he
hath) which Mr. <hi>Greſham</hi> (had he been alive) would have
been aſhamed to own.</p>
            <p>Well, but if it be not <hi>L</hi>'s, how (may ſome ſay) do
you prove it to be Mr. <hi>Greſhams?</hi> I prove it thus:—When
<hi>L.</hi> was firſt about to make himſelf publick by Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
<hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1643. or 1644. he applies himſelf to
Dr. <hi>Nicholas Fiske,</hi> my honoured Friend and Tutor; (a
Perſon (but for the neceſſity of this occaſion) too honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to be mentioned in the ſame Page with <hi>W. L.)</hi> and
from him (as I have heard the Doctor in his life-time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
report, and that with ſhaking his head at <hi>L</hi>'s impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and ignorance) he received the beſt part of his
<hi>Prophetical Merlyn</hi> in Manuſcript. And not onely ſo, but
my ſelf ſaw in the Doctors Study, a Manuſcript formerly
written by Mr. <hi>Greſham,</hi> of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Jupiter</hi> 1603. part of which I finde printed in the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Merlyn.</hi> And how eaſie a matter it is to invert the
Judgement of one Conjunction to another, every Artiſt
knows.</p>
            <p>But I need not trouble my ſelf ſo far, ſince Mr. <hi>L.</hi> hath
been pleaſed in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Prophetick Merlyn</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
neerly as much himſelf, in theſe words:—<hi>Let
me with much thank fulneſs acknowledge, that my anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and learned Friend Mr.</hi> Nicholas Fiske, <hi>hath freely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101858:27"/>
lent me either his Manuſcripts, or any Books in his Library,
treating of this ſubject, with much love and willingneſs; from
whom ſince my happy acquaintance with him, I have received
plentiful enlargement of my Judgement</hi>—It is true, his
Arrogance would not permit him to name Mr. <hi>Greſham</hi>
here; yet the truth one way or other muſt out, and ſo he
acknowledgeth, he <hi>received Manuſcripts.</hi> I aſſert, I
ſaw a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> of the Conjunction aboveſaid, in the
Doctors hands, and that the Doctor told me it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Mr. <hi>Greſham;</hi> in which Manuſcript, the times of
many of the Conjunctions, and the Poſitions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
were noted, as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> hath printed them: <hi>Ergo, Mr.</hi>
L. <hi>hath made uſe of Mr.</hi> Greſhams <hi>Manuſcript, whoſe
Name he hath injuriouſly concealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but ſaith <hi>L.</hi> in the ſame Epiſtle, notwithſtanding
this his Confeſſion,—<hi>I have not peruſed any Mans Notes
upon this ſubject, or received aſſiſtance in Judgement from
any.</hi> How, Mr. <hi>L?</hi> Do you confeſs that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Manuſcripts, and aſſiſtance in Judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
yet in the ſame Epiſtle deny it? Can you with the Satyre
in the Fable, blow hot and cold in a breath ſo handſomely?
and yet complain unto all Aſtrologers of the unkind deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>J. G.</hi> towards you.</p>
            <p>I account it beneath me to complain of <hi>L</hi>'s Nonſence
or unworthineſs, or to tell the World he hath <hi>(ſine cauſa)</hi>
complained of me. Yet I ſhall aſſume ſome of his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſtate the matter in queſtion, from whence he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to ground his grievous complaint againſt me; and
it is thus.</p>
            <p>My ſelf ſaw (and indeed ſo did many of <hi>L</hi>'s beſt Friends
if they would ſpeak) in Doctor <hi>Fiske</hi>'s hands, a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
of a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> wrote by
Mr. <hi>Greſham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>L.</hi> confeſſes to have borrowed Dr. <hi>Fiske</hi>'s Manuſcripts.
The queſtion then in ſhort is, Whether Mr. <hi>Greſham,</hi> or <hi>L.</hi>
be the prime Author of that work?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:101858:27"/>
Unto this, <hi>L.</hi> replies, That he is.—I deny it, and
urge <hi>L</hi>'s own words againſt <hi>L.</hi> to ſtrengthen my Negation,
as alſo Dr. <hi>Fisks</hi> acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>L.</hi> pretends to prove himſelf the prime Author, by his
beforementioned Sophiſtry.—I reject ſuch proof, (and
ſo do all rational men that have read it) as impertinent,
idle, and vain. <hi>L.</hi> muſt therefore either prove his claim
better, or elſe be content to looſe his Title unto <hi>Englands
Prophetick Merlyn,</hi> as being the prime Author thereof.
Howbeit, as I ſaid before, I deny not but <hi>L.</hi> hath added
many things of his own unto that Work of Mr. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhams.</hi>
As to inſtance, in Page 30. he hath theſe
words:—</p>
            <p>This Conjunction flndeth (his Majeſty <hi>Charles</hi> King of<note place="margin">☞</note>
               <hi>England)</hi> engaged in an uncivil and unnatural War againſt

againſt the moſt famous City of <hi>London,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
Metropolis, and almoſt againſt the whole Commonalty
and Yeomanry of <hi>England.—[Here is ſuch Aſtrologie,
that I believe Mr.</hi> Greſham <hi>never dreamt of.] He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
thus:</hi>—His Majeſty in defence of his own rights, and
of the perſons of ſeveral Delinquents and Malignant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
ſo voted by both Houſes; the Parliament ſtand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of thoſe Malefactors, and in defence of themſelves,
Proteſtant Religion, Liberties of the Parliament and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in Page</hi> 103. <hi>he hath this paſſage:</hi>—The Wars we
now groan under, and the infinite preſſures we ſuffer by his
Majeſties averſeneſs from his Parliament, and City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
the deſertion of thoſe many Lords, and untruſty Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Houſe of Commons, do all make way, and prepare
matter for their own, and Poſterities confuſion in the firſt
place, and next for the utter deſolation of this Kingdome, and
his Majeſties poſterity.—<hi>And a little further, he ſaith,</hi>—
Let the undeſerving Biſhop and Clergy-man ſuffer; they onely
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101858:28"/>
have ſtirred theſe Tumults with the aſſiſtance of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in Page</hi> 109. <hi>he ſaith,</hi>—Tyranny in Religion firſt
broke the neck of an inſulting Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>Theſe (with many more) of <hi>L</hi>'s Predictions, (if ſo he
will have them called) I believe Mr. <hi>Greſham</hi> knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of; neither would any Man, but a State-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſite,
have ſo heightned, and encouraged Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
under pretence of Aſtrologie.</p>
            <p>And in Page 35. I finde alſo ſome Aſtrological Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which I dare be confident was <hi>L</hi>'s own, and not Mr.
<hi>Greſhams.</hi>—There he gives us the motion in Longitude
of the Comet in 1618. and gives us its dayly motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
in a Column by it ſelf, moſt ſtrangely different from
its motion in Longitude: which how he will reconcile, for
my part I underſtand not. <hi>Cum multis aliis, quae nunc
perſcribere longum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I fully proved what in my <hi>Collectio Genitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum</hi>
I aſſerted in the behalf of Truth and Honour of
Mr. <hi>Greſham.</hi> And to be quit with <hi>L.</hi> in every matter as
near as I can, for his <hi>Oportet Mendacem eſſe memorem</hi>—
I return him the Rule in the Civil Law,<note place="margin">Qui ſemel verecundia fines tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicrit, cum bene &amp; gnaviter impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter.</note>—<hi>Mendax ſemel,

the bounds of Truth, it behooves him, he thinks,
now to grow impudent to purpoſe, and rayle at large
at thoſe that ſhall publiſh his playing the Plagiary.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould Mr. <hi>L.</hi> be ſo extreamly angry at me for my
taxing him with pilfering from Mr. <hi>Greſham,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
his Name? Since this is not the onely piece of Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm
that he hath been guilty of, in his Writings. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
In his <hi>Annus Tenebroſus, Pag.</hi> 60. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he prints
Forty Aſtrological Aphoriſms, as his own, but he hath ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
them out of <hi>Aſtrologia Aphoriſtica, Fol.</hi> 295. and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>And for the greater part of his <hi>Chriſtian Aſtrologie,</hi> my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101858:28"/>
ſelf ſaw in Manuſcript in the hands of the beforementioned
Dr. <hi>Fiske,</hi> which by the Doctor was tranſlated from <hi>Haly,
de judiciis Aſtrorum,</hi> as many of <hi>L</hi>'s beſt Friends know alſo
to be true; and yet hath he been ſo impudent therein,
as to print in Pag. 830. of that his Book, <hi>That he hath not
adviſed with any man living in any thing comprehended in
that Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What thinks Mr. <hi>L.</hi> now? Doth not he better deſerve
to conſult the Proverb, <hi>Oportet Mendacem, &amp;c.</hi> then <hi>J.
G.</hi> againſt whom he falſly urgeth it, and of whom he
ſo cauſleſly complains?</p>
            <p>Well, but let Mr. <hi>L.</hi> play the Plagiarie ſtill, and pilfer
from whom he can; liſp and jabber, ſay and unſay as faſt
and as oft as he pleaſes; he judges it wiſdome it ſeems and
honour enough to himſelf to raile upon my Perſon and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
and that he thinks is ſatisfaction ſufficient from
him.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, me thinks he might readily conceive it is no
hard matter for me to retort his <hi>Scomma</hi>'s. Nay, he knows
in my <hi>Novice Aſtrologer inſtructed,</hi> I have accounted with

needs have me to follow him, I am obliged to acquaint the
world, that wherein he moſt pretends to wound me, the
more he honours me, <hi>viz.</hi> in taxing my Education: For
the meaner that hath been, the greater hath been my pains
in the Study that now I follow. And the leſſer aſſiſtance
any man receives, it is always preſumed the greater Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
he uſes in the matter he undertakes.</p>
            <p>For a Shoomaker to make Boots or Shooes, or a Taylor
a Suit of Clothes, I adjudge no great piece of Ingenuity,
becauſe it is their Profeſſion ſo to do; they were bred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: So for a Scholar to write a Book, or defend a <hi>Theſis</hi>
well, is not to be wondred at; ſince his Education hath
been to Learning: but for either of theſe to take to the
contrary, is certainly an Argument that Education doth
not naturally concentre with Inclination; and the perſon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101858:29"/>
that ſo doth, may reaſonably be termed Ingenious.—And
here, by the way, were not <hi>L.</hi> ſo ſtrangely ambitious, I
could be content to think him a little ingenious,<note place="margin">This he hath 100 times confeſſed in my hearing: Beſides, there are yet perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the <hi>Strand,</hi> that knew him an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to <hi>Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> the Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe
he hath left the Trade of a Taylor, to adventure as Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;
although he was never able to do any thing in it but Quack.</hi>
See this proved in Captain <hi>Whartons Merlini Anglici Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi>
printed 1647. as alſo in <hi>L</hi>'s own Nativity, calculated
and publiſhed by Mr. <hi>James Blackwel, Anno</hi> 1660. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theſe Gentlemen have been pleaſed to pronounce
and prove him a Taylor, I ſuppoſe they do it by the ſame
Figure as a Pedlar is termed a Merchant, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
for I am apt to believe he was as bad at the Trade
of a Taylor, as at the Profeſſion of an Aſtrologer:—A
very Botcher at both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, but ſaith Mr.</hi> L. <hi>J. G.</hi> is not onely an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful
Perſon, but the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful of men living.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L.</hi> ſhould have done well to have told me for what:
for four years ſince he exhibited this charge againſt me,<note place="margin">See more of this in my <hi>Britains Royal Star,</hi> from <hi>pa.</hi> 29. 10 <hi>pag.</hi> 34.</note>
for which I queſtioned him before Mr. <hi>E. Carrent,</hi> (now
Adjutant-General of the honourable City of <hi>London)</hi>
before whom he did not onely deny the Expreſſion, and
called a Learned Miniſter <hi>Falſe Scot,</hi> for telling me of it,
but pronounced me to him, <hi>The moſt Grateful Perſon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am ſure I have had no Dealings with Mr. <hi>L.</hi> ſince;
no, not ſo much as to drink a Glaſs of Wine. But let him
rail on; I have more then the acknowledgement of ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
a Fellow, (who I perceive abhors to hear I live) to
acquit me from ſo ſoul a Crime as Ingratitude. And I am
the leſs troubled at his Scandals, becauſe I know—<hi>Contra
Sycophant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

with ſome, their words may beget credit.</p>
            <p>But <hi>cui fini?</hi> To what purpoſe trouble I my ſelf thus
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101858:29"/>
far with ſo known an Impoſtor, from whom I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to accept of Railings and Revilings for Reaſon, and
Perſonal Reflections and Scandals for the proof of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in queſtion?—But this is the beſt on't, he hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all others that have touched his Copyhold with the
ſame ſawce; ſo that I am not ſingular in partaking of his
Scurrility. As for inſtance,—Captain <hi>G. Wharton</hi> he
terms <hi>Aſinego, Vagadond, Iriſh Wolf, Obſoure Footman, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Booted or Gowned:</hi> with many ſuch-like terms of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probry
and Contumely. And in ſtead of ſoberly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> he calls him, <hi>Thomas Wiſeacre, Covetous
Churl, A ſtiff Prelate, Preaching impudently for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or ſports of the Sabbath,</hi> viz. <hi>Cards, Dice,</hi> &amp;c.—This
is the curious Logique that Wiſe <hi>W. L.</hi> makes uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all that oppoſe his Ignorance, or diſcover his grand
Juggling and Plagiariſm. And poſſibly for my preſent
dealing with his Filth, as well as for my former, I may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
have my Reputation defiled by his ſcandalous Vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Pen. But this I aſſure him, That if he ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſupport (by Calumniations and Forgeries) the
Untruths that I have here and elſewhere proved him
guilty of, I ſhall ſcorn hereafter to intermeddle with ſo
ſhameleſs a Perſon, but rather for anſwer do homage to
<hi>Harpocrates,</hi> and by ſilence give him my ſuffrage for the
Whetſtone. Howbeit, if he ſhall Rationally, and not Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
endeavour to defend himſelf from the Errours I
have charged on him, I promiſe him ſoberly to rejoyn,
for the ſatisfaction of all thoſe that have taken notice of
the difference between him and my ſelf.</p>
