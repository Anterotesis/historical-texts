            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On the late Fire of
London.</head>
            <l>WHat weep in Verse? Yes, yes, taught by this Fire</l>
            <l>When burnt to Mourn, but burning to admire.</l>
            <l>Distill'd by measure? A <hi>Poetick</hi> tear?</l>
            <l>There's more of Chymistry then nature there.</l>
            <l>Poets here needless are, unless the <hi>Charm</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In verse had been sufficient to disarm</l>
            <l>The force and power of fire, if that could do it</l>
            <l>Each Loyal Subject would have then turn'd Poet.</l>
            <l>But since a rude confused draught fits best,</l>
            <l>As like th' effects of fire, let me express't.</l>
            <l>Decaying Trophies, and declining States,</l>
            <l>And what the series of Age relates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Joyn'd with the Wonders of the World, and all</l>
            <l>That we may height, or worth, or greatness call,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Troy</hi> intomb'd in <hi>Iliads,</hi> story showes</l>

            <l>Thus <hi>Londons</hi> Beauty, Pomp, Varieties</l>
            <l>Their only being in a <hi>Catalogue</hi> lies:</l>
            <l>Preserv'd by memory maintain'd by Fame</l>
            <l>Lives only in the story and the name.</l>
            <l>Is Poetry a <hi>Rage?</hi> Yes justly styl'd</l>
            <l>But were't a <hi>Fury</hi> too, 'twere here too mild:</l>

            <l>Distraction only makes it imitate.</l>
            <l>For hark the cryes the frights and the complaints</l>
            <l>Of <hi>London's</hi> poor deplor'd Inhabitants.</l>
            <l>Here an united multitude combine</l>
            <l>Together all their <hi>helpless succor</hi> joyn:</l>

            <l>But <hi>Argus</hi> Eyes, joynd with <hi>Briareus</hi> hands</l>
            <l>Are too too weak supplies to countermand</l>
            <l>So great a force, which like a torrent gorwes</l>
            <l>When stopt the greater, and with unlimited measure overflowes.</l>
            <l>The face of Heaven with an unusual veile</l>
            <l>Is over spread, while the proud fires exhale</l>
            <l>Innumerous Clouds of smoak, that they appear</l>
            <l>To make themselves another <hi>Hemispheare.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That seems to each approaching dazled sight</l>
            <l>Both <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Smoak,</hi> both <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> unite.</l>

            <l>When for their own their Sanctuaries prove</l>
            <l>Too weak; in brief 'tis but a short Repreive</l>
            <l>Surpris'd at last only a while survive,</l>
            <l>One Merchant swears the <hi>Elements</hi> conspire</l>
            <l>Rescu'd from Water to be wrackt by Fire.</l>
            <l>Finding more mercy in the rageing Waves</l>
            <l>Whose sinking billowes but present their Graves</l>
            <l>Which here too true he finds: His Merchandise</l>
            <l>In a confused Chaos buried lies.</l>
            <l>His <hi>Arabian</hi> wealth serves but for one <hi>Perfume:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>His <hi>Indian,</hi> Gold and Silver, reasume</l>
            <l>Their first Original, and in the Earth,</l>
            <l>Make that their Tomb whence they receiv'd their Birth:</l>
            <l>Once more, dispersed in a liquid train</l>
            <l>Both <hi>Or</hi> and <hi>Argent</hi> turn into a Vein.</l>
            <l>Others who once their Honour and Estate</l>
            <l>In the same Ballance weigh'd, by th' common fate</l>
            <l>Like German Emp'rours youngest sons, now are,</l>
            <l>Or like declining Kings but <hi>Titular.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But when I weigh the general loss, I swear</l>
            <l>If Riches ever yet had wings 'twas there.</l>
            <l>Here are those Planets influence of late</l>
            <l>Which in the <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi> met, and that</l>
            <l>Since the great Monarch <hi>Cesar</hi> wore the Bays</l>
            <l>But once and then in <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> daies:</l>
            <l>One Planet rule a greater? <hi>London</hi> far</l>
            <l>
               <unclear>Exceeds the power</unclear> of every weaker Star,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43813:3"/>For this, to feel its loss, imparts from hence</l>
            <l>Through the whole Kingdome its sad <hi>Influence.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Nay threatens Heaven. At this deep Tragedy</l>
            <l>The Sun's spectator but with half an Eye,</l>
            <l>Whilst his diminishing and weaker Rayes</l>
            <l>In such a fainting manner he displayes,</l>
            <l>That what was totally then threatned here</l>
            <l>Some part of an <hi>Eclipse</hi> they seem to beare.</l>
            <l>That 'twas a <hi>Planet</hi> too, a <hi>wandring Fire</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Its swift extent and motion did require.</l>
            <l>But if these Stars rule here, let them compleat</l>
            <l>Their yet continued Aspect, as great</l>
            <l>As was the former that there may ensue</l>
            <l>As did the last a <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> too.</l>
            <l>
               <unclear>That</unclear> 
               <hi>London</hi> may arise and dayly higher</l>
            <l>With its triumphant <hi>Monarch</hi> may aspire.</l>
            <l>But as for those profest Astrologers,</l>
            <l>(Beyond our Spheare,) Heavens Privy Counsellours</l>
            <l>Who know by <hi>Signs</hi> the very Stars intent,</l>
            <l>Give reason for't (above my <hi>Element.</hi>)</l>
            <l>As if they would foretel what's past. T' apply</l>
            <l>Portents to a foregoing destiny</l>
            <l>That's base: The nobler way's, search future Fate</l>
            <l>Help build another, then foretel of that.</l>
            <l>But hark (me thinks) I heare some say 'tis just</l>
            <l>That <hi>Londons</hi> Pride is humbled in the dust.</l>
            <l>Alas thus fire and smoak have left behind</l>
            <l>This <hi>its one property</hi> to make men blind</l>
            <l>Too like this <hi>Iustice</hi> that they plead, unless</l>

            <l>Away dark blindness, tis the only part</l>
            <l>Of Ignorance to censure the desert</l>
            <l>By the event as if that fortune could,</l>
            <l>Because that, Justice is by merit rul'd.</l>
            <l>Nay were its guilt the high'st, who, but mad denies</l>
            <l>Twere, thus absolv'd, too great a sacrifice?</l>
