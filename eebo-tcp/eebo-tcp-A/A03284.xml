            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHile I consider, (Noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) how that after the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable saccage of IERVSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEM, vtter wrake and ouerthrow of the cietie and temple thereof, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table leading till, and being in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of the Iewes, and to the eyes of man, the vnrecouerable desolation of that whole common weale, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nowe as it were, lying so many years deadly buried: yet at the last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their deliuerance, which was

most wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>derful, how I say that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their greatest beautie, and highest felicitie euer did stand: yea, the onely glorie wherein any people could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that is, the lawe of God giuen by MOYSES, was found out amongest the old &amp; desperate ruines, vndestroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vnuiolated, and safely preserued, as is to bee seene by the holy historie 2. Chro. 34. 2. King. 22. I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the wonderful prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce &amp; exceeding great mercy of our god, in preseruing from tyme to tyme, his blessed law and word, wherein onely consisteth the glorie &amp; felicitie of his church vpon the face of this earth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> deprauation, corruption, and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in whatsoeuer extreame da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gers: howsoeuer the blinde papistes cannot see this without a visible &amp; glistering successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of a Church, to do the same. The like perswasion, whereof now in

the whole body of the scripture, now in some parts or portions of the same: the histories of tymes and memories of men do recorde: so that Gods care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce: &amp; mercyful preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath alwayes beene bent herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And if it be lesome to compare small, base, and litle thinges, vnto such as are great, highe, and mightie: surely there was a certein prettie, learned, and godly treatise,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M. Henry Balnaues.</hi>
               </note> compyled by a diuine lawier, and honourable sessioner of the kings maiestie, his session and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke Counsell, which through the iniuries of time, neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of keepers, great and carefull distractions of the author, was so lost, and to the opinion of all perished, that being earnestly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted, greatly desired, and carefully sought for, and searched out by some good, godly, and learned, as hauing some intelligence of the authors tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
<pb facs="tcp:884:4"/>
in that part: yet it could neuer bee had, as desperate at any tyme to haue beene able to bee recouered: vntill to mans appearance of mere chance, but most assuredly by the mercyfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of our God, a certeine godly, and zealous gentleman,<note place="margin">

               </note> priuy to the desires of some that so earnestly coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, being in the towne of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in Lothiane, findeth the same in the handes of a child, as it were ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the childe to playe him with, and so receaued and recouered the the same. And as this treatise was a prettie, &amp; gentill strand of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fountaine of the scriptures: why might it not in this point sauour of the own source, spring, &amp; beginning? why might not the birth in such a case follow the nature and conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the womb? &amp; why might not the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this farre euen rese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ble the mother,
<pb facs="tcp:884:4"/>
or be of the same fortune, &amp; as it were subiect, to the same fatalitie with her. Wherefore, this treatise comming to my handes, as a singuler token of the finders louing kindnes, and liberall will, and affection towards mee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the worthines, vtilitie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious learning, and singuler god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines thereof: I could not, either bee so inique to the honourable fame of the godly author: either so ingrate to the louing propiner, and offerer vnto mee, either enuious to the common wealth of christianitie, or sacrilegious towards God, in suppressing his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in this point, as not to commit the same by my trauell, to a longer and more lastie memorie: that so in this raritie of trustie and faithfull hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides, and great store of treasonable dealing of vile hyrelings: This lawful &amp; louing daughter might after a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

And surely not a fewe, nor small reasons moued mee to vtter the same (worshipful Lady) vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of your name, and as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat it, at least my paines and trauels in setting it out, vnto your honour. For, it being found and recouered in your ground and holding, and after a maner being the birth thereof: who can so iustly as yee nowe and yours challenge the right of the same, after Gods calling to his mercies, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: It is also a work bredd &amp; broght forth in that affliction, and banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t for Christs sake, in the which yee did breede and bring forth your dearest children.

It is such, that when as it was (I wot not howe) negligently letten bee, amongest the handes of babes to play them with, it was through gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence recouered by that godly gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, your Ladyships secretarie.<note place="margin">

SALMANASER, ISRAEL, vnto ASSY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA: &amp; NEBVCADNETZAR, IVDA vnto Babylon. Then Sathan beleeued the true knowledge, and worshipping of God, to haue decayed for euer.

            <p>Sathan neuer beleeued his purpose rather to take effect, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> when after the death of Iesus Christ, hee moued the princes of the priests (who then were estemed the true church of god) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the Apostles, and other profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of Christs euangel.

But that ye may plainly know wherby are Sathan and the world ouercome, and which are the weapons against whome they may not stand: yee shall reade dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly, this work following: which, I am sure, no man hauing the spirite of God, shal thinke tedious, nor long, because it conteineth nothing, except the very scriptures of God, and meditations of his law.<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:884:14"/>
may not abide the light. And therfore they abhorre all godly writings thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them tedious, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine not the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>gth of the lords prayer. But according to the threatning of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAY, the proph. saying: because they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>temne the law of the lord God, hee shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>temne them.

Their vestime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts of spiders webbes (which ar their vaine workes) shall not abide the force of the lords winde: but they shall stand naked, &amp; the workes of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in their handes: to their extreame confusion.<note place="margin">

light, darknes: and darknes light: that which was sweete, they called bitter: and by the contrarie, that which was bitter, they called sweet: seeking salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where none was to be found. But yee, most Christian brethren, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I beseeche, and in the bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ I exhort, that ye reade dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently this present treatise: Not onely with earnest prayer, that yee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d the same aright: but also with humble and due thankesgiuing vnto our most mercifull father, who of his infinite power so hath strengthned the hartes of his prisoners, that in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of Sathan, they desist not yet to worke, but in the most vehemency of tribulation, seeke the vtilitie and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of others.</p>
            <p>It is not my purpose to commend, or aduance this worke with wordes (as commonly writers of prophane,
<pb facs="tcp:884:15"/>
or humane scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce do) seeing, the verity by the selfe, is onely to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But one thing bouldly I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that no man, which commeth with a godly hart hereto, shall passe from the same, without satisfaction. The firme &amp; weake, shall find stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ght, and confort. The rude, and simple, true knowledge, and erudition. The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and godly, humble reioycing, by the omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t spirite of Iesus Christ, to whome bee glorie before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Amen.</p>
            <p>This worke following, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>teineth three principall parts. The first parte, how ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> being in trouble, should seek refuge at God alone. And that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all men is subiect to trouble, and howe profitable the same is, to the godly. Last, of the cruell persecution of Sathan, and his members, against the chosen of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:884:16"/>The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>teineth, how ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is released of his trouble, by faith and hope in the promisses of god, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declareth the article of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prouing that faith onely iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth before God, without all deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or merite of our workes: either preceeding or following faith: with a solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trarie argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, made by the aduersaries of faith, &amp; this article: With the true vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding of such scriptures, as they alledge for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.</p>
            <p>The third and last part conteineth the fruites of faith, whiche are good workes, which euery man should worke, according to their owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in euery estate.</p>
            <p>All this plainely may be perceaued in the life of our first parent ADAM, which by transgression of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement fell in great trouble and affliction. From which hee should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:884:16"/>
haue beene released, without the goodnesse of God, had first called him. And secondly, made vnto him the promisse of his saluation: The which ADAM beleeuing, before euer hee wrought good workes, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted iust. After during all his life, hee continued in good workes, striuing contrarie Sathan, the worlde, and his owne flesh.</p>

For whome the Lawe is made and ordinate, as <hi>Saint Paule</hi> sayeth, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> the first Chap. for the iust needeth no law. These morall maners and discipline, is the most excellent rayment or habite, wherewith man may bee cled. Neuerthelesse, they can not make a man iust before God, nor is not the Iustice which we speak of here in this treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:884:44"/>The Politike or Ciuill Iustice is the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce which euery Subiect and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour estate of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, giueth to their prince, and Superiour, in all the worlde. The which proceedeth of the lawe of nature, and is a good worke, without the which obedience (to the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and defence of the iust) no common weale might bee conserued and kept in rule and order, but all would run to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. Therefore are Princes and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers commanded of God to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> as his good worke: for they ar the ministers of God vnto good. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, yee shall neuer finde man so iust in fulfilling this iustice: but the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shall accuse him that hee hath not done his whole duetie, whiche the same requireth: Neither the Prince to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, nor the Subiect to the Prince, nor equall to equall, that is, Neighbour to Neighboure: The knowledge of this lawe of nature is borne with man, pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his harte, with the finger of God. And therefore let euery man consider
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:884:45"/>
his owne estate: and hee shall perceaue, that if god wil accuse him, with this law, he shall not be found iust, because of the deedes of the law, no flesh shalbe found iust before God.<note place="margin">What is to be iust before man.</note> Notwithstanding, hee which doth the deedes of this law and is obedient thereto in doing, and leauing vndone, according to the external works is so reakoned iust before ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and liueth in the same: and therefore hath the name of iustice.</p>
            <p>The Ceremoniall Iustice, is the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and fulfilling of the Statutes, ordinances, and traditions of man, made by the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other bishops, Counsels, Schoolemaisters, and House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, for good rule, and order, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to bee kept in the church, schooles, and families. This is a good work and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to be had with these conditions<note place="margin">The thinges which should be eschew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in keep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> (that is) that they be made, not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t to the law of god: &amp; that through keping of them: no man thinke him, the holyer before god: nor yet therefore to obteine remission of sinnes, or to bee found right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:884:45"/>
before god. Nor yet that the same may bind or oblish any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them, vnder the paine of deadly sinne. Neuerthelesse how well that euer ye obserue or keep them, that is, this law Ceremoniall: ye shall not bee found iust there through before God, becaus of the deedes of the lawe, no flesh shalbe found iust before him.</p>
            <p>The Iustice of the law morall or <hi>Moy.</hi> law, which is the law of God, exceedeth &amp; is far aboue the other two iustices. It is the perfite obedience required of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the works and deeds of the same. Not only in externall and outward deed, but also with the inward affections and motions of the hart,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. <hi>Math.</hi> 22. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.</note> conforme to the commandement of the same (saying) Thou shalt loue thy lord god with all thy hart, with all thy mind, with all thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and strength.

This is no other thing but the law of nature, prented in the hart of man, in the beginning: nowe made patent by the mouth of god to man, to vtter his sin<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:884:46"/>
and make his corrupted nature more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to him selfe. And so is the lawe of nature, and the lawe of <hi>Moyses,</hi> ioyned together in a knot, which is a doctrine, teaching all men a perfite rule, to know what he should do: and what he should leaue vndone, both to god and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Iustice of the lawe, is to fulfill the law: That is, to doo the perfite workes, of the lawe as they are required from the bottome of the hart.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 56. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note> And as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared &amp; expounded by Christ: and who soeuer transgresseth the same, shall neuer be pronounced iust of the law.

Therefore, in the lawe can we not finde our iustice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the deedes of the lawe, no fleshe shalbe made iust before God.</p>
            <p>For the probation hereof, wee will showe the aucthorities of the Scripture fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the beginning: how the most holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sgressours of the law. And

therefore could neuer be made righteous by the same: and if they which were most holy, could not be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d iust by the deeds of the law: much lesse may the wicked be pronounced iust by the same. Therefore, wee must take this conclusion with the Apostle <hi>S. Paule.</hi> All haue sinned, &amp; haue neede, or are destitute, of the glorye of God<note n="*" place="margin">That is by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne all man is becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me blind and is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God (which was inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of nature, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) in which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> was first created and now is cled with the contrarie. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</note>: And are made iust freely by grace through faith, in the bloud of Iesus christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam,</hi> first in the paradise, transgressed the law: and therefore the same accused him, and condempned him, and all his posteritie, as rebels and transgressours of the same, to the death. Neuertheles, the law remaineth still holy, iust, and good, requiring the same holynesse, Iustice, and goodnesse of vs, as testified <hi>S. P.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Roma.</hi> 7, And because wee doo not the same, the lawe euer accused vs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vs rebelles, and transgressours, as our forefather <hi>Adam</hi> was.

For he might get no better sonnes, nor his nature was. This corruption is so infixt in the nature of man, that hee is neuer cleane purged thereof, so long as this mortall body of sin, &amp; the spirit remaineth together: and this is the cause why wee fulfill not the lawe, in the pure and cleane forme as the same requireth the deedes thereof to be done. For this cause <hi>S.P.</hi> sayeth: Nowe I worke not this euill,<note place="margin">

I would loue, feare, honor, and thanke God, with all my hart, and all my strength, and adheere to his promis: in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery houre and all tribulation, but by the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:884:47"/>
wicked fleshe, I am impedite to doo the same. For howbeit, I haue feare, and loue, begun into me, yet are naturall securite, and concupiscence impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, that they be not pure and perfite as the law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and albeit I haue faith begun in me:<note place="margin">Let euery man iudge if in time of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee finde not this battel within him self.</note> which teacheth that God is true in al his promisses.

This is the iustice of a christian which at length shal be declared (with gods grace) hereafter.</p>
            <p>Here the aduersaries will moue three questions, to se if they may impung the trueth.

The third is, how were the fathers made iust, &amp; by what meanes. To the first question concerning the giuing of the lawe: the cause wherefore it was giuen:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:884:52"/>
and why we fulfill not the same: I will answere vnto it presently. And the other two questions shalbee discussed with the Article of iustification. That is, with the discussing of the iustice, pertaining to a Christian man. And in the forthsetting of good workes: which followed faith, as the true fruites thereof.</p>
            <p>But first yee shall note and keepe well in memorie,<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> that the wicked euer obiects questions and causes, vnto god: on this maner when any thing occurres, which transcendeth their fleshely wit, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: then say they, wherefore did god this or that thing: the which sayinges decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to be the serpents seed, of whom they learned that lesson.

inquiring at God the causes of his secret iudgements, as wherefore hath god cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen one: and reiected another, with other such vnprofitable questions, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, and forescience of God.

How in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible are the iudgements of him: and vnsearchable are the wayes of him: for who hath knowen the minde of the lord, or who hath beene his Counsellour, or who hath first giuen to him that hee should giue againe to them: for of him, and by him, and in him, are all thinges.

Read the whole Chap. which will instruct you of these noble vertues, and qualities of <hi>Adam.</hi> What might hee want, being perticipant in vertues to the godly nature: nothing at all: and so all the workes of god were made perfite:<note place="margin">All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of god were perfite in their first creation.</note> the which he neuer altered nor changed: No more did he his lawe, but after the fall of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, by his prophetes and holy Preachers hee set forth and vttered his lawe in the same forme &amp; pure estate, as it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: That man thereby might the more perfitly knowe his weakenes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

            <p>The law of <hi>Moyses</hi> of the two Tables was but a vttering and declaration of the law of nature. And that proues the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges of Christ: For when he had made a long sermon, teaching his disciples, and the people, the perfection of the lawe of

               <hi>Moys.</hi> as ye may read the 5.6. &amp; 7. Chap. of <hi>S. Math.</hi> concludes on this maner. All things whatsoeuer ye wil men do to you, doo ye the same to them: For this is the law and prophetes. Here ye see the law and all the preaching of the Prophetes ioyned in a knot to the Lawe of nature, which teacheth vs what we should doo, and what we should leaue vndone. This lawe was perfitly prented in the hart of <hi>Adam,</hi> who wanted no perfection to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill, obserue, and keepe the same, to the vttermost perfection thereof.</p>
            <p>For transgression of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of god, our forefather <hi>Adam</hi> was exiled, &amp; banished forth of paradise: and spoiled of the integritie, perfection, and all the excellent qualities, dignities, and godlie vertues, with the which he was indued by his creation, made rebell, and disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t to God in his owne default<note n="*" place="margin">Why ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> may not fulfill the lawe.</note>.

and asketh the same of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, to be in deed fulfilled. But all men proceeding from <hi>Adam,</hi> by naturall propagation, haue the same imperfection, that hee had.

This knowledge deceaued and beguiled the Philosophers: for they looke but to the reason and iudgement of man: and could not perceaue the inward corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

And therefore they erred, and were deceaued in their opinions &amp; iudgements: but the perfite christian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> should looke first in his corruption of nature, &amp; consider what the law requireth of him: in the which he finding his imperfection and sinnes accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: for that is the office of the law, to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> sinne to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and giueth him no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then of necessitie is he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pelled either to dspaire, or seeke Christ: by whome

hee shall get the iustice, that is of value before God: which can not begotten by any law, or works, because by the deedes of the lawe, no fleshe shalbe iustified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
            <p>Yee shall not meruell of the oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsinge of these wordes, that of the deedes of the law, no fleshe shalbe made iust: that is declared, reputed, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d, or pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nounced iust before god: for they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed before the forthsetting of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of iustification, that it may seeme the more cleare, and to that effect the same wordes were spoken by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Rom.</hi> the third Chapter. Of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we know what euer the lawe speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: to them it speaketh, whiche are in the lawe, that all mouthes may bee stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and all the worlde made subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god, because by the deedes of the law, no fleshe shalbee made iust before him. And therefore I haue repeated them so oft, because they lead all men to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite knowledge of their iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which is in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:884:59"/>This proposition of the holy spirite is so perfite, that it excludeth (if ye will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the same right) all the vaine foolish arguments of sophistrie, made by the iustifiers of them selfes, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte the wordes of <hi>S.

Insomuch that no man of righteous iudgement can denye: but shall feele the same as it were in their hands: by this probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, the law speaketh to all, that is accuseth all men, that are vnder the law.<note n="1" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente against Sophistes.</note> All men are vnder the law of nature, or the law of <hi>Moys.</hi> Therefore the Apost. speaketh of the law of nature &amp; <hi>Moy.</hi> and of all men which he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth vnder Iewe &amp; gentill, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes in the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chap. to the <hi>Roma.</hi> And concludeth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:884:59"/>
in the third Cha. all men are sinners. If all men bee sinners: none is iust. If none bee iust, none fulfill the lawe. If none fulfill the lawe, the lawe can pronounce none iust. Therefore concludeth he that of the deedes of the law, no flesh shalbe founde iust before God. The same is proued by <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 13. Psalme.</p>
            <p>Here ye see by the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, he intendes to proue and declare,<note n="2" place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> all men Sinners. That is, to stoppe all mens mouths: and to dryue them to Christ, by the accusation of the law. No law may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> make or declare all men sinners: and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the whole world to God: but the law of nature and <hi>Moyses.</hi> Therefore, vnder that word (law) the Apost. comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ded the law morall, and not the law Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial only. Becaus it followeth in the text. The knowledge of sinne, is by the lawe. And also I knewe not sinne (sayth <hi>S.P.</hi>) but by the lawe:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> Nor I had not knowen that lust or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cupiscence had bene sinne, were not the law said: Thou shal not lust: Therefore ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not eschew: but confesse
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:884:60"/>
that the Apostle speaketh of the law mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: yea, and of all lawes, and all men, because hee excepts none. Therefore let vs conclude with the Apost. and the holy spirite,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> that the iustice of god is without the law made patent and forthshowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by the lawe and prophetes. And then shall we come to our Iustice, which is Christ, as <hi>S. P.</hi> saith the 1. Epist. the first chap. to the <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If yee will saye of your vaine conceate (as ye which are aduersaries to faith euer obiects vanities) that the Apostle in his conclusion comprehendeth not all men, proceeding from <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation: but that some iust men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Ye shall not finde that exception in scripture, of any man (except) Christ. Who beeing both God and man, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly excepted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esa.</hi> 53. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Io.</hi> 3.</note> because hee neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted sinne: Fraude, nor deceat was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found in his mouth, by this exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> all other are excluded, because there is no other (who can be found iust) but he. For that cause, he only fulfilled the law,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:884:60"/>
and satisfied the same. By whome all which beleeue, are accepted as iust, without the deedes of the lawe, through faith in the bloude of Iesu Christ. Let vs passe forward therefore, in the scriptures, for to finde the Iustice of a christian man, which can not be founde in the lawe, nor deedes thereof.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:884:61"/>
by the mercy of god, purchased by christ through faith in his bloude, without all our deseruings, either proceeding or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the same. And it is so farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the other iustice of the law, as darkenesse from light: and heauen from earth: becaus it wilbe alone, and not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipant with any other thing, that Christ may haue his due honour. Who obtained this iustice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the father, and is the price thereof,</p>
            <p>And first it is called the iustice of god, because it proceedeth only of the mercy of God, Secondly, the iustice of faith, because faith is the instrument whereby in Christ we obteine the mercy of God, freely giuen to vs for Christes sake. And thirdly, it is called ours, because by faith in Christ without all our deseruinges, wee receaue the same: and are made, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and compted iust, and accepted in to the fauour of god. And all three ar one Iustice, deuided by sundrie names, as is before saide, which is this article of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. As by example: almes deede
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:884:61"/>
is but one name. And yet after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maner of speaking it is appropriat truely to three: that is to the Giuer, to God, and to the Receauer. In almes, the poore, and indigent, haue no part but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receaue, and giue thankes. The gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer freely giueth of his liberalitie &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and for gods sake. So it is properly called the almes of the giuer, and iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attribute vnto god, becaus for his sake it is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. And also to the receauer becaus he is made rich therewith. In the like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this iustice of God proceedeth of his aboundant mercy and grace, fauour, and goodnes, which hee beareth toward man kind, that is poore (yea) aboue all pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, laden with sinne, hauing neede of the grace and mercy of God: destitute of all confort and consolation. And therefore is called his iustice, by reason of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. And it is called the iustice of faith, or the iustice of Christ: because faith is the instrument, and Christ the Purchaser of the same. And it is called ours by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of participation of all christes merits:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:884:62"/>
which we haue through faith in his blud without our merites or deseruinges.</p>
            <p>Therefore euen as the sickman recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his health:<note place="margin">An apt si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</note> The poore his almes: and the drye earth the raine, without all their merites or deseruings: So receauest thou of God this iustice, which is of value be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, by such instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts as god pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth mediatly thereto: he being the im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediate cause.

The Earth receaued the raine, and hath no part thereinto, but to receaue. The Labourer or Plowman,

beeing the instrument to open the pores of the earth that the raine may descend into it, and then it bringeth foorth fruite in due time: Euen so it is with man.</p>
            <p>It is called the iustice of God and not of man or of free wil: but of God, not that Iustice by the which God is iust: but the Iustice with the which man is cledd, and by the mercy of God, of wicked made iust, as <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> saith, in his booke of the spirite, and the Letter the 20. Chap. in obteining of the which we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke nor giue anything to god: but receaueth, and suffers god to worke in vs. Therefore, it is farre aboue all iustice of the law, which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> doth, and worketh, the which are also the works of god, both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they are of the law: and man may do them of his own free will, &amp; power, as to the externall work.

That it is the mind of the Apost. <hi>S.

Specially to the <hi>Rom. Galath. Hebre.</hi> In the which he laboureth so diligently, that all the Sophistes and workers, that are Iustifiers of themselfes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:884:66"/>
may not get a corner to hyde them into, from his conclusions, without they deny Christ and his office. At the least in effect (as they doo after their maner.) But the wisedome of god and his holy spirite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth them: for when they wrest and throwe the scriptures, to their minde in one place, they are compelled in another place of the same Scripture to confesse them selfes Lyers. In the Epistle<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> from the beginning to the 12. chap. and in the Epistle to the <hi>Galath.</hi> to the 5.

               </note> with all laboure and diligence, he setteth forth the iustice of god to bee through faith in Iesu Christ, without all workes of the lawe. And when he hath established the same Article of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Then setteth he forth the workes of righteousnes, in the which a christian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> shal liue becaus the iust shal liue in faith.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:884:67"/>
the mixtion which now these fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed workers would haue ioyned in with faith and the benefite of Christ, which is no other thing but the worke of the deuil our aduersary, to make the death of christ in vaine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galath.</hi> 2.</note> as the Apost. sayth: Therefore if iustice be of the law, or by the law, christs death is in vaine.</p>
            <p>But thinke not that I intende through these assertions to exclude good works: No, god forbid, for good workes are the gift of god, and his good creatures. And ought and should be done of a christian, as shalbe showen hereafter at length in their place. But in this article of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yee must either exclude all workes, or els exclude Christ from you, and make your selfes iust: the which is impossible to do, because we are wicked and can do no good at all, which can be of value be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or pacifie his wrath, except Christ first make our peace. For that is his office <note place="margin">The office of Iesu Christ is: to pacifie the wrath of God, which our workes may not doo. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> for the which he came in the world and suffered death: So if yee will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Christ, exclude your workes. For in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:884:67"/>
this case there is no concurrence, more then there is betweene darknes &amp; light: For what participation hath righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with iniquitie, or what fellowship hath light with darknesse. The definition of this Iustice is made plaine by <hi>S. P. Ro.</hi> the 3. Chap. which I exhort you to reade: consider worde by worde, conceaue, and prent them well in your harts, then shall ye be able to contend and fight valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly against satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Io.</hi> 5.</note> and his sophistes: of whom yee shall haue victorie by faith, which is our victorie that ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>meth the world.</p>
            <p>The iustice of god is, by the faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Christ, In all, and vpon all, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, there is no distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. All haue sinned, and haue need (or are destitute) of the glorie of god: But they are made iust, by his mercy, freely without the workes, by the redemption which is in Christ Iesu: whome god hath proponed or layd before a sacrifice or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by faith in his bloud: to the forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>showing of his iustice, for remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the sinnes by past: the which god hath suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:884:68"/>
to the forthshowing of his righteous<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes at this time, that hee may be iust, and iustifie him, which is of the faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Christ. Where the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is thy glorie or van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? it is excluded by what law of works? No, but by the law of faith: Therfore we beleeue surely a man to be made iust, by faith without the deedes of the law.</p>
            <p>Now, I pray you tell me what plainer words may be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, or termes inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted to exclude all our works, merites, or power, to be participant with god in this article of iustification.

But here he cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led the iustice of God his, by imputation. And also hee was innocent of the thinge which was layde to his charge, by King <hi>Saule,</hi> who euer accused him of treason: and vsurping of the crowne of <hi>Israell,</hi> in the 16.

And in innumerable places of scripture, yee shall finde this word iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice sometime ascribed to god: &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to man,<note place="margin">Why iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to man.</note> because of the receauing of the same from god: but euer the scripture makes the selfe plaine, by the sentence that goeth before, or els followeth, or in some other place. Therefore, take good heede vpon the reading of the scriptures, that ye deceaue not your selfes, ascribing any deede or power of yours to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: for it may suffer none, but only Christs merits, because the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of man, are impure and imperfite, &amp; may not abyde the iustice of God: nor stand in his sight.</p>
            <p>It followeth in the definition of this iustice: By the faith of Iesu Christ in all, and vpon all which beleeueth in him. Here ye may see our faith, that we beleue in Iesu Christ, called his faith, as it is in deede. And the faith also of god, and by the same reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, as the iustice is called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, because it is the gift of God, as <hi>S. P.</hi>

So let all our delite and pleasure bee to imbrace Christ in our hart by faith in his bloude. For, faith is the thing which Christ desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of a sinner.

            <p>It followeth in the definition: there is no distinction nor exception, all hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and hath neede of the glorie of god: that is,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Par.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Io.</hi> 1. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.</note> all wanteth that iustice which god approued or iudged to be glorie.

            <p>It followeth in the definition, but they are made iust, freely, by the grace of god, through the redemption which is in Iesu Christ. Here ye see the Apost. purposeth to exclude all your merites in deseruing of this iustice. To the effect he may (as in all his Epist. and labours he intended) set foorth the glorie of god: and the benefite of christ, the which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> no wise be highlier setforth, then in the making of a wicked man, iust, and freely: that is, for nothing: and without deseruing: For that cause Christ is made to vs, from god, wisdome, iustice, holynes, and redemption: that he which reioyseth, may reioyse in the lord. And that meaneth the Apo. <hi>Pau.</hi> and the prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi>

vertues giuen vnto God, as wisedome, strength, &amp; riches, which are in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to vse and exercise, as the gifts of God: much more iustice, which is not in our power.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For we are made, &amp; make not our selues: the which we do, if we deserue it, either for workes preceeding or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iustification, to haue any part of the substance thereof. And so would ye drawe the glorie of God to you in one part, the which God will not suffer, as the Prophete <hi>Esay</hi> saith:<note place="margin">

But my welbeloued bretheren, yee shall vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d that God first loued vs, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked vs to loue him (wee being sinners vnworthie of loue: yea enemies also) as the Scriptures of god teach you, <hi>Io.</hi> 1. ep. and 4.

And so shal ye vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d this text following of <hi>Corn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The text saith, there was a man named <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a captaine, &amp;c. a deuout man, &amp; one that feared god, withall his houshold which gaue great almes to the people, &amp; prayed god continually, &amp;c. To whome the angell sent from god (said) thy almes and prayers are past vp in the sight of God, &amp;c. Here yee see this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and iust, by the first two proprieties, by the which hee is commended: which can not stand without faith: That is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and fearing god: Deuout, is to say, a true worshipper of god. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> truely ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:884:88"/>
worship God, or please him, but in faith becaus it is impossible to please god,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cornelius</hi> had faith and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wroght good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> with out faith. <hi>Cornelius</hi> worshipped God truelie: and so pleased him: therefore he was faithfull, he feared and dread god, by loue, for that is the feare whereof the text speaketh. Therefore <hi>Cornelius</hi> was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full because that loue can not be without faith. The works which <hi>Cornelius</hi> wroght wer the fruites of faith, and pleased god: because god approued the same, which hee had neuer allowed, except they had bene done in faith: For all which is not of faith is sinne. Therefore yee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was faithfull, and iust before god: or els ye must deny the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (which good forbid).</p>
            <p>And then will yee say: to what effect was <hi>Peter</hi> sent for, to instruct him in the faith, and teach him what he should doo: if he was faithfull, what faith was it he had? To that I shall answer. <hi>Cornelius</hi> had the same faith that <hi>Adam, Noe,</hi> and the fathers had, for he beleeued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised seede, which was Christ: &amp; knew
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:884:88"/>
not that he was come:<note place="margin">What faith <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lius</hi> had &amp; wherefor was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> sent vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to him.</note> But beleeued in one god, and that the same god had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised a Saueour to redeame the world. So god looking vpon the faithfull, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ble and simple hart of <hi>Cornelius</hi>: and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent desire of his prayers (which desire doubtles was conforme to the sayinges of the Proph. <hi>Esay:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>O if thou wouldest break a sunder the heauens that thou might come doune</hi>) would not haue him deceaued, to looke for him, which was already come Therefore he caused him send for <hi>Peter</hi> to instruct him in the present faith. And to certifie him that Christ was come whome he looked for so ardentlie. Yee may read the text: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> shall yee perceaue the sermon <hi>Peter</hi> made vnto him, which was only of the opening of the Scripturs testifieing the comming of Christ in the fleshe: and fulfilling of all the promises, and Prophets sayings, spoken of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and that he was risen from deathe: and had giuen <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math. vlt. Mar.</hi> 16. <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.</note> and the rest of his Disciples &amp; Apostles, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d to preache repentance and remission of sinnes to all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:884:89"/>
which would beleeue in his name. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To the which words and preaching of <hi>S. Peter, Cornelius,</hi> &amp; his whole hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde gaue firme faith, and receaued by a visible signe the holy spirit. The which is no other thing, but this article of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. For hee beleeued the word of god: and by faith in Christ, through the mercy of God receaued the holy spirit, without all working of any deede of the lawe of Moyses: but onely being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of nature: and so was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp;c. Therefore yee can not proue by this authority of scripture, that either the works preceeding, or following the gift of the holie spirite, was the cause of his iustification, or yet any parte thereof. But first being iust through the faith which the fathers had (who had also the holy spirit) truely worshipped god: and feared him of loue, &amp; so he was iust. And in that righteousnes wrought the fruites of faith, in prayers and almes deeds. And secondly, being taught by <hi>Peter,</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that Christ was comme the sure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:884:89"/>
of the world: and had fulfilled all which was spoken of him by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes. By this faith was hee by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, made iust: and receaued the holy spirite visiblie, without all works or deseruings. And then in the kingdome of Christ and righteousnesse, wrought the fruites of faith vnto life, as all perfite Christians should doo.</p>
            <p>They alledge another text. <hi>Galath.</hi> the 5. Chap. Faith, which worketh by loue, &amp;c. by these wordes they would inferre of their corrupted maner: that faith onely iustifieth not before god: but faith which worketh by loue. By this maner of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,<note place="margin">Sophistes would make the holy spirit speaking in <hi>S.P.</hi> contrarie to him selfe.</note> they not only make the Apost. false, but also cast all downe &amp; destroye the same thing, which hee hath builded: for in the fourth Chap. of the same Epist. preceeding, with great laboures and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible arguments, hee setteth forth the article of iustification, prouing faith only to iustifie without all deedes or workes of the law. And then in the 5. chap. he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to set foorth the fruites of faith
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:884:90"/>
(saying) ye are abolished fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> christ, which would be made iust by the lawe.

            <p>In these words shortly, &amp; in briefe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the Apost. excludeth all workes, and lawes, sacrifices, &amp; worshippings, both of Iew and gentill, to haue any mixtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with Christ, in the iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of a christian: for if there had bene any more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t work, or greater in estimation among the <hi>Iewes</hi> (which were the chosen people of god) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, no doubt but the Ap. would haue excluded the same: &amp; so the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall work co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>manded by god, and giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by him, as the seale of his promis &amp; couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, made to <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,</hi> being excluded forth of of this article: how can any other worke of lesse or equall estimation, haue parte thereinto.

which faith may not suffer, nor wil on no wayes suffer, as a light superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> repu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the word of god: loue will, or may suffer the same to be in it, for the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the infirme brother.

            <p>Christ being asked, and inquired by the young man, what he should doe or worke,<note place="margin">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:884:92"/>
no fals witnes: thou shalt honour thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy mother: and thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> Here yee see, Christ teacheth the young man, the workes of the second table, which concerne our neighbour onely: and speaketh no thing of the first table: which perteineth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to God, and consisteth into faith. Therefore by these wordes of Christ it may not be inferred, that he sendeth any to the law, to obtein perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> therin: that is to say, iustification, or saluation: but onely to let them know, what the Law requireth of them, and what they wer oblished to doe: that they seing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meady thereinto, might seeke Christ: who came in the world, to call all vnto him, and not to sende them to the Law, for that was the office of <hi>Moyses.</hi> What auailed Christs comming in the fleshe: If hee would haue sent man to the Lawe to get saluation: but Christ declareth plainely hereafter in the same texte, that there was no perfection to be had in the deedes of the Lawe, of mannes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:884:93"/>
doing, as appeareth by the answere made to the young man, and precept giuen to him.</p>
            <p>When the young man said, he had obserued all the said deedes of the Law, from his youth &amp;c. Howbeit, hee made a lye, Christ accused him not, because it was not his office: but said vnto him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> if thou wilt be perfite, go thy waye, and sell all that thou hast, &amp; giue it to the poore: and come and follow me. But when the young man harde that saying, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sorrowfull, and left Christ, because he had great possessions. <note n="*" place="margin">The wordes of Christ vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the hipocrisie of the young man.</note> These wordes of Christ are no other thinge, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the fained man, to let his hart be knowen, which beleeued that through fulfilling of the outward deeds of the law, he might be found iust before god. And also to teache vs the duetie, which we are bound to do to our neighbour. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, Christ hath freed vs from the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and malediction of the law, he will that we worke the workes of charitie, to the vtility of our neighbour: and nothing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:884:93"/>
draweth vs so much therefrom as auarice and couetousnes. Therefore Christ ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the young ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s couetous hart (which hee would haue hidden, as all hypocrites do) and taught him, if he would bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, to followe him, in whome is all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And so this text maketh nothing for them which impunge this article of iustification, but rather against them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the matter of which christ speaketh, doth concerne the neighbour only, and works to be wrought to his weale &amp; vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which of necessitie followe the article of iustification, as the fruits of faith done by the iustified ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, who may or can finde no better workes to doo, nor they which are commanded in the law of God.</p>

which are good, and well instructed in maners, but also to the wicked and euill. What euer yee doe worke the same with your harte, as it were to the lord, and not to man: knowing surely ye shall receaue from the lord the reward of the heritage. Therefore serue the Lord Iesus Christ. Be not flatterers, nor lyers, backbiters, nor detracters: serue not your maisters onely in their presence, but also in their absence: without deceat or dissimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.

            <p>NO better works can be, then <hi>Iohn</hi> the baptist taught to the people: which are the workes of mercy, and to desist from fraude, iniurie, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. And these workes (and not the

vaine inuentions of man) pastours should teach their flocks: instructing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> first, in perfite faith. For Iesus christ (being asked by the <hi>Iewes</hi> what they shuld do, that they might worke the workes of god: that is, that they might please god) answered: This is the worke of God, that yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him whome he hath sent. By the which words, our maister vnderstandeth, that without faith, whiche is the worke of god, and not of man, no worke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth god.</p>
            <p>The yoke of Christ is easie, and his burden is light to the faithfull, because they lay all their sinns vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Christs backe, and follow him, euery man in his owne vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. There is two maner of vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, one immediate by god, as the prophetes, and Apostles were called, to be preachers without authoritie of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. Another is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, as when one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> called another: As <hi>Paull</hi> called <hi>Timoth.</hi> &amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> to be bishops. There is a generall vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, by which all the chosen are called to a Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Hauing one lorde, one faith, one
<pb facs="tcp:884:152"/>
baptisme: In this vocation, there is no difference of persons, but all are equally loued by god: becaus we ar all the sonns of one father, &amp; al boght with one price, all seruaunts to one lord, all guided with one spirite, all tending to one end, and shall all be participant of one heritage, that is, the life eternall by Iesus Christ, by whom we are all made priests, and kings: but let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> herefore, vsurpe the autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie of a king in dignitie: nor the office of a priest in administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of gods word, &amp; sacraments: for that perteinteh to a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vocation.</p>

Whose duety is, first to know god, and his lawe, which hath placed them in that authoritie.

Secondly to guide, feed, and defend their subiects: knowing them selues to be no better of their nature, then is the poorest in their realme. Thirdly to defend the iust and punish the wicked, but respect of persons. Hauing their harts and eyes cleane and pure from all auarice. They are called the sonnes of God, and should be obeyed in all things, not repungning to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mand of god, because they ar or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deined &amp; placed by god: to punish vice &amp; mainteine vertue, and therefore their owne life should be pure and cleane: first because otherwise they can not punish sinne: and secondly, because the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of princes, prouoketh their subiects to the Imitation thereof. And therefore the life of princes shuld be pure &amp; cleane as a mirrour to their subiects: and should admitte into their kingdomes, no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of god: except that which is commanded in the scripturs: for god be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commoned by Idolatry: and strange worshipping, hath destroyed many king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes, as all prophecyings witnesse.</p>

            <p>THE principall office of a Bishop is, to preache the true Euangell of Iesus Christ, knowing that if the flocke perishe, the bloud shalbe required at his hands. And that hee neglecting the preaching of the Euangell, is no bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, nor can doe no worke pleasant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god. And therefore no bishop should mixt him selfe with temporall or seculer busines: for that is contrarie his vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>: but continually should preache, reade, &amp; exhort his flocke, to seeke their spirituall foode in the Scriptures. And so the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes in these dayes, forbidding men to reade the Scriptures, declare them selues, wolues, and no pastors: whom god shall shortly punish (because they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned his command: attending altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon their own vaine supertitions) as he did <hi>Hely,</hi> and his two sonnes vnder law: and the whole priesthood after Iesus Christ.</p>

            <p>THE office of the Father (vnder whom is comprehended all housholders) is to rule, and guide his children, family and seruaunts, in all godlinesse and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie: instructing them in the Law, and word of God. For honest housholders, who liued in chaste matrimonie, ruled, &amp; guided their housholdes well, nurished their children in the feare and reuerence of God: were chosen to be Bishoppes in the Primitiue church, And therefore they are blasphemous to the holy spirit: which inhibit the Laickes (so style they the chosen of God) learning, reading &amp; teaching of the holy Scriptures, wherin is conteined the foode of the soule: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Antichristes willing to depriue them, would also kill the soule. For the soule without gods worde, hath, nor may haue no life. The office of the husband is, to loue, and defend his wife, giuing to her onely his body. The office of the wife is
<pb facs="tcp:884:154"/>
likewise to loue, and obey her husband, vsurping no dominion ouer him. And the office of them both is, to instruct their children in gods Law: euer giuing to them, example of good life: and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them at godly occupations, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring also them selues faithfully, for susten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation of their families.</p>

            <p>THE office and duetie of the Lord is, to pay vnto his seruaunts, the rewarde promised. And the office of the seruaunt is, faithfully to worke, and labour, to the profite and vtilitie of his lord, but fraude or simulation, as hee would serue Iesus Christ. The office of the subiect is, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his prince, and rulers placed by him: giuing vnto them, honour, custome, and tribute, not requiring the cause, why they receaue the same: for that perteineth not to the vocation of a subiect. The office of the sonne is, to loue, feare, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his parents. Which honour stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in words only, but in ministring
<pb facs="tcp:884:155"/>
of all thinges necessary vnto them, which if the sonne doe not to the father and mother, hee can doe no good worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god.
