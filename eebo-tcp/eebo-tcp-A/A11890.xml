            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE service of idols, or of God by them, although it be a sin more reprehended in Gods word, more punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his works, then other vices: yet is it most common and familiar with the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> easily compassing them about, and hanging fast upon them. As may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by three demonstrations; first, how the best men in the world doe easily fall into it; secondly, after, what pleasure they take in it; thirdly, and then, how hardly they are drawn from it. Of all these, the Scriptures giue testimonies many.</p>

Being fraught with this fear, and void of faith; he thought to prevent these evils, by setting up a place of Gods publick worship, in his own dominions. And knowing that the people would not easily be drawn to a new religion, he retained a shew still of the old, not altering any article of the faith, nor yet many of the externall rites; but as in Ierusalem there was a Temple, and Altar, and other outward signes of Gods habitation with his Church; so would <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in Israel, make Temples, and Altars, and signes of Gods presence, that his people mought serv him there.

               <hi>kingdom of Priests,</hi> as the Lord calleth them in his Law: they may (no doubt) being duely sanctified and consecrate thereto, offer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable sacrifices unto God.

cause of all this stur, and faction: their doctrine impeacheth my supremacy, and disturbeth the peace of the Church. Wherfore as <hi>Solomon</hi>

            <p n="20">20 Yet a few words more of the events that are happened; which in their simplicity many doe mistake and abuse against me. The Prophet <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.1.</note> that came out of Iudah to Bethel, and gaue there a sign; made some for to think, I had sinned in deed. My selfe, I confesse, was somewhat moved when I felt <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>vers.</hi> 4.</note> my arm withered: but seriously weighing things after, as they were, I stayed my thoughts. For first, he came but as any false Prophet, (if God so permit,) may come at all times; I mean, with sign and wonder, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out word of truth, to convince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. He <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>vers.</hi> 2.</note> cryed against the altar: but shewed no law of the Lord to condemn it. He threatned destruction; but who knows when the day shall come; for no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16422:37"/>
time was set down; that men may be held with continuall expectation. I find in the Law, that a <note n="y" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 13 1.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Prophet may arise, giving a sign or wonder, which shal come to passe: and yet his doctrine may be abominable, and God thereby <note n="z" place="margin">
                  <hi>vers.</hi> 4.</note> proveth the hearts of his people. The inchanters of Aegypt <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11.12.</note> could also doe miracles even like unto <hi>Moses:</hi> yet were they no Ministers of the Lord. What then though this falser had power to doe great things, and thereupon was hired by the King of Iudah to come preach against me, and seduce my people; no wise man will rest on coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit miracles, but will settle his heart on the Law of God; which that Prophet could not convince me with all (for then I had yeelded,) but sought to get credit by abusing that power, which God did permit him to haue for my tryall. The abuse of Gods name cannot goe long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished, for it is a great sin: neither sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this Prophet due vengeance for his crime; but as he went homeward, he was slain <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.24.</note> by a Lyon. Well worthy end, for such as dissemble the message of the most High. How ever therefore some think of this matter, I am not perswaded

hee was a man of God, that came to so fearfull a death.</p>
            <p n="21">21 But the death <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 14</note> of mine own son <hi>Abijah,</hi> sate neerer me, and made me look narrowly into mine actions, till I found indeed whereof to resolue. I sent mine own wife <note n="d" place="margin">

And were it indeed that I had offended; my fault mought bee shewed me in loue and meeknesse: which would better beseem the Prophets of God, then this their distempered carriage.

               <hi>some goodnesse found</hi> in my son, towards the Lord God of Israel; and therefore he must die. But doth the Lord use so to reward them that are good before him? It is said in the Scripture of wicked men, that <hi>they</hi>
