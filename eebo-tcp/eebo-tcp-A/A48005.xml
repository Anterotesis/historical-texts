            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>BOth I and many others of this
County, who have been witneſſes
of the Duke of <hi>Leeds</hi> his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Services for this King and
Government, were ſo amazed with the
ſurprizing News of his being Impeached
in Parliament, that we expected to have
heard of ſome very black Crime laid to his
Charge, and that the ſame had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
prov'd againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97640:3"/>
It was not otherwiſe poſſible for us here
to believe, that this Parliament, to whoſe
Meeting and Well-being, that Lord did
contribute ſo much, would have ſuffered
him to be Accuſed; ſince all Men muſt
acknowledge, that he was the chief, if not
the ſole Inſtrument, in procuring that
happy Match betwixt his Majeſty and the
late Queen, to which alone the Deliverance
of theſe Nations is to be attributed, and by
which only his Majeſty was Intitled to that
Claim, which enabled him to do us the
Good he hath done, and to receive the
Reward he juſtly deſerved from theſe
Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Neither can any body be ignorant of
the Duke's Perſonal Services at the time of
the Revolution; wherein, although others
may not know the number of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
(which were much ſuperior to any
other Body of <hi>Engliſh</hi> in any one place)
nor the care and prudence of his Conduct,
as we do who ſaw it upon the place; yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97640:3"/>
all who are Well-wiſhers to this Govermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
muſt be ſenſible of the good Effects
which that <hi>Northern</hi> Inſurrection did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and that it was a principal Motive
to the deſertion of the late King's Army.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo not to be denied, That as his
Grace did expoſe both his Perſon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
on that occaſion; ſo, it being for ſo
great a Good to his Country, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Means then viſible of preſerving the
Proteſtant Religion in this Nation, he did
it without reſerve: For he ingaged his only
Son as deeply as himſelf; inſomuch, that
his Poſterity muſt have been liable to all
Forfeitures; as well as he; which was the
Caſe of no other Nobleman in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and he hath ever ſince continu'd to
expoſe him on the moſt hazardous Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings;
in all which, the Marqueſs hath as
conſtantly ſignalized himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As the Duke's forwardneſs and zeal for
the Service of his Country hath appeared in
all his Actions, ſo his Experience hath been
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97640:4"/>
long, and his Abilities known; and no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
can be ſtrong enough to bring his
fidelity to this Government into queſtion,
were there no other reaſon for it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that would be to ſuppoſe him the
weakeſt of Men (which no body will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
to quit the intereſt of a great and
powerful King, whom he hath obliged; to
eſpouſe the intereſt of a King, he hath
not only diſobliged, but who can feed
no body with more than bare Promiſes;
which he is neither likely ever to be in a
condition to perform; or, if he were, he
hath ſhew'd the World, by too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
that he can as eaſily break Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
as make them.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Reaſons, we are impatient to
learn what myſterious Deſigns lie at the
bottom of theſe Proceedings againſt his
Grace.</p>
                  <p>That which appears to us, by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Votes of Parliament, is only a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Accuſation for High Crimes and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97640:4"/>
alledging the ſaid Crimes to
be for taking corruptly and illegally, 5500
Guinea's from the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, for
procuring a Confirmation of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
of which the illegality is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
here, if it had been done.</p>
                  <p>But by ſeveral Books and Pamphlets which
have been diſperſed in the Country, we
find many things aggravated in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by the pretended Speeches of Members
in both Houſes, which we thought had
not been permitted to have been Printed,
without the Lycenſe of the Speakers of
each Houſe: But we obſerve, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of thoſe Phamphlets do not only
conceal their Names, but their Prints are
found ſo full of virulent and perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
againſt the Duke, that very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
credit is given to them; and ſome of
them are Prefaced with Texts of Scripture,
ſo maliciouſly and wickedly applied, that
they appear to be things written with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
only to ſpread an ill Character (if
they could) of the Duke amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97640:5"/>
People, whom they hope to deceive
by their bold and impudent aſſertions: But
inſtead of making that impreſſion, it is
generally believed they take that courſe,
becauſe they think they cannot hurt him
by any truth or fair way of acting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</p>
                  <p>That this is the aim of thoſe Libellers,
they have made ſufficiently appear, by the
firſt of thoſe Phamphlets which I ſaw,
<hi>viz.</hi> one Intituled, <hi>A Collection of ſome Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions
in Parliament, in relation to the
Impeachment of</hi> Thomas <hi>Earl of</hi> Danby, <hi>in</hi>
1678, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Publiſher of that hath
been ſo deceived, in the operation of that
old Memorandum, amongſt us Country
Gentlemen, that it hath had a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Effect to his Purpoſe; for it hath
both ſhew'd a Malice without diſguiſe,
and puts every body in remembrance
how unjuſtly the Duke was then accuſed,
and how conſtant an Aſſertor he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to have been ever ſince, both of
the Proteſtant Religion, and of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97640:5"/>
intereſt, againſt that of <hi>France:</hi> Nor was
the Author's Wiſdom ſuited to his Malice,
when he thought fit (as he hath done
in that Pamphlet) to quote ſome parts of
the Duke's Letters to Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> and
to leave out other parts of the ſame Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and to ſay nothing of what appeared
in ſome of Mr. <hi>Montague</hi>'s Letters, in the
Duke's Vindication in that ſame Buſineſs;
which hath ſince manifeſted it ſelf, to have
been the contrivance of <hi>French</hi> Councils, in
concert with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, who were
employ'd to wound the Duke, who they
then found to be their chief Enemy in the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>The other two Pamphlets which I have
ſeen, are, one of them Intituled, <hi>A Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Debates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Inquiry into
the late Briberies,</hi> &amp;c. And the other is
called, <hi>A Supplement to the ſaid Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
&amp;c. Both which, although they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give an Account of ſome other
Mens Actions, yet appear to be ſo princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
levelled againſt the Duke, that the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97640:6"/>
reſt ſeem to be introduced rather to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Author's Venome againſt his
Grace; in which, to ſay truth, they have
ventured to be as bold as they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
unleſs they find him more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hereafter than they deſerve; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Inquiries in Parliament, it
may reaſonably be expected to be one,
to know who they are that preſume to
take the Liberty of Printing Lords and
Commons Proceedings and Speeches in
Parliament, without their Lycenſe; which
(if true) muſt be given out by ſome of
their own Members; but are moſt likely
to be falſe, becauſe they are writ by ſuch
Clandeſtine Scriblers as are ſuppoſed to
write for bread.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other reflections, the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
endeavour to raiſe a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of guilt againſt the Duke, upon the
abſconding of his <hi>Valet de Chambre, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Robart,</hi> (who I remember waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord <hi>Willughby,</hi> when we were at
<hi>York</hi>) and they would inſinuate, as if he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97640:6"/>
could diſcover ſomething againſt his
Grace: But this does ſeem ſtranger than
the reſt, to believe that if he could ſay
any thing againſt the Duke, his Grace
hath not better means and opportunity, if
he had pleaſed, to ſecure his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's
Teſtimony to be for his Maſter's
Intereſt, than any body elſe could have
to make him ſwear againſt his Maſter for
nothing; unleſs they have a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a Stranger's Conſcience, (who is
ſaid to be a <hi>Swiſs</hi>) than of an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's;</hi>
ſo that this pretence is lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as frivolous; and ſome ſuſpect whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Lords Enemies may not rather
have prevailed with him to withdraw,
becauſe his abſence ſerves them both to
create a ſuſpicion and delay; whereas it
is next to an impoſſibility that his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
can be prejudicial to the Duke;
for if he can ſay nothing againſt his
Grace, it would be to his advantage; and
ſuppoſing that he could, I will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
for my Country-mens ſakes, that a
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Swiſs</hi> Servant has a more nice
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97640:7"/>
and ſqueamiſh Conſcience for Truth, than
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one; and I dare appeal to ſuch
Servants themſelves, how many of them
would be Proof againſt a good Reward
from their Maſter, to ſtretch a little for
him, (eſpecially when they ſhould have
nothing on the other ſide for betraying
him) it being in truth, no better than
treachery in a Servant to ſwear againſt
his Maſter, in a caſe where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treaſon nor Felony in it; nor indeed
ſo much as to be call'd a Crime, till the
Parliament thought fit to make it one by
a Law <hi>ex poſt facto;</hi> which may prove a
very dangerous Preſident. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtance of our wonder, how that
which hath been ſo conſtantly Practiſed
in all times paſt, by moſt of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
trading beyond the Seas, <hi>viz.</hi> The
giving Summs of Money at Court for
the procuring and inlarging their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſhould without any notice before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
of its being a Fault, be now called
an High Crime and Miſdemeanor by Act
of Parliament, and under ſuch heavy Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97640:7"/>
as ſome do now ſuffer, without
any benefit of the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> which
ought to be ſo Sacred to us; when in all
probability the Puniſhment would not have
been made greater for the trangreſſion of
ſuch a Law, if it had been a known
Law before, and had been wilfully bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo greatly obſervable, That thoſe
Libellers who have ſhew'd they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing which they could hope would
any way blemiſh the Duke, have not ſaid
one Syllable of any Proof made of that
matter, with which they would charge
him, but tells us of Contracts and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
betwixt one Sir <hi>Bazil Firebraſs,</hi>
and one Mr. <hi>Charles Bates,</hi> about thoſe
Guinea's which are before mentioned, and
brings it to the Duke, only by Sir <hi>Bazil'</hi>'s
pretending that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> ſhould
ſay ſometimes to him, that he could not
treat with Sir <hi>Bazil</hi> without ſpeaking with
his Friend at St <hi>James's;</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſs</hi>
ſaith that <hi>Bates</hi> did once name the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97640:8"/>
Duke, but does not pretend that himſelf
did ever ſpeak with the Duke about any ſuch
Matter; only ſays, that he was ſometimes
brought to the Duke by the ſaid <hi>Bates,</hi> and
that his Grace was kinder to them after the
Money was given to Mr. <hi>Bates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs this is ſuch a way of charging
Men with Crimes, as I hope we of leſſer
Rank ſhall never be made liable to; and
Sir <hi>Bazil</hi>'s part in it is, what does agree
with the Character he hath in many other
things, if the Stories be true which are
related of him in all places where his Name
is mentioned; for although in this Matter
about the Duke, all he is able to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
but to raiſe a Suſpicion by Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,
(if all his Depoſitions were true;) yet
he is willing rather to expoſe his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
(which perhaps he thought was
to venture nothing) than not endeavour
to blemiſh the Duke's as much as he could;
and ſince no apparent advantage could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew
to him for doing ſo, it muſt certainly
have been either a conſiderable Reward,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97640:8"/>
or ſome other Deſign beyond his own,
which muſt have tempted him to make any
mention at all of Moneys, which (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Pamphlets) related not to any
of the Summs with which the ſaid Sir <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil</hi>
is charged, and much leſs to have
brought the Duke's Name to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, both the Matter and Manner
of making ſuch Reflections againſt the
Duke, as they have done by theſe Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
are ſo far from harming the Duke,
or wounding his Reputation in theſe Parts,
that the Authors of them are lookt upon
as Men who are Malicious, and Enemies
to the Government, as much as to the
Duke; for unleſs he had been guilty of
the breach of ſome known Law, he has
deſerved too much from this Government,
to have been traduced under it as a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in Print; when, if Gratitude can be
due from a Nation to a Subject, I am ſure
he may expect it with an unqueſtionable
Claim to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97640:9"/>
Upon the whole (as I have ſaid) we are
very deſirous to know what the meaning
of all this can be, and from what Spring it
ariſes; ſince it is certain, that the King can
no more approve it, than we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
why ſuch diſcouragements ſhould be
put upon ſuch an Uſeful and Experienc'd
Miniſter, at a Time when the Kingdom
hath more than ordinary need of ſuch to
preſerve it.</p>
                  <p>I deſire therefore, that you will favour
me with what Information you can in theſe
Matters, which will be a great Satisfaction
to many beſides my ſelf, and will infinitely
oblige,</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have Received yours, and have ſeen
Letters from divers other Gentlemen
in the Country, who do wonder no
leſs than you, at the Proſecution
which hath been againſt the Duke of
<hi>Leeds:</hi> For his Services to this King and
Nation have been ſo publick, that it was
rather to be expected, that he would have
been ſupported by this Government, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had broken ſome Law, (if the
Caſe had not been very Criminal) than that
we ſhould have ſeen an Accuſation brought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97640:11"/>
againſt him, for a Matter which (as you
have obſerved) was to be made a Crime
after it was committed (if the Fact had
been true,) and without any Proof appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt him, and upon ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as, when conſidered, muſt add to
the admiration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In regard of his Accuſer Sir <hi>Bazil
Firebraſs</hi> his Credit, which needs very good
concurring Teſtimony, to ſupport it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the meaneſt Man in the Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is no other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt the Duke but himſelf; and
what he ſays, is only by Diſcourſes with
another Man, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bates,</hi> who depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
poſitively, that the Duke refuſed the
Money when it was offer'd him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sir <hi>Bazil</hi> confeſſes, that Mr. <hi>Bates</hi>
told him, the Money was all for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Sir <hi>Bazil</hi> depoſeth, that he
could not tell who this Money was deſigned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97640:11"/>
for, or what Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> did with it; for he
ſays, Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> would not deal on ſuch
Terms as the telling of Names.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Sir <hi>Bazil</hi> depoſeth, that he knew
not of any Money or Stock given to any
Perſon whatever, for procuring a Charter
to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To put the Truth of all his
Depoſitions out of queſtion, he hath Sworn,
that Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> brought him the Condition
of a Contract about this Money, which
was drawn with theſe words, <hi>In caſe the
Lord Preſident did not aſſiſt the Company,</hi> &amp;c.
And that he, Sir <hi>Bazil,</hi> took care to ſtrike
the Lord Preſident's Name out of the ſaid
Contract: Now let this be reconciled, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to that Lord's Prudence, or to Sir <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil</hi>'s
Honeſty, (who had Sworn that Mr.
<hi>Bates</hi> would not tell Names) or to his
Care (as he pretends) of the Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
if any body be able to do the
Knight that Service: But he needs no more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97640:12"/>
than his own Depoſitions, as aforeſaid, to
contradict himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Pamphlet indeed is ſo juſt in that,
as to ſhew that his ſwearing to that Article,
of not knowing of any Money given (as
aforeſaid) was on the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> and the
mentioning of the Guinea's to Mr. <hi>Bates</hi>
was not till the 25th, and the chief Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the Duke were not made till the
26th, (whereof I ſhall take notice by and
by) but to inform you from whence this
Proſecution ariſes Originally againſt the
Duke, is too nice a point for me to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with, if I could.</p>
                  <p>Thus much only is certain, That it was
a matter concerted before the ſitting of the
Parliament, (for I have reaſon to believe the
Duke ſpoke of it himſelf before that time)
that it was purſued with great warmth by
ſome particular Perſons, and there was no
proſecution of ſome who were named with
greater grounds of ſuſpicion about the
ſame matter. That much time was ſpent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97640:12"/>
in theſe Inquiries, to the very great delay
of the King's Supplies; and at laſt it was
brought to no Tryal of the Duke, for that
reaſon only which you have obſerved, of
his <hi>Valet de Chambre, Robart,</hi> being out of
the way.</p>
                  <p>You have remarked ſo much concerning
that Servant's abſenting himſelf, that I have
only two particulars more to inform you
of that matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
was made to the King by the Houſe
of Lords, for a Proclamation to apprehend
the ſaid <hi>Robart;</hi> it was moved in that Houſe,
and agreed to by the Houſe, that there
ſhould be a Clauſe in the ſaid Proclamation
to incourage the ſaid <hi>Robart</hi> to come in,
without danger of his being Impriſoned;
which was done upon the Duke's informing
the Houſe, that <hi>Robart</hi> had writ a Letter
to his Chaplain, wherein he had declared
that he was fled only for fear of being put
into Priſon, having heard before he went
away of ſo many being ſent to the Tower,
who were Witneſſes in that Affair, and that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97640:13"/>
Meſſengers had been ſent to take him; and
being a ſtranger, he could not hope to find
many Friends in this Country to protect
him. And yet this Encouragement for him
to return was never put into the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</p>
                  <p>The other particular is, That in <hi>June</hi> laſt
an Information was carried to the Duke
(by one who I ſuppoſe thought the Duke
was unwilling to have his Servant taken)
that a man had been that day with a Friend
of his, to ask what Reward any man would
get who ſhould apprehend Monſieur <hi>Robart,</hi>
for that he could take him any night about
Eight a Clock; but that he would not do it
for nothing.</p>
                  <p>To which the Informer told the Duke, his
Friend had anſwered, that he had beſt go
and acquaint a Secretary of State with it;
but whether the man did go to a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
or not, the Informer knew not; but
ſaid, that ſome care muſt be taken, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97640:13"/>
                     <hi>Robart</hi> would be certainly apprehended in
a night or two.</p>
                  <p>To this the Duke reply'd, (as I was told
by the Informer himſelf) <hi>I thank you for
the Information, and deſire you will tell the
Man, that if the Secretary will give him
nothing, I will give him an Hundred Pounds,
if he can take him and bring him to a Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of State, or to me at St. </hi>James<hi>'s; </hi>and I
have good Reaſon to believe, that the Duke
would be much gladder to have him here,
than his Enemies would be to ſee him.</p>
                  <p>Another thing which was conſtrued to
proceed from the private Animoſities of
particular Perſons againſt the Duke, and
which carries a ſtrong preſumption of a
contrivance againſt him by thoſe Perſons,
was, That on the 25th of <hi>April,</hi> when the
ſaid <hi>Firebraſs</hi> was in the Cuſtody of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of the Houſe of Lords, and ought
not to have been ſpoke to, but before the
Committee of both Houſes, or with their
permiſſion; he was got out of the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97640:14"/>
of thoſe Meſſengers, and was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a private Lodging, where he was for
ſome hours, without any Meſſenger to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, or knowing where to find him;
and it was after that day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 26th of
<hi>April,</hi> that he made thoſe Depoſitions which
reflect moſt upon the Duke; and (which is
yet more remarkable) they who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
him, as aforeſaid, on the 25th,
informed the Committee on the 26th, that
<hi>Firebraſs</hi> had deſired to ſpeak with them;
but that they would not ſpeak with him in
private, without the leave of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
                  <p>Upon this it is, that I formerly obſerved to
you, that 'till the 25th (which was the day
of their ſpeaking with <hi>Firebraſs</hi> at a private
Lodging) he knew nothing (as the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
relates) of any Money given to any
body; but that day he not only knew of
the 5500 Guinea's given to Mr. <hi>Bates,</hi> but
he made it his own Requeſt to be called in
to the Committee, and for that purpoſe
only, although it related no more to his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97640:14"/>
Account than to yours; and he ſaid not
one word at that time relating to his own
Account, having hopes (as is reported)
that his own Account (which was for
40000 <hi>l.</hi>) ſhould have been buried in the
5500 Guinea's aforeſaid; and then on the
26th, (which was the day that leave was
given to ſpeak privately with <hi>Firebraſs</hi>) he
mentioned Bargains and Contracts, and a
Copy of that Receipt given him by Mr.
<hi>Bates,</hi> out of which he pretended to
have taken that great care (as aforeſaid) to
ſtrike the Lord Preſident's Name.</p>
                  <p>As to the pretended Speeches in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſome of them have certainly been
miſ-repreſented by the Pamphlets; becauſe
in one of them, they make a Member of
the Houſe of Commons to ſay, that the
Duke, when he ſpoke in that Houſe, would
not enter into the particular Facts charged
againſt him, and yet they have Printed his
Speech in that Houſe, (although with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
miſtakes) wherein they own his Grace
to have ſaid, that he never touched any of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97640:15"/>
that Money; which is ſo full a denial of
the main Fact, that no Member who then
heard him, could ſay afterwards that he
would not enter into Particulars, becauſe
it had been abſurd for him to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Particulars, after ſuch a general
denial: And they pretend, another Member
of that Houſe to have ſaid, (but mentions
no Names) that the Law of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, (meaning the Duke) and
broken by him, before any thing be proved
againſt him, or ſhewing wherein the Law
of God is broken, if it had been proved;
and he makes the ſame Member to mention
the Oath of a Privy Councellor, as if he
had broken that alſo; of which Oath, all
the Members of that Houſe are ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that they know it is only an Oath
to conceal the King's Council, and to give
him faithful Council; which every Man
does according to what he thinks to be ſo;
and if the Duke's Council hath not been
faithful to this King, there is no body that
can pretend to it: Beſides, his Grace did
in this Caſe alwaies declare his Opinion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97640:15"/>
publickly, That the taking of ſuch a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,
as that then was againſt the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company, would have been very
unjuſt; and that the breaking of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company would be both the loſs of
that Trade to the Nation, and the giving
it away from <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> to ſtrangers; and
many Thouſands in the Kingdom are
now of the ſame opinion.</p>
                  <p>I have given you a true Account of the
principal Matters of Fact; but the conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
are very various, why an occaſion
hath been taken to give the Duke this
trouble, upon ſo ſmall grounds as theſe ſeem
to be, to every body that conſiders them
throughly; but a little time will make thoſe
Reaſons (whatever they were) appear more
plainly: For in Truth the Parliament was
in ſome meaſure ſurprized with the ſudden
bringing of that buſineſs before them,
which, although concerted by ſome Men
long before, was not brought into Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
till the laſt Week of its Seſſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it had ſate Twenty Four Weeks, and that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97640:16"/>
two thirds of the Members of the Houſe
of Commons were gone into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
believing all the buſineſs of that Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to have been over: For it was the
24th of <hi>April,</hi> when the firſt Examination
of Sir <hi>Bazil Firebraſs</hi> began before the
Committee, and the Impeachment of the
Duke was Voted the 26th, the Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him were carried up to the Lords
the 29th, at Six a Clock at Night; and the
Duke gave in his Anſwer the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was the 30th. The 1ſt of <hi>May</hi>
was <hi>Sunday,</hi> the 2d was ſpent wholly by
the Duke's preſſing to have been T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yed
before the Seſſion had been ended, and the
3d the Parliament was Prorogued; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that there was but ſeven days in the
whole, betwixt the firſt time of examining
the matter concerning the Duke, and the
end of the Seſſion, and the Proceedings
upon him were ſo quick, that the Duke
had no notice of their intent to Impeach
him (although he was at that time in the
Houſe of Lords,) before they had paſt the
Vote of Impeachment, which was too late
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97640:16"/>
to be Revoked when his Grace went down
to the Houſe of Commons. And I have
ſince heard divers of that Houſe ſay, that
if they had heard the Duke before their
Vote paſt, they would not have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſo haſtily.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe you have heard with what
earneſtneſs the Duke on his part preſt
daily to have been brought to Tryal,
inſomuch that he ventured the King's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
in hindring the paſſing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
Bill one whole day, and part of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
within the time of the Seven
days aforeſaid: So that by all this you
will eaſily imagine how little time any
body had to digeſt their thoughts ſo
throughly, as an Affair of that Conſequence
required.</p>
                  <p>I am glad to hear from all hands, that
this matter about the Duke is ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in the Country, where they can
know little, but what the Gazette or Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
relate, which take a far greater Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97640:17"/>
than they uſed to do, ſince the Act
for Printing expired: But in this place,
where things are known better, and more
particularly, the Eſteem of the Duke is
as much as ever amongſt all, but ſuch
as love Monarchy no better than they do
his Grace; and I am certain there is not
any Nobleman whoſe Reputation is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in this City, than the Duke's; his
good Example of Life and ſober Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(Qualities not frequently found amongſt
his Enemies) his great Moderation in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the exactneſs of his Payments
and Dealings with all ſorts of Men (which
is no leſs rare to be met with in this
Age, and eſpecially amongſt many who
talk loudeſt for Property and Liberty)
recommending him to their eſteem in a
very great degree: Beſides, that mark of
his Honour will never be forgot, how
he ſcorned to be tempted with Money,
when a Summ Twenty times greater than
what was now pretended to be given him,
was offered him from <hi>France,</hi> and was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by him; becauſe it was to do what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97640:17"/>
he thought would be prejudicial to his
Country; which is ſuch a Proof of his
being out of the reach of Money to
make him do any diſhonourable or illegal
Act, as no Man but himſelf hath had
the opportunity to give the World; and
it ought to take away the giving credit
to any Charge of that kind againſt
him.</p>
                  <p>It is no new thing, nor at all out of
Practice in our days, to ſee good Men
miſ-repreſented, or bad ones cried up with
the Character of Worthies; but to ſee
ſuch Libellers go unpuniſhed as have da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to put in Print the moſt ſcandalous
and apparent lies againſt the greateſt Men in
the Realm (as are to be ſeen againſt others
as well as this Duke,) is what, I confeſs,
ſeems ſtrange to be ſuffered in any well-govern'd
State.</p>
                  <p>It is well known, that heretofore the
ſame ſort of Men indeavoured to have
blaſted this Duke with the Character of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97640:18"/>
a Betrayer of his Country, even about the
time when he could not be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to do it, by the ſtrongeſt Temptations
which could be offered him: Nay, their
Malice then reached ſo far as to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
him with a pretence of his being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry;</hi>
but as God many times hardens ſuch
Mens hearts, and leaves them to frame
lies according to their own inventions, ſo
they then ſpared not King <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf,
but in their Libels made him to be one of
the Accomplices with this Duke in that vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous
Murther. So far will Men proceed
in their Wickedneſs, when they find it go
unregarded.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, It may be Remarked, that
whilſt ſome Men are accuſed, who have done
the greateſt Services to their Country, and
to the Intereſts of the Proteſtant Religion;
others, who have abandoned, and formally
abjured the Proteſtant Religion, to take up
the Romiſh, and who have ſerved the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of <hi>France</hi> and Popery without diſguiſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97640:18"/>
and in conjunction with Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s, and
<hi>Jeſuit</hi> Privy Councellors, go not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſht,
but have been countenanced, as if
they were the chief Supporters of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Laws, and the others the Betrayers
of them: Such Paradoxes do we meet with
in State Affairs, as well as in School Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies:
But as God has hitherto protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Duke againſt his Enemies, in ſo many
tranſcendant Inſtances of their Malice, ſo
I doubt not but he will continue both to
protect his Perſon, and reward his Merits;
which I am ſure every man ought to pray
for, that wiſhes well to this Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as does daily,</p>
