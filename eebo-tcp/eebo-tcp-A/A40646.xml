            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="5">5 For his life and conversation, it was so blamelesse that therein he starved the malice of all his adversaries, the long teeth of whose spight could finde nothing to feede upon. He is reported not to have suffered <hi>any woman to come in his sight</hi>; not because he was a hater of their sex, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was to deale with dangerous adversaries, he would warily cut off all occasions of suspition; and in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses we may say, that over-much wari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nesse is but even measure and caution, if it be not too much, will be too little.</p>

It took the rise from some extravagant expressions of <hi>Damascene</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi> who endeavouring to shew the reality of Christs presence in the Sacrament, scattered such florishing language to that purpose (flowers, though they cannot feede, may sometimes infect) that though well intending, yet ill interpreted, gave occasion to their unskilfull R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="8">8 There was one <hi>Adelmanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Brixia</hi> schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow with <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who by most loving letters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to be reconciled to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church; he often in his Epistolary addresses intituled <hi>Berengarius</hi> (even when little better than under the Popes curse) <hi>sancte Frater,</hi> holy Brother; and addulced his discourse with all luscious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions unto him. Moreover, he minded him of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell which <hi>Fulbertus</hi> their Master often gave him <hi>in horto,</hi> in the Garden; who suspecting the activity (nick-named by him turbulency) of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> often forwarned him with teare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, not to innovate any thing in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and humbly to submit his judgement to the censure of the Church. Nor were promises of preferment wanting, on condition he would comply with the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; who, on the revocation of his opinion, might easily have turned his Arch-deaconry into a Bishopricke. But all was in vaine, he still persisted loyall to his first principles, and no golden promises could bribe his judgement against his conscience.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Here it is no part of our imployment, much lesse of our purpose to be advocate for all the fauls of <hi>Berengarius.</hi> It being madnesse in any man, who is unable to pay the score of his owne faults, utterly to breake himselfe by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing surety for the offences of others.

            <p n="10">10 First, that he was a man, and so subject to errour: And therefore he is no man who will not afford him a pardon of course, for those failings proceeding from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infirmity. Secondly, that he lived in a darke age; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108343:10"/>
therefore was more obnoxious to stumble. So that we need not condemne him that his errours were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, <hi>Berengarius</hi> was vexed with oposition, which makes men reele into violence, and no reason it is, that the constant temper of his soule, should be guessed from som ague-fits (as I may terme them) of his passion, and that his positive opinion should be stated from his polemicall heate, when he was chafed in disputation. Lastly, to render him whilest living, and his memory when dead more odious, his Adversaries have fastened many false accusations upon him.</p>

            <p n="13">13 But having got out of the reach of his enemies pawes he reassumed his Tenents again, remitting nothing of his former zeale, but rather asserting them with more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and vehemency then before.

            <p n="14">14 After his second Recantation, we find little of the manner of his demeanour unto the day of his death.

            <p>THE faire fruit of effects, is vertually couched in the small seeds of their causes.</p>

            <p n="2">2 It would have given much satisfaction to the reader, and more to our selves, could we present him with exact Particulars of <hi>Huss</hi> his birth and extraction. But alas we are so far from having a <hi>starre going before us</hi> to direct us to the place of his nativitie, that we finde not the least candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to guide us to the notice thereof.

               <hi>Prague</hi> we conceive him to be borne, in which University he had his education.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now the learning of that age moved in a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row circle, in Case and Controversiall Divinity. The Schoolmen wanting the wings of the learned tongues, therewith to mount into the meaning of the Scriptures in their originall, onely employed themselves in running round in the beaten path of common questions: whilst such amonst them as were of extraordinary parts, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be confined within, yet unable to exceed the foresaid compasse, let out their soules, and made roome for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of their mindes, by digging deepe into curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, where their best results are either unnecessarie, or certaine, or both. Wherefore <hi>Iohn Huss</hi> declining such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate labyrinthes, betooke himselfe to finde out the right way to heaven describ'd in Gods word.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It happened about this time, that <hi>Richard</hi> the second of <hi>England</hi> married <hi>Anne</hi> sister to <hi>Wencelaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; and although he had no children by her, yet the conversion of <hi>Bohemia</hi> may fitly be stiled the issue of this their mariage. Indeed this Queene <hi>Anne,</hi> taught our English women mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie in riding on Side-saddles; in exchange whereof the English taught the <hi>Bohemians</hi> true religion; first discov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Romish superstitions unto them. For her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers here did light on the bookes of <hi>Iohn Wicklief,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them into their owne Country, where <hi>Huss</hi> had the happinesse to read, approve, and disperse the same. See here the pedegree of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> wherein <hi>Germany</hi> may be counted the Son, <hi>Bohemia</hi> the Father, and <hi>England</hi> the Grand-father.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Huss</hi> hereupon began zealously to preach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the truth, which for the soundnesse thereof was welcome to many, for the novelty to more. But as the Jewes <hi>Acts</hi> 22.22. heard Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108343:15"/>
some Friers lent attentive eares to <hi>Huss</hi> his Sermons, till their profit began to be concerned in his confuting the gainefull errours of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their malice mustred all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against him. First, by order from his holinesse, the Arch-bishop of <hi>Suinco</hi> was commanded to suppresse him; but all in vaine, his commands prevailing no more with <hi>Huss,</hi> than the peoples prohibitions to <hi>Bartimeus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6 Here happined a most remarkable Accident, very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for the propagating of <hi>Husses</hi> doctrine. A Scisme happened in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> betwext three Popes at the same time, so that <hi>Peters</hi> chaire was like to be broken betwixt so many sitting downe together. This conduced much to the benefit of <hi>Huss,</hi> who hereupon took advantage to decline (so good a witt having an usefull Theame, would loose nothing, in handling it) against the Chuch of <hi>Rome</hi>: Pleading that having three, it had no leagall head: That this monstrous apparition of the Man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>im a great doore of utterance,</hi> made out of that cracke or cleft, which now happened in this seasonable schisme at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 It was now high time a generall Councell should be called. The Church was growne fowle with long want of scowring: however the vicious Court of <hi>Rome</hi> declined it (wonder not if theeves be unwilling to heare of an Assises) expecting that there their faults would be discovered and censured. All the world stood on the Tiptoes of Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, what the Councell would produce. Where for a while we leave them with the three Popes tugging one against the other; where all Three at last were deposed and Pope <hi>Martin</hi> substituted in the roome of them.</p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>Huss</hi> during the beginning of this Counsell remained at <hi>Pargue,</hi> constantly preaching in his Church of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Where his adversaries chose out of his bookes and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

severall Articles, which they charged against him for Hereticall. And it may seeme wonderfull, how variously the number of them is rekoned up, some times eight er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, sometimes nine, sometimes one and twenty, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times five and fourty, which numbers the doctors and Masters of the University of <hi>Prague,</hi> collected and objected against him. Yet none need justly admire at this difference, as if <hi>Huss</hi> his opinions were like the stones on <hi>Salsbury plain,</hi> falsely reported that no two can count them alike. The variety ariseth, first because some count onely his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tenets, which were breeders; whilest others count all the yong Frye of Consequences derived from them. Secondly, some were more industrous to seeke, capatious to expound, malicious to deduce far distant Consequences. Excellent at the inflaming of a Reckoning, and to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an infant or Embryo, errours which others over looked. Thirdly, It is possible that in processe of time, <hi>Huss</hi> might delate himselfe in additionall and supplemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall opinions, more than what he maintained at first. His principall accusations were, that he maintained, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be ministred to the peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, That the Popes power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Priests, was onely invented for covetousnesse. Fourthly, That Priests once ordained are not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden preaching &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="14">14 Then the seaven Bishops, who were appointed for that purpose, began to degrade <hi>Huss</hi> of his seaven Orders, and such Vestments as were the badges thereof. The best was, though they uncased him out of his other garments, they could not strip him of the white robe of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Yea, so cruelly did they act their part therein, that they resolved instead of a rasor, with sheares to pare a way a part of his crowne, left (forsooth) any relique of their holy oyle should remaine upon it.

The father of <hi>George Aemilius</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> often hath related) first put him to Schoole, where though the trueth was much darkned by clouds of Popery, yet God preserved still the heads of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme,</hi> the <hi>Elements of the Cistoian Grammer,</hi> some <hi>Psalmes</hi> and formes of prayer.</p>
            <p>At fourteene yeeres of age, he with <hi>Iohn Reineck,</hi> who
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108343:24"/>
proved a man of especiall vertue and authority in those parts, were sent to <hi>Magdeburg</hi>: thence by his Parents he was removed to <hi>Isenak,</hi> where was a Schoole of great fame; There he prefected his Grammer learning, and being of a very quick wit, and by nature fitted for elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, he soone surpassed his School fellowes in copious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of speech and matter, and excelled in expression of his minde both in profe and verse.</p>
            <p>He went to <hi>Erford Anno</hi> 1501. Where he fell upon the crabbed and thorny <hi>Logick</hi> of that age: which he soone attained, as one who by the sagacitie of his wit, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to dive into causes and other places of Arguments then others. Here, out of a desire of better learning, he read over <hi>Cicero, Livy, Virgil,</hi> and other monuments of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient latine Authors.</p>
            <p>When at <hi>Erphord</hi> he was graced with the degree of <hi>Master of Aarts</hi> at twinty yeeres of age, he read, as Professor, <hi>Aristotes Phisicks, Ethicks</hi> and other parts of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his kindred seeing it fit that so worthy indowments of wit and eloquence should be cherishsd for the publque good, by their advise he betooke himselfe to the study of the <hi>Law.</hi> But not long after when he was 21. yeeres old, of a sudden besides the purpose of his parents and kindered (upon an affright from his faithfull mates violent death) he betooke himselfe to the <hi>Augustine Monks Colledge in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phord.</hi> But before he entred the Monastry, he entertained his fellow studients with a cheerefull banquet: and thereupon sent them letters of valedictory; and sending to his parents the Ring &amp; gown of his degree of Master of Arts, unfolded to them the reason of the change of his course of life. It much grieved his parents that so excillent parts should be spent in a life little differing from death. But for a moneths space no man could be admitted to speake with him: running over the Bookes thereof in order, he met with a copie of the <hi>Lanine Bible,</hi> which he never saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; there with admiration he observed that there were moe <hi>Evangelicall</hi> and <hi>Apostolicall Texts</hi> then what were read

Hereupon he spent his time on the Propheticall and Apostolicall writings, the fountaines of all heavenly doctrine, seeking thence to enforme his minde with Gods will, and to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in himselfe the feare of God, and true faith in Christ from true and undoubted grounds. Some sicknesse and feare whet him on to attempt these studyes more earnestly. It is said, that in this Colledge <hi>Luther</hi> in his younger years fell into a most violent disease, in so much that there was no hope of life; and that an ancient Preast came to him, and with these words comforted him; <hi>Sir, Be of good courage for your disease is not mortall; God will raise you up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Works: where both in his Comment on the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and in the book, <hi>Of the Spirit and letter,</hi> he found many evident places, which confirmed this doctrin concerning faith &amp; the comfort which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kindled in his breast. Yet did he not utterly cast of the reading of <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Camaracensis,</hi> writers on the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but was able to recite them by heart in a manner. He spent much time in often reading <hi>Occam,</hi> and esteemed him for acutenesse of wit before <hi>Thomas Acquinas</hi> and <hi>Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This earnest prosecution of his studyes he began at <hi>Erphord</hi>: and spent there five years in the Colledge.</p>
            <p>In the year 1507. he put on the priests hood. The first Masse which he celebrated, was <hi>May</hi> 2. <hi>Domini Cantate.</hi> Then was he 24. years old. In this course he continued 15. years; to the year of our Lord 1527. At that time <hi>Iohn Staupicius,</hi> who endeavoured to promote the University of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> lately begun, desired that the study of Theology

should there flourish, and well knew the wit and learning of <hi>Luther</hi>: and removed him to <hi>Wittenberg, An.</hi> 1508. when he was 26. years old. Here in regard of his daily exercises in the Schools &amp; his Sermons, the eminency of his good parts did more and more shew themselves. And among other learned men, who attentively heard him <hi>Martinus Mellurstad</hi> commonly cal'd <hi>Lux mundi,</hi> the light of the world, often said of <hi>Luther: that there was in him so Noble a straine of wit, that he did verily presage, that he would change the vulger course of Studyes, which at that time was usuall in Schooles, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Wittenberg Luther</hi> first explained <hi>Aristotles Logick</hi> and <hi>Physicks</hi>: yet intermitted not his study of <hi>Divinity.</hi> Three years after, that is <hi>Anno</hi> 1510. he was sent into <hi>Italy</hi> and to <hi>Rome</hi> in the behalfe of his Covent, for the deciding of some controversies among the Monkes. There he saw the Pope and the Popes palace, and the manners of the Roman Clergy. Concerning which he saith; <hi>I was not long at Rome, There I said and heard others say Masse: but in that manner, that so often as I call them to minde, I detest them. For at the <unclear>tabe</unclear> I heard among other matters some Curtisans laugh and boast, and some concerning the bread and wine on the Altar to say: Bread thou art, and bread thou shalt remaine; Wine thou art, and wine thou shalt remaine.</hi> He further addeth, that the Priests celeberated the Masses so hastily and perfunctorily, that he left of saying Masse, before he betook himselfe to the Gospell. And cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>A way with it, a way with it.</hi> In talke with his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar friends he would often rejoyce at this his journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and say; that <hi>he would not for</hi> 1000. <hi>florens have been without it.</hi> After his returne from <hi>Rome, Staupicious</hi> so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising, he was made <hi>Doctor in Divinity,</hi> after the manner of the Schools, and at the charge of Duke <hi>Fredrick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi> For the Prince heard him Preach, and admired the soundnesse of his invention, the strength of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the excellence of the things which he dilivered. Now was <hi>Luther</hi> thirty years old, and had attained a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of Judgement. <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe used to professe, that

He cleared also other points of Ecclesiasticall truth: This beginning made him of great authority, and that much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his demeanor was sutable to his doctrine, so that his speech seemed to come from his heart, not from his lippes onely.

            <p>When <hi>Luther</hi> perceived that the Positions were very well liked of, and entertained as sound and Orthodox; which he at first propounded to be discussed by Disputation, till the Church defined what was to be thought concerning Indulgences; he wrote to <hi>Ierom</hi> Bishop of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> under whose Jurisdiction he was, and submitted what he had written to the Bishops judgement; and intreated him tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Bishop answered <hi>Luther,</hi> and declared <hi>that his desire was, that the setting forth of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about those matters should a little while be deferred: and that he wished that the common talke about Indulgences had never been.

               <hi>Luther,</hi> though most men disswaded him, yet to shew his observance of authority, went (for the most part on foot) to the Colledge of <hi>Hidleberg.</hi> In the Colledge of the <hi>Augustinians,</hi> now cal'd the Colledge of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience,</hi> he disputed about Justification by Faith.</p>

            <p>About the beginning of <hi>October, Luther</hi> came on foot to <hi>Auspurg,</hi> and upon assurance of his safety was admitted to the Cardinals presence. Who admonished him; first, <hi>To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a sound member of the Church, and to recant the errours which he had divulged: secondly, to promise that he would not againe teach his former doctrines: thirdly, that he would abstain from other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which would disturb the Peace of the Church. Here also it was objected to him, that he denyed the Merit of Christ to be a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Indulgences: and that he taught that Faith was necessary for all which should come to the Sacrament. Luther</hi> intreated some time to deliberate thereon: and returned the next day, and in the presence of some witnesses and a Scribe, and four of the Empeours Counsellors, professed, that <hi>he gave the Church of Rome all due observance, and if he had spoken any thing dissenting from the judgement of the Church, he would reverse it: but could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke no errour, being not yet convicted by Scripture of any, and did appeale to the judgement of the Church.</hi> But <hi>Luther</hi> not convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as yet by Scripture, persisted in the truth. Yet at length fearing least the Cardinall should make more use of his power and greatnesse, then Scholarlike disputations, he appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and departed from <hi>Auspurg, October</hi> 20. Because the Cardinal charged him not to com into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, unlesse he would recant.

The day before his death, though he was somewhat weake, yet he dined and supped with his company; and at supper spak of divers matters, and among other passages asked, <hi>Whether in heaven we should know one another</hi>? when the rest desired to heare his judgement thereof. He said, <hi>What befell Adam? he never saw Eve, but was at rest in a deep sleep when God formed her, yet when he awaked and saw her, he asketh not, what she was, nor whence she came; but saith, that she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone. Now how knew he that? He being full of the Holy Ghost, and endued with the knowledge of God, thus spake. After the same manner we also shall be in the other life renewed by Christ; and shall know our parents, our wives and children, and all about us, much more perfectly, then</hi> Adam <hi>knew</hi> Eve <hi>at her bringing to him.</hi>

            <p>After supper, when he went aside to pray, as was his custome, the paine in his breast began to increase: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the advise of some there present, he tooke a little <hi>Vnicornes</hi> horne in wine: and after that slept quietly an houre or two on a pallat neer the fire. When he awaked, he betooke himselfe to his chamber, went to bed, &amp; bidding his friends good nght, admonished them, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108343:35"/>
               <hi>to pray God for the propagation of the Gospell; because the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of</hi> Trent <hi>and the Pope would attempt wonderfull devises against it.</hi> Having thus said, after a little silence he fell a sleep: But was awaked by the violence of his disease after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Then complained he againe of the narrownesse of his breast, and perceiving that his life was at an end, he thus implored Gods mercy, and said.</p>

            </head>
            <p>In the yeer of our Lord God one thousand four hundred eighty and seven, <hi>Huldericus Zuinglius</hi> the Angel of the Church at <hi>Tigurum,</hi> was borne, and on the first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in a little village which in the language of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> is called Wild-house: he was descended from pious, vertuous and Religious Parents; his Father also being a man advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto great dignity and authority, amongst the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> in regard of his approved and well deserving parts.</p>
            <p>He by daily observation, (without doubt to his great comfort) seeing and perceiving more then an ordinary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlinesse in his Sonne; and beholding a future worth to discover it selfe, even from his infancy and cradle: not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108343:52"/>
onely for the advancement of the glory of God, but also for the benefit and profit, of his native soyle and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, (therein conferring a more charitable and friendly censure on him, then that School-master on <hi>Thenistocles</hi>) and causing others also to make triall of his ingenious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, who beheld his naturall parts with astonishment and admiration: he was very carefull to perfect nature by Art, &amp; for that cause (his age condescending thereunto) he committed him unto the tuition of a certain School-master, living not far from the place of his birth to be instructed &amp; trained up in the elements &amp; grounds of the Latin tongue: with whom in short time, by reason of the vigilancy and watchfulnesse of the one, and the carefulnesse and industry of the other, he attained not without great applease to that discretion and judgement, that he esteemed those things which were read unto him, as a subject fitter and more convenient for duller braines, then for his quick and ready apprehension.</p>
            <p>This proceeding therefore not answering his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he removed thence and being not yet fully ten yeeres old, he was sent unto <hi>Basil</hi> a City in Germany situate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> where he obtained for his Tutor <hi>Gregorius Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>His Father being joyfull with this approbation of his Master, and also fearfull least these springing vertues should suffer an Eclipse by the interposition of that odious vice of Idlenesse, he forthwith sent him unto <hi>Berna,</hi> a famou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> forthwith addicted himselfe (being guided thereunto by the spirit of God) unto the study of Schoole.

               </gap>use he well understood, that he could have no sound judgement concerning the Scriptures, nor concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the writings of pious and learned men, unlesse that he were wel skild in the tongues; he forthwith betook himself to the study of the Greek tongue, wherin in short time he so well profited, that the Greek seemed more easier unto him then the Latin, and he better able to judge of a Greek then of a Latin Author; and for the better understanding of the tongue, he used help of the best Lexicons and translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with them translated Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them all to Memory, and other bookes of the New Testament. But when he had found it written in Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that the Scripture was not of private interpretation: he lifted up his eyes to heaven, beseeching the holy Ghost, and earnestly wrestling with him by prayer, that he would be pleased so to illuminate his understanding that he might rightly and truely understand the sense and meaning of the holy Scriptures: so that he might neither decieve himselfe, nor lead away others with a false image of the spirit.</p>
            <p>Having thus in some measure fitted himselfe for the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of sin, &amp; advancing &amp; furthering of the truth; he then first began to condemne the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Pensions, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to overthrow them, and to reduce and bring backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine former sanctity and worship into the Countrey; and hence hatred and reproachfull speeches had and took their beginning against this good, pious and laborious man; who notwiths<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>anding this affront, at the first shewing of himselfe for the glory of God, and that in his owne Country, chearfully proceeded Preaching the Gospel, and endeavouring rather as yet to plant truth in the hearts of his Auditors, and to cause them fully to understand it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to open and to discover unto them the vices and wickednesses of the whore of Babilon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:108343:53"/>Not long after, occasion being offered and <hi>D. Theobaldus Gerolzeggius,</hi> desiring or rather earnestly intreating the sam, he departed from <hi>Glarona,</hi> and went to <hi>Eremus</hi>; there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to continue for a time, but indeed the chiefest cause of his reparing unto that place, was the happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of preaching Christ and his truth unto diverse remote and forreine Nations, being at that time gathered togethered unto that place, from all parts of the world.</p>
            <p>In the meane time it fell out that the Church of <hi>Tigurum,</hi> was destitute of a Curate or Priest; many there were which greatly laboured to bring in <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> he being altogether ignorant of this matter comes to <hi>Tigurum</hi>; where being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, by a certaine Canon who accidentally met him; Whether he could preach the word of the Lord unto those of <hi>Tigurum</hi>: he presently answered, that he could; upon which answer he is called unto the Church of <hi>Tigurum,</hi> not without the great joy of many godly minded persons: and that which he promised, he began with happy successe to performe, (the Lord being with him and giving a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto his labours) in the yeer of grace one thousand five hundred twenty and one: During the time of this happy proceeding of his at <hi>Tigurum,</hi> the Switzers had taken great notice of the name of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> by reason many of his writings which in all places came unto their hands, these he exhorted them to read and to peruse, that so they might perceive the vnity of the spirit drawne out of those holy writings in them both, and so by that meanes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting but that they would be the more willing to consent and to give place unto the truth.</p>
            <p>This is also remarkable in the godly man, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his continued paines in the discharging of his Pastorall office, he omitted not his reading of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultest Greek Authors for the preserving of that knowledg w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had formerly gotten, &amp; not cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus did he cheerefully animate and encourage these his friends to fight for the glory of God, and to give sufficient testification of his zeale towards God: he was himselfe present in Person in two severall Battels fought betwixt them nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Battell was finished without the shedding of blood, concerning which he was often heard to say, that he had seene more malice and more wicked Counsell in it, then he knew all his life time either by experience or from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

            <p>Wherefore being well horsed and compleatly Armed, he followed the <hi>Tigurunes</hi> in the reare, being ready to joyne battell; he went not forth as a Captaine or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Army, but as a good Citizen and faithfull Pastor, who would not forsake his friends in their greatest perill. In this Battell <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was slaine together with three hundred eighty and three of his confaederates; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening on the eleventh day of <hi>Octobrr,</hi> in the yeer of our Lord 1531. after that he had Preached the Gospel of Christ at <hi>Tigurum</hi> the space of 12. yeeres, and at <hi>Glarona</hi> and <hi>Eremus</hi> the space of a 11. yeeres, himselfe being 44. yeeres of age.</p>
            <p>They which were neere unto him when he fell, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even unto death heard him utter these words; <hi>What misfortune is this? Well, they can indeed kill the body, but they cannot kill the soule</hi>: being in this misery he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his enimies, whether he would yeeld unto Papisticall invocation of the Saints; being not able to speake, he refused it apparantly by the motion of his head, and by the lifting up of his eyes to heaven, he gave th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some of his faithfull friends greatly lamenting his death came full of sorrow unto the place where his body was burnt, and lightly moving the ashes, found his heart sound and untouched with the flames; some ascribing it unto the

               <hi>IOhn Colet</hi> was borne in <hi>London,</hi> of honest and wealthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: His Father was twice Lord <hi>Major</hi> of that famous City, to whom, his Mother (a chaste and fruitfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron) brought forth eleven Sonnes, and as many daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: of which numerous off-spring, <hi>Iohn Colet</hi> was the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, and sole Survivor; the rest dyed before their Father, whereby he became Heir to a very considerable fortune: and yet nature to him was no lesse indulgent then fortune, being indowed with all the Simmetry almost imaginable in a tall and comely Person. In his younger yeeres he gave himselfe to the study of <hi>Phylosophy,</hi> and in the seaventh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his <hi>Matriculation</hi> in the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> obtained his degree of

               <hi>Master in Arts,</hi> an honor not so much given to his <hi>Standing,</hi> as due to his knowledge, in the <hi>Liberall Sciences</hi>; in none whereof he was ignorant, in some exquisitly learned. All <hi>Tullies</hi> wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having thus fethered his nest at home, he began to looke abroad, and improve his stock in forreigne Countries: In <hi>France</hi> he added his <hi>Humanity,</hi> what he thought necessary to the study of <hi>Divinity</hi>: which thereafter he effectually prosecuted in <hi>Italie</hi>; amongst the Ancients he was most taken with <hi>Dionysius, Areopagita, Origen,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>: with St. <hi>Augustine</hi> (whether out of Singularity, or judgement) amongst all the Fathers he seemed most disguised: And yet he did not so mancipate himselfe to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but that as occasion served he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times survayed <hi>Aquinas, Scotus,</hi> and other Schoolmen. In a word, he was seene in <hi>both Lawes</hi>; and singularly well read in History, both Civill and Ecclesiasticall. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw that <hi>England</hi> had her owne <hi>Dant's</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarchs</hi> as well as <hi>Italie,</hi> who have perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After his returne from <hi>Italie,</hi> he made choyse to live at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he publickly, but freely without stipend, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him with the degree of <hi>Doctor,</hi> whereof he accepted rather to please the givers, then himselfe. From <hi>Oxford,</hi> and these sacred imployments, he was called to <hi>London</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, who bestowed upon him the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>; of all the Denaries in <hi>England</hi> the highest in the ranke, but not the deepest in the manger: which <hi>Colet</hi> imbraced rather as aburdensome charge, then honor; And therfore as soone as he had regulated his Colledge of <hi>Canons,</hi> and restored it to its antient Discipline, he resolved (which was not Customary in those times) to Preach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Holy-day in the <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> over and above his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons at <hi>Court,</hi> and many other Churches in the City, to one or other whereof, the want of able <hi>Predicants,</hi> invited him almost every Lords-day: In his owne Church he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> not by retale, but whole-sale; run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over, sometimes a whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> sometimes a whole <hi>Gospell</hi>; wheresoever he Preached, he was exceedingly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, both by Courtiers and Citizens. The <hi>Deans</hi> Table, which in former times had been two much prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to excesse and luxury, he reduced to temperance and moderated by his frugality: For he restrained himselfe to one meale a day for many yeeres together, both before and after his preferment; which at one blow c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his travels he was cheerfull, but his chiefe Companion was ever some chiefe Booke: Solecisme he accounted the worst point of Slovenry, affecting neatnesse in his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-stusse, and cloathes, Books, meat, and all things else, magnificence in nothing, much lesse prodigality: Black he loved above all Colours, preferring it farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Purple, which preserved his Doctorall robes the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. His upper garment was alwaies of broad-cloath, and that too none of the finest, which against hard frosts, he fortified with deep Furres; whatsoeuer accrued unto him by the Church, he intirely committed to his steward, to be spent in House-keeping: His owne hereditary rents and profits (which were great, for he was heir to his Father and some of his brethren) he himselfe pursed up, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to pious uses. But perceiving the manifold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions which accompanied the managing of so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an estate, he called in his Fathers debts, and sold his whole Patrimony, which in the totall amounted to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great masse of money: and wherewith he erected and indowed that stately and famous Free-schoole in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard: whereunto he joyned a faire dwelling house Capable of two School-masters, to whom he assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberall Stipends, because they were to teach <hi>gratis.</hi> The whole fabrick he divided into four parts, whereof one is (as it were) for your <hi>Catechumany,</hi> and beareth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Catechizationis</hi>; the second for such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Vsher,</hi> divided from the third part, by a vaile drawen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for Prayer, and other religious exercises: Above the Masters head (if the Reformation have not pulled it downe, and levelled him with his Crosse) standeth the child <hi>Iesus</hi> curiously ingraven, and as it were in the posture of one reading a Lecture, with this Motto, <hi>Ipsum audite</hi>: whom the Children as they entered the Schoole, were wont to salute with a sacred Hymne, composed (if I be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) by <hi>Erasmus</hi>: Every <hi>Form</hi> containeth sixteen, and the Captaine or <hi>Dux</hi> of every <hi>Classe,</hi> sitteth by himselfe in a Pue or Throne somewhat more eminent then the rest; great respect had wont to be had, both to the <hi>Ingine</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> of the Intrants; how matters are now carried, I know not? This is certaine, though the whole amounted to an infinit charge, yet <hi>Colet</hi> would therein admit of no Copartners. An hundred pounds left by a charitable Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, for advancement of the Structure, he bestowed (with the Bishops licence) upon Books, and sacred Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the <hi>Quire</hi>; And yet though he would permit no Lay-man to have a finger in the building, he intrusted no Clergimen with the over-sight of its Revenewes: As all men praised him for this Schoole, so many wondred what he meant to build so magnificent a house for himselfe, within a Curtilage of the <hi>Carthusians,</hi> and so neer the honor of <hi>Richmond.</hi> But to take both the best &amp; the worst together, He was by nature high minded, impatient of inivries, much given to sleep, and (as he confessed, but not <hi>sub Sigillo,</hi> to his best friend) no stranger to the temptations both of lust and Luxury; a great admirer of witty jests, and inclinable enough unto Covetousnesse; Over all which imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, through grace, he became more then conqueror: for his haughtinesse of minde and proud stomake, he levelled even to humility, by the common grounds of reason and Phylosophy: being then best pleased, when he was most freely admonished. Covetousnesse he put to flight, by a charitable profusion of his whole temporall Estate, upon works of mercy &amp; piety: Venery, sleep and Luxury he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly profligated by holy confercences, fasting, praying,

He was no great admirer of <hi>Monks,</hi> not that he hated the Profession, but because he saw the Professors lived not accordingly: wherfore whilst he lived he gave them little, when he dyed, nothing: And yet his intent and purpose was, to end his dayes in a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,</hi> if he could have found one qualified to his minde: This, by many, was censured in him, that although he himselfe lived most chastly, and as <hi>Erasmus</hi> verily beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, dyed a pure Virgin, notwithstanding his naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Contrary, yet he had a very charilable opinion of such Priests and Frier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Priests here, in his time, Officiated once every day, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himself with Sundayes and Holy-daies; it may be to set the greater edge upon his Devotion, which by these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals was the more sharpned, or perhaps to gaine the more time for his private studies, the better to fit himselfe for his Cathedrall or Pulpit imployments. Learning he really loved, and laboured for; onely that <hi>Encuclopedicall</hi> wisdome, which cannot be attained but by knowledge of all Arts, and devouring of all bookes, he esteemed rather a learned sort of madnesse, then any true provocation to Christian simplicity and charity. He deferred much to the <hi>Apostolicall Epistles,</hi> but when he compared them with that sweetnesse, wisdome, and majesty, which is to be found in our <hi>Saviours</hi> owne sayings and Sermons, he thought them saplesse, and scarce to be named the same day; which as one of his <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> I leave to be sensured by the Reader, for both proceede from the same Spirit; Howsoever, omitting the former, the latter he intended to <hi>trichotomize</hi> or reduce unto <hi>Ternaries,</hi> but was prevented by death: Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Service (as much as in him lay) he performed with an equall decency, and magnificence: and was no great approver, either of their zeale, or wisdome, who tyed Priests every day (those wherein they travell, not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to the private repetition of so many and long prayers: which perhaps he knew by experience, they rather mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled over with their lips, then considerately evaporated from their hearts. He willingly and attentively read over many Hereticall bookes, professing he sometimes bettered himselfe more by them, then theirs who without dispute, define what they please, and as they please. He indured not that any man should square his stile by the rules of

               <hi>Grammer,</hi> or <hi>Grammarians,</hi> but by reading and imitating the most approved Authors; which opinion brought its owne punishmeat with it, for though he was eloquent both by nature, and erudition, yet when he set himselfe to write in <hi>Latin,</hi> he often tript, even in things common and obvious to every School-boy: which did so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, that he never set forth any thing: it were to be wished, his modestey had not so much stumbled at this straw; for certainly howsoever his expression had taken the eare, his conceptions could not have disrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the understanding: but in this, as in many things else, he dissented from the common Tenets and practice both of his owne and former times; yet so as his private opinions never troubled the publike peace, his friends were as many, as there were men of learning and Candor in the whole kingdome. His greatest enemies were certaine illiterate and irregular Friers: and amongst these his own Bishop, of whose Sophisticall <hi>Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, that in another Sermon he had Preached against worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>jmages</hi>: and thirdly, that in the same Sermon, he seem'd to tap those, who Preached out of their note books; which the Bishop took to himselfe, for at that time he was aged eighty; and forced by this help to piece out a Seni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concluding, that it was better for Christians, to imitate in their warfare, their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lord and <hi>Saviour,</hi> then either <hi>Caesars</hi> or <hi>Alexanders.</hi> At this Sermon (amongst others) were present the Bishop and two Friers Minorites, whereof the one was the chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary to the warre, for which his ghostly counsell, he was soone after rewarded with a Bishopricke; the other, an obstreperous &amp; stentorian whorson, who in all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (which in all were not many) was sure to have a fling at Poets and poetry: intending thereby to mump <hi>Colet,</hi> who though he had skill in musicke, yet never wrote a <hi>verse</hi> in his life: But so ignorant was the vulgar of that frye, in those dayes, that they knew not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in the Carthusian gardens at <hi>Greenwitch,</hi> he gave his Majesty such satisfaction, that when most men gave him for lost, he never parted from the King, more loaded with promises, both of protection and preferment: who

            <p>Some of his Physitians judged him far gone in an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropsie, but upon his imbowelling, there appeared no such thing to the Anatomists, onely the extremities of his liver seemed (as it were) bearded with certaine rough and curl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed strings or pendants: he lyeth buried in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> upon the south side of the Quire; a place designed by himselfe; and almost in the eye of all who passe that way.</p>

            <p>IN the yeere of our Lord God 1482. this worthy instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of advancing the truth of Christ <hi>Iohannes Oecolom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius</hi> was borne at <hi>Weinsperge,</hi> a towne scituated in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>; which yeere also was remarkable for the birth of <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Spalatinus,</hi> who afterwards proved a faithfull and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Minister in the Church of God; being sometimes Chaplaine unto the Duke of <hi>Saxonie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Parents were greatly esteemed amongst their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for their vertuous and civill demeanour, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with a sufficient competency of outward necessaries, both for the supporting of themselves and also for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of such Children as it pleased the Lord to blesse
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108343:63"/>
them with, and with a great number of these they were for a time beautified; but it pleased God to take againe those which he had given during the life of these Parents; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them onely this <hi>Oecolompadius,</hi> unto whom he had granted a longer life for the good and benefit of his Church.</p>
            <p>Both of them beholding the ingenious disposition of the childe, and finding him to be capable of Learning, they carefully sent him to be instructed and brought up in the rudiment of Learning; his Father intending that after he had attained unto some knowledge and perfection, to place him with a Merchant, supposing that course of life to be the most fittest for him; but his Mother being acquainted with this resolution of her Husbands; and finding it not suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her owne will, she never ceased from intreating him to desist from his intent, untill such time as she obtained of him, that he should continue longer in the Schooles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which there appeared in him a naturall inclination; the Lord beginning even in his Infancy to frame his minde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that wherein he afterwards used him as his instrument for the converting of many unto himselfe.</p>
            <p>Not long after, his Father yeelding unto the request of his Mother, who was as carefull of <hi>Oecolompadius</hi> as ever <hi>Monica</hi> was of <hi>Augustine,</hi> he sent him unto <hi>Heilbronna,</hi> which place was famous in <hi>Germanie</hi> for an exact training up of Youth in the knowledge of the Latine tongue; where he having remained a few yeeres, he removed him unto <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> an Accademy eminent both for the Arts and tongues; here he attained unto that perfection in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that at the age of 14. yeeres he proceeded with great approbation <hi>Bachiler of Arts.</hi> And unto his proceeding in the knowledge of humaine Learning, he adjoyned a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and civill behaviour, perswading himselfe, <hi>eum, qui proficiat in literis &amp; deficiat in moribus, non proficere sed deficere.</hi> That he which went forward in Learning, without having respect unto an orderly carriage of himselfe, would prove to be retrograde in his motion.</p>

            <p>Here he began to acquaint himselfe with such Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose judgements in points of Controversie were most approved of in that Academie, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and others; these he prosecuted with an indefatigable labour, studying them day and night, desiring the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of such distinctions which he could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>This intended reformation was againe hindred by <hi>Eccius</hi> and his followers, who taught (1) that the substantiall body and blood of Christ was in the Sacrament of the Altar; (2) that they were truly offered up in the Masse, both for the living and the dead; (3) that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> were to be worshipped as intercessours; (4) that the images of <hi>Iesus</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> were not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished; (5) that after this life there was a Purgatory.</p>
            <p>These positions were vehemently opposed by <hi>Oecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> at the publicke dispu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108343:67"/>
for an effectuall performance of the same, yet <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> wrought so with the Saints, that liberty of conscience was granted unto the Citizens as touching religion.</p>
            <p>In the yeer following there was a disputation held at <hi>Berne,</hi> which continued for the space of twenty dayes, wherein <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> labored so powerfully for a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his acts there recorded give a sufficient testimony thereof, unto the world.</p>

            </p>
            <p>After the painfull sustaining of so many labours, at home and abroad, he returned to <hi>Basil,</hi> where he spent the residue of his life in Preaching, reading, writing, setting forth of books, visiting the sicke, and having also a care of the adjacent Churches, untill the yeer 1531. wherein it pleased God to visit him with sicknesse, wherewith he was constrained to take his bed, hourely exspecting death. And forthwith sending for the Pastors of the same place, he welcommed them with ashort &amp; pithy oration, wherein he exhorted them to remaine constant and firme in the purity of the doctrine which they professed, because it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto the word of God: as for other things he willed them to be lesse carefull, assuring them that the Al-sufficient God would care for them, and that he would not be wanting unto his Church.</p>
            <p>His Children standing before him, he tooke them by their right hands, and afterwards gently stroking their heads, he advised them to love God, who would be unto them in the place of a Father.</p>
            <p>A little before his death one of his intimate friends comming unto him, he asked him what newes? he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, none. But said he I will till thee newes, being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

by the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to be burned, and so being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over unto the Mayor and Sheriffes of <hi>London,</hi> the forth day of <hi>Iuly</hi> he was by them carryed into <hi>Smithfield</hi> to be burned; when he was tyed to the stake, he shewed much constancy and courage, for when as the fire and faggots were put unto him, he willingly embraced the same, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declaring with what uprightnesse of minde he suffered those torments for Christs and the truths sake, whereof that day he gave with his blood a perfect and firme testimony; The winde drove away the flame from him, unto his fellow Martyr <hi>Andrew Hewet,</hi> who was burned with him, which made his death the longer, and his paines the greater; But God assisted him with such strength, and fortifyed his soule with such patience, that he seemed rather to rejoyce for his fellow, then to be carefull for himselfe, as if he had felt no paine in that long torment.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more very observable concerning this constant Martyr <hi>Iohn Frith,</hi> that whereas the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> sent two of his servants to fetch him to <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> there to be examined, they were so convinced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pon the way, with his learned &amp; pious discourses, sweet and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carriage, that they contrived betwixt themselves how to let him escape; and at the length one of them delivered himselfe unto him, in this manner, saying, Master <hi>Frith,</hi> the journey which I have taken in hand to bring you to <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as a Sheep to the slaughter, so grieveth me, that I am over-whelmed with care and sorrow; neither regard I what hazard I undergoe, so that I may deliver you out of the Lions mouth. And then made knowne unto him how that they had plotted betwixt themselves to let him escape: to whom <hi>Frith</hi> answered with a smiling countenance, Doe you thinke that I am affraid to deliver my opinion unto the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> in a manifest truth? the Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, I marvell that you were so williug to flye the Realme before you were taken, and now so unwilling to save your selfe. Master <hi>Frith</hi> answered, before I was attached I would fain have enjoyed my liberty for the benefit of the Church
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108343:69"/>
of God; but now being taken by the higher power, and by the providence of almighty God delivered into the hands of the Bishops, to give testimony to that religion and doctrine, which under paine of damnation I am bound to maintaine &amp; defend; if I should now start aside, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, I should run from my God, and from the testimony of the Word, and should be worthy of a thousand Hells; therfore I beseech you to bring me where I was apponted to be brought, or else I will goe thither all alone.</p>

Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Wolsey</hi> at that time being in great authority, and well knowing that the pride and hypocrisie of the Clergie could not long continue against the word of God, if once the light of the Gospel should open the eyes of men, he therefore caused <hi>Bilney</hi> to be apprehended, and cast into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; And on the 25. day of <hi>November</hi> 1537. Master <hi>Bilney</hi> was brought before the said <hi>Cardinall</hi> and many other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there examined whether he had not taught unto the people, the opinions of <hi>Luther,</hi> or of any other condemned by the Church; <hi>Bilney</hi> answered that wittingly he had not taught any thing contrary to the <hi>Catholique Church.</hi> Hereupon he was delivered over to the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> to be further examined: being brought before him, he exhorted him to abjure and recant; <hi>Bilney</hi> answered, that he would stand to his conscience saying, <hi>fiat justicia, et judicium in nomine domini.</hi> Then said the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> with the consent of the rest, read part of the sentance against Master <hi>Bilney</hi> but respites the rest of it untill the morrow, to see if he would recant; then he was brought before them againe, but still he refuseth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: yet at the last, through infirmity, rather then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, he recanteth the seventh day of <hi>December</hi> 1527.</p>
            <p>After which abjuration made, he went againe to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> but he had such conflicts within himselfe upon the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108343:70"/>
consideration of what he had done, that he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with sorrow, and was neere the point of utter dispaire, so that his friends were afraid to let him be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but continued with him day and night, striving to administer some comfort unto him; But he was in such an agonie for the space of a whole yeer after, that he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no comfort, yet at the length, having bin throughly humbled for his sinne, through the goodnesse of God he came unto some quiet in conscience, being firmely resolved to spend his dearest blood in giving testimony to that truth which before he had renounced. Having thus determined in his minde, he tooke his leave of his friends in <hi>Trenity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> and said that he would goe to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and so should see them no more (alluding to Christs going up to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> before his passion.) And immediatly he departed into <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and there Preached, first privatley in houses, and then openly in the fields, bewailing his former subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and owning that doctrine for truth which before he had abjured, willing all men to be warned by him, and never to trust to their fleshly friends in causes of religion; whereupon he was apprehended, and carryed to prison; while he there remained, Doctor <hi>Call</hi> and Doctor <hi>Stokes,</hi> with many others, were sent to dispute with him, the forme of which, by meanes of <hi>Bilneies</hi> doctrine, was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reclaimed; After many tedious disputes, seeing that by no meanes they could not withdraw Master <hi>Bilney</hi> for truth, he was condemned to be burned.</p>
            <p>The night before his execution, many of his friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted unto him, found him eating hartily with a quiet minde and cheerefull countinance, where upon they said unto him, that they were glad to see him thus to refresh himselfe, being shortly to suffer such painefull <hi>torments</hi>; He answered, <hi>I imitate those, who having a decaying house to dwell in, hold i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108343:71"/>
moment, but the spirit of God would refresh, and coole his <hi>soule</hi> with everlasting comfort; At these words Master <hi>Bilney</hi> put his finger into the <hi>flame</hi> of the <hi>candle</hi> then burning before them, and feeling the heat thereof, said, I finde by experience, and have knowne it long by <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that fire is naturally hot, yet I am perswaded by Gods holy word, and by the experience of some Saints of <hi>God</hi> therein record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in the flame we may feele no heat, and I constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, that however the stubble of this my <hi>body</hi> shall be wasted by the fire, yet my <hi>Soule</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> shalbe purged thereby; and although it may be somewhat painfull for a time, yet joy unspake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble followeth there-upon.</p>
            <p>As he was led forth to the place of execution, one of his freinds spake unto him, and desired him to be constant, and to take his death as patiently as he could; to whom Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Bilney</hi> answered with a quiet and milde countenance; <hi>When the Marriner undertakes a voyage, he is tossed on the billowes of the troubled Seas, yet in the midst of all perils he heareth up his spirit, with this consideration, that ere long he should come unto his quiet Harbour; so saith he, I am now sayling upon the troubled Sea, but ere long my</hi> Ship <hi>shall be in a quiet</hi> Harbour; <hi>and I doubt not, but through the grace of God, I shall endure the</hi> Storme; <hi>only I would entreat you to help me with your prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he went along the streets, he gave much almes to the poore, by the hands of one of his friends. Being come to the Stake, he there openly made a long confession of his faith in an exellent manner, and gave many sweet exhortations to the people; and then earnstly called upon God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and at the end rehearsed the 143. <hi>Psalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then turning to the Officers, he asked them if they were ready, whereupon the fire was kindled; he holding up his hands, and crying sometimes Jesus, sometimes <hi>Credo</hi>: but the winde did blow away the flame from him, which made his paine the longer, yet he patiently endured it; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to call upon God, untill he gave up the ghost.</p>

            <head>The Life and Death of <hi>CRUCIGER,</hi> Who died <hi>Anno Christi 1548.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>GAsper Cruciger</hi> was born at <hi>Lipsich</hi> in <hi>Misnia, Anno</hi> 1504. of religious Parents, who carefully brought him up in the knowledge of God, and in learning. He was melancholy by nature, and of a retired disposition, much in meditation, and of few words: being principled in the Latine, he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Greek, and profited much therein, and so went to the University of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> that having studyed Divinity there, he might be more usefull to the Church: he studyed also the Hebrew tongue, and grew very exquisite therein: from thence was called to govern the School at <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> where he taught with much profit and applause till 1527. and then being called back to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> he preached and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xpounded the Scriptures with so much dexterity, that he was graced with the degree of a Doctor; in that Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he studyed and practised Physick also. He was very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Luther</hi> in his Translation of the Bible. He wrote so swiftly, that he was chosen Scribe at the disputation at <hi>Worms,</hi> and yet withall suggested to <hi>Melancthon</hi> many things for answer to <hi>Eccius</hi> his subtilties, insomuch that <hi>Glanvell</hi> (who supplyed the Enperors room) said of him, That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had a Scribe that was more learned then all the <hi>Pontificians.</hi> He alwayes opposed the Anabaptisticall errors, and was very careful to preserve the Truch from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: he alwayes hated new, and ambiguous expressions, which often caused much troubles in the Church: he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contemplated the foot-steps of God in Nature, saying with <hi>Paul,</hi> That God was so near unto us, that he might be almost felt with our hands. He studyed the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in his later time, and grew so skilfull therein that few excelled him: he was excellent also in the Opticks:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108343:81"/>
but with excessive pains, and incessant studyes night and day, he contracted to himselfe a mortall disease, whereby he wasted away, and yet his intellectuals decayed not: he lay sick for above three moneths, all which time he gave forth cleer &amp; notable demonstrations of his Faith, Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence and Piety: he called up his two young daughters, and caused them to repeate their prayers before him, and then himselfe prayed with great fervency for himselfe: the Church, and those his Orphans, concluding, <hi>Invoco te quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam languida &amp; imbecill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In his sicknesse he intermitted not his studies; for during the same, he turned into Latine <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> books concerning the last words of <hi>David</hi>: he read the Psalms, and other Autors: his ordinary discourse with his friends was about the Principles of Religion; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable government of the Church; Immortality, and our sweet Communion in heaven. Upon the sixth of <hi>November</hi> there was a great <hi>Chasm,</hi> or opening in the heavens, and in some places fire fell to the earth, and flew up into the ayre againe; this <hi>Cruciger</hi> saw, as he lay in his bed in the night, and thereupon much bewayled the great commotions, and dissipations in the Church, which he foresaw by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie: He spent the few dayes which remained in prayer, and repentance, and so quietly ended his dayes <hi>November</hi> 16. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1548. and of his Age 45. Considering the mutabilitie of all earthly things, he used often to say,

            <p>IN the yeer of our Lord God 1504. <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> alias <hi>Buchlin,</hi> was borne in a Town situate in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> not farre from <hi>Bretta,</hi> which in the <hi>Germain</hi> language, is called <hi>Rhein-taberne</hi>; his Father was called by the name of <hi>Peter
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108343:82"/>
Buchlin,</hi> being chiefe Schoole-master of that Towne, his Mother by the name of <hi>Margaretta Iager,</hi> daughter unto <hi>Henricus Iazger</hi> of <hi>Heidelberge</hi>: who was much beloved of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> by reason of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge in the art of War.</p>
            <p>He was first acquainted with the grounds of Leaenrng in the same Towne, and that through the carefulnesse and paines of his Father, which indeed seemed pleasing unto him, because of the sharpenesse of wit and quicknesse of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension which he saw in the childe; and therefore for the better perfection of his naturall parts (when he had reached unto the age of eleven yeares) he sent him unto <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> and committed him unto the tuition of <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Brentius</hi> and <hi>Martinus Frechtus,</hi> two learned men; by whose meanes he was furnished with an excellent insight in humaine Learning.</p>
            <p>When he had continued with these learned men for the space of seven yeers, and being now eighteene yeers of age, and longing for a greater perfection of learning; he left <hi>Heidelberge</hi> and went unto <hi>Stratsburge</hi>; and because poverty twharted the good will of his Parents, so that they could not afford him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch maintenance as they were willing, he framed himselfe unto the teaching of Youth, during his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in that place; by which meanes he defended himselfe from that miserabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> condition which was likely to ensue, and also furnished himselfe with money for the procuring of such Bookes as he had most use of for his Studies.</p>
            <p>About this time the study and profession of the tongues began to appeare and to shew it selfe in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangus Capito</hi> set forth two Bookes, containing solid instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the obtaining of knowledge in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, a thing worthy of admiration in those times; and there were also some <hi>Iewes,</hi> who wandring up and downe did impart the grounds of that knowledge unto many in <hi>Germanie. Fagius</hi> laying hold upon this opportunity, gave himselfe wholly unto the study of this tongue, and for that cause he happily insinuated himselfe into the familiarity
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108343:83"/>
of <hi>Capito Hedio, Bucer, Zellius,</hi> and other learned Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, who were the first planters of the Church of Christ in those places.</p>
            <p>Having here indifferently furnished himselfe with learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with the knowledge of the tongues, in the yeere 1527. he left <hi>Strasburge,</hi> and betooke himselfe unto <hi>Isna,</hi> a towne in <hi>Algaria,</hi> (being thereunto constrained with his poverty, and also with the small regard that those people had of learned men) where, by the intreaty and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his friends, he underwent the painfull office again of a Schoolemaster; wherein he used such diligence that he gained the love of all that knew him, but finding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe a naturall inclination unto the Ministery, he left his Schoole and returned againe unto <hi>Strasburge,</hi> to furnish himselfe with sufficient knowledge, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that function: here he continued for the space of two yeeres, spending them altogether in the study of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, at the end whereof, he was called from <hi>Ssasburge</hi> by the Senate of <hi>Isna,</hi> to undergoe a Pastorall office in the same towne, which he performed for the space of five yeers, with the great approbation of his Auditors; when he gave himselfe again unto the study of the Holy tongues, wherin in short time he proceeded beyond expectation, so that he was adjudged to be the most absolutest in those dayes; for the attayning unto this perfection he used the helpe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias Livita,</hi> a most learned Jew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Petrus Buflerus</hi> one of the Senators of <hi>Isna</hi> having notice of his perfection in the holy tongue, and of his naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination unto the Arts, at his owne cost and charge he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Printing house; to the end that <hi>Fagius</hi> might pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish som works for the futur good of that Nation, &amp; for the credit and good fame of himself; but the event not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their expectation, <hi>Fagius</hi> came at last, to be deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted unto his friend <hi>Petrus</hi>; whereby he was dishartned, and kept from proceeding any further; which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>Buflerus</hi> he incouraged him againe to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and for that cause he lovingly forgave him all the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108343:83"/>
debt, which amounted unto the summe of one thousand Crownes and more.</p>
            <p>But he finding by experience that <hi>Isna</hi> was not a place for his purpose, he resolved to remove; and opening the same unto the Inhabitants, they seemed unwilling, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they consented: receiving <hi>Iohannes Marbachius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his roome. Before his departure, the towne was greatly afflicted with the Pestilence, and he understanding that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the wealthiest of the Inhabitants intended to forsake the place, without having any respect or care of such as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with that disease, and that the houses of such as were infected, were commanded to be shut up by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate; he openly admonished them, either to continue in the towne, or liberally to bestow their almes before their departure, for the reliefe of such as were sicke: and during the time of the visitation, he himselfe in person would vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>At the same season the Pestilence was hot in <hi>Strasburge,</hi> and with many others, it tooke away <hi>Wolfangus Capito,</hi> by reason whereof he was called by the Senate, and designed to be his successour in the same City, where he continued Preaching untill the beginning of the <hi>Germain</hi> warres; for then <hi>Fredecicus Secundus,</hi> the Prince Elector <hi>Palatnie,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a reformation in those Churches which were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, he called <hi>Fagius</hi> from <hi>Strasburge</hi> unto <hi>Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge,</hi> being then reputed to be a most eloquent and learned man, and constituted him the publicke Professor in the same place; but the Emperour prevailing against the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, &amp; triumphing in <hi>Germany,</hi> that which was begun in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> touching reformation, fell againe to the ground and became extinct: during his residence here, he set forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny books, but more especially such as he adjudged would be most profitable for such as intended to study the Hebrew
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108343:84"/>
tongue; which were so approved of by <hi>Bucer</hi> Martyr, and <hi>Hedio,</hi> then ordinary professors of Divinity, that he was advanced to the reading of a Divinity Lecture on the week dayes, and designed to discharge their Pastorall functions, in case they were restrained either with sicknesse, or any other serious imployments; and in this course he remained for the space of six yeeres.</p>
            <p>At the end of which time, the Church was greatly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Germany,</hi> and banishment was threatned unto such as would not adhaere unto the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the beginning of these troubles, it pleased God to stirre up <hi>Thomas Cranmer,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and Metrapolitan of <hi>England,</hi> to call for him out of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> who together with <hi>Bucer</hi> was honorably entertained by the said Arch-bishop and disposed of, &amp;c. <hi>vide Bucer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He died in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the yeere 1550. and was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably buried in the Church of Saint <hi>Michael</hi>; his bones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Bucers</hi> in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> were diged up and burned, because he was condemned of haeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In his youth he was trained up in the knowledge of the liberall Arts and Sciences in his owne Countrey, wherein he profited beyond expectation, to the great credit of his Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

wrote a forme of Ecclesiasticall reformation, little or no way differing from the opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which worke was approved by the Emperour, and <hi>Bucer</hi> was craftily called by a Magistrate of <hi>Brandenburge</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Auspurge,</hi> to subscribe unto the same worke, perswading him that it was collected out of the most learned writers; but <hi>Bucer</hi> uderstanding the matter fully, told him after a freindly manner, that he could not approve of it, because it savored too much of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither would he be drawne thereunto, although the same party promised to confer large benefits upon him.</p>
            <p>This Booke, by the command of the Emperour, was thrust upon the Reformed Churches, and those who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it were severely punished, either with imprisonment or banishment; and as it happily fell out, the fame of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and hard fortune of his painfull contemporaneans came into <hi>England,</hi> in the reigne of that vertuous Prince of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memory <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, even when a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began to be established in the Church: wherefore <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> perceiving that he would be advantagious in that behalfe, sent over letters unto him, wherein he perswaded him with <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> to come into <hi>England</hi>; assuring them both of kinde entertainment and a sufficient stipend, if it would please them to continue amongst them.</p>

            <p>Within short time after they came hither, they both fell into an irrecoverable sicknesse, by reason of the change of the ayre and dyet; <hi>Fagius</hi> was the first that yeelded his soul into the hands of God; <hi>Bucer</hi> followed shortly after, who before his death prayed unto almighty God, that he would not suffer <hi>England</hi> to fall into those sinnes, which had brought <hi>Germany</hi> unto great misery; and withall, desired that those things which he had written unto the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the discipline of the Church, might take firme foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Kingdome. Master <hi>Iohn Bradford</hi> coming to him in the time of his sicknesse, and telling him that he would remember him in his prayers, being that day to Preach, he uttered these words, <hi>Ne abiicias me Domine in tompore senectutis meae cum defecerit virtus mea</hi>; forsake me not O Lord in the time of my age, and when my strength faileth me. Being admonished in his sicknesse that he should arme himselfe against the assaults of the Divell; he answered, that he had nothing to doe with the Divell, because he was wholly in Christ, and God forbid; God forbid, but that I should have some experience of his heavenly comfort.</p>
            <p>After Sermon <hi>Bradford</hi> came to him againe, and after some words, declared unto him the great feare which the Physitians had to prescribe any thing unto him, by reason of the weaknesse of his body, which he apprehending, with his eyes fixed towards heaven, he uttered these words: <hi>ille, ille regit &amp; moderatar omnia,</hi> he, he it is, that ruleth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth all thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>The Life and Death of <hi>Rowland Tailor,</hi> who dyed <hi>Anno Christi 1555.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>ROwland Tailor</hi> was Doctor in both the Laws, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Hadley</hi> in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> where Master <hi>Thomas Bilney</hi> had formerly been a Preacher of the Word, and in which place there were few either men or women that were not well learned in the holy Scriptures; many having often read over the whole Bible, and could say a great part of <hi>Paul's Epistles</hi> by heart. Here this Doctor <hi>Tailor</hi> Preached constantly on Sabbaths, Holy-dayes, and at other times when he could get the People together. His life also, and conversation was very exemplary, and full of holinesse: he was meek and humble, yet would stoutly rebuke sin in the greatest: to the poore, blinde, lame, sick, bed-rid, or that had many children, he was a father, causing the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners to make good provision for them, besides what of his owne bounty he gave them: he brought up his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the fear of God, and good learning. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> reign, two Popish persons suborned a Priest to come and say Masse in his Church; he being at his study, and hearing the Bell to toul, went to Church, and finding this Priest guarded with drawn swords, in his Popish robes, ready to begin the Masse, he said unto him, <hi>Thou Divell, who made thee so bold to enter into this Church, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and defile it with this abominable Idolatrie; I command thee thou Popish Wolfe in the name of God to avoid hence, and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume thus to poyson Christs flock:</hi> but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But after other discourse, he sent him to the Kings Bench, commanding his Keeper to keep him strictly. In Prison he spent his time in prayer, reading the Scriptures, Preaching to the prisoners, and to others that resorted to him: he was diverse times examined of his Faith, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed a good Confession before his adversaries, for which at last he was condemned to dye: when his sentence was read, he told them that God, the righteous Judge, would require his blood at their hands, and that the proudest of them all should repent their receiving againe of Antichrist, and their tyranny against the flocke of Christ.</p>
            <p>He was sent down to <hi>Hadley</hi> to be burn'd, and all the way as he went, he was very merrie as one that went to a banquet, or Bridall.

But perceiving how usefull and necessary a Hand-maid Humanity is to Divinity, and how short he came of those Tongus and Sciences, without which it was improbable, if not impossible for him, to attaine any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the noblest, and most supereminent of all other Sciences, at which he chiefely aimed: leaving the Temple at <hi>London,</hi> where he usually bestowed some few houres every day in hearing the Reader of the <hi>Common-Law</hi>; he betooke himselfe to the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as neither able nor desirous, to suppresse that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly moved him, to fit himselfe for an able workman in a more spirituall building. After a yeere and some few moneths spent in the University, he attained his degree of Master in Arts, whereunto others are hardly admitted, after long examination, and seven yeeres painfull study: But such was his Carriage, diligence and profeciency, that this favour, though extraordinary and insolent, was

thought well bestowed upon him by the whole Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And least any man may thinke, it was rather (out of Charity) defer'd to his yeeres, then abilities: he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly hereafter, without any interposall of time, chosen Fellow, of <hi>Pembrooke Hall</hi>: which first brought him to the eye, and afterwards to the bosome, of that learned and notable stickler in the reformation, <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> by whom he was again encouraged, and stir'd up to the worke of the <hi>Ministry</hi>; not that he found him stagger in his Resolution, or fall from his principles: but because the greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge he attained, the longer he defered the performance of his promise, as ever thinking himselfe, the more insufficient for so high and laborious a Calling: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one time (amongst many) moved by <hi>Bucer,</hi> to defer the imployment of his Talent no longer, and he pretending (as formerly) his present inability.

            <p>In the first yeere of the Queenes Raigne, and not long after her Coronation, Master <hi>Bourne,</hi> who was shortly thereafter by the favour of <hi>Secretary Bourne,</hi> consecrated Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wels,</hi> made a most invective and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sermon at <hi>Pauls Crosse</hi>: wherein he not onely cast dirt upon his late deceased King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, but vented and maintained many <hi>Popish</hi> tents, contrary to the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Religion then established: which drove the Common People into such a fury &amp; tumult, that neither the reverence of the place, the perswasion of the Bishop, nor the authority and presence of the Lord Major, could stop them from pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him out of the Pulpit; gladly he would have ended his Sermon, (for belike his greatest strength and confidence to lead his auditors hood winkt into their old <hi>Mumpsimus,</hi> lay in his peroration) but perceiving by a drawne dagger, (which amongst other implements) was flung at him, and missed him but very narrowly, that the multitude were in good earnest, and his life in jeoperdy, he turned himselfe about, and perceived Master <hi>Bradford</hi> standing at his backe within the Pulpit; whom he earnestly intreated to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his place, and save his life, by pacifying the People. He no sooner appeared in the others room, but the people joyfully ingeminated with a loud voice, <hi>Bradford Bradford</hi>: and by that time he had a little inlarged himselfe in the point of obedience, the Tumult seemed more then halfe appeased.

whereunto he willingly consented, and when the multitude (for the greater part) were dispersed, under the covert of his owne gowne, he conveighed him into the next house, which was the Scholemasters; effecting that by the <hi>Word,</hi> which the Major could not doe for him by the <hi>Sword</hi>: many were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Howsoever <hi>Bradford,</hi> committed the issue to almighty God, nothing repented his Charity, which he was sure would finde, reward with him, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance soever it found amongst wicked and unthankfull men; yea so far was he from being afraid or sorry for what he had done, that in his afternoones Sermon at <hi>Bow Church,</hi> he sharply reprehended his Auditors, for their forenoones tumultuous Carriage and sedition: And yet such was the malice of the common adversary, and iniquity of the times, that about three dayes after, for this very fact he was sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appeare before the Councell, and by the Lords Committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from whence within few weeks, they removed him to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi>; where (through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After that by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and other select Commissioners, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 22. 1555. The things laid to his charge were principally these: That he was the Author of the tumult at <hi>Bournes</hi> Sermon, because (forsooth) he so readily and dextrously appeased the same: That he presumed to Preach without Licence, though he had been a Divinity Lecturer at <hi>Pauls</hi> two yeeres before that tumult. And that upon his first Committall to the Tower, he had answered the Queens Councell peremptorily and saucily in the point of Religion: As that he was now more then ever confirm'd in the same, as it was reform'd and professed under <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt. The first and last of these Articles he denyed, saving the words last repeated; the second he laboured to justifie, as not requisite from them, by any law at that time in force, when he Preached; in the conclusion, they twitted him in the teeth with Heresie, and accused him of writing from the Tower seditious letters into <hi>Lancaster</hi>: whereto, because they desended not to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, he gave them onely generall answers. The whole conference was larded with an often repealed tender of the Queens Mercy, in case he would confesse his sedition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and abjure his Heresies, and returne to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church after their example. To the first he said, he could not acknowledge himselfe guilty of what he neither Committed, nor intended. To the second, that he never Preached or Patronized any error to his knowledge: being ready to abjure whatsoever he was not able to defend. To the third, that he willingly embraced the Queens Mercy, though he neither needed, not could accept thereof, as they were pleased to Clog it with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions repugnant to the word of God, &amp; the cleer light of his owne Conscience.

After much jangling and a second offer of mercy upon the former Condition, they required a Peremptory &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive accoumpt of his faith, concerning Christs Corporall presence in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> To which he replyed, that dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a yeere and eight moneths imprisonment, they had never prest him with that question, but now, that by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the state of Religion, they had made the Contrary opinion unto theirs, Hereticall, and all Heresie interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and by consequence, Capitall; it is more then Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, what thereby they hunted after. This drove the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> into a long Apologeticall Oration of his owne innocency and notorious lenity in that kind; which ended without expecting what <hi>Bradford</hi> would reply; upon some intelligence from the Kitchin, he adjurend the Court, and went home to dinner. The day following which was the fourth &amp; last of his apparence, he was brought to the same place, and before the same judges; where after many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories and answers concerning the corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Queenes</hi> authority, and other Emergent questions (which if here inserted, would swell the processe of his death to thrice the length of his lif, but may be found at large in the Martirologie) he was finally condemned for worshiping the God of our fathers, after that way which those bloud-suckers called Heresie, excommunicated, and delivered over to the Secular powers, (<hi>Ianuary</hi> 31. 1555.) who first committed him to the <hi>Clinke,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Counter</hi>: where he remained to the first of <hi>Iuly</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; had many hot Disputes &amp; sharp Conflicts. 1. with <hi>Bonner</hi> Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> 2. with Master <hi>Wollerton</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Chaplen. 3. <hi>Percivall Creswell</hi> and Doctor <hi>Harding.</hi> 4.

He was, for his stature, tall but slender: of a faintish sanguine Complexion, his heir and beard auburne, his countenance was full of sweetnesse mix'd with reverence and austerity: He spent the whole time of his inprisonment in reading, Preaching and praying: eating but once every day, and that but sparingly; scarcely ever rising from that meale, wherein his tears did not largly bedew his trencher. He slept not (commonly) above four hours a night, from the time he went to bed, till dead sleep lock'd up his senses, his candle went not out nor his booke out of his hand. Halfe an hour he sent usually after dinner in discourse, (which was all the recreation he used) the rest of his time, in his owne private devotions and studies: His death was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lamented by all who knew, or bus heard of of him; yea many Papists themselves, being convicted with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of his life, or taken with the quicknesse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disty of his answers; but especially considering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the propagation of it; being indowed with as eminent parts as any of them for that purpose, and at length seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up, as did some others of them also, with his blood.</p>
            <p>He was borne in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> as some say, or as others, in the Bishopricke of <hi>Durham,</hi> descended of a worshipfull Family bearing that name, and trained up in the first rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of literature in the Grammer schoole at <hi>New-castle</hi> upon Tine; which towne situate upon that river, which divideth those two Counties, though standing within <hi>Northumberland,</hi> is by a bridge joyned unto the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham</hi>: from the schoole there he was first transplanted into the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi>: and from thence, as it seemes, removed upon some occasions to <hi>Oxford</hi>; for tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those of <hi>Pembrooke Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> among whom he was first placed, could not, it seemes well be without him, or he without them: with whom, if he continued not at first, yet he returned shortly againe to them, whither of his owne accord, or invited by them, doth not appeare. But certaine it is that he was head of that house, and there tooke his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> But there he made no long stay, not finding peradventure what he looked for; but returned againe to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and his former place of aboade.</p>
            <p>Upon his returne, or not long after, especiall notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken of him, as his good parts well deserved, he was called to be Chaplaine unto King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Lincolne</hi>: Concerning which his preferment I find diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent relations; for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fox</hi> in his Martyrologie affirmes that he was by &amp; under King <hi>Henry</hi> promoted to that See; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the forementioned compiler of the Catalogue of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, (who seemes to have followed the authentick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords) referreth both the removall of <hi>Holbeach,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Ridley</hi> his successor to the first of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in the yeere of our lord 1547. However, in that seat he sat not long, for in the third of King <hi>Edward,</hi> upon the deprivation of <hi>Bonner,</hi> that bloudy persecutor of Gods people and butcherer of Christs flock, he was translated to the Bishoprike of <hi>London</hi>: wherein how he bemeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, shall hereafter be related.</p>
            <p>Before these his latter times, having long walked in the dark, he came at length to see better and clearer light, in the points then questioned, especially concerning the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament of Christs body and bloud; first by reading that worthy &amp; (for these times especially) learned works of <hi>Bertram</hi> written long since of that argument; w<hi rend="sup">c•</hi> is to this day such a mote in the Papists eyes, that they know not wel how to handle it, or which way to dispose of it, though they wish it out of the world, not out of their eyes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as appeareth by their long disput about it in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex Expurgatorius: and afterward by conference with <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> two other of Christs champions who confirmed him in the same: and lastly, as himselfe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly calling God to witnesse, seriously protested, upon due enquiry and diligent examination, finding the doctrine he after that maintained to be not onely grounded upon Gods word, but agreeable also to the writings of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers.</p>
            <p>Nor was he lesse zealous &amp; forward in the profession and progatation of the truth and faith of Christ once knowne and embraced, then ever he had been in any erronious or superstitious way before, and carefull by a godly religious course of life to adorn it in himselfe, and commended it to others; for being passing well learned (which his adversaris

            <p>After that they had been detained som space of time there, downe came a Commission for a disputation to be held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the said three prisoners Christs champions, but a part, on the one part, and certaine Doctores and Divines of either University, thereunto designed, on the other part; whereupon they were severed one from another, that they might not have any help either from other; and Bishop <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> was committed to the house of one <hi>Irish</hi> then Major of the City; whence being convented, as the other two also were before certaine Commissioners, he had certaine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles tendred him to subscribe unto, concerning the reall presence of Christs naturall body and bloud, and the utter abolition of the substance of bread and wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eucharist, and concerning the Masse, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it a sacrifice propitiatory for the quick and dead, which refusing to subcrsibe to, and affirming them to be

false, and such as sprung from a soure and bitter rooe, he was willing to deliver in writing his mind of them the night following; and being withall demanded, whither he were willing to dispute of them or no, he made answer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry roundly, that so long as God gave him life, he should have, not his heart onely, but his tongue and his pen to defend his truth: but required, as was meete and equall, to have time and books: Howbeit no further respit could be obtained then to write his mind against the next day, and to prepare for disputation against Tuesday following, it being then Saturday at even: meane space it was told him he should have what books he pleased, but could not be suffered to have any of his owne books or notes: Howbeit notwithstanding all disadvantages, neither few nor small, and the dispute it selfe most partially &amp; tumultuousl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How well and worthily he quieted himselfe in the same, may to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently and unpartially affected appeare by the Acts of it, so much as for clamor and confusion could be taken of it, yet extant. It is no unfiting censure, that a reverend Prelate gives of the three disputants, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very learnedly and gravely, <hi>Ridley</hi> very readily and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutely, <hi>Latimer</hi> merrily and yet solidly, beyond the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his age. Yet if taking somewhat from his sentence concerning either of the other, not as denied unto them, but imparted and applyed unto him, I should say, that he answered very readily &amp; learnedly, acutely and yet solidly, I should neither wrong them at all, and doe him but right; for he was a man of sharp wit, a sound judgement, a strong memory, well versed in Schoole learning; and indeed seemed to have been one of the learnedst of those that then maintained Christs cause against the malicious enemies and oppugners of the maintainers of it, and of it in them.

But they were herein deceived, both he and they being both built upon a firmer and sounder founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then they were able to undermine, much lesse to blow up.</p>
            <p>After this disputation thus had for a shew, that they might seeme to have don somewhat, for the satisfaction of such as had little need of any, save that they would have somewhat to say for themselves, and their owne turning from the truth, and against those that stuck to it, and stood in the defence of it; on the Friday following, together with the other two his copartners therein, he was againe convented before the Commissioners, and upon refusall to recant, being condemned for an heretike, was returned to the Majors house, where he was more strictly kept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained then either of the other two, in the places of their restraint. That which he imputeth most to the wayward and superstitious and disposition of his keepers wife, being a woman as naturally very waspish, so withall extreamely Popish, and perswaded therefore that she pleased God the better, the worse she dealt with such a one as she deemed him to be; her husband otherwise a man mildly disposed, yet durst not doe what he otherwise desired, over-awed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his wife, who ruled him as he the town, or els by authority and charge from the Commissioners; whose power there was so dreadfull, that not one of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity had the courage to repaire to the prisoners even then when accesse was more free.</p>

               </gap> length they excomunicated him with the greater excomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and haveing passed sentance of condemnation against him, turned him over to the Secular power.</p>
            <p>On the fifteenth day of the same moneth he was by <hi>Brookes</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi> assisted by some other degraded, at which time he requested the said Bishop to second his petition to the Queene, that such Tenants as he had made Leases to, while he was possessed of the Bishoprick of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> &amp; his Sister among the rest might quietly enjoy the sam: this he promised to do, acknowledging it to be agreeable to equity and right, but it seemes it could not be obtained; for that cruell bloud-sucker, whose Mother and Sister he had so kindly delt with, thrust his Sister and her Husband, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Law and conscience out of the keeping of a Park, which he had conferred upon them: nor is it likely that the rest fared much better then they did.</p>
            <p>The day following he suffred together with Master <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>: who much strengthned him as by conference before, so at the Stake then. The evening before he suffered he

washed his Beard and his Feete, and bad those at boord that supped with him to his wedding the next day: deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his brother Master <hi>Shipside,</hi> whether he thought his sister his wife could find in her heart to be there; and he answering, that he durst say she would with all her heart, he professed to be thereof very glad.

His brother offred to watch all night with him. But he refused it; telling him, that he intended to go to bead, hoping to sleepe as quietly that night as ever he did in his life.</p>

            <p>His name was given him by his Parents from one <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Milaine</hi> a Martyr, reported to have been slain sometime by the Arrian faction, whose Church stood neere unto their house.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> being the onely son of his Parents that attained to any yeeres, was by them carefully trained up in good literature from a child; his mother her selfe (a prety scholler) reading <hi>Terence</hi> to him in Latin.

The motion was on all hands soon assented unto, but the event answered not their expectation: For by his wise, kind and discreet carryage among them, he gained so much good will and esteeme with them, that they affected him no otherwise then as if he had been a native, and by a solemn embassage made suite to the Principall of the Order, that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> might not be removed againe from them.</p>
            <p>Here to advance both Religion and Learning among them, he procured learned men of great note, to read to the younger sort the tongues, one Latine, and the other Greeke, and a third (which was <hi>Emmanuell Tremellius</hi>) the Hebrew. He himselfe daily read to them some part of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles in Greek, and examined them in the same: to the whole Company before supper he expounded some

               <hi>Psalme</hi>; to which exercise diverse learned of the Nobility and Gentry did also usually resort: and every Lords day he preached publikly to the People: By which his godly labours many attained to much knowledge, as appeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the number of those, who after his departure thence sustained exilement for the truth; among whom that famous <hi>Zanchie</hi> one.</p>
            <p>These his good proceedings his adversaries much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligning held a meeting at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and convented him thither. But he having intellidence of their complotment, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warning by their late dealings with a godly Eremite of the same Order, resolved to decline them, and to betake himselfe to some place of better safety: Having therefore committed to his Deputy the charge of the Monastery, and his Library (his onely wealth) to a trusty friend in <hi>Luca,</hi> to be sent after him into <hi>Germany,</hi> he left the City secretly, and from thence travelled first toward his owne Country to <hi>Pisa</hi>; where meeting with certaine religious Noble men he celebrated together with them in due manner the Lords Supper: and from thence by letters both to Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> and to those of <hi>Luca</hi> he rendred a reason of his depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture from them. After that coming to <hi>Florence,</hi> but making no long stay there, he departed from thence for <hi>Germany,</hi> and passing the <hi>Alpes</hi> came into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> wher he arrived first at <hi>Zurick,</hi> and passing thence to <hi>Basil,</hi> was by <hi>Bucers</hi> procurement called over to <hi>Strasbourge</hi>; where for the sp<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Here he tooke him a wife, one of a religious disposition, and in all respects a meete match for one of his ranke and profession, who lived with him eight yeeres, died in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where she had lived in great repute with the best, for her singular piety, and with the most for he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity corrrespondent thereunto: though after her decease in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, her remaines were inhumanely digged

            </p>
            <p>Thither returning he was received with the greater joy in regard of the dangers he had past and escaped; and was restored to his professors place againe.

            <p>At <hi>Zuricke</hi> with much gratulation was he most lovingly and respectively received by the Magistrates, Ministers, <hi>Bullinger</hi> especially, and the maine body of the people; and notwithstanding an Order before made to the contrary, denying such admittance for some yeeres unto any, enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led instantly for a free Denison.

            <p>IN the year of grace 1497. <hi>Philippus Melancthon</hi> (that vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Watchman for the generall good of the Church) was borne at <hi>Bretta,</hi> a Towne situate in the Lower <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> and onely famous for the birth of so excellent a man. His Parents although they were not endewed with any store of earthly treasures, yet they were rich in grace, both of them being godly, wise, vertuous, grave and honest; his Father attaining to no greater advancement then to be chief Gentleman of Armes unto <hi>Philippus</hi> and <hi>Rupertus,</hi> two <hi>German</hi> Princes.</p>
            <p>In his youth he was committed unto the tuition of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Aungarus,</hi> a man excellently qualified, of whom he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108343:126"/>
learned the Latin tongue, and afterwards instructed in the knowledge of the Greek, by <hi>Georgius Simlerus,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a publicke professor of the Civill Law: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom <hi>Melancthon</hi> used to speak with great rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and respect, both for his eminent gifts, and also for that singular care which he had over him, being a child and delivered unto him to be instructed in the knowledg of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame tongues.</p>
            <p>Being by these two furnished in some measure with the knowledge of those tongues; and being not yet fully twelve yeers old (a sufficient testimony of his future worth) he was sent to the University of <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> where he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Poetry, and proved also in short time an excellent Historian, and he being but a child himselfe, he taught the children of the Grave of <hi>Lionsten,</hi> by which means notice being taken of the excellency of his parts, he was graced in the same University by a generall consent, with the title of Bachilor of Arts: and which is also most remarkable in his youth, here he frequented the Company of those which were observed to be the greatest and best learned men; and especially he used the familiarity of <hi>Spangelus</hi> a Doctor of Divinity, a man learned, discreet and wise; having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued here for the space of three yeers, he went unto <hi>Tubinga</hi> in the yeer 1512. where he became an Auditor unto <hi>Braffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> and <hi>Bebelius,</hi> the lavrell Poets of those parts; and also unto <hi>Iohannes Stoflerus</hi> an excellent Mathematician and professor of those Arts in that <hi>Academie</hi>: and also <hi>Franciscus Stadianus,</hi> then Logick Lecturer, all of them being famous for their excellent endowments; and for the bettering of his understanding in Divinity, and increased of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein, he repaired unto Doctor <hi>Lempus</hi> esteemed the soundest and most judicius in that place, concerning whom he used to say, that he would paint that horrid Monster of Transubstantiation on a table, and present it publickly unto his Auditors, and that he could not but much admire and wonder at the insulsitie and blockishnesse of the man; here he was also an Auditor unto his Master <hi>Simlerus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing

the civill Law, wherein he came unto sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as is made apparent by his writings, and having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto a singular perfection in the Arts and Tongus, he was in this University advanced unto the degree of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Arts or Doctor of Philosophy in the yeer 1513. and in the seventeenth yeer of his age: after this dignity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, he remained four yeers in the <hi>Academie,</hi> where he commented on <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About this time there being great tumults raised in <hi>Saxonie</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, grounded on the doctrine taught by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he was called by the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> (God so dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his providence) unto <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> in the yeer 1518. and in the 22. yeer of his age, and in the tenth yeer of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> residence in the same place, to be a faithfull assistant unto him for the advancing of the Gospell; and in this may that City justly glory, that it hath been blessed with the labours of these two undaunted Champions, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At his departure from <hi>Tubinga,</hi> his Master <hi>Simlerus</hi> said that his going away was to be much lamented of the whole City, and forthwith added, <hi>Quotquot ibi essent docti homines, non esse tam doctos ut intelligerent, quanta esse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> could be found guilty of so much learning as to judge truely of that worth which was to be found in that man.</p>
            <p>Presently after his comming unto <hi>Wittemberge,</hi> he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely began to read his Lctures, where <hi>Luther</hi> being present he received an excellent approbation from him, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his sufficiency &amp; so he proceeded in opening the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the great benefit and instruction of his Auditors.</p>
            <p>In the yeer 1519. he was present at the disputation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twxt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Eccius,</hi> at <hi>Leipsich</hi> where sometimes he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his opinion amongst them concerning the points in

            </p>
            <p>In the year 1520. he expounded the Epistle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Wittemberge</hi>; which worke of his was so well approved by <hi>Luther,</hi> that he caused it to be Printed for the generall benefit of the Church: and in his Preface to the same Booke, he useth these words unto <hi>Melancthon, Ego, quod impii Thomistae suo Thomae mendaciter arrogant,</hi> (viz.) <hi>neminem scripsissi melius in sanctum Paulum, tibi vere tribuo</hi>: What the <hi>Thomists</hi> unjustly ascribed unto their <hi>Thomas (viz.)</hi> that none set forth a sounder Comentary on <hi>Paul</hi>; I attribute it justly unto thee.

            <p>In the year 1527. he was appointed by the Duke of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onie</hi> to visit all the Churches within his Dukedome; in the performance whereof he wanted neither painfull labour nor envious backbiting. And finding in them many disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and corruptions, he prescribed unto them a forme written in the <hi>German</hi> tongue, which he willed them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and to make use of in their Churches. This action of his caused great contention and strife in the Countrey, which by the wisdome and vertue of the same Duke was speedily quieted and taken away.</p>
            <p>In the year 1529. an assembly of Divines was appointed at <hi>Spire,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> was present with <hi>Phillip Melancthon</hi>; who espying his Mother, went unto her, and being demanded by her, What she should beleeve amongst so many different opinions and controversies; he answered that <hi>Pergeret hoc credere quod credidisset, nec pateretur se turbari conflectibus disputationum.</hi> That she should beleeve what she had hitherto beleeved; and withall, willed her not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay to heart, nor to be disquieted with those Scholasticke combats.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:108343:128"/>The Church being about this time in a troublesome state, and so continuing for a season; it pleased the Pope to promise the calling of a generall Councill, for the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of these differences out of the Church, and for the establishing of an Uniforme manner of Doctrine and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: but his intent was onely to make triall how <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> stood affected; for when his Legates requested of him to promise them that he would subscribe to all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Synod then shortly to be called; he denyed their unjust request, and withall telling them, <hi>In concillo &amp; accusationes, &amp; defensiones, &amp; sententias liberas esse ô portêre, &amp; in ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so remaining unmoveable in this resolution, there was no generall Councill called, because it lay not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Emperour to command it, and because the Pope was unwilling to exercise his authority in that kinde, least the event should have proved fatall unto the Apostolicall See. About this time Comets were seen in the ayre for the space of three whole yeeres; concerning which <hi>Melancthon</hi> wrote many learned observations unto his friends.</p>
            <p>In the yeer 1535. the fame of <hi>Melancthon</hi> came into the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; wherefore he was sent for by <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and invited by the King of <hi>France,</hi> to settle a Reformation in their Churches; but he went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to neither of them, in regard the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> would not consent thereunto.</p>
            <p>In the year 1539. there was an Assembly of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Princes at <hi>Francfort ad Menum,</hi> concerning a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Melancthon</hi> was commanded to make his personall appearance; but being fearfull least any should offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence unto his person, he there published a worke, intituled <hi>De Defensione Legitima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1541. an Assembly was appointed at <hi>Wormes,</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:108343:128"/>
where there happened a sharpe Disputation betwixt <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> and <hi>Eccius</hi> touching Originall, sinne but by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Emperour, it was forthwith dissolved, and both of them appointed to meet at <hi>Reinspurge,</hi> where it fell out that <hi>Eccius</hi> in his disputation propounded a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall argument, at the which <hi>Melancthon</hi> pausing a little space for the better untwisting of it, said unto <hi>Eccius,</hi> that the next day he would give him an answer, whereupon <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> presently replyed, that it would be imputed as a great disgrace unto him, to require so long a time, unto which he presently answered. <hi>Mi Doctor non quaero meam gloriam hoc in negotio sed veritatem</hi>: Sir, I seeke not my owne praise in this businesse, but the truth; within short time the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, came to <hi>Reispurge,</hi> appointed certaine learned Persons on both sides for continuation of the conference; of whom in the life of <hi>Bucer,</hi> &amp;c. this Conference gave no satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither unto <hi>Eccius</hi> nor unto the Bishops there present, nor unto <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; and therefore the whol businesse was referred unto the judgement of a generall Councill, and peace was injoyned unto both parties by the strict command of the Emperour, together with a hope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared as touching the Reformation of the Churches.

            <p>His father was called <hi>Antonius Musculus,</hi> who by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was a Cooper, he was religiously given but of a meane estate, his mother was named <hi>Angela Sartoria</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from an honest and well esteemed Parentage, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man endewed with zeale towards religion, with unspotted

Chastity, and also with a singular wisedome; they were bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with two sons <hi>Hammanus</hi> and this <hi>Wolfangus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former was brought up in his Fathers professions, the other appearing more ingenuous, and more fit for learning, he was set apart thereunto, which he prosecuted with such an ardent affection, that even in his tender yeeres, he would exercise himselfe continually in reading or writing, unlesse he were violently withdrawne from, and as it were with rains restrained from those actions.</p>
            <p>Reaching unto that maturity of age, wherein he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fit for more solid studies, his father (furnishing him with some necessaries for the journey) sent him away unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Schooles, wherein according to his owne desire he might attaine unto greater perfection: the reason why he sent him so slenderly furnished, was because he would have him to get his victuals by singing and beging from doore to doore, according to the custome of those times, who used (although rich) to thrust out their sons into the world after that manner, that by that meanes they might joyne patience, temperance and humility with their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fearing that if they should be tenderly and delicatly brought up, they would be more addicted unto, and sooner follow and imbrace Idelnesse and lust, then their studies.</p>
            <p>Being sent away after this manner, he went into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and taking a vew of some certaine towns in that Country, at the length he came unto <hi>Rappers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having continued here a certain space, he shaped his cours unto <hi>Selestadt,</hi> where he addicted himselfe unto the study of

               </gap>d notice being taken of his knowledge therein, and of the ability of his parts, the office of a Preacher was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on him, and he was first designed unto the Church at <hi>Leixheim,</hi> belonging unto the jurisdiction of the Monastery; where his Auditors perceiving his excellent gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>During his continuance in this exercise, many of <hi>Luthers</hi> books were dispersed through <hi>Germany,</hi> some of which were conveyed to him by an intimate friend of his, these he diligently perused and read day and night, and not with

lesse benefit then labour, embracing the purest doctrin that he found therein, with great zeale; and would confer with his Colleagus many times about the same, stifly defending and maintaining that doctrin against their Culumnes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining that aspersion of haeresie, which was by some of them fastned upon him; affirming that although <hi>Luther</hi> as he was a man, might erre in some points, yet he was not therefore to be pronounced an haeretick; neither did he vindicate this in the Monastery onely, but publickly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the same for true and undoubted doctrine unto hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But his desire of propagating the truth, wanted not (by the blessing of God) good successe; for besides many of his Auditors, he converted some of the Monks of the same Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, who afterwards forsooke that Cloyster life, and constantly professed the Gospell of Christ unto their lives end. He also converted many Noble men, and amongst them <hi>Reinhardus</hi> a <hi>Rottenburge</hi> Governour of the Castle at <hi>Lutzelstein,</hi> a man in great favour with the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ince Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these proceedings he wanted not mighty and bitter enemies; for in the Monastery the Senior Monkes (who were deeply rooted in superstition) sharply opposed him, doing him all the mischiefe that they could: as for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemies they were not wanting; for the Bishops and <hi>Ments</hi> and <hi>Strasburge,</hi> had many times surprized him, had he not beene carefully protected by the foresaid Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
            <p>This Governour being willing to make triall of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in the cause of Religion; on a time (during his abode under his protection) came to the Church where he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he desired of them that they would give him leave to finish his Sermon, and then he would go with them whether so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleased; which being granted, he went forward in his Sermon, without making any shew of the least fear: his Sermon being ended, and he supposing that he should dye, he exhorted his Auditors u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to constancy, faith and piety; and withall desired them to poure out their prayers unto God for him, who was then ready to lay down his life for Christ; and so committed them all unto Almighty God (who were wonderfully astonished with this action) he came downe and yeelded himselfe into the hands of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> who expected his coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reinhardus</hi> admiring the undaunted courage of the man, discovered himselfe, and embracing him in his armes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him alwayes to retaine the same constancy, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him sure defence, as long as he continued and resided within his liberties.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Musculus</hi> perceiving danger to increase daily, so that he could not have liberty to make profession of the Gospell in that place, he resolved to forsake the Monastery, and to betake himself unto some place where he might with more freedome and lesse danger professe the same. He acquainted some of the Monkes which were his intimate friends with this resolution; they, by reason of the death of the Prior at that time, desired him to stay, and would willingly have conferred the government of the Monastery on him; but he knowing that that dignity would prove a hinderance unto that which he most aymed at, refused it, and willed them to bestow it on <hi>Brisacius.</hi> Before he departed he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed himselfe unto a Kinswoman of the said <hi>Brisacius</hi>; who also went together with him unto <hi>Strasburge,</hi> in the year 1527. and in the thirtieth year of his age; where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of that Church he was publickly married; the Minister bestowing a Wedding dinner on them in his owne house.</p>
            <p>Here misery began to creepe more and more upon him, partly because of that little money wherewith he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:108343:136"/>
to sustaine both himselfe and his wife; and partly because there was no hope left unto him of getting any thing by Preaching; because many eminent persons were Silenced in the same City. Wherefore for the avoyding of further poverty, his wife turned servant, and he covenanted with a Weaver to doe him service for the space of two Moneths. Which action although that it ministred griefe unto him, yet casting himselfe upon God, he comforted himselfe with this distick:
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Est Deus in coelo, qui providus omnia curat,</l>
                     <l>Credentes nunquam deservisse potest.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>God by his foresight hath such order taken,</l>
                     <l>That true Beléevers cannot be forsaken.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Weaver with whom he had Covenanted was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist, who nourished in his house a teacher of that sect. <hi>Musculus</hi> perceiving his great hypocrisie &amp; idlenesse, would sometimes object unto him those words of <hi>Paul, He that will not worke, let him not ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He agrees with the Master of the Worke, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night he walkes about the wals to view what place might please him best to worke in; which being done, he returned unto his wife, who certified him of better newes; and as God so disposed of a better work, and that was this, that a Messenger was in the house, who willed him to meet the Senate and <hi>Bucer</hi> in the Cathedrall Church. He much admired at the first what this should meane, yet forthwith he went; <hi>Bucer</hi> having notice of him, cals him unto him: he being no sooner come, the Councill commanded him to goe unto the Village called <hi>Dorl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At his first entrance upon this Cure, <hi>Bucer</hi> tooke him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne House, and made use of him for the writing of such things as he intended for the Presse. Afterwards, by the advice of the Ministers of <hi>Strasburge,</hi> he setled himselfe with his wife in the Village. The Inhabitants received him with all courtesie, freely offering him all things necessary for his house. Here he continued Preaching for the space of twelve moneths, receiving not any thing for his paine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Unto his preaching he also added the teaching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This railing act as it was pleasing unto the Monkes and Priests there present, so it grieved <hi>Musculus</hi> to hear the true profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors thus scandalized.

            <p>The Priests and Monkes hearing this, they withdrew themselves out of the Chappell; in comes the Pryor, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts him, and commands him to desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At his comming unto <hi>Auspurge,</hi> he found the Church much troubled and afflicted, not onely by reason of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill attempts and indeavour of the Papists, who never ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extinguish the light of the Gospell; but also by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Anabaptists, who seduced and led away many, whose bouldnesse also advanced it selfe unto that height, that they would come publikly into the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and openly in their Pulpits they would divulge their errours: whereby sedition and tumults were raised in the City, for which many of the Anabaptis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He taught in this City eighteen yeeres, to the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Auditors, in his Sermons he was vehement and powerfull, wonderfully working upon the hearts of the people; he was a sharp reprover of vice; his method which he observed in teaching was exact and easie, which drew the greater concourse of people unto him, for their better instruction and information in the way of truth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here he found <hi>Symones Grinaeus</hi> and <hi>Wolfangus Capito,</hi> who received him with great joy, where he continued and gave himself unto the study of the Hebrew tongu: here he also set forth his Institutions, a laborious &amp; learned worke, and well worthy of the Author, with a Preface most excellent unto the King of <hi>France,</hi> which if he had read, it had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt given a great wound unto the Popish religion: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having set forth this book, and in some sort performed his duty to his Country, he left <hi>Basil</hi> and went into <hi>Italy</hi> to visit the daughter of the King of <hi>France,</hi> a vertuous and a godly Princesse, whom he there confirmed and strenthned in her religiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108343:145"/>
but by the observation of future actions, it is evident that he was guided thither by the hand of God: into this City, not long before his comming, the Gospell of Christ was wonderfully brought, and that by the labour and industry of two famous Divines, <hi>(viz.) Gulielmus Farellus</hi> somtime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Scholer unto <hi>Iacobus Stapulensis,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Viretus,</hi> whose labours were aboundently blessed by the Lord: <hi>Calvin</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for to visit these <hi>Genevan</hi> lights, he was entertained by <hi>Farellus</hi> with a long discourse, and thereby discovering the excellency of his parts, desiring him to remaine at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and to be an ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant to him in that place for the advancing of the truth of Christ: but when he saw that <hi>Calvin</hi> could not easily be drawn and perswaded thereunto, and being a man of a bould spirit, he said unto him after a vehement manner, I pronounce unto thee in the name of the living and alpowerfull God, that unlesse thou joyne with us in this worke of the Lord, it will come to passe, that he will curse thee as one that seeketh more his owne then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> being astonished with this terrible sentence and speech of <hi>Farellus,</hi> he forthwith submitted himselfe unto the pleasure of the Presbytery and Magistrates; by whose voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and consent of the People, he was not onely chosen to be a Preacher, but was also designed to be their Divinity Lecturer, and graced with the title of Doctor, in the year 1536. which year also is remarkeable for that League con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt the Cities of <hi>Brene</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eneva,</hi> touching Divine Worship; and also for the conversion of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Lausanna</hi> unto Christ.</p>
            <p>The first thing which he attempted, after his admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this City, was a more exact reformation in the Church; &amp; for that cause drew a compendium of Christian Religion and forme of Doctrine, unto which he laboured to have the Inhabitants to subscribe, and to binde themselves by an Oath to abjure the supersticious Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to defend the same with their lives. This motion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused by many at the first, yet not long after (God so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing)
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:108343:145"/>
even in the year 1537. the Senate and people of <hi>Geneva,</hi> took their Oathes for the defence of the same.</p>
            <p>The ground being thus laid, there wanted not enemies, and those bitter ones to oppose him in his proceedings; for first the Anabaptists began to sow their erronious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in the hearts of many, to the great detriment of the Church; but these were so confuted by <hi>Calvin</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick disputation appointed by the Senate, that scarcely any one of them appeared afterwards in the City. The other disturber of the peace and happinesse of that Church was, <hi>Petrus Caroli</hi> born at <hi>Sarbona</hi>; who, as she brought him forth an impudent Sophister, so she cast him out againe as a more wicked haeretick: being thence cast out he came to <hi>Geneva,</hi> accompanied w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the spirit of the Divel; when he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be sharply reproved of the Inhabitants, he went unto their en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mies, and from thence he returned unto <hi>Geneva</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, intending to leave behind him some expressions of his worse then diabolicall opinions; and for that cause he first began openly to accuse <hi>Farell, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> of a misconceived opinion concerning the Trinity; wherupon a Synad was called at <hi>Berne,</hi> wherein that calumny of <hi>Petrus Caroli</hi> was condemned.</p>
            <p>But that which strooke the greatest strok for the crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these hopefull beginnings, was the intestine dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and seditions in the City, who would not endure this new forme of Government; these <hi>Farell</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> began first to correct with mild admonitions, and when they saw that would not prevaile they used more severe and sharper reprehensions, which many not brooking, the City came to be divided, and many renounced that Oath which they had formerly made; in respect of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> actions <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Farell,</hi> with an undaunted courage openly protested, that they could not lawfully administer the Sacrament of the Lords Supper unto them, by reason of the disagreements amongst themselves, and by reason of their alienation from all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall discipline.</p>
            <p>There also happened unto this another evill, (<hi>viz.</hi>) a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:108343:146"/>
difference betwixt the Churches of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> about some ceremonies; which because it could not presently be concluded on by the Synod at <hi>Lausanna,</hi> but was referred unto another appointed at <hi>Tigurum</hi>; the Commissioners unpatient of delay, assembled the people together, and perswaded then to command <hi>Farell, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Coraldus</hi> to depart the City within two dayes, because they had refused to administer the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to them; which message when it was delivered unto <hi>Calvin</hi> he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Indeed, if I had served men, I had been evilly rewarded, but now it shall goe well with me, because I have served him who will truely pay unto his servants that which he hath once promised.</p>
            <p>Who could otherwise have thought but that this action would have proved fatall unto the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi>? yet the event manifested the contrary, &amp; shewed that it came to passe by Divine providence, partly because that by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising him with these trials, he might be the more fitter for weightier matters; and partly because he might purge that Church againe from many grosse and wicked errours. When that sedition had overthrown and sunk it selfe with its owne weight; so wonderfully doth the Lord appeare in all his workes, but more especally in the Governing and protection of his Church.</p>
            <p>Some there were who greatly bewailed the departure of these faithfull Pastors, who also inwardly asmuch lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the the miserable and wretched State of that City. From <hi>Geneva</hi> they went unto <hi>Tigurum,</hi> where a Synod was called to effect a reconciliation betwixt the Churches, and those of <hi>Geneva</hi>; being willed by an Embassadour sent from <hi>Berne</hi> to subscribe unto the decrees thereof, they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend thereun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o; whereupon <hi>Calvin</hi> left <hi>Tigurum</hi> and went unto <hi>Basil,</hi> where after that he had remained two or three dayes, he directed his course unto <hi>Strasburge,</hi> where he was called by the Senate, <hi>Bucer, Hedio, Capito,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reverend Pastors, to be the Divinity Lecturer in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he did not only perform with the applause of all
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:108343:146"/>
the learned, but also with the consent of the Senat he plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>French</hi> Church in that City.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Calvin</hi> remained untill the year 1541. in which year a Convocation was enacted by the Emperor at <hi>Wormes</hi> and <hi>Reinspurge,</hi> for the taking away of differences out of those Churches concerning Religion; at which Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Calvin</hi> was present, and unto this Assembly came also the Commissioners before mentioned, who perswaded and prevailed with the Inhabitants of <hi>Geneva</hi> for the casting out of <hi>Calvin</hi> out of the City; upon one of them God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a terrible example of vengeance in the same place; for being censured guilty of sedition, as he was about to save himselfe by escaping through a window, he fell downe headlong, and with the weight of his body he so crushed himselfe, that within few dayes after he dyed. Another of them being found guilty of murther, he had his head stricken off; the other two, by reason of their ill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the affaires of that Commonwealth, were in their absence condemned and ejected by the Citizens.</p>
            <p>During his abode at <hi>Strasburge,</hi> untill this Assembly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Emperour, the Church at <hi>Geneva</hi> was greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with sundry opinions, which were brought into the City in the year 1539. by <hi>Iacobus Sadoletus,</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing tooke no deep rooting, <hi>Calvin</hi> by his letters in his banishment perswaded the contrary.</p>
            <p>These Commissioners being thus taken away, as the fountaines of all sedition in the City, it pleased the Lord to worke a desire in the hearts of the Inhabitants of recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> into the City; but when they saw that they could not possibly recall <hi>Farel</hi> from <hi>Neocum,</hi> they send Embassadours with all speed unto <hi>Strasburge,</hi> making the <hi>Tigurines</hi> also their intercessours for the obtaining of <hi>Calvin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Strasburge</hi> appeared unwilling to grant their desire, and <hi>Calvin</hi> himselfe; because he saw his actions to prosper and to be blessed of God; in that City refused also himselfe to goe unto <hi>Geneva,</hi> fearing least his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:108343:147"/>
proceedings should be again hindered by the like sedicious uproares.</p>
            <p>The Embassadours were urgent, and followed their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o close, that at the last it was concluded that <hi>Calvin</hi> should againe to <hi>Geneva</hi>; but because he was to accompany <hi>Buc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r</hi> unto <hi>Reinspurge,</hi> his journey was deferred for a space, and they of <hi>Geneva</hi> procured <hi>Viret</hi> from <hi>Lausanna</hi> to Preach unto them, untill the returne of <hi>Calvin</hi> from <hi>Reinspurge</hi>; which fell out in the year 1541. where he was received with exceeding joy and gladnesse, not onely by the Senate, but also by all the Inhabitants; and he was again restored unto his Church.</p>
            <p>But at his entrance againe, he told them, that he could not truly discharge his Ministeriall function, unlesse they would also entertain a Presbytery, strengthned with Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall discipline together with his Doctrin: unto which motion they consented; whereupon a Presbytery was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, their Offices were declared unto each of them: and unto this forme of Government they all subscribed.</p>
            <p>The joyfull newes of <hi>Calvins</hi> comming unto <hi>Geneva</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain being spread abroad, it caused many godly minded persons to resort, some out of <hi>Italy,</hi> some out of <hi>England,</hi> some out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> unto the same place to be Auditors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: these increased unto that number, that there wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not roome in the City to entertain them; and <hi>Calvin</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ordering of all things in the City, would be a labour too weighty for him; he de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired that he might have <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Viret</hi> adjoyned unto him; but it could not be granted; for <hi>Viret</hi> was returned againe unto <hi>Lausanna,</hi> and <hi>Farell</hi> was detained at <hi>Neocum</hi>; so as <hi>Calvin</hi> alone carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the glory of that reformed Church.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Bezaes</hi> opinion concerning these three, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Pastor might be composed of them; taking boldnesse from <hi>Farel,</hi> eloquence from <hi>Viret,</hi> and solid substance from <hi>Calvin,</hi> every word appearing a grave sentence.</p>
            <p>In the year 1542. <hi>Calvin</hi> was exercised with many labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious imployments; not onely concerning the affaires of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:108343:147"/>
               <hi>Geneva,</hi> but also about the comforting and relieving of such as were banished their Countrey for the profession of the Gospell, and also by writing consolatory Letters unto them, for their confirmation and strengthning in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their afflictions: unto these also were added; first, a Famine: secondly, a Pestilence, both being predominant at one and the same time in <hi>Geneva.</hi> Now because the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the City was to place such as were infected, in a Pesthouse, for that cause erected without the City; one <hi>Blanchetus</hi> tooke upon him the charge of visiting the sicke; and <hi>Calvin</hi> by the command of the Senate was delivered from that action.</p>
            <p>Then he turned himselfe unto the suppressing of such false Doctrine as crept into the Church for the eclypsing of the truth. And first he confuted that opinion of <hi>Petrus Tossanus,</hi> concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: Then he confuted the Articles set forth at <hi>Sorbon.</hi> He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> concerning Free-will: refuted the opinion of <hi>Sebastianus Castellio,</hi> concerning the Song of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and caused him to be banished the City of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1544. <hi>Carolus</hi> the fith, intending to make War against the <hi>French</hi> King, commanded a peace amongst the Churches in <hi>Germanie,</hi> untill such time as a generall Councell was called, which he promised should shortly be effected, and in the meane time granted unto them liberty of Conscience; which when it came to the eares of <hi>Paulus</hi> III. Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> he sharply reproved the Emperour, saying, That he esteemed of Hereticks as highly as of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and that he seemed to thrust in his sickle into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans harvest. The Emperour answered, That he was perswaded that his act was just.

               </gap>d the boldnesse of the Pope. In this year also there was a Convocation at <hi>Spire</hi>; whereupon <hi>Calvin</hi> tooke occasion of writing his Booke, intituled, <hi>De necessitate reformandae Ecclesiae.</hi> And in the same year also he
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:108343:148"/>
refuted the Anabaptists and Libertines, and that with such invincible arguments, that none reading and observing hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Worke, can (unlesse wittingly and willingly) be deceived and seduced by them. But the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended with that Worke of his against the Libertines, because he had particularly reproved <hi>Quintinus</hi> and <hi>Pocque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> two Ringleaders of that Sect, and not of small account with her Majesty. <hi>Calvin</hi> being informed of this, he so wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and discreetly behaved himselfe, that he gained againe the favour of the Queen; and withall, caused that impious and blasphemous Sect to be banished out of <hi>France,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards seated themselves in <hi>Amsterlodam,</hi> the prime town in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1545. by the conspiracy of some wicked and evilly disposed persons, the thresholds and posts of the doores in <hi>Geneva</hi> were done over with an oyntment so strongly composed of poyson, that whosoever touched it, death imediately followed; and from this also proceeded a raging Pestilence in the City, whereby an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of soules were swept away: this accident procured great envie unto <hi>Calvin</hi> from all places; yet at the last some of the authors of this inhumane act were discovered, and suffered worthy punishment for the same. In this year also he laboured to remove the false opinion of <hi>Osiander</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lords Supper, out of the Church; and also the errours of the <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> and many other grosse opinions which hindred the growth of the truth of Christ. In which proceedings he was abundantly blessed by the Lord, who never permitted his enemies to have their pleasure of him, by taking away his life, which they intended; and more especially he shelterd him from the fury of <hi>Amedenus Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinnus,</hi> a Captaine of great authority in the City, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived for that fact of his Office.</p>
            <p>These continued dissentions and defamations in the Church at <hi>Geneva,</hi> were motives which drew <hi>Farellus</hi> and <hi>Viretus</hi> unto the same place; who in the year 1548. deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before the Senate an eloquent and learned Oration,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:108343:148"/>
concerning the suppression of Sedition, and the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of differences out of the Church. The motion was approved of all, and <hi>Perinnus</hi> having hopes thereby to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againe unto his former preserment, consented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but he soone discovered his wicked intent, for he was no sooner graced with his former dignitie, but he and many others burst forth into reproachfull speeches against <hi>Calvin</hi>; and after a disgracefull manner, calling his Dog by the name of <hi>Calvin</hi>; others stile him by the name of <hi>Cain</hi>; and some by reason of that violent and fierce hatred which they conceived against him, they would absent themselves from the Communion, and so draw downe a double vengeance on themselves.</p>
            <p>In the midst of these evils (which were of force to have caused him to have forsaken the City) he constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Ministeriall office; and at vacant times he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles with learned Commentaries. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so most learnedly laid open and discovered the falsity and vanity fo Judiciary Astrology. He comforted <hi>Beratius</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a banished man at <hi>Basil,</hi> and also <hi>Bucer</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is also remarkable, that notwithstanding the daily increa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing of these contentions, the Church did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully florish in <hi>Geneva</hi>; and also it injoyed some peace and quietnesse. In the year 1551. for then there sprung up a company of factious fellowes, who denied the priviledges of the City unto such as were banished for the truth, and fled to that place for succour: And being perswaded by <hi>Calvin</hi> in a Sermon Preached for that purpose, to grant the priviledges of the City unto them; he was well beaten for his paines as soon as he came out of the Pulpit. These stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up also another Tumult in the Temple of St. <hi>Gervas,</hi> because the Minister refused to Baptize a child by the name of <hi>Balthazar. Calvin</hi> not forgetting his late kindnesse recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was contented with patience to let it passe. In this year the City was also much troubled with that blasphemous heresie of <hi>Servetus</hi>; who by the means of <hi>Calvin</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and convicted; but remaining obstinate in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:108343:149"/>The cause of <hi>Servetus</hi> being as yet in hand, one of the factious company, called <hi>Ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this troublesom state the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> continued unto the yeere 1555. wherein a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was happily discovered, by which meanes most of the factious persons were put to death, and banished the City. By which example of Divine vengeance, others were delivered and kept in awe, and that Common-wealt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:108343:149"/>The same year also yeelded much sorrow unto <hi>Calvin,</hi> in regard that persecution raged in many places, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>England</hi>; which tooke away <hi>Hooper, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Cranmer,</hi> men of incomparable piety; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the propagation of the truth was hindred. There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned also other causes of discontent, as the faction of some neighbouring Pastors, bewitched with the instigation of that <hi>Carmelite Bolsecus,</hi> who bitterly inveighed against him concerning Predestination; whereupon he obtained leave of the Senate to go unto <hi>Berne,</hi> to be censured by the Church concerning that point; in which censures the adversaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found guilty, they were expelled &amp; banished the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and he found favor, &amp; was in great estimation amongst the best. In the year 1556. <hi>Calvin</hi> preaching in <hi>Geneva,</hi> he was taken so strongly with an Ague, that he was forst to leave in the midst of his Sermon, and to come downe from the Pulpit: upon this accident, newes was spread abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his death, which in short space came unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and it was so ioyfully entertained by the Pope, that he forthwith caused publicke prayers and thanksgivings to be dedicated unto God in all the Church for the same; but the prayers of the faithfull prevailed more; for he was so far from dying, that being as it were endewed with another life, he went unto <hi>France, fuet ad Maenum,</hi> being thereunto called for the removing the dissentions out of the Churches of <hi>France</hi>; whence returning, although somewhat sickly, yet he ceased not to execute his constant course in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery; and also he carefully and timely confuted the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall opinion of <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> touching three Gods and three Eternals, lest by continuation it should take such root, that it would hardly be plucked up. And these were his actions untill the year 1558. wherein in pleased God to afflict him with a quartan Ague, which caused great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and lamentation in <hi>Geneva</hi>; yet it continued with him but for the space of eight weeks; in which time it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and so enfeebled his body, that he was never sound untill the day of his death. During this sicknesse, he was
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:108343:150"/>
advised by the Physitians and some of his friends, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare his usuall exercises, and to cherish his body with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ease; but he would not, declaring unto them, that he could not endure an idle life.</p>
            <p>In the year following <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> intended to levell <hi>Geneva</hi> with the ground, and to put the Inhabitants thereof to the sword; but before he could effect that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy project, he was taken captive by a higher power; and the City still flourished, even in the midst of her enemies: and that nothing might be wanting unto her prosperous and flourish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the year 1560. the <hi>Waldenses</hi> sent unto <hi>Calvin</hi> for his judgement concerning some points, wherein he gave them aboundant satisfaction, and exhorted them to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the other Protestant Churches.

               <hi>Calvin</hi> having spent his dayes hitherto in extraordinary labours (for his life may well be said to be a continued la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour mixed with griefe, as appeareth by the Works which he wrote being at <hi>Geneva.</hi>) The time was now at hand in which he must goe unto his eternall rest; his diseases, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by his indefatigable labours, caused him to give over his Divine exercises; for indeed, how could he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long? when as his body was by nature weake and leane, inclining to a consumption; and because he slept
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:108343:150"/>
very little, spending almost all the year either in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Teaching, or Dictating; for ten whole years he never Dined, and after the set houre he would not receive his Supper. He was subject unto the disease called the <hi>Migram,</hi> for the curing of which he used nothing but fasting, and that sometimes for the space of six and thirty houres. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that his quartan Ague left him, he was troubled with the Gout taking him in his left legge; which to make it the more grievous was seconded with the Colick. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians applyed what remedies they could, and he carefully followed their counsell. He was armed against these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with an admired patience, no man ever hearing him uttering a word unworthy of himselfe in his greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but lifting up his eyes unto heaven, he would chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully utter the words of <hi>David, How long O Lord.</hi> When he was exhorted by his friends to desist from reading or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the time of sicknesse, he would reply, What? <hi>will you have the Lord finde me idle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long before his death, some of his fellow Pastors coming accordingly as they used to visit him, they found him contrary to their expectation apparalled, and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Growing weaker and weaker, he was brought into the Senats Court by his command, where after an humble manner he thanked the Senate for the curtesies formerly conferred on him, and for the speciall care which they had of him in this his last sicknesse. Not long after he received the Communion at the hands of <hi>Beza,</hi> labouring the best that he could to joyne with the rest of the Congregation in singing of Psalmes unto God.</p>
            <p>The day wherein he dyed, he seemed to speake somewhat heartily, but this was but the last strugling of nature, for
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:108343:151"/>
about eight of the clocke apparant signes of death were seen; which being perceived of <hi>Beza,</hi> he ran forth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his other Collegues with it, but besure his returne he had quietly yeelded his soule into the hands of God, leaving such a chearfull countenance unto the beholders, that he seemed rather to be asleepe, then dead. Thus was that light taken away, even at the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting of the Sun. The day following, there was great lamentation throughout the City; the Church lamented for the death of her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastor; the Schoole sorrowed for the losse of so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Doctor; and in generall, all were filled with mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because they were deprived of their onely comforter, next unto God.</p>
            <p>Many of the Citizens desired to behold him after that he was dead, so great was their affection to him; and some strangers also whom the fame of <hi>Calvin</hi> had drawne unto that place, and amongst them the <hi>English</hi> Embassadour for <hi>France</hi> desired greatly to see him being dead; but it could not be granted, least it might raise a scandall on him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Papists. He was buried in the common Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, without any extraordinary pompe, and without any Grave-stone laid over him; for which cause <hi>Beza</hi> wrote these Funerall Verses:

               </gap>ft their places for shame, and went elsewhere. He used much modesty and wisdome in his Sermons; and when (in the beginning of his Preaching there) the Popish Priests railed exceedingly upon him and his Doctrine, and the People expected that he would answer them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; he, contrariwise, went on in teaching the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of Religion, and as he had occasion he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed their Errors without bitternesse from clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:108343:156"/>
to his brest, threatning to kill him, if the doore was not presently opened. Whereupon they were let in, and he caused meat and drinke to be prepared for them, and in the mean time conveyed away all his papers; and when he saw the fury and rage of the souldiers, he conveyed himselfe and family out at a back door. The next day came a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Bishop with his train, and putting forth the souldiers, he quartered in <hi>Brentius</hi> his house, searched his study, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over his papers and letters, and finding some letters to his friends, wherein he justified the Protestant Princes in taking Armes against the Emperour, he presently carried them to the Emperour; whereby <hi>Brentius</hi> was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and was fain to hide himselfe in a very high Tower, and not being safe there, he changed his apparell, left his wife and children, and with one onely companion passed through the <hi>Spaniards</hi> safely, and wandred up and down the fields all that night. But when the Emperor was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Army, he returned to <hi>Hale</hi> again.</p>
            <p>In the year 1548. when <hi>Caesar</hi> had published his Booke, called the <hi>Interim,</hi> the Protestant Princes and Magistrates required the judgements of their Divines upon it: and the Magistrates of <hi>Hale</hi> desired <hi>Brentius</hi> to tell them his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who when he had considered it, told them, That it was a wicked Booke, and altogether contrary to the Scriptures, and that he would lose his life before he would assent to it. This coming to <hi>Caesar's</hi> eares, he sent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary to <hi>Hale,</hi> charging him to bring <hi>Brentius</hi> to him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alive or dead: when the Commissary came thither, he insinuated himselfe into <hi>Brentius</hi> his acquaintance, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to his Table, perswaded him to walke abroad with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im, having prepared Horses to carry him away, but that succeeding not, he called the Senate together, and having sworn them to keep private what he should tell them, he imparted his Commission, telling them how acceptable it would be to the Emperour, if they would send to him <hi>Brentius</hi>; but if they refused, the Emperour would destroy their City, &amp;c. It pleased God that whilest he was thus
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:108343:157"/>
perswading the Magistrates, there came in one later then his fellowes, and the Commissary not minding it, did not tender the Oath to him; so when they were dismissed, this man wrote to <hi>Brentius; Fuge, fuge,</hi> Brenti, <hi>cito, citius, citis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sime</hi>: which note was brought him as he sate at supper: having read it, he told his Family that he must goe forth upon businesse, but would return ere long. As he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the City he met the Commissary, who asked him whither he went? He answered, To a sick friend in the Suburbs who had sent for him: Well (said the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary) to morrow you must dine with me. He replyed, <hi>God willing,</hi> and so they parted. Being thus escaped, he hid himselfe in a thick Wood, and for some weeks together he lay in the Wood all day, and every night came into a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to a friends house where he lodged; he wrote also to the Magistrates of <hi>Hale</hi> that if they could and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, he was ready to come back, and not to forsake his flock, but if they could not, he did not desire that they should indanger themselves for his sake: They answered, that they could not protect him, and therefore left him free to goe whither he pleased. Presently after <hi>Vlricus</hi> Prince of <hi>Wurtenburge</hi> invited him to him, and ordered him to be so private that he himselfe might not know where he was, that if he was asked, he might safely deny his knowledge of him: yet upon suspicion, his Castle was searched, but <hi>Brentius</hi> was in another place, where in his retirement he wrote a Comment upon the ninety third <hi>Psalm</hi>: afterwards he went to <hi>Basil,</hi> as to a safer place, where his wife dyed of a Consumption: from thence he removed to the Castle of <hi>Horrenburge</hi> in the <hi>Hyrcinian</hi> Wood, where he changed his name, and gave out that he was the Keeper of the Castle: and whilst he was there, he frequented the Sermons in a neighbor towne, where the Minister used to spin out his Sermons to a great length: whereupon <hi>Brentius</hi> took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion modestly to tell him of it; to whom the Minister an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, You Castle-keepers think all time too long at Church, but no time too long that you spend in drinking:
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:108343:157"/>
               <hi>Brentius</hi> smiling at it, said no more. Whilest he was there, he perfected his Comment upon <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and some other Works: afterwards he had great profers made him by the Citizens of <hi>Magdeburge,</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by the Duke of <hi>Broussia,</hi> but he refused them all, and thus continued in banishment for the space of two years. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1550. <hi>Vlricus</hi> Duke of <hi>Wurtenburg</hi> dyed, and his son <hi>Christopher</hi> succeeding, he resolved to restore the Ministers which were driven away by the <hi>Interim</hi> to their Charges within his Dominions, and to perfect the Worke of Reformation: and for that end, sent for <hi>Brentius</hi> and kept him in his Castle of <hi>Stutgard</hi> that he might have his advice and assistance in carrying on of that work: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he discouraged by the admonitions of the Princes and Bishops, nor by the threats of the Garrisons that were about him: but caused <hi>Brentius</hi> to write a Confession of Faith, and of the Doctrine of Christian Religion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When I perused the catologue of his Sermons, I wonder what time he had to write: agane, when I number and weigh his writing, I wonder what time he had to provide for Preaching; and when I compare both, I wonder how he could doe any thing els.

from an ancient and a noble Family, much esteemed and honoured in those parts. Being an Infant he was twice in great danger of his life, but preserved by the powerfull hand of God, contrary to the expectation of his Parent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at, by reason of a fall; whereby he was made unable to admit of any nourishment for the space of five dayes.</p>
            <p>His Father being a man of great learning, and bearing an extraordinary affection unto the Arts and their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, he was very carefull to provide that the tender years of this his Son might be bathed in the Fountains of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for that cause (he being not fully five years old, he was sent unto a Countrey School neer adjoyning, where he continued seven years; but by reason of the inability of his Master, he profited not much; yet he attained unto that perfection, that he exceeded those which learned with him, not without the approbation of his Master. His Parents well perceiving the towardlinesse of the childe, and finding that Schoolmaster not to be a sufficient Tutor for him; they presently entred into a consideration of sending him unto some more eminent place, where he might be instructed in the Arts, for the better perfection of nature; and therefore in the year 1516. he was sent unto <hi>Embrick,</hi> a Town in the Dukedom of <hi>Clire,</hi> then famous for the many learned Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers wherewith it was adorned: and here he was comitted unto the tuition of <hi>Casparus Glogoriensis,</hi> and of <hi>Petrus Coche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensis, Mosellanus,</hi> and others, being men beautified with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent endowments, and famous both for their Method of Teaching, and severity of Discipline; which latter was most acceptable unto this <hi>Bullinger</hi>; and for that cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet a childe, he had an intent to unite himself unto the Order of the <hi>Carthusians,</hi> it being the stric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:108343:174"/>
in the Arts and Tongues. During which time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived little maintenance from his Father. He furnished himselfe with victuals, sometimes by singing, sometimes by begging from doore to doore. Which action he performed not because his Father was poore and could not, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and would not confer a sufficient annuall pension on him; but he did it, because he desired to have some expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the miserable and wretched condition of poore men; that iu future times he might be the more willing and ready to relieve and succour them. Afterwards, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved unto <hi>Colen,</hi> where he studied Logick, and notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken of his excellent qualities, he proceeded Bachelor of Arts; and because there was great controversies in the Churches then, touching some points of Divinity, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto the Study of <hi>Theologie,</hi> and withall desired to know of those who were esteemed the best Schollars, what Authors were fittest to be read, to ground him in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. They all advise him to consult with <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> his writings being of good account and authority in those times. This counsell was embraced by <hi>Bullinger,</hi> who not contenting himselfe with that Author, he went unto <hi>Georgius Deinerus</hi>; by whose procurement he obtained an admission into the publick Library at <hi>Colen</hi>; where he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the Homilies of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> on <hi>Matthew,</hi> read over some chiefe parts of the Workes of <hi>Augustine, Ambrose, Origen,</hi> the Workes of <hi>Luther</hi> he read privately in his own Chamber, which indeed were the meanes of inlightning his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; for by the reading of them he was induced to peruse and to search into the Scriptures, and especially into the New Testament; whereby he entred into a detestation of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and into a constant and firme resolution of rejecting the auster<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> life of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusian</hi> Monkes.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Academy</hi> he went forth Master of Arts, and then he returned unto his Fathers house, where he spent a whole year in his private studies and meditations, at the end whereof he was called by <hi>Wolfangus Ionerus,</hi> unto <hi>Capella</hi> (he
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:108343:175"/>
being <hi>Abbot</hi> there) a Monastery situate in the fields of <hi>Tigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and advanced by him to be Head-schoolmaster, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his residence he was entirely beloved, not onely of the <hi>Abbot,</hi> but also of <hi>Simler Zuinglius O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>colampadius,</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent and reverend personages, for those excellent parts wherewith he was endewed.</p>
            <p>About this time he joyned with <hi>Zuinglius</hi> as touching a reformation in the Church, the labouring to produce it at <hi>Tigurum,</hi> and the other endeavouring to effect it at <hi>Capella</hi>; which in short time took good effect, for they cleared both places of Masses, and Idoles, and of many other things, which appeared superstitious in the Church, this he did during his residence at <hi>Capella,</hi> and with so much the more happy success because he was appointed to read the publick Divinity Lecture in the same school.</p>
            <p>In the year 1529. he was called unto <hi>Bremogart,</hi> the place of his birth, to Preach the Word of truth unto them: here he began openly to condemne the errours of the Papists, stoutly defending his Fathers doctrine, who had formerly discovered and confuted their errors, but some of the more eminent Citizens, not well brooking his doctrine, exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their authority, in expelling him the City; placing in his office a godly and learned Theologue, named <hi>Gervasius Scholasticus,</hi> but his name being famous amongst the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> and many of them having a great desire to hear him, he was called unto his owne Country to preach the Gospel of Christ, wherein he was so powerfull that he caused them to rectifie many abuses in the Church, and so well approved of, that the Senate kindly intreated him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there, and to goe forward in his teaching? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them, that he was so strictly bound by promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Senate of <hi>Tigurum,</hi> and to the Abbot of <hi>Capella,</hi> that he could doe nothing without their leave and consent: Wherefore they presently dispatched an Embassador unto <hi>Cahella,</hi> who wrought so effectually with the Senate, that they willed <hi>Bullinger</hi> to remaine in his owne Country, where he continued Preaching the Gospell together with
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:108343:175"/>
               <hi>Gervasius</hi> three years with the Unanimous consent of all the Citizens, and the Gospell by the industry of these two learned and vigilant watchmen flourished in the same place: which (although it weare opposed by the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, who laboured to hinder the growth of the Church) was preferred by God, who stirred up this <hi>Bullinger</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute with invincible arguments in the presence of the whole Church, their erronious opinions.</p>
            <p>But as one misery seldome comes alone, without the addition of another, even so it happened at this present, for the Church of <hi>Bremogart</hi> was not onely troubled with the erronious opinions of these Anabaptists; but also vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with intestine discords, where in the Papists having the upper hand, <hi>Bullinger</hi> with his father and brother, and his faithfull colleague <hi>Gervas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the same yeere the Church of <hi>Basil</hi> was destitute of a Pastor, by reason of the death of <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> whereupon he was called by them unto the discharging of a Pastorall office amongst them, but the Senate of <hi>Tigurum</hi> detained him, and appointed him in the place of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> according to his owne desire, for when he went forth with the <hi>Tigurines</hi> to Battell, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of them if any misfortune came unto him, that they would be pleased to Nominate <hi>Bullinger</hi> to be his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.</p>
            <p>And unto this office he was called in a time full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, even to build up and to confirme and strengthen a Church, greatly shaken and afflicted. Which he performed with such patience and modesty, that false Doctrine began againe to be discovered, and the truth to be firmly planted in the hearts of many; which he well perceiving, ceased not to proceed and go forward, praising almighty God for ordaining and esteeming him a worthy instrument for the advancing and propagating of his Truth: and for that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:108343:176"/>
cause he wrote a Confession of his Faith, sending it unto <hi>Constance</hi> to <hi>Bucer,</hi> and other learned Divines there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the establishing of an agreement amongst the Churches; which worke of his was approved of by <hi>Bucer</hi> and by the whole Assembly, esteeming it worthy to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced of the adjacent Churches.</p>
            <p>In the year 1536. he was present at <hi>Basel</hi> with <hi>Bucer</hi> and others, about the reconciling of different points, which did great hurt unto the Church, and especially about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation betwixt <hi>Luther</hi> and the <hi>Hevetian</hi> Churches; where it being declared against him, that he laboured for a defection unto <hi>Luther,</hi> and all his opinions he cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of that asper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the year 1538. some of our <hi>English</hi> Nobility came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>

This happened about the time that <hi>Henry</hi> the eight had disburdened himself of the weight of the Pope, the <hi>English</hi> being greatly inflamed to imbrace a pure worship of the Lord, which had not yet been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant amongst them; these men were kindely entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Bullinger,</hi> who also gave them full satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things demanded; before their departure, they intreated him that he would write some short Treatise concerning Religion unto their Soveraigne, whereby he might be egged forward in his resolution touching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Church. Unto which he willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended, and wrote unto the King two learned Treatises, exhorting him to set aside the inventions of men, and to give himselfe wholly unto the Word of God; and to have all things in his Dominion regulated and squared accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Canonicall Scripture.</p>
            <p>In the year following he laboured to purge the Church of that grosse errour of <hi>Casparus Schroenckfeldius</hi> a <hi>Silesian,</hi>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:108343:176"/>
concerning the Humane nature of Christ, who taught that after his ascention into heaven, and sitting at the right hand of his Father, it was so Deified and made coequall unto the Word, that it was no more a creature; which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour received strength and was fostered by the approbation of great persons in <hi>Suevia,</hi> but quickly overthrowne by the laborious Preaching and writing of <hi>Bullinger.</hi> Within short time after, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the year 1582. on a Lords day he preached twice, and in the evening heard another Sermon, then supped chearfully, and after supper refreshed himself by walking abroad; then went to visit a sick friend, and whilest he was comforting of him, he found his spirits to begin to sinke in him, and runing to his servant, he said unto him, <hi>Praie</hi>; saying further, <hi>Lord receive my soule,</hi> and so he quietly departed in the Lord, in the year 1582.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaching: out of this School were sent daily many to the University, to diverse of which he allowed maintenance, whereby his name was renowned, and the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> much esteemed him, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:108343:187"/>
procured of the Queen the Bishoprick of <hi>Carlile</hi> for him, and sent him his <hi>Congedeslier,</hi> but Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> returned it back with many thanks, alleging his own insufficiency for the discharge of so great a place. Not long after also he was much importuned to take upon him the Provost's place of Queens Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> but he refused it, being wholly unwilling to remove from the place where God had set him.</p>
            <p>He was much given to Hospitality, insomuch as <hi>William Cecill</hi> Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> returning out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> drawn with the same of Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> came to <hi>Houghton,</hi> where he was entertained with all due respect: and when he had well observed Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi> and the diligence, and abundance of all things, with so compleat service in the entertainment of so great, and unlooked for a Guest, he said at his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he had heard much of Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi> but what he had now seen, and tryed was much more then the report; and thereupon taking his his leave of Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi> he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him if he had any occasion, or suit at the Court that he would make use of him to meditate it for him. He still continued his yearly visit of <hi>Riddesdale,</hi> and <hi>Tindale,</hi> where he was esteemed a Prophet, and little lesse then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored by that barbarous people. Being once amongst them, one had stoln his horses, whereupon Hue and Cry was sent abroad for Master <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s horses: the fellow that had stoln them, hearing that they were Master <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s, fell a tremble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and presently carryed them back againe, humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pardon, and the benediction of Father <hi>Gilpin,</hi> protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he feared that he should be thurst into hell if he should doe him any wrong. Also he being to preach at a towne called <hi>Rothbury,</hi> there was a deadly fewd between the Inhabitants, so that the men of both sides never met at Church without blood-shed, and therefore when one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty came the other used to stay away: but Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Pulpit, both partyes came to Church, one party going into the Chancell, and the other into the body of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:108343:187"/>
though somewhat moved with this uncouth spectacle, yet went on in his Sermon; but when their weapons began to make a clashing sound, and the one side drew near to the other, Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> came downe from the Pulpit, and step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to the ringleaders of either faction, he laboured to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish a peace; and when he could not prevaile in that, yet he got a promise from them to continue the peace whilst he was in the Church, &amp; afterwards whilst he was in those quarters, and so going up againe, he spent the rest of the time in discharging that barbarous and bloody custom. At another time Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> coming to a Church in those parts, before the people assembled, and walking up, and downe, he espied a glove hanging up in the Church; end enquiring of the Sexton the meaning of it, he told him that it was a glove of one of the Parish who hung it up as a challenge to his enemy, with whom he would fight hand to hand, or with any else that durst take it downe. Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> requested the Sexton to take it downe, who replyed, That he durst not. Then said Master <hi>Gilpin,</hi> Bring me a staff, &amp; I will take it down; which accordingly he did, and put it into his bosome, and in his Sermon he took occation to reprove these inhumane challenges, and reproved him in particular that had hug up the glove, shewing them that he had taken it downe, and that such practices were unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming Christians, and therefore he perswaded them to love, and mutuall charity amongst themselves: after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon he distributed mony amongst the poor, and as his manner was, visited the prisoners, gave them mony, and preached to them, and brought many of them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and for some that were condemned to die he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured pardon, and saved their lives.</p>
            <p>Not long after a Rebellion was raised in the North by the Earls of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland</hi>; which Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> having intelligence of, resolved to retire himselfe, and making a speech to the Master, aud Scholars to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themselves carefully, and peaceably in his absence; he went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> till the Queens Army commanded by
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:108343:188"/>
the Earl of <hi>Sussex,</hi> had dissipated the Rebels: but before that Army came, the Rebels having seazed upon <hi>Durham,</hi> some of them flew as far as <hi>Houghton,</hi> and finding Master <hi>Gilpin's</hi> Barns full of corn, young cattell fatted, and many things provided for hospitality, they made spoile of all; the chiefest of which plunderers was a knave whom Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> had saved from the Gallows: but when those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels were overthrown, Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> returned home, and begged the lives of many of the simpler sort, whom he knew to be drawn into that Rebellion through ignorance.</p>
            <p>After the death of Bishop <hi>Pilkington,</hi> who was Master <hi>Gilpins</hi> faithfull friend, there succeeded in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> one <hi>Richard Barns</hi> who was offended with him upon some false suggestions, which came thus about: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Gilpins</hi> custom was sometimes to goe to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and once as he was upon his way, he espied a young youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him sometimes walking, and sometimes runing. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Gilpin</hi> demanded of him what he was, whence he came, and whether he was going? He answered, That he came out of <hi>Wales,</hi> and was bound for <hi>Oxford</hi> to be a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> thereupon examined him, and finding him a prompt Scholar for the Latin, and that he had a smattering in the Greek, asked him if he would goe with him, and he would provide for him: the youth was contented, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he took him with him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Houghton,</hi> where he profited exceedingly bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited evill for good, by stirring up of the Bishop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> against Master <hi>Gilpin.</hi> Now the Bishop sent to Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> to preach at a Visitation, appointing time and place: but it fell out just at that time when Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Northern journy into <hi>Riddesdale, &amp;c.</hi> whereupon he sent his man to the Bishop, desiring him to appoint som other to preach the Visitation-Sermon, for that he might have many to doe that, but none would goe amongst

But so soon as the Bishop heard of it, he suspended him, which Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> at his returne much wondred at: Shortly after the Bishop sent to him to warn him to meet him, and the rest of the Clergy at <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>: whither Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> went, and when the Bishop and Clergy were all met in the Church: he said to Master <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, Sir, I must have you preach to day.</hi> Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> desired to be excused, because he was unprovided, and for that he was suspended. <hi>But</hi> (saith the Bishop) <hi>I free you from that suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Yet Master <hi>Gilpin</hi> replyed, That he durst not go up into the Pulpit unprovided.

in the Grounds of Learning, in the Schooles he continued untill that he was twelve years old; at which time his Father dyed, and shortly after his Mother also.

               </gap>m, as well for civill behaviour as for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he resolved to take that course of life upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also thereunto induced by the advice of his intimate friend <hi>Basileus.</hi> Wherefore revealing himselfe unto his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle and other friends, he was by their meanes elected and chosen into the Monastery.</p>
            <p>In this place he lived almost ninteen years, and was by profession a <hi>Lateran Canon Regular</hi>; in which space he gave himselfe first unto the study of the Tongues, and proved a good Linguist. Secondly, unto the study of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and became a good Logician: and thirdly, unto the study of School Divinity, wherein his excellency is manifest by his Workes. For the space of sixteen years he was familiarly acquainted, and dearly beloved of that illustrious and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, grave <hi>Celsus Martinengus</hi>; who perceiving that his life was sought for the profession of the truth, fled out of <hi>Italie,</hi> and went unto <hi>Geneva,</hi> and was the first Pastor which the <hi>Italian</hi> Church had in that place; who when he dyed commended the care of his Flocke to <hi>Calvin,</hi> 1558.</p>
            <p>During his residence in this Monastery, he would walke sometimes with <hi>Martinengus,</hi> for recreations sake unto <hi>Luca</hi> a Towne in <hi>Tuscanie,</hi> where he heard <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> openly expounding the Epistle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in private the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> unto their <hi>Canons</hi>: and these Expositions of this learned man wrought so effectually
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:108343:205"/>
with him, that he gave himselfe wholly unto the study of Divinity, and made diligent search into the Commentaries of the most learned and authenticke Fathers; perused po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive and polemicall discourses, and delivered for a season the purity of the truth of the Gospell of Christ in <hi>Italie.</hi> But in regard that <hi>Italie</hi> was too hot for <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and much more for his Schollars, who were hardly permitted to reside in the Countrey, much lesse to be publick Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; eighteen of them within the space of one year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Master, amongst whom was this <hi>Zanchius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus freed and delivered from this <hi>Babilonian</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity (an expression often used by himselfe) in the year 1550. he first went unto the <hi>Rhetians,</hi> because a greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was ganted unto their Churches, and because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e might serve Christ with a free and a good conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. Yet here he continued not fully nine months but he left them, and went unto <hi>Geneva</hi>; and after that he had spent other nine Moneths in that place, by the meanes of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> he was called into <hi>England,</hi> to performe the place of the Divinity Lecturer; unto which motion he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly condescended: and having taken his leave of his friends and acquaintance he sets forward in his journey; he was detained by the Inhabitants of <hi>Strarburge,</hi> because their Pastor <hi>Casper Hedio</hi> was then dead, and because it was decreed by the Magistrates that an <hi>Italian</hi> following the Doctrine of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> should be called unto the Citie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and therfore they first used meanes to bring in the grav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Martinengus</hi>; but he refused to leave his Flocke in <hi>Geneva</hi>: wherefore seing, they could not prevaile that way. They kindely intreated <hi>Zanchy</hi> to stay amongst them; hither he came in the yeare 1553. and in this place he performed a Pastorall office almost eleven years; and at vacant times he expounded <hi>Aristotle</hi> unto such as were desirous to attain unto some understanding in the Arts.</p>
            <p>Here he was commanded by the Magistrates (if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to teach in that City) to subscribe unto that Confession of Faith concluded on, and set forth at <hi>Auspurge,</hi> called the

               </gap> the chiefest cause which did urge this Subscription, he wrote a Treatise concerning the Lords Supper; wherein he delivered his opinion thus.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, that the true body of Christ, which was given for us, and his true blood which was shed for the remission of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <item>Secondly, that it was not eaten with the mouth and teeth of the body, but with true faith.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, and therefore received of none but of those which were elected.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And this his opinion was generally answered unto, and approved in the City, so that when they had made a triall of the sufficiency of his parts, for the space of two years, and had approved of that method and order which he had observed both in teaching and disputing, he was admitted and chosen into the Society of the <hi>Thomists:</hi> where he lived a Canon for the space of nine years, in which time he was beloved of all good men that knew him: a detester of Contraversies as cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet notwithstanding diverse Controversies and accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were afterwards instituted and moved against him, during his residence here, and that by some of the Divines and Professors of the same Common-wealth concerning the Sacrament, and concerning the Ubiquity of the humain nature, concerning the setting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Immediately after his comming unto <hi>Clavenna</hi> a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and heavy pestilence invaded the City, which was the cause of great sorrow and lamentation in that place: for within the space of seven months three dyed 1200. persons, yet <hi>Zanchy</hi> continued his course of teaching so long as any Auditor came unto him; afterwards he removed himselfe out of the towne, unto the top of an high Mountaine, with his family, where he spent three months in reading, meditation and prayers; and at the end thereof it pleased God to remove his scourge from the City, and he returned and performed his ordinary function for the space of four years, to the great benefit of that Church, but not without many afflictions and crosses unto himself.</p>
            <p>Hence then he was called by that incomparable vertuous and religious Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> the third Elector Palatine, unto that famous <hi>Academie</hi> at <hi>Heidleberge,</hi> and by him most courteously entertained, and constituted successor unto <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary Vrsin,</hi> at his entrance into his office which was in the year 1568. he delivered an excellent and learned speech concerning the conservation of the purity of doctrine in the Church, and in the same year he was graced with the title of Doctor in Divinity, in the presence of the Prince Elector, and of his son <hi>Casimirus</hi>; who being most desirous of propagating the truth of Christ, injoyned him (after his returne from <hi>Rhetia</hi> to the <hi>Palatinate</hi>) to lay open the true doctrine concer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ANthony Sadeel</hi> was born upon the confines of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> not far from <hi>Geneva Anno Christi</hi> 1534. and his father dying whilst he was young, his mother brought him up in learning, and sent him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and having stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed a while there, he went to <hi>Tholous,</hi> where falling into the society of some godly students of the Law, it pleased God that he left Popery, and went from thence to <hi>Geneva</hi>; where he was much holpen by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>: afterwards being sent for home, and some controversie arising about his inheritance, he went to <hi>Paris</hi> and there joyned himselfe with the private Congregation of the Protestants: there the Pastor <hi>Collongius</hi> called the young students that

In the year 1561. he fell sicke of a quartan Ague, and by the advice of his Physitians and friends, he was perswaded to goe into his owne Countrey: yet neither there did he live idle, but Preached up and down, to the spirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of many.

               </gap> with the generall applause of all, as well strangers as others.</p>
            <p>From the study of the Arts and Tongues, wherein he gave sundry pregnant proofs of his proficiency beyond most of his equals, (having thereby laid a sound founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a further firmer &amp; fairer future fabrick) he betook himself to the study of Divinity. Unto which now mainely addicting himselfe, he began (as was most need) with the Scriptures, the pure Well-spring of all divine truth: the authority whereof as he alwayes maintained, so he made them ever his Ground-worke for all matters of Faith, and his Touchstone for the triall of all humane either writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or opinions. From the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he proceeded (a good course to be taken by young students in Divinity) to the writings of our modern Divines of the best note: and from these to the Monuments of the auncient Doctors; all the works of whom, whither Greek or Latine Fathers of any note (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one as of a strong and able body, so of pains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry unweariable; by night watches repairing what at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time by day he lost through emergent occasions) he read over and dispatched within few years.</p>

               </gap> we see.</p>
            <p>Being now brought upon a most eminent Stage, wherein he lay open to all eyes, to envious ones especially (seldome wanting in such cases, and of all other most curious and quick-sighted to pry narrowly into the defects and defaults of those whom they envie;) he therein so worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himselfe, beyond all expectation, that he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surpassed the expectation of his wel-wishing friends, but surpassed also the emulations of his ill-affected adversaries: not unlike a prevailing pillar of fire, that with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s cleare and bright flames mounting up on high, dispelleth and consumeth the smoake that would obscure and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it.</p>
            <p>He began with the opening in a dogmaticall way, of sundry Bookes and parcels of Scripture: the three first chapters of S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, the Epistle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> his first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Salomons</hi> Song of Songs: all which he went through with, in his publicke Lectures, within the space of six years; being attended continually with a constant concourse of the best, and an auditory at all times well filled.</p>
            <p>Neither was his Pen idle the whiles but was withall employed otherwise, as well as his tongue. For during this time, he delt by writing with <hi>Campian</hi> that florishing Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, and refuted his ten frivolous and reasonlesse Reasons, which he so much vaunted of; he replyed upon <hi>Duraeus</hi> the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:108343:211"/>
               <hi>Scot,</hi> his scurrilous railings, in defence of that his refutation, and stopt his foule mouth. He grapled with sedicious <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> evicting his Arguments, wherby he laboured to prove that the Pope is not Antichrist; and with <hi>Rainolds</hi> his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who had bin nibling onely at the Preface to his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Sanders</hi> his Demonstration, but had no hart to meddle with the Worke it selfe.</p>
            <p>After this, considering the state and necessity of the times, in his publicke Lectures he betooke himselfe to Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies; and singled out <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the Popes then greatest Champion and <hi>Romes Goliah,</hi> to bicker with. The Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies he handled, were concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Church,</hi> concerning <hi>Councels,</hi> concerning the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> concerning the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> concerning the <hi>Saints deceased,</hi> concerning the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in generall, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> and of <hi>Baptisme</hi> in speciall; whereof some small part he published in his life time, some other part hath bin pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished since his death.</p>
            <p>And as his Readings at home, so his Writings both at home and abroad, have for ingenuity, perspicuity, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, succinctnesse, received high commendations from the most judicious Divines that this age hath afforded; yea, it is credibly reported, that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe so esteemed of him, that he procured hence his Portraiture, and had it hanging in his Study among the Pictures of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of prime note; and that being demanded, why he would keepe so near him the effigies of an Hereticke, and one that had written against him, and grace such an one so much; he made answer, that <hi>Though he were an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and an Advarsarie, yet he was a learned Adversary</hi>: nor is any testimony deemed more firme and credible, then that that proceedeth from a professed enemy. Onely, while he lived, <hi>Stapleton</hi> a peevish peece, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For in his government thereof (which with much moderation and singular discretion he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in) he had a speciall eye to the advancement, as well of Religion as of Learning, taking notice even of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and the meanest; and giving much encouragement every way to such as he observed to be forward in either. By meanes whereof, that Colledge (during all the time of his continuance there) greatly florished, and was more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented then any Colledge in the whole Universitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p>About his latter times som Controversie arising in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversitie, concerning certaine points of Doctrine; he was together with some other of chiefe note and place called up to <hi>London,</hi> for the composing of the same; wherein hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travelled and taken much paines to good purpose; in his returne homeward from thence, being well near mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winter and sharpe weather, he tooke (by some cold in likelihood) that sicknesse, of which (turning to a violent Feaver) he not long after deceased.</p>
            <p>During the short time of his sicknesse (for he lay not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes) he carried himselfe very comfortably and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and departed with much peace.</p>
            <p>He was a man very personable, of a goodly presence, a body well compact, tall of stature, upright, proportional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limmed, blacke hayred, of a grave aspect, a ruddy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, a strong constitution; of a setled carriage, a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid judgement, a liberall minde, an affable disposition; a milde, yet no remisse Governour; a free disposer of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; a constant frequenter of the publicke service; a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Schollar; a great Student to the last; a lover of Learning and Learned; a contemner of money; of a moderate dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; a familiar demeanure; a life generally unblameable; and (that which added a luster to all the rest) amidst all

these endowments, and the respects of others, even the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, thereby deservedly procured, of a most meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit.</p>
            <p>He had two wives successively, women of good birth and note, and eight children by them. He left this world (to his eternall joy and gaine, but to the great losse of Gods Church, and griefe of all sound and godly learned) on the fourth day of <hi>December,</hi> in the year of our Lord 1595. and in the forty and seventh of his age: having held the Professours chaire about sixteene years; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stership of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge almost nine.

               <hi>DAniel Tossanus</hi> was born at <hi>Moumbelgard</hi> in <hi>Wertemburge Anno Christi</hi> 1541. his Parents carefully brought him up in learning, and at fourteen years old, sent him to the Univers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whilst he was there, the civill Wars brake out between the Papists, and Protestants: and <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> besieging the City of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> where Mounseur de <hi>Andelot,</hi> brother to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>France,</hi> commanded in chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is certainly known and beleeved, that if <hi>Quick-silver</hi> could be fired (which all confesse difficult, and most conclude impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) it would amount to an infinite treasure; so when the roving parts, the giddy and unstable conceits of this young Scholar began to be setled, his extravagant studyes to be confined and centered to Divinity, in a very short time he arrived at an incredable improvement.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He began first to preach to the prisoners in <hi>Cambridge</hi> Castle, being then himselfe Fellow of Christ Colledge. Here he truely preached Christs precepts: <hi>Freely you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give</hi>: And with Saint <hi>Paul made the Gospell of Christ of no expence</hi>; yea he followed Christs example <hi>to preach deliverance to the Captives,</hi> whose bodies were in a prison and souls in a dungeon: such generally their ignorant and desperate condition. Here (though free himselfe) he begot sons to God in fetters: Many an <hi>Onesimus</hi> in bonds was converted to Christ: Mock not at this good mans meane imployment, neither terme him <hi>with such as sit in the seate of the scornfull, the Goale-birds Chaplaine</hi>: But know nothing is base which in it selfe is lawfull, and done in order to the glory of God, yea better it is to be a true preacher in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then a flatterer in a Princes pallace.</p>

But so great a star could not move alwayes in so small a sphear: His merits promoted him to a Cangregation of greater credit in the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was most constant in preaching. Wherein as no man did with more vehemency remove sin, so none either with more passionate affection bemone the condition of obstinate siners, or with sounder judgment, give them directions for their future a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment: <hi>Luther</hi> did observe that Thunder without rain doth more harme then good, wherof he maks this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Ministers who are alwaies threatning of legall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to offenders, except also they seasonably drop the dew of direction; giving them orders and instructions to better their estates, are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="9">9. He used alwayes before his Sermons, (as to this day is attested by many surviving witnesses) a set form of prayer, not that out of poverty he wanted variety and exchange of phrase<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THis grave and honorable Prelate, was borne in the City of <hi>London,</hi> in the Parish of <hi>All-Saints Barking,</hi> of honest and Religious Parents; his Father (having most part of his life used the Seas) in his latter time, became one of the society, and Master of the Holy Trini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>From his tender yeeres, he was totally addicted to the study of good letters; and in his youth, there appeared in him such aptnesse to learne, answerable to his endeavours that his two first Schoolmasters, Master <hi>Ward,</hi> and Master <hi>Mulcaster,</hi> (conceiving, or foreseeing, that he would prove a rare scholer) contended, who should have the honor of his breeding. From Master <hi>Ward,</hi> Master of the <hi>Coopers</hi> Free-Schoole in <hi>Radcliffe,</hi> he was sent to Master <hi>Mulcaster,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the <hi>Mercantaylors</hi> free schoole, in <hi>London</hi>: where he answered the former opinion, conceived of him; for by his extraordinary industry, and admirable capacity, he soone outstript all the scholers under Master <hi>Mulcasters</hi> tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being become an excellent Grecian, and Hebrecian: Insomuch as <hi>Thomas Wattes</hi> Doctor of Divinity, Prebend and Residentiary of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Archdeacon of <hi>Middle-sex</hi> (who had newly Founded som Scholerships in <hi>Pembrook Hall,</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi>) sent him thither, and bestowed the first of his said Scholarships upon his; which places a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:108343:230"/>
being then a scholer also in the said Colledge, and very well approved of, by many of the Society. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Fellowes put these two young men to a Tryall before them, by some Scholasticall exercises: upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof, they preferred Sir <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and chose him into the fellowship, then void, though they liked Sir <hi>Dove</hi> so well also, that (being loth to loose him) they made him some allowance for his present maintenance, under the title, of a <hi>Tanquam Socius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane while, <hi>Hugh Price</hi> (having built <hi>Iesus</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Oxford</hi>) had heard so much of this young man (Sir <hi>Andrewes</hi>) that without his privity, he named him in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His Custome was (after he had been three yeeres in the University) to come up to <hi>London</hi> once a yeer to visit his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and that, ever about a fortnight before <hi>Easter,</hi> staying till a fortnight after: and against the time he should com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What he did, when he was a Child, and a schoole-boy, is not now knowne; But he hath beene sometimes heard to say, that when he was a young scholer in the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y (and so all his time onward, he never loved or used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny games, or ordinary recreations, either within doores (as Cards, Dice, Tables, Chesse, or the like;) or abroad,
<pb facs="tcp:108343:230"/>
as Buts, Coyts, Bowles, or any such: but his ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and recreation, was walking either alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or with some other selected Companion, with whom he might conferre and argue, and recount their studies: and he would often professe, that to observe the grasse, herbs, corne, trees, cattle, earth, waters, heavens, any of the Creatures, and to contemplate their Natures, orders, qualities, vertues, uses, &amp;c. was ever to him, the greatest mirth, content, and recreation that could be: and this he held to his dying day. After he had been some while a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Arts in the University, he applied himselfe to the study of Divinity, wherein he so profited, that his fame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be spread farre and neare. Insomuch as being chosen Catechist in the Colledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and purposing to read the ten Commandements (every Saturday, and Sunday at three of clocke afternoone, which was the hour of Catechizing) not onely out of other Colledges in the University, but diverse also out of the Country, did duely resort unto the Colledge Chappell, as a publique Divinity Lecture.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to his life (after he left the University) give me leave to relate a story of him, while he yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there, and that (as near as I can) from his owne mouth, and in his owne words.</p>
            <p>Upon his first shewing himselfe at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity studies, especiall notice was soone taken of him (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his abilities and eminencies) as a man deeply seene in all cases of Conscience, and he was much sought to in that respect.</p>
            <p>To proceed, with his owne particular: His worth made him so famous, that <hi>Henry Early</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> (hearing of it) sent for him, and thought himselfe much honoured by his accompanying him into the North, whereof he was President; and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re God so blessed his painfull Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and moderate private conference, that he converted Recusants (Priests and others) to the Protestant Religion. Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> (Secretary of State to Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>) tooke also especiall notice of his abilities, and highly
<pb facs="tcp:108343:231"/>
affected him, and (being loath that he should not be better known to the world) wrought meanes to make him Vicar of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> without <hi>Criplegate London</hi>; then Prebend and Residentiary of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>; and afterwards Prebend of the Collegiate Church of <hi>Southwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus preferred (to his owne contentment) he lived not idlely, but continued a painfull labourer in the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> vineyard, witnesse Saint <hi>Giles</hi> Pulpit and that in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, where he read the Lecture thrice a weeke in the Terme time. And indeed what by his often Preaching at St. <hi>Giles,</hi> and his no lesse often reading in St. <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so infirme, that his friends despaired of his life. Upon the death of Doctor <hi>Fulke,</hi> he was elected to the Mastership of <hi>Pembrooke Hall</hi> (whereof he had been a Schollar and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) a place of credit, but of little benefit; for he ever spent more upon it then he received by it.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he was made Chaplaine in ordinary attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (of which kinde there were then but twelve) to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; who tooke such delight in his Preaching and grave deportment, that first she bestowed a Prebend at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> upon him, and (not long after) the Deanry of that place: and what she intended further to him, her death prevented.</p>
            <p>He soone grew into far greater esteem with her successor the most learned King <hi>Iames,</hi> who (to say but truth) admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him beyond all other Divines, not onely for his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant gift in Preaching, but for the excellency and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in all kinde of Learning; selecting him, at his choysest peece, to vindicate his Regality against his foule-mouthed adversaries. His Majesty (not long after his happy entrance to this Crowne) bestowed upon him the Bishopricke of <hi>Chichester</hi> (which he held about foure yeeres) and withall made him Lord <hi>Almoner</hi>: and (because of the exility of that Bishopricke) soon after added the Parsonage of <hi>Cheyham</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> to his <hi>commendam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the vacancy of the Bishopricke of <hi>Ely,</hi> his Majesty made him Bishop thereof; and there he sate about nine
<pb facs="tcp:108343:231"/>
yeers. In which time he was made a Privie Councellor, first of <hi>England</hi> &amp; then of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in his attendance of the King thither. He was afterwards preferred to the Bishopricke of <hi>Winchester</hi> and the Deanry of the Kings Chappell, which two last preferments he held to his death, which hapned about eight yeeres after, in the third yeer of the raigne of our late King <hi>Charlse</hi>; with whom he held no lesse repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then he had done with his Father before him.</p>
            <p>It is worth the observation, that having bin preferd to many, and those no small dignities, yet he never used any meanes to obtaine the least of them, but they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd upon him without the least suit on his part: For he was so farre from ambition or covetousnesse, as that when the Bishopricks of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi> were at severall times tendred unto him upon some propositions, prejudiciall to the state of those Churches, he utterly refused them.</p>
            <p>The vertues and good parts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> this honorable Prelate were so many, and those so transcendent, that to doe him right, a large volumn would be but sufficient, which I shall leave to some of better abilities to performe, which I shall (by way of an Epitome) onely point a finger at, in these heads which follow.</p>
            <p>His first and principall vertue, was his singular zeale and piety, which shewed it selfe not onely in his private and secret Devotions betweene God and himselfe (in which, they that were about him, well perceived, that he daily spent many houres, yea, and the greatest part of his life, in holy prayers and abundant teares, the signes whereof they often discovered) but also in his exemplary publicke pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with his Family in his Chappell; wherein he behaved himselfe so humbly, devoutly and reverently, that it could not but move others to follow his example. His Chappell (in which he had Monthly Communions) was so decently and reverently adorned, and God served there with so holy and reverend behaviour of himselfe and his Family (by his pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erne) that the soules of many (that (<hi>obiter</hi>) came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in time of Divine Service) were very much elevated,
<pb facs="tcp:108343:232"/>
and they stirred up to the like reverend deportment; yea, some that had bin there, were so taken with it, that they desired to end their dayes in the Bishop of <hi>Elyes</hi> Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppell.</p>
            <p>The next is his Charity and compassion, which he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized even before he came to great preferments: for while he was yet in private estate, he extended his Charity in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall manner, to the reliefe of poore Parishioners, prisons and prisoners; besides his constant Sundayes Almes at his Parish of Saint <hi>Giles.</hi> But when his Meanes became grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his Charity encreased to a large proportion; releasing many prisoners of all sorts, that were detained either for petty Debts or keepers fees. And one thing in his Charity is remarkable; that whereas he sent much money at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times to the reliefe of poore Parishes, Prisons, Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and the like, he gave strict charge to his servants whom he entrusted therewith, that they should not acknowledge whence this reliefe came; but directed that the acquittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which they (to make the discharge of their trust ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to him) desired from them that received such reliefe, should be taken in the name of a Benefactor unknown. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large sums he bestowed yeerly (and oftner) in clothing the poore and naked, in relieving the sicke and needy, in succouring Families in time of infection (besides his Almes to poore house-keepers at his gate:) insomuch, that his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Almes in his last six yeeres (besides those publique) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to the sum of 1300 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and upwards. Lastly, though it might well have beene supposed (by that which is said already) that he had bin in his life time his own Almoner, yet as he lived a pattern of compassion and worke of mercy so he dyed also; for it appeareth by his Will, that his chief care was, to provide that his pious workes should never have end, leaving 4000 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. to purchase 200 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. Land <hi>per annum</hi> for ever, to be distributed by 50 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. quarterly, thus; To aged poore men and decayed (with an especiall eye to Sea faring men, wherin he reflected upon his Fathers Profession) 50 <hi rend="sup">l</hi>.

            <p>The third is his fidelity and integrity; faithfull, upright and just he ever was, whether you respect him in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary transactions, in which no man could ever justly taxe him with the least aspersion of injustice; or whether you looke upon him as entrusted with those great Offices and Places which he did undergoe; and they were either his Spirituall preferments or Temporall Office, besides some other matters committed to his fidelity. In the first of which he declared evidently to the world, that he reputed himself but Gods Steward, and that he must give an account to his Lord and Master for them. To begin then with the lowest account: He was ever faithfull, provident and carefull to keepe in good repaire the Houses of all his Spirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and spent much money that way; as upon the Vicarage house of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> the Prebends and Deanes houses of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the Residentiaries house of Saint <hi>Pauls.</hi> Upon the House belonging to the Bishopricke of <hi>Chichester,</hi> he expended above 420 l. Of <hi>Elye</hi> above 2440 l. Of <hi>Winchesters</hi> (besides a Pention of 400 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> from which he freed his See at his owne charge) he spent two thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>But in that part of the Account which concerned him more neerly to perfect, which was his Pastorall and Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall charge, the cure of <hi>Soules,</hi> and the well ordering of the severall Diocesse committed to his trust, never any made a more just and exact account.</p>
            <p>Some particulars of this account was, the promoting of sufficient, able and good men to Livings and preferments which fell within his owne gift. To the better discharge
<pb facs="tcp:108343:233"/>
of this part of the account he tooke order still before hand, by continuall search and enquiry, to know what hopefull young men were in the University: his Chapleins and friends receiving a charge from him, to certifie him, what hopefull and towardly young wit they met with at any time: and these (till he could better provide for them) were sure to taste of his bounty and goodnesse, for their better encouragement.</p>
            <p>Diverse eminent men in Learning that wanted prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when any thing fell in his guift convenient for them (though otherwise they had no dependance at all upon him, nor interest in him) he would send for, before they knew why, and entertaine them in his owne house<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and conferre the preferment upon them, and also defray the very charges incident for a dispensation or a faculty, yea, of their very journey; and all this, that he might have his Diocesse in generall, and his preferments in particular, the better fitted: So that, that may fitly be applyed to him, which was sometimes to Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> In <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratione Epatus, prebuit se fidelem, constantem, &amp; Vigilantem Ministerum Christi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you looke upon him in those Temporales wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was intrusted, you shall find him no lesse faithfull and just: As first, diverse summes (and many of them of good value) were sent to him, to be distributed among poore scholers, and others, at his discretion: all which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed with great care and fidelity, even according to the Donors minds and entents.</p>
            <p>For his faithfulnesse in managing those places, wherein he was entrusted for others, joyntly with himselfe, let <hi>Pembrooke H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when he was made Deane of the other, it is not unknowne to some yet living (who will testfie)
<pb facs="tcp:108343:233"/>
that he left it for all orders, aswell of the Church as of the Colledge and Schoole, a place then truly exemplarily Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate in all respects, both within and without, free from debts and arrerages, from encrochments &amp; evill Customes; the Schoole-boyes (in the foure yeeres he stayed there) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much improved, not by his care and oversight onely, but by his owne personall, and often labours also with them.</p>
            <p>To these may be added, that whereas by vertue of his Deanry of <hi>Westminster,</hi> his Mastership a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>full and just, that he waved all Letters from great Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, for unsufficient Scholers, and cast aside all favor and affection, and chose onely such as in his judgment were fittest. And lastly (which is not the least in this kind) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many times desired to assist at the election of Scholers, from the free Schooles of the <hi>Merchantaylors,</hi> and from that at Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> of the <hi>Mercers,</hi> and perceiving favour and affection, and other by respects, sometimes to oversway merit, with those to whom the choyce belonged, and that diverse good Scholers were omitted, and others of lesse desert preferred, he of his owne goodnesse, diverse times tooke care for such as were so neglected, and sent them to the University; where he bestowed pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ment upon them.</p>
            <p>To conclude this account of his, take a view of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, in that great place of trust, the <hi>Almo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orship</hi>; which was sufficiently evident (especially to those who attended him neerly.) First, in that he would never suffer one pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that which accrewed to him by that place, to be put or mingled with any of his own Rents or Revenewes (and wherein he kept a more exact account then of his owne private Estate:) and secondly, being so separated, he was
<pb facs="tcp:108343:234"/>
as fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hfull in the disposing of it: not onely in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall trust of his Soveraigne, in the daily charges incident to that place, expended by the <hi>Sub-Almoner</hi> and other yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinary charges; but when he perceived that he had a surplussage (those charges defrayed) he would not suffer it
to lye by him; but some of it he disposed to the reliefe of poore Housekeepers, some in releasing of poore Prisoners, and comforting them which lay in misery and iron; and some in furnishing poore people with Gownes, hose, shooes and the like; for all which, many (so bestowed by him) had he reserved to his owne use (his Patent being <hi>sine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puto</hi>) no man could have questioned him: But he was a faithfull Steward in this, as in the rest, and expected that joyfull <hi>Euge, Well done thou good and faithfull servant, thou hast bin faithfull, &amp;c. enter thou into the joy of thy Lord</hi>; which (no doubt but he possesseth.</p>
            <p>The next is, his Gratitude or thankfulnesse to all, from whom he had received any benefit. Of this vertue of his there are and were lately divers witnesses; as Doctor <hi>Ward</hi> Son to his first Schoolemaster, upon whom he bestowed the Living of <hi>Waltham</hi> in <hi>Hampshire</hi>; and Master <hi>Mulcaster,</hi> his other Schoolmaster, whom he ever reverently respected du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, in all companies, and placed him ever at the upper end of his Table; and after his death, caused his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (having but few other in his House) to be set over hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Study door. And not onely shewed he this outward thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to him, but supplyed his wants many times also, priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly, in a liberall and plentifull manner; and at his owne death (the Father being dead) he bequeathed a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy to his Son of good valune, who as is said before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed a full Scholarship on him in <hi>Pembrooke Hall.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kinred of Doctor <hi>Watts,</hi> after much enquiry, he found onely one, upon whom (being a Scholar) he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ferments in <hi>Pembrooke Hall</hi>; and (he dying there) hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lordship much grieved, that he could heare of no more of that kinred, to whom he might expresse his further thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. And yet he forgat not his Patron Doctor <hi>Watts,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:108343:234"/>
at his end; for by his Will he tooke order, that out of the Scholarships of that Foundation, the two Fellowships which he himselfe Founded (as you shall see by and by) in <hi>Pembrooke Hall,</hi> should be supplyed, if they should be found fit for them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to <hi>Pembrooke Hall</hi> (omitting the Legacies by him bequeathed to the Parishes of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> Saint <hi>Martin Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> where he had dwelt; Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> in <hi>Holborne,</hi> Saint <hi>Saviours</hi> in <hi>Southwarke, All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o Fellowships, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uses in that Colledge, expressed in his Will; besides three hundred such <hi>Folio</hi> Books of his own, to the encrease of that Colledg Library, as were not there before. Together with a guilt Cut and a Bason and Ewer, in all points (as weight, fashion, inscription, &amp;c.) so like to the Cup, Bason and Ewer given about 300. yeers since to that Colledge, by the religious Foundresse thereof, as that not <hi>Ovum Ovo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The fift is, his Munificence and Bounty. To prove which little need be said more, then that which hath bin touched in his bountifull Charity. But besides that, the two famous Universities, and they which then were poore Scholars in them, will witnesse for him in this point; he never coming neer either of them (after he was Bishop) but that he sent to be distributed among poore Scholars, sometimes one hundred po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds, and ever fifty pounds at the least. One thing I cannot passe over in silence; That when King <hi>Iames</hi> was pleased to grace the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> with his presence, in 1617. this reverend Father being present also at the Philosophy Act, he sent (at his departure) to foure of the Disputants forty peeces of Gold, of two and twenty shillings a peece, to be equally divided among them.

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:108343:235"/>
what speake I of these? Was ever Prince better entertained, and in mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e magnificent but orderly manner, then was hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> said Majesty at <hi>Farneham Castle</hi> (one of the Houses belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Bishopricke of <hi>Winchester</hi>) where in the space o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> three dayes he spent three thousand pounds, to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary contentment of his Majesty, and the admiration of all his Followers.</p>
            <p>The next is, his Hospitality: from the first time of his preferment (to meanes of any considerable value) even to his dying day, he was ever Hospitable, and free in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to all people of quality and worthy of respect, especially to Schollars and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trangers; his Table being ever bountifully and neatly f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rnished with provisions and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants answerable; to whom he committed the care of providing and expending in a plentifull yet orderly way: himselfe seldome knowing what meat he had, till he came from his Study to Dinner; at which he would shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so noble in his entertainment, and so gravely faceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that his guests would often professe, they never came to any mans Table, where they received better satisfaction in all points, and that his Lordship kept <hi>Christmas</hi> all the yeer, in respect of the plenty they ever found there. And yet (by the way) take this, that he ever strictly observed in his provisions of dyet, the time of Lent, Embers, and other Fasting dayes, according to the Lawes of this Kingdome, and the orders of the Church.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to speake of the extraordinary great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality he kept, and the large expence he was at, in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of all sorts of people in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at what time he attended King <hi>Iames</hi> thither; the Nobility, Clergy, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and others of both Nations there present, will (as they often already have) speake of it for me, to his exceeding great honour. So that I know not, whether I have fitly couched it under this Head of Hospitality, or whether it had more properly belonged to that of his Munificence and Bounty.</p>
            <p>The seventh, is his Humanity and affability, not onely
<pb facs="tcp:108343:235"/>
to the last mentioned (his Guests) but to every one that did converse with him; for which, not onely divers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scholars and others of this Kingdome, but others of Forraigne parts (as they had just cause) have admired him. As (not to mention Natives) Master <hi>Causabow,</hi> Master <hi>Clu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) Master <hi>Erpenius,</hi> to whom he tendered an Annuall S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipend, to have read and taught here the Orientall tongues (wherein long before his death he himselfe had bin well versed, as may appeare by his Commencement Verses) the experienced Professors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he much delighted in, and did much for them, as Master <hi>Bedwell</hi> (to whom he gave the Vicarage of <hi>Tottenham</hi> in <hi>Midd.</hi>) if living (among others) would testifie. And the reason for this, a late reverend Father of this Church hath given <hi>Omnes quid in se amant, in aliis venerantur</hi>: loving and honoring those gifts in others which he had in himselfe; for among the other parts of his profound Learning, he by his industry, had attained to the knowledge of fifte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne tongues, if not more.</p>
            <p>To these former, may be added his Modesty, which was ever such, that although the whole Christian world tooke especiall notice of his profound and deep learning, yet was he so farre from acknowledging it in himselfe, that he would often complaine of his defects, even to the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, yea vilifying of his owne worth and abilities; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing many times, that he was but <hi>inutilis servas,</hi> nay <hi>inutile pondus</hi>; insomuch, that being preferd by King <hi>Iames</hi> to the Bishopricke of <hi>Chic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ester,</hi> and pretending his owne imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and insufficiency to undergoe such a charge, as also that he might have not onely his Clergy, but all others to take notice thereof, he caused to be engraven about the Seale of his Bishopricke, those words of Saint <hi>Paul, Et ad haec quis idoneus?</hi> and who is sufficient for these things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>One note of his Modesty (mixt with his last vertue of Humanity) may be added, that after his Chaplaines had
<pb facs="tcp:108343:236"/>
Preached in his Chappell before him, he would sometime privately request them, that he might have a sight of their Notes, with very good words and full of encouragement; insomuch, as they would professe of him, that the would never desire a more candid Auditor. So that what was said of <hi>Bede,</hi> may as fitly be said of him; <hi>A pietate modestia, &amp; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitate, nomen</hi> Venerabilis <hi>adeptus est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Indefatigability in Study cannot be paralleld, if we consider him from his Childe hood to his old age. Never any man tooke such paines (or at least spent so much time) in Study, as this reverend Prelate; for even in those dayes, when it might have been supposed he would have taken some ease for his former paines, then also from the houre he arose (his private Devotions finished) to the time he was called to Dinner, which (by his own order) was not till twelve at noone at the soonest, he kept close at his Booke, and would not be interrupted by any that came to speake with him, or upon any occasion (publick Prayer excepted:) Insomuch, that he would be so displeased with Scholars that attempted to speake with him in a morning, that he would say, He doubted they were no true Scholars, that came to speake with him before noon.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, for two or three houres space, he would willingly passe the time, either in discourse with his guests, or other friends, or in dispatch of his own temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or of those, who (by reason of his Episcopall Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction) attended him: and being quit of these and the like occasions, he would returne to his Study, where he spent the rest of the after-noone, even till Bed-time, except some friend tooke him off to Supper, and then did he eat but sparingly.</p>
            <p>Of the fruit of this his seed-time, the world (especially this Land) hath reaped a plentifull harvest, in his Sermons and writings: Never went any beyond him in the first of these [his Preaching] wherein he had such a dexterty, that some would say of him, that he was quicke againe, as soone as delivered: and in this faculty he hath left a patterne
<pb facs="tcp:108343:236"/>
unimitable. So that he was truly stiled <hi>Stella perdicantium</hi>; and an Angell in the Pulpit. And his late Majesty tooke especiall care in causing that volume of his Sermons to be divulged (though but a handfull of those which he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) by enjoying whereof, this kingdome hath an inestimable treasure.</p>
            <p>And for his acutenesse and profundity in writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Adversary, he so excelled all others of his time, that neither <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (champion to the the Romanists) nor any other of them, was ever able to answere what he wrote: So, that as his Sermons were unimitable, his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins were unanswerable.</p>
            <p>To draw to an end of deciphering his vertues, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments: It may truly be said of him, that he had those gifts and graces, both of Art and Nature, so fixed in him, as that this age cannot paralell him; for his profundity, and abisse of learning, was accompanied with wit, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, judgment, Languages, gravity and humility: insomuch that if he had bin Contemporary with the Ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church, he would have bin (and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily) reputed, not inferior to the chiefest among them.</p>
            <p>He generally hated all vices, but three (which he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed sinnes) were most especially odious unto him. First, Usury, from which he was so farre himselfe, that when his friends had need of such money as he could spare, he lent it to them freely, without expectance of ought backe, but the Principall. Secondly, The second was Simony which was so detestable to him, as that for refusing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit diverse men to livings whom he suspected to be Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically preferd, he suffered much by suits of Law: choosing rather to be compelled (against his will) to admit them by Law, then voluntarily to doe that which his conscience made scruple of. And for the livings and other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which fell in his owne gift, he ever bestowed them freely (as you have seene before) upon deserving men, without suit: So that we may say of him as was said long since, concerning <hi>Rober<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning that of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> give leave to adde a particuler passage of his, which happened many yeeres after his said refusall of it, which was this; At a Parliament under King <hi>Iames,</hi> when an Act was to passe, concerning <hi>Sherburne</hi> Castle, it was observed, that onely Bishop <hi>Andrewes</hi> and another gave their Votes against the same. That the other should so doe was not much merveiled at, but that Bishop <hi>Andrewes</hi> should doe it, when none but that other Lord did so, was so remarkeable, as that he was demanded by a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Person, what his reason was for it. To which he most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily replyed, that it could not be well wondred, why he should now vote against that which if he would have yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto (many yeeres before, in the dayes of Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>) he might have had this Bishopricke of <hi>Sarum</hi>: which reason of his, when his late Majesty (being then Prince, and present at the passing of the Act) heard; He be shrewed him, that when he denyed his consent, he did not declare the reason of his denyall also: Professing that had he bin made acquainted with the state of that Case, as now he was, (he would with the King his Fathers good leave) have labored against the passing of the said Act. To close up this point: This reverend Prelate went yet a degree fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in refusing (when he was Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (diverse large and considerable summes, to renew some Leases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he conceived that the renewing of them might be prejudiciall to Succession.</p>
            <p>Now let us lay all these together: His Zeale and Piety: His Charity, and Compassion: His Fidelity, and Integrity: His Gratitude, and Thankfulnesse: His Munificence and Bounty: Hospitality, Humanity, Affability, and Modesty: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to these, His Indefatigability in study, and the fruits
<pb facs="tcp:108343:237"/>
of his labours in his Sermons and Writings, together with hes profundity in all kinde of Learning; his wit, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, judgement, gravity and humility. His detestation of all vices and sinne, <hi>but especially of three.</hi> All which (by couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them onely in this Compend) we have seen in him, as <hi>ex ungue Leonem,</hi> or by <hi>Hercules</hi> foot, his whole body: and consider, whether the Chuech of God in generall, and this in particular, did not suffer an irreparable losse, by his death.</p>
            <p>Having taken a short survey of his Life, let us now see him Dying. He was not often sicke, and but once (till his last sicknesse) in thirty yeers, before the time he dyed, which was at <hi>Downham</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> the ayre of that place not agreeing with the constitution of his body. But there he seemed to be prepared for his dissolution; saying often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in that sicknesse, It must come once, and why not here? And at other times, before and since, he would say, The dayes must come, when, whether we will or nill, we shall say (with the Preacher) <hi>I have no pleasure in them, Eccles.</hi> 12.1. Of his Death he seemed to presage himselfe a yeere before he dyed, and therefore prepared his oyle, that he might be admitted in due time into the Bride Chamber. That of <hi>qualis vita, &amp;c.</hi> was truly verified in him; for as he lived, so dyed he. As his fidelity in his health was great, so encreased the strength of his Faith in his sicknesse. His Gratitude to men, was now changed into his Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to God. His Affability to incessant and devout Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and speech with his Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier. His laborious Studies, to his restlesse groanes, sighes, cryes and teares; his hands labouring, his eyes lifted up, and his heart beating and panting to see the living God, even to the last of his breath. And him (no dobut) he sees face to face, his workes preceding and following him, and he now following the Lambe, crowned with that immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is reserved for every one, that lives such a life as he lived.</p>
            <p>He departed this life <hi>September</hi> 25. 1626. in the seventy

His baptisme was hastned to prevent his death, all looking on him as a weakling, which would post to the grave; whereas he not onely out-lived most of his brethren but even made his Parents to survive in him. His soul was condemn'd to a bad body, his infancy being a continued sicknesse, and the <hi>small pox</hi> being struck into him when a child, (by negligence of the servants suffering him to take cold) occasioned a sore in his leg; and ever after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the day of his death he felt the Admonition of that maladie: for when there was any indisposion in his body, that the malignant humours mustered themselves together, hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Being sent to school he was unhappy in tirannicall Masters, For though he was of that capacity to hold as much and more then they would poure into him, and of that industry, that he refused no labour for learning, yet they were most cruell unto him. One especially, who as of whipping of boyes had been rather his recreation, then their punishment, and he willing to make faults where he could not find them, so punished the naturall weaknesse of <hi>Iunius</hi> for an offence, that it was familiar with him seven times a day to be corrected, truely scoring the number of the <hi>Liberall Sciences</hi> upon him, wherein afterwards he gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sudden alterations to extreames com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prove dangerous: <hi>Iunius</hi> hath now neither Master to fright him, nor father to awe him, nor friend to direct him.

            <p n="5">5. Two dangerous Rocks he was drawn upon, narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scaping the one, but dangerously hitting against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

But by Gods providence he was protected from this temptation, and by Satans sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions solicited to another, who finding his corporall baits not to succeed, did try by a more spirituall way to entice him.</p>

I have heard that supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Exorcistes (who most serve the Divel, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend most to command him) use, or rather abuse this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conjure out evill spirits out of persons possessed. What collusion or confederacy may passe betwixt Sathan and his playmates, I neither doe nor desire to know. This sure I am, that that parcell of Scripture was so sanctified by God to <hi>Iunius,</hi> that it dispossessed his soule, and ejected thence that Atheisticall Fin, formerly lodged therein. And now <hi>Iunius</hi> begins to prefer <hi>Salomons</hi> Proverbs before <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> his Sentences; the Psalmes of <hi>David</hi> before the Odes of <hi>Horace; Ieremies</hi> Lamentations before <hi>Ovid de Tristibus</hi>; in a word, he grew sensible of the majesty in the meanest, of the rich matter in the plaine stile of the Scripture.</p>

            <p>Shortly after, when the <hi>Duke</hi> was taken, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> proclaimed, one Master <hi>Mildmay</hi> was sent to apprehend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Sands,</hi> and to carry him to the Tower of <hi>London</hi>; who coming unto Doctor <hi>Sands,</hi> he told him, that he marvelled that so learned a man as he, should so unadvisedly run himselfe into danger. To whom he answered, I am not ashamed of bonds, but if I could doe as you can doe, I need not to fear bonds; you came downe armed against the Queen, and now you are for the Queen; before a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, now a friend.

            <p>IN the year of our Lord 1530. being the twenty and first of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight (a year very remarkable for the Parliament then held, wherein that proud Prelate Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Wolsey</hi> was attainted, and the first opposition made by the maine body of the the Commons therein assembled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the tirannicall usurpation of the Popish Clergy) was <hi>Iohn Whitgift</hi> born at great <hi>Grimesbie</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from an ancient and worshipfull Family of the <hi>Whitgifts</hi> in <hi>Yorkeshire.</hi> An Unckle he had called <hi>Robert Whitgift,</hi> Abbot of Wellow: who though himselfe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Monk, yet not greaty liked the profession; and was by this his Nephew, therefore heard sometime to say, that they and their Religion could not long continue; for that having read the Scripture over and over again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> he could never finde therein that their Religion was founded by

God: and it is not unlikly, that by the cariage of businesses in the State at that time, being an understanding man, he might shrewdly guesse at those things that shortly after sued.</p>
            <p>Under this his Unckle was he educated together with some other young Gentlemens sonnes for some space of time: and whether taking some hints from him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by some other meanes wrought on, through a secret hand of God, already moulding and preparing him for future employments, he began to grow, though very young yet, into a dislike of Popish superstitions, and to af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Besides this, while he sat at <hi>Worcester,</hi> upon complaint made to the Queens Majesty of many discords and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the two Cathedrall Churches of <hi>Lichfield</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> he was by speciall Commission from her Majesty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Visite them; which accordingly he did, reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them both, and appointing them Statutes for the better and more peaceable government of either.</p>
            <p>Having spent six years at <hi>Worcester,</hi> to the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with the generall good affection of all sorts in those parts, he was now advanced to the highest pitch of dignity that our Church affordeth, being called to succeed that most reverend Father in God, <hi>Grindall,</hi> in the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> For the benefit of which seat also being many wayes much wronged, he travelled as much,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:108343:250"/>
and with as good successe, as for that of <hi>Worcester</hi> he had before done: for which his successors in either remaine beholden to him unto this day. In this height of honour together with his Soveraignes highest favour, he continued during the whole remnant of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, and some small while after King <hi>Iames</hi> his entrance; alwayes constantly maintaining the present Ecclesiasticall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against those that oppugned it; and yet carrying himselfe moderately, as toward all in generall, so toward those also that therein stood out, and holding a good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency with those in foraine parts, as Master <hi>Beza</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, that followed another course of discipline; that which appeareth by diverse letters that passed to and fro betweene them.</p>

Church of Christ, <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> came into the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne at <hi>Vezelia</hi> an ancient Town in the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi>; he was descended from <hi>Petrus a Beza,</hi> being Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the same Town, and <hi>Maria Burdoletia,</hi> both of them being beautified with a lineall proceeding from a Noble and renowned Family.</p>
            <p>His name imposed on him by his Parents imports the <hi>gift of God</hi>; by which act they declared themselves to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and religious; and let the Lord evermore blesse his Church with such gifts, with such painfull labourers, for the gathering in of his great harvest, to his endlesse glory and to the eternall peace of such as seek salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Beza</hi> being yet an infant, not fully two years old, was taken by his Unckle <hi>Nicholas Beza,</hi> being a Councellor pertaining to the Senate of <hi>Paris</hi>; where he was carefully and tenderly brought up for the space of three years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that time acquainted with the knowledge of the Letters.</p>
            <p>Being now five years old, he was committed, through the carefulnesse of his said Unckle, unto the tuition of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Walmarius</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> who at that time taught the Greek tongue at <hi>Aurelia,</hi> under whom he continued for the space of seven years; in which time he attained unto great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection both in the Greeke and Latine tongues; and also, which is more commendable, his tender yeares were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the true knowledge of Christian Piety, being drawn from the pure fountain of the Word of God, by the same man.</p>

For the Lord had prepared him for better things, and opening his eyes, gave him to understand, that these were but so many snares laid to intangle him, and to draw him into everlasting ruine and perdition: wherefore he fully resolved to forsake them all, and to adhere and sticke fast unto that Truth whose sweetnesse he had tasted in his youth; which that he might the better performe, he was fully determined to undergoe any labour, and to remove any obstacle, and for that cause he vowed a vow that he would never embrace nor countenance the errours of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And purposing a constancy in his intended course, and that he might be the better fitted thereunto, he resolved to free himselfe from that affection which useth to be predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in his youth; and for that cause he betroathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto a vertuous woman, acquainting onely two of his intimate friends with the same action, and that for two causes.</p>
            <p>First, that he might give no occasion of offence unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cornfull manner, <hi>Philosophum novum,</hi> the new Philosopher.</p>
            <p>These checks and reprehensions of his friends being secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the considerations of the great riches wherewith he was endewed, and these two being strengthned with the temptation of of the Divell; yeelded to many doubts and oppositions unto <hi>Beza,</hi> notwithstanding his former resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, sometimes intending to embrace God and his truth, somtimes casting an eye of love on his present preferments being taken up with this various disposition, it pleased the Lord to settle his inconstant minde by afflicting him with sicknesse, which indeed was the cause of his spirituall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and health, for he well perceiving that it was the powerfull hand of the Lord Almighty, against which there was no contending: after the suffering of many torments both inward and outward, he fell into a detestation and loathing hatred of his owne backwardnesse, and turning himselfe unto the Lord with teares, he renewed that vow which he had formerly made concerning the embracing of the true worship of God, promising unfainedly that he would never start from it, but consecrate himselfe wholly unto him, and unto the furtherance of his glory, if it would please him to restore him to his former health: during the time of this sicknesse he was often heard to utter those Words of <hi>David</hi> in his 142. <hi>Psalme</hi> v. 7. <hi>Educ de carcere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam meam ut celebrem nomen tuum.</hi> Bring my soul out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son O Lord that I may praise thy name; &amp; indeed the Lord which cannot withstand the prayers of the faithfull, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discending unto him, and he obtayned his desire of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And being recovered, he forthwith forsooke Countrey Parents and friends, to follow Christ; he forsooke all his preferments, preferring the glory of God and the hope of his Kingdome before all the transitory glory of the world:
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:108343:253"/>
which action of his is very remarkable, if we consider but the circumstance of time, which was presently upon his recovery, being fearfull that his remaining there should be offensive unto God, or that his familiarity with his friends might draw him into the like inconveniences, who without doubt would labour with might and maine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to his former profession.

            </p>
            <p>At that time in <hi>Lausanna</hi> were famous for Learning and Piety <hi>Petrus Viretus</hi> Pastor of the Church, <hi>Iohannes Ribbilus</hi> Professor of Divinity, <hi>Iohannes Racmundus Merlinus</hi> Professor of the Hebrew tongue, with many other excellently well gifted; all of which seemed as it were to be ravished with the society of this worthy member of Christ.</p>
            <p>During his Lectureship at <hi>Lausanna,</hi> a great company of godly minded persons thirsting after Christ and his truth, resorted unto the same place. Here <hi>Beza</hi> perceiving a good occasion offered unto him by God, not onely for his owne sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He began publickly and in the <hi>French</hi> tongue to expound the Epistle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and both the Epistles of S. <hi>Peter</hi>; opening unto them the great mysteries of godlinesse, and informing their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with such Doctrines, wherby the scales of ignorance being rubbed away, the truth did manifestly appeare unto
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:108343:254"/>
them, whereby (without doubt) many were drawn neerer and neerer unto Christ.</p>
            <p>Amongst these his imployments in this place, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any leasure was given unto him, he would spend that time with Master <hi>Calvin</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> from whom he received great benefit both for Gods glory and the edification of the Church; and by his perswasion he was induced to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish that excellent and Divine Commentary on the <hi>Psalms,</hi> first begun by <hi>Marotus,</hi> which was also Printed and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by authority in <hi>France,</hi> 1561.</p>

last, as he himselfe testified unto the Queene, and was also embraced by her selfe.</p>
            <p>The conference being ended with happy successe to the glory of God, and furtherance of his truth, <hi>Martyr</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Tigurum,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> intended to goe unto <hi>Geneva,</hi> but he was hindred by the Authority of the Queen who plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him, that seeing he was a <hi>French</hi> man, he might be the Author of much good unto his own Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beza</hi> being thus detained contrary to his expectation, spent not the time unprofitably but betook himselfe unto the preaching of the Word, sometimes in the Pallace of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> sometimes in the house of the Prince <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus,</hi> and sometimes in the suburbes of the City of <hi>Paris</hi>: for then it was by publick Proclamation decreed, that the use of the reformed Religion should be tolerated in the suburbes without any Molestation; but they enjoyed not that benefit long, by reason of a conspiracy performed by <hi>Guisius,</hi> and other wicked persons for the utter extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth; who urging the King with the example of <hi>Balderinus,</hi> that Religion was but a thing indifferent, and that he might condemne and renounce the day after that which he approved and allowed the day before; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this answer from him; That he would never put hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whereupon a hot persecution entred into the bowels of <hi>France,</hi> against the Protestants, forty five of them being put to the sword, in the same place where they were gathered together to heare the Word of God preacht; whereupon <hi>Beza</hi> was sent to complaine unto the King of their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane cruelty, but found no redresse; whereupon prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to defend themselves by force of Armes; the Prince <hi>Condaeus</hi> desired <hi>Beza</hi> to remaine with him in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and necessary a season, who although<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

consents unto the request of this religious Prince, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with him, preaching and exhorting Christians pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, to a patient wayting of the Lords leasure.</p>
            <p>The Protestants betook themselves unto <hi>Orleans,</hi> to which place the enemies marching, in the fields thereof was fought a terrible battle, wherein <hi>Condaeus</hi> was taken prisoner and the Protestants lost the day, who (notwithstanding this sorrowfull accident) were much comforted by those divine letters which were sent unto them by <hi>Beza,</hi> and they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining firme in that doctrine which they had received.</p>
            <p>Not long after a peace being concluded, and the prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers restored to their former liberty, <hi>Beza</hi> obtained leave of the same Prince to returne unto <hi>Geneva,</hi> after he had spent two and twenty monthes with great labour, and manifest dangers of his life.</p>
            <p>Comming to <hi>Geneva,</hi> not without the great joy of the Inhabitants, he went forward in his ordinary course of teaching both in the Church and Schoole, continued with Master <hi>Calvin</hi> in reading the Divinity Lecture untill his death, then he performed it onely himselfe, appointing <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladonus Danaeus</hi> and <hi>Fayus,</hi> to be the Humanity Lecturers in the same City.</p>
            <p>And in this godly couse he laboriously continued, untill the time that he was called unto <hi>Rupella,</hi> by the generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty and request of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, and earnest desire of the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and of other Peeres of <hi>France,</hi> where the confession of the faith of the <hi>French</hi> Churches was repeated and confirmed, and strenthned with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Condaeus</hi>; and so he returned to <hi>Geneva</hi> againe, and indefatigably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his constant course of teaching, and then he corrected his Annotations on the New Testament.</p>

            <p>Yet here by the way we may observe the great malice of the Romish Jesuites, who before the payment of his debt to nature, scandalized him with a defection to the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; not much unlike that which was of late cast on that reverend Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> but this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent untruth was refuted by the Pastors of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who by their writings and subscriptions of their names, both in Latine and French, testified the contrary unto the world; many of them being present at his death, who on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October,</hi> in the year of our Lord 1605. being the Lords day, rising early and calling his family to prayers; which don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He was of stature somwhat tall, but corpulent or bigge boned; in his age he had a long thick beard as white as snow, he had a grave Senators countenance, broad faced, but not fat, and in generall by his comely person sweet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability and gravity, he would have exhorted reverence from those that least loved him.</p>

It was his manner every Tearm to begin his Lectures with an exhortatory Oration to his auditors: of these his elegant paraeneticks, two were published in print by himselfe, the other were since his death put forth by <hi>Henry Iackeson</hi> Fellow of the same Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; of these later an intilligent reader will give a like censure to that of the Oratour, <hi>sunt tantuam phidiae Minerva sed tumen ex eadem efficina</hi>; they are not like the other two his malter his pieces, yet any man may perceive they were drawne with the same pensill. Whilest he continued this Lecture it was his hap as it had been of <hi>Politian,</hi> and <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> before him to tread upon a nest of Hornets, a sort of wrangling Sophisters bred of the excrements of the Dunsticall Commenters upon <hi>Aristotle,</hi> fed advocates to plead for all his Phylosophicall errours, and sworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all polite learning; these he so strongly confuted in his Lectures, and faceciously derided in his Orations, that any ingenuous man that peruseth them, be he a <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Agelastus</hi> will be in like manner affected, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> was when he read the Booke intituled <hi>Epistolae obscurorum viro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>; at which he fell into such a laughter, that he much hurt his spleen and endangered his health.</p>

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:108343:258"/>
a strange <hi>Duell,</hi> much like to that of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> wherein <hi>both conquered one the other, yet neither enjoyed the victory,</hi> nor kept his prisoner; for <hi>Iohn Reinolds,</hi> who before was a Papist, by these bickerings became a zealous Protestant, and <hi>William Reinolds</hi> who before had been a zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, became a <hi>Iesuited</hi> Papist, and wrote most pestilent Bookes against the Church and State; and as after the death of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> when their corps were burnt, the flames are said to have parted: so the contention of these Brethren expired not with their death; for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which they have left behinde them, enflamed with <hi>contrary fires</hi> of zeale, hold the quarrell on foot to this day.

therein <hi>Oregen,</hi> surnamed <hi>Adamantius</hi>; he was so well seene in all Arts and Sciences as if he had spent his whole time in each of them; moreover for his vertue, probaty, integrity, and which is above all, piety and sanctity of life; he was so eminent and conspicuous that as <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> speaketh of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> it might be said of him, to name <hi>Reinolds</hi> is to commend vertue it selfe.

            <p>For he brought the Colledge much before hand, which before through the covetousnesse of the Governours or negligence of inferiour officers, was very much impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he procured an Act of Parliament for assuring some lands to it: he caused diverse ambiguous Statutes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the visitor Doctor <hi>Bilson</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winton,</hi> and all the Statutes to be more duely observed then ever they had beene before.

               </gap>ey in the dark, and but for him might so have done in everlasting oblivion; as also for the publishing of many writings and works both of his owne and other mens.</p>
            <p>He was borne in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> his Parents but of meane estate, nor free from Romish superstition, that then generally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verspread the whole surface of this realme; by meanes of of their poverty and geeat charge being overburdened with a numerous issue, through the advice and perswasion of some of their blinde leaders (such as those dayes afforded) perceiving the towardlinesse that then appeared in him yet a child, being but twelve years of age, he was placed in the Convent of Carmelite Fryars at <hi>Norwich</hi>: In which place, as also afterward in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (whither he was from thence removed) he gave himself to the study of the Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and of Divinity, such as in those time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e publikely professed.</p>
            <p>But when the light of the Gospell, which had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the most part been smothered and supprest, began now to break forth, by the instigation of that right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and truly Noble Lord (for it is vertue and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety alone that affordeth true Nobility) the Lord <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
               <pb n="504" facs="tcp:108343:271"/>
he diverted his studies and applyed himselfe now, not to rake any longer in those muddy streames, and miry puddles of Divinity falsly so tearmed, which he had plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe in before; but to repaire directly to the well-head, to betake himselfe to the fource of all true knowledg, to search into the written Word of God, where he might be sure to finde the waters cleane and cleere, free from all impurity and mixture of humane invention; therein to dive, and thence to draw that which he might both drink deepe of himselfe, and impart of to others without damage and detriment to himsele.</p>
            <p>That which also accordingly he did. For not content to sell his owne cistorns, and satisfie out of it his owne thirst, he was desirous that what he had there drawn, should be derived also unto others, and should flow out to the like benefit and behafe unto them, as he had thereby formerly received himselfe, To this purpose he betooke himselfe now to the pulpit; and what light of truth he had by his private studies, and Gods blessing upon them attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he made known in publike to those that heard him.</p>
            <p>And having now wholly shooke of that yoake of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer superstitions profession (as the Word of God warrent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the Apostle in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch case adviseth) he tooke him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wife one <hi>Dorothy</hi> by name, &amp; that name well deserving; a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man piously affected, &amp; one that aboad constantly with him, an inseparable and individuall companion and copartner with him in all his troubles and exilments, which began shortly after to ensue.</p>
            <p>For through the malignity of those, who neither loved the light themselves, and indevoured to keepe others from fight of that which themselves neither loved nor liked, as being that which discovered their grosse errors and foul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, he was quickly called in question, and much troubled and molested; first at <hi>Yorke</hi> by <hi>Lee</hi> there Archbissiop (<hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his great, though unequall antagonist) for Preaching at <hi>Doncaster</hi> against invocation of Saints: and after that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Stokesley</hi> their Bishop, (the maine opposer
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:108343:271"/>
of <hi>Ales</hi> the Scot, <hi>Bales</hi> intimate friend afterward, in defence of Popish errours and inventions) for matters of the like nature.</p>
            <p>Thus he soone found opposition, and met with much trouble (as what other was to be looked for?) for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and publishing the truth of God, which could not yet be brooked, having so many, so mighty, and those no lesse malitious opponets.</p>
            <p>Howbeit he escaped, as well then, as oft after also out of their hands; God having still some further employments for him. For having by some elegant and pleasant Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which he presented unto him, insinuated himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the notice and favor of the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was then grown to some greatnesse, being a favouror of the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h and the professors of it, he was by his meanes, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> sometimes by <hi>Ahikams,</hi> rescued out of their clutches (who otherwise would in likelehood, have crushed him) and continued quiet, while he stood.</p>
            <p>But after his unfortunate downfall and death, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God his chiefe, yea alone protector, perceiving that though their former attempts against him had for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent been frustrate, yet their spite and malice towards him was enraged rather then abated, ready to break forth into action againe, when opportunity should serve; that means of restraint being now removed, and persecution about the six Articles (commonly known by name of <hi>the whip with six strings</hi>) growing hot; he thought it his best and wisest course (the rather being tied to no particular charge) to leave the Land untill times of more freedome might be, and to get over into <hi>Germany,</hi> where by <hi>Luther</hi> and other his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants seconds their labours, many Churches had been establshed, and much liberty was afforded for the sincere profession of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>Unto that common refuge and receptacle of Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted people in those times, with much difficulty and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, at length he gat and there aboad as an exile for some eight yeares. During which time he was not idle, but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:108343:272"/>
employed himselfe in writing and in publishing of many Treatises, tending most to the discovery of Romish errors, superstitions, idolotries and abominable practises, and to the manifestation and clearing of Gods saving truth.</p>
            <p>Thence upon the decease of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, being by his religious Son and successor King <hi>Edward</hi> called over againe, and entertained a while in the family of that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pious <hi>Poynet</hi> then bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>; he was shortly after by his Maiesty preferred unto and setled in the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Ossar</hi> in <hi>Ireland:</hi> whither being sent over freely at the Kings owne charge, he was consecrated at <hi>Dublin</hi> by <hi>George</hi> Archbishop of that See, assisted by <hi>Thomas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and <hi>Vrhane</hi> of <hi>Doune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Seat he sate quietly Preaching Christ and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him alone to his people, and laboring to withdraw them from Popish superstitions, during the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> by whom he was there seated, expending most of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Episcopal revenew over &amp; above the necessary expence of his family any reliefe of the poore, in furnishing himselfe with books of almanner of learning, such especielly as were then rare &amp; not ordinarily to be had, as well manuscrips as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ones; partly to preserve the perishing Monuments of antiquity, and partly from them to receive further &amp; fuller information of the occurrents &amp; carryages of former times: and what a multitude of Authors he had in that short time gathered togeter, may appeare by a Catalogue of them left upon record by him, in the close of that laborious Work of his, his <hi>Centuries,</hi> to shew what a treasure he was stripped of at his expulsion from his place.</p>
            <p>For after that <hi>halfe hours silence</hi> (as he stileth it, alluding to that of Saint <hi>Iohn Apoc.</hi> 8.1.) and those few years of rest that Gods people here enjoyed under that blessed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Christ King <hi>Edward</hi>; his succeeding sister raising up new tumults and with fire and fogot making havock of the faithfull; that seat grew too hot for him. And having therefore (as his owne relation hath it) his books and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:108343:272"/>
seized on (as once before) his servants some of them slain, others misused, and himselfe laid for, he was enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his wife, his ever undivided consort, to flye for his life; and purposed as himselfe saith, to have shaped his course for <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping there to finde some succour, as diverse others driven hence at that time did. But man we say purposeth, and God disposeth: that project of his took not effect, God it seemeth intended him another way; for b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out to sea, he was intercepted &amp; surprised by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pirates sea-robbers, of whom though he were stript a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and abused in most inhumane manner, (as little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be expected at the hands of such) yet was he by Gods good providence preserved among them, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againe from them, being ransomed by certaine chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and well-minded Merchants.</p>
            <p>Having regained his liberty, he gat safe againe into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> his former place of retreat, and the then Common sanctuary of Gods afflicted and distressed Saints. There he found entertainment with, and enjoyed the acquaintance of, most of the prime men of note for learning and relegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those parts in those times, who some of them in their writings, especially for the notes of antiquity, and of authors both ours and others, doe professe to have received no small light from his writings and observations.</p>
            <p>For during the time of his aboad in those parts, among other his labours (being never out of action) he compiled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat vast <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Euglish Scottish and Irish writers,</hi> a work of exceeding great paines and industry, that many of them and others since have made much use of: wherin also by the way he hath inserted the lives, Acts and carriages of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Popes</hi>; that the world might see and know, what manner of men, or monsters rather, many of them have been, and how far unlike unto Christ, who yet have given themselves out to be <hi>Christs Vicars,</hi> and the chiefe pillars of his Church.</p>
            <p>Shor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly after the happy entrance of that blessed Princess Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when the storm raised by her sister <hi>Mary</hi> was now
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:108343:273"/>
laid, he returned over again into <hi>England</hi>: &amp; as it semeth, stept over from thence into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to visit (it may be) his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flock (if any faithfull of them were remaining yet) there; or to looke after his library, if he might light upon any remaines of it in those places where it had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in the hands of those that had seazed upon it. But he survived not long to enjoy either the peaceable times of Gods Church here re-established, or the comfort of his people, if he found any left there, or the use and benefit of his books, if he recovered any of them.</p>
            <p>For it is by some reported, that he dyed in <hi>Ireland</hi> at sixty and seven yeers of age, in the year of our Lord 1558. which yet for the year of his decease may seeme not so to be: since that his <hi>Catalogue</hi> or <hi>Centuries</hi> of our Brittin <hi>Writers,</hi> Printed by him at <hi>Basile,</hi> while he yet aboad in those parts, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by himselfe to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then setled in the throne of this kingdome, who began her raigne but in the latter part of that year: besides that the latter part of that impression beareth date the Month of <hi>February</hi> 1559. as al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it may well be admired, how being so haunted, hunted, chased and hurried as he was from pillar to post, and so oft stript both of bookes and other helps, he could come to the sight and view of so many Authors; much more, how he should have time to surveigh such a multitude of them, as by his writings it appeareth he did; and most of all, how he should be able to write so many volumes (to goe no further) as you see here related, although some of them were but small.

            <p>There being entered he so carried himselfe, and gave so good proofes of his parts and pregnancy, that within a few months he was chosen Scholler of the house, having a Bible-Clearkes place conferred upon him, and so his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eased of her charge. Having after that taken his first degrees, and being made Fellow of the house, he began to addict himselfe mainely unto the study of Divinity, and therein made good progresse.

During his abode there, Satan working in corrupt nature, sought oft to trap him in his snares, but as himself testifies, the Lord in mercy forgave the vanities and ignorances of his youth, and preserved him from such fals as might have made him a shame to the Saints, and a reproach to his enemies.</p>
            <p>At the age of sixteen years, he returned to his Parents at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> who propos'd to him sundry courses of life: but his heart was still enclined to the study of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereupon he resolved to goe into <hi>England,</hi> and the Lord provided him a place at <hi>Hoddesdon,</hi> 18. mils from <hi>London</hi> (just as he had spent all his mony which he brought with him out of <hi>Scotland</hi>) where he was entertained by one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Gut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At nineteen years old he returned againe to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he lived with his elder brother [then one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in that City] who much furthered him in his former studyes: at last he was required to give a proofe of his gifts privately, which he did in the New Church before Master <hi>Robert Pont,</hi> and Master <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> and some others, by whom he was commanded to Preach in publick also. Being
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:108343:299"/>
twenty years old he was sent by the authority of the general Assembly which met at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to be the Pastor at <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenner</hi> in <hi>Sterlingshire</hi>; when he came thither he found in the Church, besides ruinous wals, neither roof nor doors, nor Pulpit, nor seats, nor windows, yet it pleased God to give such a blessing to his ministery, that within halfe a year the Parishioners of their owne accord, built, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned the Church in as good a quality as any round about it: There he continued seven or eight years, yet subject to great bodily infirmities, by reason of the wetnesse of the soyl, and the moystnesse of the ayre: and in that time did God begin to acquaint him with his terrors, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tentations, so that his life was almost wasted with heavinesse; yet thereby he learned more, and more to know Christ Jesus. About that time there was a Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Church at <hi>Perth,</hi> unto which some that lived in the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> sent to desire that a Minister might be sent unto them; whereupon the Assembly appointed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Cowper</hi> for that place, and accordingly wrote to him by Master <hi>Patrick Simpson,</hi> who comming to <hi>Sterling,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him the letters from the Assembly, and the Town, containing his calling to the Ministry of that place; and shortly after the Towne sent their Commissioners to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himselfe and family thither. In that place he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doing the work of the Lord for nineteen years together, where he was a comfort to the best, and a wound to the worser sort: Besides the Sabbath dayes, he chose thrice a week to convene the people together in the Evenings, <hi>viz.</hi> Wednesdayes, Fridayes and Saturdayes, for preparation to the Sabbath, upon which dayes they had no Preaching in the morning: concerning which meetings, himselfe writes, <hi>That it would have don a Christians heart good, to have seen those glorious and joyfull Assemblies, to have heard the zealous cryings to God amongst that people, with sighings and tears, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts, and mourning eyes</hi>: and concerning himselfe, he saith, <hi>My witnesse is in heaven that the love of Iesus, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made continuall Preaching my pleasure, and I had no such joy as in

               </gap>he time of his aboad there (except some little intermissions and breathing times) the Lord still exercised him with inward tentations, and great variety of spirituall combats; the end of all which (th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In the middest of these wrestlings with God he wanted not combats with wicked men also, but the greatnesse of his inward conflicts made him lightly regard all their outward contradictions, and to esteem them but as the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a Flea. It was no marvell to see Satan stir up his wicked instruments to molest him, since he professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a disquieter of him and his Kingdome; and this much supported him, that he never had a controversie with any of them but for their sins; and the Lord assisting him, the power of the Word did so hammer downe their pride, that they were all of them at last brought to an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their evill wayes.</p>
            <p>But at length (as God turned the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when the time drew on f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

so by little and litle, did the zeal and love of most of that people fall away, so that his last conflict was not with the prophane, but with Justiciaries &amp; such as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebukeable in their lives: These men were stuffed with such pride, self-conceit, disdain, and intolerable contempt, that thereby they were carried further from their duty th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n any of the former, and which should have been his greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, were his greatest crosse.</p>
            <p>Presently hereupon God called him to the Government of the Churches in <hi>Galloway,</hi> in the South-West parts of the Kingdome, being chosen by the Assembly, and presented by the King thereunto: this was effected with out his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, or ambitious seeking after it; yea, he was so far from it that eightteen weeks passed betwixt the Kings Presentation, and the Acceptation of it. In that place he was very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to advance the Gospel, &amp; to adorne his Ministery: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the frame of his Spirit thus he writs: <hi>My soul is alway in my hand, ready to be offered to my God: Where, or what kinde of death God hath prepared for mee, I know not: But sure I am, there can no evill death befall him that lives in Christ, nor sudden death to a Christian Pilgrim, who</hi> (<hi>with</hi> Job) <hi>waites every day for his change: yea</hi> (saith he) <hi>many a day have I sought it with tears, not out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, distrust or per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This faithfull servant of God, who had alwayes beene faithfull and painfull in his Ministery, when sicknesse grew daily upon him, was no way deficient in the duty of his ordinary Preaching: taking great pains also to perfect his worke upon the <hi>Revelations</hi>; which he desired greatly to finish before his death: he had also much griefe by reason of some that disturb'd the peace of the Church, which he always sought to procure: so that his infirmity encreasing, he was compelled to keep home: yet as his weaknesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he applyed himselfe to revise his writings, and to dispose of his worldly estate, that he might be ready for his passage, which every day he expected: and some ten dayes before his decease, he manifested to his friends what great

               <hi>JOhn Piscator</hi> was born at <hi>Argentine, Anno Christi</hi> 1546. at which time <hi>Germany</hi> was on fire with civill Wars: Yet that hindred not, but he followed his studyes very hard, and profited exceedingly in learning: when he came to the study of Logick, with great felicity, he joyned <hi>Ramus</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> together: And afterwards having made a good progresse in the study of Divinity, he was called to <hi>Herborn</hi> to be the Professor there, and his labors were so gratefull to young Students, that many flocked thither out of <hi>Germany, France, Hungary, Poland</hi> and other Nothern Countries: He wrote many things with great diligence and labor, scarce affording any rest to himselfe: He transl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was very able, and very ready to confer with, and to resolve the doubts of such as came him: He bare such a tender love to that great people over which God had set him, that though his means was small, and he had many offers of great preferment in the Church, yet he would not leave them.

And a good while before his latter end, God gave him victory over his greatest corruptions, which for a long time kept him in continuall exercise. About eight weeks before his death, he was much troubled with a cough and shortnesse of breath, which much weakned him, yet he Preached divers times, till his encreasing weaknesse disabled him. In his sicknesse he gave heavenly and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some counsell to his people, neighbours and friends that came to visit him, exhorting them to labor to redeem the time, to be much reading, hearing, and Meditating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word of God; much in prayer, brotherly love, and communion of Saints, and that they would be carefull to hold that fast that he had taught them out of the Word of Truth, and that whil'st the the meanes of Salvation was to be had, they would neither spare pains nor cost to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it. His pains towards his end were very great, yet he bore them patiently. He was much in ejaculations and lifting up his heart to God in behalfe of the Church and State, and for himselfe also, wherein he was most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and earnest a little before his death. A godly friend &amp; Minister praying with him, that if his time were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, God would be pleased to restore him for the good of his Church, or if otherwise, that he would put an end to his pains, if he saw good; he lifting up his eyes sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly towards heaven and one of his hands, in the close of that prayer gave up the Ghost, shutting his eyes himself, as if he were fallen into a sweet sleep, <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. and of
