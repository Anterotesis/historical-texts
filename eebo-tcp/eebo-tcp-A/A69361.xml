         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We <hi>Robert,</hi> Earle of Essex, &amp; Ewe, Uiscount Hereford, lord Ferrers of Chartley, Bourghcer, and Louane, &amp;c. And <hi>Charles</hi> lorde <hi>Howard,</hi> Baron of Effingham, Lord high Admirall of England, &amp;c. hauing the charge of a Royall Nauy of Ships, prepared and sent to the Seas, by the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Princesse the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> Queene of England, France, and Ireland, &amp;c. doe giue all men knowledge, that the said Nauy vnder our charge is by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie prepared and sent to serue on the Seas, for defence of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Realmes, Dominions, and Subiects, against such mightie Forces, as we are aduertised from all partes of Christendome, to be already prepared by the King of Spaine, and by further prouisions of Men and Ships dayly sent for, are to be mightily increased, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade

her Maiesties Realmes: as heretofore in the yeere of our Lord 1588. was attempted (euen when there was a Treatie continued by both their Commissioners for a Peace) with a greater Army then euer before in his time was set to the Seas: though by Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the valour and wisedome of her Noble and faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, the same was notably made frustrate. And because her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie hath good intelligence of perfite amitie with all Kings and Princes of Christendome, sauing with the King of Spaine, who hath this many yeeres most vniustly professed openly great enimitie by diuers actions, both against her Royall person, and her people, and Countries, without any iust cause first giuen on her Maiesties part. Therefore we the saide Earle, and Lord Admirall, doe ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all persons, that wee are most straightly commaunded by her excellent Maiestie to forbeare from offending in this our Uoyage of any maner of persons of what Nation soeuer, except the said Kings naturall Subiects, or such others borne Strangers, as shall giue to the said King manifest aide, with Men, Ships, Artillerie, Uictual, and other Warlike prouisions for inuasion of her Maiestie. Which her Maiesties commandement we meane duetifully to obserue: and doe therefore giue straight charge to al persons that shal serue in this Nauy vnderneath vs, vpon paine of extreme punishment to obserue the same. Yet to auoyde all occasions that may breede question, who they are, being not the King of Spaines Subiects, that shalbe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by vs to be manifest aiders for the furnishing and strengthening of the said Kings forces, prouided either by land or Sea, to attempt any inuasion of her Maiesties Countries: We do for the liquidation of this doubt, earnestly in Gods Name, require and charge all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that are not the saide Kings naturall Subiects, and yet that haue giuen him ayde with their Ships, Uictuall, and Munition, as is aboue saide, to withdrawe all their said Shippes prepared for the warre, and all their prouisions of hostilitie out of any Hauens of Spaine, or Portugall, or from the company and seruice of the Kings Ships against our Nauy, and therewith to returne either to their owne Countries, or if they so shall like to come to our Nauy: to whom in the reuerend name of our Soueraigne Lady the Queenes Maiestie, we doe promise all securitie, both for their persons and

gdods to be vsed and defended as friends, and to suffer al their Ships and prouisions, that were either taken by the King of Spaine, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for his seruice, or that shall bee by the owners withdrawen from his ayde, to remaine in their owne free dispositions, so as the same be vsed in all sortes as friendes, and not as enemies to the Queenes Maiestie, and to vs her Generals. And if any shall vpon knowledge of this her Maiesties most honourable order, and of our promise (to obserue the same as fauourably as wee may) willingly and manifestly refuse to accept this our offer, and shall not endeuour themselues to perfourme this reasonable request, tending to their good and libertie, wee shall then be iustly moued, as by the lawe of Armes we may, to take and vse all such so refusing this our offer, as manifest ayders of the King of Spaine, with forces to inuade her Maiesties Dominions, and so manifest Enemies: and in such case of that refusall, if any harme shall happen by any attempt against their Persons, Ships, &amp; Goods by any our Nauie, for the ayding of the said King: there shall be no iust cause for them hereafter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, or to procure their naturall Princes and Lords to sollicite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions or amends for the same. And for the more notification hereof, we haue thought good to haue the Originall hereof to bee signed with our hands and with our seales, to bee seene by any that will require to reade or see the same: And likewise wee haue put the same in Print, in French, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish, and haue also caused the same to bee distributed into as many Ports of Spaine and Portugall, as conueniently might be for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge to bee had in the saide Portes, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in all other Partes vnder his subiection.</p>
