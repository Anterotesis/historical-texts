            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

maintain, that among all the severall fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that in these times have exercised the most nice and curious judgements, there hath not come forth any thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be welcom'd into the world with greater estimation and applause: And though he hath not had the fortune to be so generally fam'd abroad, as many others, perhaps, of lesse esteeme, yet this is a consideration that cannot at all dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, but rather advance his credit; For by breaking forth of obscurity he will attract the higher admiration, and like the Sun emerging from a Cloud appeare at length with so much the more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rayes. Had there been nothing extant of him but his History of <hi>Scotland,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but the Language, how florid and ornate it is; consider the order, and the prudent conduct of his Story, and you will ranke him in the number of the best writers, and compare him even with <hi>Thuanus</hi> himselfe.

all those graces met together that conduce any thing toward the making up of a compleat and perfect Poet, a decent and becomming Majesty, a brave and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable height, and a wit so flowing, that <hi>Jove</hi> himselfe never dranke Nectar that sparkled with a more spritly lustre; should I dwell any longer (ingenuous Reader) upon the commendation of this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Author, I should injure, thee by forestalling the freedome of thy owne judgement, and him by attempting a vain designe, since there is nothing can so well set him forth as his own works; besides the losse of time which is but trifled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way so long as thou art detained from perusing the Poems themselves.</p>

                  <l>WHat course of life should wretched Mortals take?</l>
                  <l>In Books hard Questions large contention make;</l>
                  <l>Care dwels in Houses, Labour in the Field,</l>
                  <l>Tumultuous Seas affrighting dangers yield.</l>
                  <l>In Forraine Lands thou never canst be blest;</l>
                  <l>If rich, thou art in feare; if poore, distrest.</l>
                  <l>In Wedlock frequent discontentments swell;</l>
                  <l>Unmarried persons as in Deserts dwell.</l>
                  <l>How many troubles are with Children borne?</l>
                  <l>Yet he that wants them, counts himselfe Forlorne.</l>
                  <l>Young men are wanton, and of wisdome voyd:</l>
                  <l>Gray haires are cold, unfit to be employ'd.</l>
                  <l>Who would not one of those two offers try,</l>
                  <l>Not to be borne: or, being borne, to dye?</l>
