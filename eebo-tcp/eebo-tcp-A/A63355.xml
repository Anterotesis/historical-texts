            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heir Cruell and Damnable Deſigne, was firſt to have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the Caſtle of Dublin upon the 23. day of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Anno predicto, upon a Saturday; the ſame night all the Popiſh houſes were to be marked with a Croſſe to be knowne from the Proteſtants houſes, their intent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Sunday following to have ſurpriſed all the proteſtants and to have ſtript them naked, as they did many thouſands of men, women and children in other parts of the kingdome of Ireland upon the ſame day, and alſo to have ſurpriſed all the Engliſh ſhipping, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at Anchor at a Harbor commonly called the Rings End, about a mile diſtant from the City of Dublin. But God that ſaw their bloudy intent diſcovered their practice by one of their owne faction ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to run on in their owne wicked hope and cruell imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, untill the night before their practiſe ſhould have bin put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, for the ſame night the Lord Mack-Gueere an Iriſh man, and Captaine Mack-Mahowne alſo an Iriſh man (who confeſſed the whole plot) were apprehended, the one in Cookſtreet within the City of Dublin, the other neere Dublin in Saint Mary Abby in the ſuburbes of the ſame City, both which have been ever ſince impriſoned in the Caſtle of Dublin, and doe ſtill remaine there: what man ſo blind as may not herein ſee the finger of God, and how their malitious hearts are bent to ſhed innocent bloud, that notwithſtanding they have ſo often failed in their wicked and bloudy purpoſes and intents both private and publik, which they have ſecretly attempted in darkneſſe will take no warning, but ſtill run on in their bloud-thirſtines, to extirpate whole ſtates, to ſuppreſſe the truth, and to ſhed the bloud of Gods Saints, the Lord confound their devices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>It is too manifeſt that the Ieſuits thoſe firebrands of hell, and Popiſh

prieſts were the plotters of this and other Treaſons, which can at their pleaſure abſolve ſubjects of their obedience to their princes, and give power to murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and depoſe Kings, neither could they worke upon a more rebellious and forward Nation to doe miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>The Iriſh is well knowne to be a people both proud and envious, for the commonaltie they are for the moſt part ignorant and illiterate, Lazie and poore, and will rather begge then worke, and therefore fit ſubjects for the Ieſuits, to ſpur on upon ſuch bloody Actions, for Ignorance is without mercy, for never was it heard or knowne, that ever Turk or Infidell did ever uſe a Chriſtian ſo unmercifully as they have uſed the Engliſh proteſtants, who have releived them, and kept them from ſtarving,</p>
            <p>It is too well knowne (the more is the pittie and to be lamented) that they have murthered, and ſtarved to death of the Engliſh in the province of Vlſter and other provinces where they are riſen up in bellion, of men, women and Children above 20000.</p>
            <p>Their manner is and hath beene, cowardly and trecherouſly to ſurpriſe them upon great advantages, and without reſpect of perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to rob them of all they have, but being not content therewith (but as inſatiable of bloud) hunting after their pretious lives, ſtript Ladyes, and gentlewomen, Virgins and Babes, old and young, naked as ever they were borne, from their clothes, turning them into the open fields, (where having firſt deſtroyed the husbands and Parents, before their wives and childrens faces) many hundreds have beene found dead in ditches with cold for want of food and rayment, the Iriſh having no more compaſſion of their age or youth, then of Doggs.</p>
            <p>As for the proteſtant Miniſters, thoſe they take (which have been many) they uſe them with ſuch cruelty, as it would make any heart to melt into teares that doth but heare this relation; Their manner is firſt to hang them up, and then they cut off their heads, after they quarter them, then they diſmember their ſecret parts, ſtopping their mouthes therewith, a thing indeed for modeſtie ſake, more fit to bee omitted then related.</p>
            <p>Many of their wives, they have raviſhed in their ſights before th<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to ſpeake of the raviſhing of wives, maids and Virgins in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it would take up a great volume, and therefore I leave that to the conſideration of ſuch as have learned, what effects fruits and miſchiefes, wars and Rebellions produce,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62858:3"/>The Prieſts and Ieſuits commonly annoint the rebells with their ſacrament of the unction, before they goe to murther and rob, aſſuring them that for their meritorious ſervice, if they chance to dye or bee killed, they ſhall eſcape Purgatory and goe to heaven immediately, and what they can get by ſtealing and murthering ſhall be their own, a good reward for ſuch a bloudy and murthering ſervice, and what man will not venter upon ſuch conditions to get wealth upon earth, and heaven for murther? O Damnable Doctrine, and Doctors!</p>
            <p>After they have murthered men; ſurpriſing them cowardly and treacherouſly, they doe uſually mangle their dead Carcaſes, laying wagers which ſhall cut deepeſt into their dead fleſh with their skeyns as they did unto one maſter Champion, a Iuſtice of the peace in the province of Vlſter, whom they cruelly murthered by trechery, and one Maſter Iremonger, whom they kild, as he was at prayers in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Champions houſe, and alſo deſtroying the whole houſhold.</p>
            <p>One worthy gentleman nere Belturbat, in the province of Vlſter, was ſurpriſed as hee was at Dinner with his vertuou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wife and foure ſmall children, and after they had robbed them, and all his family, and ſtripped them naked, they threatned them to kill them, if they went not away preſently, who comming towards Dublin, hoping that way to find ſome comfort, the further they came the more miſerable they were beholding others of their friends handled in the ſame manner, which ſtruck in them ſuch amaſement, and bred in them ſuch feare, that being hopeles, &amp; helpleſſe they, ſat downe in a Ditch, where they were all found dead by ſome Troopers, the Gentleman and his wife having their armes imbracing one th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>other were found dead, but a ſucking Child, which was betweene them, was alive grabling and ſtriving for the dead Mothers breaſt, who was taken up by the Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and carried to a Nurſe.</p>
            <p>At Belturbat they robbed all the Engliſh, being about 500. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſubmitting themſelves to their mercy found no quarter but cruelty, for they ſtripped them all naked, and ſo turned them out of the Towne to ſhift for themſelves in bitter cold weather, in a moſt ſhamefull manner, not affording them a ragg to cover thoſe parts, which ſhould be hid, amongſt which company there was one Maſter Hudſon the Miniſter of the ſaid Towne of Belturbat, a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Godly Miniſter and his wife, whom they abuſed in a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner, not ſit to be ſpoken.</p>
            <p>In another Towne the Engliſh fled all into the Church being ab one two hundred and twenty, where they remained 3. dayes and nights both men, women, and children, till they were almoſt ſtarved, and ſo were forced to come forth, whom theſe cruell Rebells ſtripped out
<pb facs="tcp:62858:4"/>
of their Clothes, and drove them over the Bridge at the Townes end naked, having before cut off the middle Arch, unknowne to thoſe poore Chriſtians, with a devilliſh intent there to murther them (as they did) for comming to the middle of the Bridge, they found no paſſage; for the poore naked Soules muſt either goe back, or fall in and bee drowned: ſome that went back they kil<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many Ladies, and Gentlewomen, which have beene great with Child they have turned them out of doores, where they have beene delivered in the open fields upon a little ſtraw, without the helpe of any woman, and ſo having ended their miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others that have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped death in Childbearing, they have mercileſly carried away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Carts (lying in ſtinking and lowſie ſtraw ſtark naked) to places where they and their poore infants have been murthered</p>
            <p>The Lord Blany eſcaped their cruelty, being forced to ride 14. miles upon a poore Garroon or Iade without Bridle or Saddle to ſave his life, his Lady being taken and his children the ſame day, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the bloody and cruell villaines, who uſe her moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and her children, neither regarding her nobleneſſe of birth nor her Lord, but ſuffer her, or rather force her to lodge in ſtraw, with a poore allowance of two pence a day, for her reliefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and poore ſweet children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ad affliction to the good Ladyes miſery, ſlew a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of hers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cauſed him to be hanged up two dayes and nights before her face to afflict and terrifie her.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certaine that many thouſands have ſuffered in this nature and worſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I have heard reported by very honeſt and credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who (through Gods mercy) have eſcaped their crueltie, for it hath beene told mee by the mouths of very Religious and Godly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who came over with me in the ſame ſhip, wherein I came from Dublin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how they had loſt their wives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their eſtates, being glad to flye for their lives, having not left wherewithall to pay for their owne carriage into England, ſome of them to mine owne knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having loſt very great eſtates.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 8. of December laſt, the Lords of the Pale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſo called becauſe they live round about the City of Dublin, in the province of Leinſter) did generally meet at a village called the Saintred, &amp; there did mutually proteſt againſt the Kings Government, and then and there proclaimed that all the Engliſh ſhould depart the kingdome within 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or otherwiſe they ſhould expect nothing but fire and ſword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being knowne to the Lords Iuſtices, all the Papiſts

in Dublin were preſently diſarmed: at or about the ſame time the Lord Fitz William of Miriam, living nere Bullock, and within two miles of Dublin, ſent word to the Lords Iuſtices that there was 1500. of the Rebells would come downe from the County of Wickloe to Bulloch, and ſo come from thence in flat boats, to ſurpriſe the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the Rings end which is the harbour, and where there lay at that time about 27. ſhips of the Engliſh and Dutch, whereupon the Lords Iuſtices, ſent a hundred Souldiers from Dublin, to be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into ſeverall ſhips for their ſafety, and gave order, under their hands to the Capt. of the Kings Frygot a man of war, who rid at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor by us, to have a ſpeciall care of our ſhip called the Phenix and (if occaſion were) to guard us ſafe over the Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Dublin ſo that we were driven to keepe a Guard many nights on ſhip-board for feare of a ſurpriſe, for the Rebells were come to a place called Finglas within two miles of Dublin, ſo that we were driven to leave our houſes (liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Suburbes) for feare of firing, and ſo lay aboard 14. dayes and nights in our Clothes, before wee had a wind to carry us to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhead, the Kings Attorney for Ireland, Sir Thomas Tempeſt, the Biſhop of Ardagh, Sir Robert Dixon, Sir Robert Foord, Mr. Carleton, and divers Ladies and Gentlewomen, being all paſſengers in the ſame Ship.</p>
            <p>As for the number of the Rebells, it is not certainly knowne; but without queſtion there is a great many of them, but not the third part of them armed, and thoſe armes they have, they have taken from the Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſurpriſing and murthering them cowardly and treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and ſome of them under pretence of being rob'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, have deceiptfully gotten Armes to goe fight againſt them, and then have run away from their Captaines to the Rebells, and indeed there is no truſt nor confidence to be put in them, they are ſo treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly perfidious.</p>
            <p>It is ſuſpected, that the chiefe Rebells doe intend to ſteale away by Sea (having gotten a great eſtate from the Engliſh Plantators whom they have robbed and murthered) and ſo leave the ignorant rabble of Iriſh in the lurch.</p>
            <p>There is a great want of Engliſh proteſtants for Souldiers, not only to ſecure the City of Dublin and the Suburbs, but alſo to releeve the diſtreſſed eſtate of the Lord Viſcount Moore in Drogheda, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves both love, praiſe, and honour.</p>
            <p>It is to be beleeved that the Rebells will never give a Battell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that in ſhort time they will be ſtarved for want of food, for they have gotten in moſt parts from the Engliſh all they can get, and they waſt and devoure that plenty they have, and there is neither plowing nor
<pb facs="tcp:62858:5"/>
ſowing in thoſe parts, ſo that it will be impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt long.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certaine that 1400. Souldiers volunteers, were landed at Dublin, under the Command of Captaine Harcot, and other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines upon the ſecond day of Ianuary laſt Anno 1641. which was a great comfort to the Engliſh, and 400. Souldiers which were not in pay went along with them, ſo that the whole number was 1800. men. and marched along from the Rings end to Dublin in Battell Array in very good order.</p>
            <p>They report and alleadge that Religion is the cauſe of their war, but that is falſe, for they have had too much liberty and freedome of conſcience in Ireland, and that hath made them Rebell. I hope that God that hath diſcovered their bloudy practice, will confound their devices, and bring them to confuſion. To the which God be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiſe and Glory for ever.</p>
