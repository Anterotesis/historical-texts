            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The state of the Judaical Church. The Liberty given by
Christ. 1. From the arbitrary Impositions of men. 2. From
the Observances and Rites instituted by Moses. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of their Observation in the patience and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of God. Difference about them stated. Legal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Legal Ceremonies contended for together, the
Reason of it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ALthough our present enquiry be meerly after one part of
Instituted Worship under the Gospel, and the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it according to the mind of God; yet there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a communication of some light to be obtained from
the turning over of that Worship from the Mosaical, to the care
and practice of the Evangelical Church, we shall look a little back
unto it as therein stated, hoping thereby to make way for our
clearer progresse. What was the state of the Church of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Jews as to Instituted Worship, when our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
came to make the last and perfect discovery of his mind and
will, is manifest both from the appointment of that Worship in
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the practice of it remarked in the Gospel.
That the Rites and Ordinances of the Worship in the Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
were from the original in their nature <hi>Carnal,</hi> and for the
number <hi>many,</hi> on both accounts <hi>burthensome</hi> and grievous to the
Worshippers, the Scripture frequently declares. Howbeit the
Teachers and Rulers of the Church, being grown wholly <hi>Carnal</hi>
in their spirits, and placing their onely glory in their yoke, not
being able to see to the end of the things that were to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97323:3"/>
be done away, had in reased those <hi>Institutions</hi> both in <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
and <hi>weight,</hi> with sundry <hi>Inventions</hi> of their own, which
by their authority they made necessary to be observed by
their Disciples. In an equal practice of these, Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
and Humane Inventions, did our Lord Jesus
Christ finde the generality of the Church at his coming in
the flesh. The former being to continue in force until the
<hi>time of Reformation,</hi> at his Resurrection from the dead should
come; both by his practice, and his teaching as a Minister
of Circumcision, he confirmed and pressed frequently on
the Consciences of men, from the authority of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker.
The latter he utterly rejected, as introduced in
an high derogation from the perfection of the Law, and the
honour of him, whose Prerogative it is, to be the sole Lawsphar-giver
of his Church; the onely Fountain and disposer of
his own Worship. And this was the first dawning of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that with the rising of this <hi>Day-star</hi> did appear to the
burthened and languishing consciences of men. He freed
them by his <hi>Teaching</hi> from the bondage of <hi>Pharisaical</hi> atbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Impositions, delivering their Consciences from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to any thing in the Worship of God, but his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Authority. For it may not be supposed that when
he recommended unto his Hearers an attendance unto the
teaching of the Scribes and Pharisees, with an injunction
to obey their directions, that he intended ought but those
Commands which they gave from him; and according to
his mind, whose fear they did outwardly professe; seeing
that both in general and particular he did himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
their Traditions and Impositions; giving out a rule
of liberty from them unto others in his own constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
Yea and whereas he would do <hi>Civil</hi> things in their
own nature indifferent, whereunto he was by no righteous
Law obliged, to avoid the offence of any which he saw
might follow, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 24. yet would he not practice or give
countenance unto, nay nor abstain from condemning of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Ecclesiastical Self invented Observances, though
he saw them offended and scandalized at him, and was by
others informed no lesse, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 12, 13, 14 confirming his
practice with that standing Rule concerning all things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Worship of God, <hi>Every plant which my heavenly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97323:3"/>
Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.</hi> But he is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to carry on the work of giving <hi>Liberty</hi> to all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that he might take them into a subjection to himself,
and his own Authority onely. The <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Priesthood
being the hinge on which the whole <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Worship tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
so that upon a change thereof, the obligation of the Law
unto that worship, or any part of it, was necessarily to cease,
our blessed Saviour in his death and oblation entering upon the
Office, and actually discharging the great duty of his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
did virtually put an end to the whole obligation of the
first Institution of Mosaical Worship. In his death was the
procurement of the Liberty of his Disciples compleatly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
as unto conscience, the <hi>supposed</hi> Obligation of mens
Traditions, and the <hi>real</hi> Obligation of Mosaical Institutions,
being by him, (the first as a Prophet in his teaching, the last
as a Priest in his offering) dissolved and taken away. From
that day all the Disciples of Christ were taken under his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Lordship, and made free to the end of the world
from all obligations in Conscience unto any thing in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, but what is of his own Institution and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>This dissolution of the Obligation of the Law of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
contained in Ordinances, being declared by
his Apostles and Disciples, became a matter of great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and debate amongst the Jewes to whom the Gospel
was first preached. Those who before had slain him in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of their own charge, that he would bring in such an
alteration in the Worship of God as was now divulged, were
many of them exceedingly entaged at this new Doctrine;
and had their prejudices against him and his way much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
hating indeed the light, because their deeds were
evil, These being obstinately bent to seek after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
(as it were, at least) by the works of the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for their Ceremonial works as one of the best stakes
in their hedge, in whose observance they placed their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
confidence of their acceptance with God. But this is not
all, many, who falling under powerfull convictions of his
Doctrine and Miracles believed on him, did yet pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
adhere to their old Ceremonial Worship. Partly for
want of clear light and understanding in the Doctrine of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97323:4"/>
Person and Office of the Messiah, partly through the power of
those unspeakable prejudices which influenced their minds in
reference to those Rights, which being from of old observed by
their Forefathers, derived their original from God himself,
(much the most noble Pleas and Pretences, that ever any of
the sons of men had to insist upon, for a subjection to such a
yoke, as indeed had lost all power to oblige them) they were
very desirous to mix the observance of them with obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those Institutions which they through the Lord Jesus had
superadded to them.</p>
            <p>Things being thus stated amongst the Jews, God having a
great work to accomplish among and upon them in a short time,
would not have the effect of it turn upon this Hinge meerly,
and therefore in his Infinite Wisdome and Condescention wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the whole contest for a season. For whereas within the
space of forty years or thereabout he was to call and gather out
from the body, by the preaching of the Gospel, his Remnant
according to the Election of Grace, and to leave the rest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable,
thereby visibly glorifying his Justice in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and Eternal ruine, it pleased him in a way of connivance
and forbearance, to continue unto that people an allowance
of the observation of their old Worship, until the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for its utter removal and actual casting away should
come. Though the original obligation in Conscience from the
first institution of their Ceremonies was taken away, yet hence
arose a new necessity of the observation of them, even in them
who were acquainted with the dissolution of that obligation;
namely from the offence and scandal of them to whom their
observance was providentially indulged. On this account the
Disciples of Christ (and the Apostles themselves) continued
in a promiscuous observation of Mosaical Institutions, with
the rest of the body of that people, until the appointed season
of the utter rejection and destruction of the Apostate Churches
were come. Hence many of the Ancients affirm that <hi>James</hi> the
less, living at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in great reputation with all the people
for his Sanctity and Righteousness, was not to the very time
of his Martyrdome known to be a Christian; which had
been utterly impossible, had he totally abstained from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them in Legal Worship. Neither had that old contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
about the Feast of the Passover any other rise or spring,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97323:4"/>
then the mistake of some who thought <hi>John</hi> had observed it as a
Christian, who kept it onely as a Judaical Feast among the Jews;
whence the Tradition ran strong that he observed it with them,
on the fourteenth day of the Moneth, which precise time others
turning it into a Christian observation, thought meet to lay aside.</p>
            <p>Things being thus stated in the connivance and forbearance of
God among the Jews, some of them not contented to use the
indulgence granted to them in meer patience for the ends before
mentioned, began sedulously to urge the Mosaical Rites upon
all the Gentiles that were turned unto God. So making upon
the matter the Preaching of the Gospel to be but a new way of
proselyting men unto Judaism. For the most part it appears, that
it was not any mistake or unacquaintedness with the Liberty
brought in by Christ, that made them engage in this quarrel for
<hi>Moses,</hi> but that indeed being themselves carnal, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the outward Name of Christ, seeking yet for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by the Law, they esteemed the observation of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
indispensably necessary unto Salvation. This gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto <hi>Paul,</hi> unto whom the Apostleship of the Gentiles
was in a special manner committed, to lay open the whole my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of that Liberty given by Christ to his Disciples from the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as also the pernitious effects which its obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
would produce upon those principles which were pressed
by the Judaical Zealots. Passing by the peculiar dispensation of
God towards the whole Nation of the Jews, wherein the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Believers were not concerned; as also that determination of
the case of scandal made at <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 15. and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
rule of Condescention as to the abridgment of Liberty in
some particulars agreed unto thereupon, he fully declares that
the time of the <hi>Appointment</hi> was come, that there was no more
power in the Law of their Institutions to bind the Consciences
of men, and that it was not in the power of all the men in the
world, to impose the observation of them, or any like unto
them, upon any one though the meanest of the Disciples of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. The mind of Christ in this matter being fully made
known, and the Liberty of his Disciples vindicated, various ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in the minds of men ensued thereupon. Those who were
in their inward principle themselves carnal, notwithstanding
their outward profession of the Gospel, delighting in, and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on an outward ceremonious Worship, continued to oppose
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97323:5"/>
him with violence and fury. Those who with the profession of
the Lord Christ had also received the Spirit of Christ, and were
by him instructed as in the perfection of righteousness, so in the
beauty and excellency of the Worship of the Gospel, rejoyced
greatly in the Grace and Priviledge of the purchased Liberty.
After many contests this controversie was buried in the ruines of
the City and Temple, when the main occasion of it was utterly
taken away.</p>
            <p>By these degrees were the Disciples of Christ put into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
actual possession of that Liberty which he had <hi>preached</hi> to
them, and purchased for them; being first delivered from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
subjection to the Institutions of men, and then to the
temporary Institutions of God which concerned them not, they
were left in a dependance on, and subjection into himself alone,
as to all things concerning worship; in which state he will assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
continue and preserve them to the end of the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the guidance and direction of those Rules for the use of their
Liberty which he has left them in his Word. But yet the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the difference before mentioned, which is fixed in the
minds of men by Nature, did not die together with the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
that mainly issued from it. We may trace it effectually
everting it self in succeeding Ages. As Ignorance of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God with a desire to establish their own, did in any
take place, so also did endeavours after an outward Ceremonies
worship: For these things do mutually further and strengthen
each other. And commonly proportionable unto mens darkness
in the mystery of the Righteousness of God in Christ, is their
zeal for a worldly Sanctuary and carnal Ordinances. And such
hath been the force and efficacy of these combined Principles in
the minds of carnal men, that under the profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they reduced things (in the <hi>Papacy</hi>) to the very state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
wherein they were in Judaism at the time of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the main Principle in the one and the other Church in the
Apostacy, being <hi>Legal Righteousness,</hi> and an unsupportable yoke
of Ceremonious observances in the Worship of God. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
in others the same Principles of <hi>Legal Righteousness</hi> and a
Ceremonious Worship have their prevalency in a just proportion,
the latter being regulated by the former: And where by any
means the former is everted, the latter for the most part falls of
its own accord; yea, though riveted in the minds of men by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97323:5"/>
other prejudices also. Hence when the soul of a Sinner is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
wrought upon by the preaching of the Gospel, to renounce
himself and his own <hi>righteousness,</hi> and being truly humbled for
sin, to receive the Lord Christ by Faith, as made unto him of
God <hi>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> there
needs for the most part little arguing to disswade him from rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, or laying wait upon an out-side pompous Worship; but
he is immediately sensible of a delivery from its yoke, which he
freely embraceth. And the reason hereof is, because that good
Spirit by whom he is enabled to believe and receive the Lord
Jesus Christ, gives him also an Acquittance with, and an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the Excellency, Glory, and Beauty of that spiritual
Communion with God in Christ, whereunto Believers are called
in the Gospel, which discovers the emptiness and uselessness of all,
which before perhaps he admired and delighted in. For where
the Spirit of Christ is, there is Liberty. And these things of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Righteousness in Christ alone, and delighting in spiritual
Communion with God, exercising it self onely in the wayes of
his own appointment, do inseperably proceed from the same

            <p>VVE have brought unto, and left the Disciples of Jesus
Christ in the hand and sole disposal of him their Lord
and Master, as to all things which concern the Worship of God,
and how he hath disposed of them we are in the next place to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97323:6"/>
consider. Now he being the Head, Lord, and onely Law-giver of
his Church, coming from the bosome of his Father, to make
the last Revelation of his Mind and Will, was to determine and
appoint that Worship of God in and by himself, which was to
continue to the end of the world. It belongeth not unto our
purpose to consider distinctly and apart all the several Institutions
which by him were ordained. We shall onely observe some
things concerning them in General that will be of use in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
and so proceed to the Consideration of that Particular
about which we are in Disquisition of his Mind and Will, The
Worship of God is either Moral and Internal, or External and
of Sovereign or arbitrary Institution. The former we do not now
consider, nor was the ancient original fundamental Obligation
unto it altered or dissolved in the least by the Lord Christ. It was as
unto superadded Institutions, of outward Worship, which have
their foundation and reason in Sovereign Will and Pleasure, that
he took his Disciples into his own disposal, discharging them
from all Obligations to ought else whatever, but onely what he
should appoint. Concerning these, some few considerations will
lead us to what in this Discourse we principally intend. And the
First is, That they were <hi>few, and easie to be observed.</hi> It was his
Will and pleasure, that the Faith and Love of his Disciples should
in some few Instances be exercised in a willing ready subjection
to the impositions of his Wisdom and Authority. And their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
herein he doth fully recompence, by rendring those his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
blessedly useful to their spiritual advantage. But he would
not burden them with Observances either for <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>number,</hi>
like or comparable unto them from which he purchased them
Liberty. And herein hath the practise of succeeding Ages put an
excellent lustre upon bis Love and Tenderness. For whereas he
is the Lord of his Church, to whom the Consciences of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
are in an unquestionable subjection, and who can give
Power and Efficacy to his Institutions to make them useful to
their Souls? Yet when some of their Fellow servants came, I
know not how, to apprehend themselves enabled to impose ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily
their Appointments, for reason seeming good to their
wisdom, they might have been counted moderate, if they had
not given above ten Commandments, for his one. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells
us indeed, that the Laws and Institutions of the Church that
absolutely bind all Christians, so that they sin if they omit their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97323:6"/>
Observation, are upon the matter but <hi>four;</hi> namely, to observe
the Fasts of Lent and Ember-weeks, to keep the Holy dayes,
Confession once a year, and to Communicate at Easter: <hi>De Rom.
Pon<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>f. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 18. But whereas they double the number of
the sacred Ceremonies instituted by Christ, and have every one of
them a great number of subservient Observations attending on
them; so he must be a stranger to their Councels, Cannon-laws,
and practises that can believe his insinuation.</p>
            <p>Again, as the Institutions and Ordinances of Christ in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worship of God, whose sole foundation was in his will
and pleasure, were few and easie to be observed, being brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a relation of Worship unto God by vertue of his institution
and command, without which no one thing in their kind can do
so more then another; so they were for the matter of them such
as he knew had an <hi>aptnesse</hi> to be serviceable unto the significancy
whereunto they were appointed by him, which nothing but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
wisdome can judge of. And this eternally severs them from
all things of mens inventions, either to the same purpose, or in
the same way to be used. For as whatever they shall appoint in
the Worship of God, can have no significancy at all as unto any
spiritual end, for want of a Christ-like Authority in their Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which alone can add that significancy to them, which in
themselves without such an appointment they have not; so they
themselves want wisdome to chuse the things which have any fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or aptitude to be used for that end, if the Authority were
sufficient to introduce with them, such a significancy. There is
nothing they can in this kind fix upon, but as good reason as any
they are able to tender for the proof of their Expedience unto the
end proposed to them, will be produced to prove them meet for
a quite other signification and purpose, and the contrary unto
them, as least things diverse to them, be asserted with as fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
as meet to be used in their place and room.</p>
            <p>But that which we principally shall observe in and about Christs
Institutions of Gospel Worship, is the Provision that he made
for the Administration of it acceptably unto God. It is of the
Instituted Worship of his Publick Assemblies that we treat. The
chiefest acts and parts thereof may be referred to these three
Heads, <hi>Preaching of the Word, Administration of the Sacraments,</hi>
and <hi>the Exercise of Discipline;</hi> all to be performed with Prayer
and Thanksgiving. The Rule for the administration of these
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97323:7"/>
things so far as they are purely of his Institution, he gave his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in his appointment of them. Persons also he designed to the
regular administration of these his holy things in the Assemblies
of his Saints; namely, Pasters and Teachers to endure to the end
of the world, after those of an extraordinary employment under
him, were to cease. It remaineth then to consider how the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
appointed by him unto the Administration of these Holy
Things in his Assemblies, and so to the discharge of the whole
publick Worship of God, should be enabled thereunto, so as the
end by him aimed at of the Edification of his Disciples, and the
Glory of God might be attained. Two ways there are whereby
this may be done. First by such Spiritual Abilities for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
and performance of this whole work as will answer the
mind of Christ therein, and so serve for the end proposed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
By the prescription of a form of words whose reading
and pronunciation in these administrations should outwardly
serve as to all the ends of the Prayer and Thanksgiving required
in them, which they do contain. Its evident that our Saviour
fixt on the former way; what he hath done as to the latter,
or what his mind is concerning it, we shall afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</p>
            <p>For the first, as in many other places so signally in one the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
acquaints us with the course he has taken, and the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that he hath made, namely, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16. <hi>Unto every of us is given Grace, according to the measure
of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith when he Ascended up on
high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. And he gave
some Apostles, some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Teachers for the perfect<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng of the Saints for the work of the
Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all-come in the
unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect
man, unto the measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ,</hi> &amp;c.
The thing aimed it is the bringing of all the Saints and Disciples
of Christ, the whole Church, to that measure and perfection of
Grace which Christ hath assigned to them in this world, that they
may be meet for himself to receive in glory. The means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
this is to be done and effected is the faithful, regular, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
discharge of the work of the Ministry, unto which the
administration of all his Ordinances and Institutions do confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
belong. That this work may be discharged in an orderly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97323:7"/>
manner to the end mentioned, he has granted unto his Church,
the Offices mentioned to be executed by persons variously called
thereunto according to his mind and will.</p>
            <p>The onely enquiry remaining is, how these persons shall be
enabled for the discharge of their Office, and so accomplishment
of the work of the Ministry. This he declares is by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of grace and spiritual gifts from heaven unto them by
Christ himself. Here lyeth the spring of all that followeth; the
care hereof he hath taken upon himself unto the end of the
world. He that enabled the shoulders of the Levites to bear the
Ark of old, and their arms to slay the sacrifices, without which
natural strength those carnal ordinances could not have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
(nor was the Ark to be carried from supply of defect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the Levites) hath upon their removal, and the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spiritual Worship of the Gospel, undertaken to supply
the administratours of it with spiritual strength and abilities for
the discharge of their work, allowing them supply of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that which he hath taken upon himself to perform. I
suppose then that these ensuing will seem but reasonable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulata.</p>
            <p>1. That the means which Jesus Christ hath appointed for the
attaining of any end is every way sufficient for that purpose
whereunto it is so appointed: his wisdome exacts our consent to
this proposition.</p>
            <p>2. That what he hath taken upon himself to perform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end of the world, and promised so to do, that he will
accomplish accordingly; here his faithfulnesse requires our
assent.</p>
            <p>3. That the communication of spirituall gifts and graces
to the Ministers of the Gospel is the provision that Christ
hath made for the right discharge of the work of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
unto the edification of his Body. This lyes plain in the
Text.</p>
            <p>4. That the exercise and use of those gifts in all those admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
for which they are bestowed, are expected and required
by him. The nature of the thing it self, with innumerable testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
confirm this truth also.</p>
            <p>5. That it is derogatory to the glory, honour and faithfulness
of the Lord Jesus Christ to affirm that he ceaseth to bestow gifts
for the work of the Ministry, whilest he continueth and requireth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97323:8"/>
the exercise and discharge of that work. What hath befallen men,
or doth yet befall them through the wretched sloth, darkness and
unbelief, which their wilfull neglect of dependence on him, or of
stirring up, or improving of what they do receive from him, and
the mischiefs that have accrewed to the Church by the Intrusion
of such persons into the Place and Office of the Ministry as were
never called nor appointed by him thereunto, are not to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto any failing on his part, in his promise of dispensing the
gifts mentioned to the end of the world. Of which several Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we shall have some use in our further progress.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ then having delivered his Disciples from
the yoke of Mosaical Institutions which lay upon them from of
old, as also from being intangled in their consciences by or from
any inventions of men imposed on them, giving them Rules for
the practice of the Liberty whereunto by him they were vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
taking them for the future into his own sole disposal in all
things concerning the Worship of God, he appoints in his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Authority both the Ordinances which he will have alone
observed in his Church, and the Persons by whom they are to be
administred, furnishing them with spiritual abilities to that end
and purpose, promising his presence with them to the end
of the world, commands them to set such in his Name and
Strength in the way and unto the work that he hath allotted
to them.</p>
            <p>That now which on this Foundation we are further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into is, whether over and above what we have recounted,
our Saviour hath appointed, or by any ways given allowance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the framing of a stinted Form of Prayers and Praises to be read
and used by the Administratours of his Ordinances in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of them; or whether the prescription and imposing
of such a Form or Liturgy upon those who Minister in the
Church, in the Name and Authority of Christ, be not contrary
to his mind, and cross to his whole design, for perpetuating of his
Institutions to the end of the world, in due order and manner.
And this we shall do; and withall discover the Rise and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
which such Liturgies have had, and made in the Church
of God?</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Lords Prayer, and what may be concluded from thence, as to
the Invention and Imposition of Liturgies in the publick Worship of
God. The Liberty whereunto Christ vindicated, and wherein he
left his Disciples.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe first plea used to give countenance unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and imposing of Liturgies, is taken from that
act of our Saviour himself, who upon the request of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
composed for them a Form of Prayer, which being
recorded in the Gospel, is said to have the force of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
rendring the observation or use of that Form a
necessary duty unto all believers to the end of the world.
And this Plea is strengthened by a discovery which some
learned men say they have made, namely that our blessed
Saviour composed this Form which he delivered to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
out of such other Forms as were then in ordinary use
among the Jewes; whereby (they say) he confirmed that
practice of prescribing Forms of Prayer among them; and
recommended the same course of proceeding, by his so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto his Disciples. Now though it be very hard to
discover how upon a supposition that all which is thus sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
is the very truth, any thing can be hence concluded
to the justification of the practice of imposing Liturgies,
now enquired into; yet that there may be no pretence left
unto a plea, though never so weak and infirm, of such an
extract as this layes claim unto, it will be necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the severals of it. It is generally apprehended that
our Saviour in his prescription of that Form of Prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Disciples did aim at two things. 1. That they might
have a summary Symbole of all the most excellent things
they were to ask of God in his Name, and so a Rule of
squaring all their desires and supplications by. This end
all universally concur in: and therefore <hi>Matthew</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Doctrinal nature of it, gives it a place in the first
recorded Sermon of our Saviour, by way of anticipation,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97323:9"/>
and mentions it not when he comes to the time wherein it was
really first delivered by him. 2. For their benefit and advantage,
together with other intercessions that they should also use the
repetition of those words, as a prescript Form wherein he had
comprized the matter of their Requests and Petitions. About
this latter, all men are not agreed in their Judgements, whether
indeed our Saviour had this aim in it or no. Many Learned men
suppose that it was a supply of a Rule and Standard of things to
be prayed for, without prescribing to them, the Use or Rehearsal
of that Form of words that he aimed at. Of this number are
<hi>Musculus, Gortius,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> with many others;
but it may suffice to intimate that some of all sorts are so minded.
But we shall not in the case in hand make use of any Principle so
far obnoxious unto common prejudice, as experience proves
that opinion of those Learned men to be. Let it therefore be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for granted, that our Saviour did command that Form to be
repeated by his Disciples; and let us then consider what will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
ensue thereupon. Our Saviour at that time was Minister
of the Circumcision, and taught the Doctrine of the Gospel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and with the Observation of all the Worship of the Judaical
Church. He was not yet glorified, and so the Spirit was not as
yet given; I mean that Spirit which he promised unto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
to enable them to perform all the Worship of God by
him required at their hands, whereof we have before spoken.
That then which the Lord Jesus prescribed unto his Disciples
for their present practise in the Worship of God, seems to have
belonged unto the Oeconomy of the old Testament. Now to
argue from the prescription of, and outward helps for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Worship of God under the old Testament, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a necessity of the like or the same under the New, is upon the
matter to deny that Christ is ascended on high, and to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
spiritual Gifts unto men, eminently distinct from, and above
those given out by him under the Judaical Padogogy. However
their boldness seems unwarrantable, if not intollerable, who to
serve their own ends upon this Prescription of his, do affirm that
our Lord Jesus Composed this Form out of such as were then
in common use among the Jews. For as the proof their Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they insist on, namely the finding of some of the things
expressed in it, or Petitions of it in the Writings of the Jews,
the eldest whereof is some hundreds of years younger then this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97323:9"/>
Prayer it self, is most weak and contemptible; so the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self is exceeding derogatory to the glory and honour of his
Wisdom, assigning unto him a work so unnecessary and trivial,
as would scarce become a man of ordinary Prudence and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But yet to carry on the work in hand, let it be supposed that
our Saviour did command that Form of Prayer out of such as
were then customarily used among the Jews, which is false, and
asserted without any colour of proof, also that he prescribed it
as a Form to be Repeated by his Disciples, which we have shewn
many very eminently Learned men to deny; and that though he
prescribed it as a Minister to the Judaical Church, and to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
whilst Members of that Church, under the Oeconomy of
the old Testament, not having as yet received the Spirit and Gifts
of the New, yet that he did it for the use and observance of his
Disciples to the end of the World, and that not as to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
regulation of their Prayers, but as to the repetition of the
words; yet it doth not appear how from all these Concessions
any Argument can be drawn to the Composition and Imposition
of Liturgies, whose Rise and Nature we are enquiring after. For
it is certain, that our Saviour gives this direction for the end
which he intends in it, not primarily as to the Publick Worship
of the Assemblies of his Disciples, but as to the guidance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
individual Saint in his private Devotion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6, 8. Now
from a Direction given unto private Persons, as to their private
deportment in the Discharge of any Religious Duty, to argue
unto a prescription of the whole Worship of God in publick
Assemblies, is not safe, But that we may hear the Argument
drawn from this act of our Saviour speak out all that it hath to
offer, let us adde this also to the fore-mentioned Presumptions,
that our Saviour hath Appointed and Ordained, that in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of his Disciples in his Worship by him required, they
who Administer in his Name in and to the Church, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the words of this Prayer, though not peculiarly suited to
any one of his Institutions, what will thence be construed to
ensue? why then it is supposed that this will follow; that it is
not onely lawful, but the duty of some men to Compose other
Forms, an hundred times as many, suited in their Judgment
to the due Administration of all Ordinances of Worship in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
imposing them on the Evangelical Administrators of those
Ordinances, to be read by them, with a severe interdiction of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97323:10"/>
the use of any other Prayers in those Administrations, <hi>Bellarmine
de Pont. Rom. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 16. argues for the necessity of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Rites indifferent, when once commanded by the
Church, from the necessity of the Observation of Baptism, in
its self a thing indifferent, after it was commanded by Christ.
Some think this is not to Dispute but Blaspheme. Nor is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
before mentioned of any other Complexion. When it
shall be made to appear that whatever it was lawful for the Lord
Christ to do, and to prescribe to his Church and Disciples in
reference to the Worship of God, the same, or any thing of
the like nature, it is lawful for men to do, under the pretence
of their being invested with the Authority of the Church, or
any else whatever, then some colour will be given to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
which being raised on the tottering suppositions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, ends in that which seems to deserve an harder
name, then at present we shall affix unto it.</p>
            <p>And this is the stare and condition wherein the Disciples of
Christ were left by himself, without the least intimation of any
other impositions in the Worship of God to be laid upon them.
Not in any thing, or by any act of his did he intimate the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
or lawful use of any such Liturgies as these which we
are enquiring after, or prescribed and limitted Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
or Praises to be used or read in the publick administration of
Evangelical Institutions, but indeed made provision rendring all
such prescriptions useless; and because they cannot be made use
of, but by rejection of the Provision by himself made, unlawful.</p>

            <argument>

nor in the Churches of their plantation. Argument from their

Impositions. The Rule given by the Apostles. Of the Liturgies
fulsly ascribed unto some of them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUr next enquiry is after the practise of the Apostles, the
best interpretation of the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ,
as to the Agenda of the Church, or what he would have done
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97323:10"/>
therein in the Worship of God, and how. That one end of their
being furnished with the Spirit of Christ, was the right and due
administration of his Ordinances in his Church, to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his Disciples, I suppose will not be denied. By vertue
of his assistance, and the gifts from him received, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
this part of their duty accordingly. That they used any
Liturgies in the Church Worship wherein they went at any
time before the Disciples, cannot with any colour of proof be
pretended. The Scripture gives us an account of many of their
Prayers, of none that were a Repetition of a Form. If any such
were used by them, how came the memory of them utterly to
perish off the Earth? Some indeed of the Ancients say that
they used the Lords Prayer in the Consecration of the Eucharist,
which by others is denied, being in its self improbable, and
the Testimonies weak that are produced in behalf of its As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.
But as hath been shewed, the use of that Prayer no way
concerns the present Question. There are no more Christs but
one; to us there is one Lord Jesus Christ. For him who hath
affirmed, that it is likely they <hi>used Forms</hi> of Prayer and <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
composed for them by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> I suppose he must fetch
his Evidence out of the same Authors that he used, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that Jesus Christ himself went up and down <hi>singing
Mass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The practice then of the Apostles is not, as far as I know,
by any sober and learned Persons controverted in this matter.
They administred the holy things of the Gospel, by vertue of
the holy Gifts they had received. But they were Apostles. The
enquiry is, what Directions and Commands they gave unto
the Bishops or Pastors of the Churches which they planted,
that they might know how to behave themselves in the House
and VVorship of God. VVhatever they might do in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their duty by vertue of their extraordinary Gifts, yet
the case might be much otherwise with them, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with ordinary Ministerial Gifts onely. But we do not
find that they made any distinction in this matter between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others. For as the Care of all the Churches was on
them, the duties whereof they were to discharge by vertue of
the Gifts they had received, according to their Commission
impowering them thereunto, so to the Bishops of particular
Churches, they gave charge to attend unto the administration
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97323:11"/>
of the holy things in them, by vertue of the Gifts they had
received to that purpose, according to the limits of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
And upon a supposition that the Apostles were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to discharge all Gospel Administrations to the edification
of the Church, by vertue of the Gifts they had received, which
those who were to come after them in the performance of the
same Duties, should not be enabled unto, it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but that they would have provided a supply for that want
and defect themselves; and not have left the Church halt and
maimed to the Cure of those men, whose weakness and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Duty was its Disease. So then neither did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of our Lord Jesus Christ use any Liturgies, in the sence
spoken of, in their administration of the Worship Instituted
by him in his Church, nor did they Prescribe or Command any
such to the Churches, or their Officers that were planted in
them; nor by any thing intimate the usefulness of any such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
or Form of publick Worship as after Ages found out
and used.</p>
            <p>Thus far then is the Liberty given by Christ unto his Church
preserved intire, and the Request seems not immodest that is
made for the Continuance of it. When men cry to God for the
Liberty in his Worship, which was left unto them by Christ
and his Apostles, he will undoubtedly hear, though their Fellow
servants should be deaf to the like Requests made unto them:
And truly they must have a great Confidence in their own Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Sufficienty, who will undertake to Appoint and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on others the Observation of things in the Worship of
God, which neither our Lord Jesus, nor his Apostles did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
or impose.</p>
            <p>Two things are principally pretended as Grounds of the
Imposition of publick Liturgies. <hi>First,</hi> The disability of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Ministers of the Churches to Celebrate and administer the
Ordinances of the Gospel to the honour of God, and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church without the use of them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great
importance of Uni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormity in the Worship of God, not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
to be attained, but by vertue of this expedient, I desire
to know whether these Arguments did occur the consideration
of the Apostles or no: If they shall say they did; I desire to know
why they did not make upon them the Provision now judged
necessary, and whether those that so do, do not therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97323:11"/>
their wisdome and care for the Churches of God, unto
the wisdome and care of the Apostles. If it shall be said, that
the Bishops or Pastors of the Churches, in their dayes had
abilities for the discharge of the whole work of the Ministry
without this relief, so that the Apostles had no need to make
any such supply. I desire to know from whom they had these
abilities; If it be said that they had them from Jesus Christ, I
then shall yet also further ask, whether ordinary Bishops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
had any other Gifts from Jesus Christ, but what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to bestow on ordinary Bishops and Pastors of his Churches;
it seems to me that he bestowed no more upon them then he
promised to bestow, <hi>viz.</hi> Gifts for the Work of the Ministry,
with an especial regard to that outward condition of his
Churches, whereunto by his providence they were disposed.
It will then in the next place be enquired, whether the Lord
Jesus Christ promised to give any other Gifts to the ordinary
Bishops and Pastors of the Churches in those dayes, then he
promised to all such Officers in his Church to the end of the
World. If this appear to be the state of things, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
by vertue whereof they received those gifts and abilities
for the disdarge of their duty, which rendred the Prescription
of Liturgies needless, as to the first Ground of them pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
did and do equally respect all that succeed in the same
Office and Duty, according to the mind and will of Christ
unto the end of the World, is not the pretended necessity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the glory of the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, as
plainly intimating that he doth not continue to fulfil his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
or at least a full declaration of mens unbelief, that they
do not, nor will depend upon him for the accomplishment of
the same. Thus the first pretended Ground of the necessary use
of such Liturgies as we speak of, endeth in a reflection upon the
honour of our Lord Jesus, or a Publication of their own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
and Apostacy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is like the former. It will not, I suppose, be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but that the Apostles took care for the Unity of the Churches,
and for that Uniformity in the Worship of God which is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto him. Evidence lyes so full unto it in their Writings, that
it cannot be denied. Great weight every where they lay upon
this duty of the Churches, and propose unto them the wayes
whereby it may be done, with multiplied Commands and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97323:12"/>
to attend unto them. Whence is it then that they never
once intimate any thing of that which is now pressed, as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>medium</hi> for the attaining of that end? It cannot but seem strange
to some, that this should be the onely expedient for that Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
which is acceptable unto God, and yet not once come into
the thoughts of any of the Apostles of Christ, so as to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto the Churches for that purpose. Considering the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Treacheries that are in the hearts of men, and the powerfull
workings of unbelief under the most solemn outward Professions,
I fear it will appear at the last day, that the true rise of most of the
Impositions on the Consciences of men, which on various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
are practised in the World, is from the secret thoughts
that either Christ doth not take that Care of his Churches, nor
make that supply unto them of spiritual abilities for the work of
the Ministry, which he did in the days of old; or that men are
now grown wiser then the Apostles, and those who succeeded
them in the administration of the things of God, and so are able
to make better provision for attaining the end they professedly
aimed at, then they knew how to do.</p>
            <p>The Heathen I confess thought Forms of Prayer to a means of
preserving an uniformity in their Religious Worship. Hence
they had a solemn Form for every publick action; yea, for those
Orations which the Magistrates had unto the People. So <hi>Levius</hi>
informs us, that when <hi>Sp. Posthumius</hi> the Consul was to speak
unto the People about the wickednesses that were perpetrated
by many under the pretence of some <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> superstition,
he gave them an account of the usefulness of the <hi>Solenne precatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
carmen,</hi> which he had recited to keep out, and prevent such
differences about their Religion as were then fallen out, <hi>lib,</hi> 39.
<hi>Concione advocat a cum Solenne precationis carmen, quod praefari pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usquam
populum alloquantur, Magistratus solent, peregisset Consul,
it a caepit. Nulli unquam concioni, Quirites, tam non solum apta, sed
etiam necessaria haec solennis Deorum comprecatio fuit, quae nos ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneret,
hos esse Deos quos colerevenerari, precarique Majores ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri instituissent,
non illos,</hi> &amp;c. But I hope we shall not preferre
their Example and Wisdome before that of our Lord Christ, and
his Apostles.</p>
            <p>Were prejudices removed, and self-interests laid out of the
way, a man would think there were nor much more necessity for
the determination of this difference; Christ, and his Apostles,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97323:12"/>
with the Apostolical Churches, knew no such Liturgies. At least
it seems as was said not an unreasonable request to ask humbly
and peaceably at the hands of any of the sons of men, that they
would be pleased to allow unto Ministers of the Gospel that are
sound in the Faith, and known so to be, who will willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the tryal of their Ministerial abilities to the Judgement of
any who are taught of God, and enabled to discern of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
that Liberty in the Worship of God which was confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left unto them by Christ and his Apostles. But the state of
things is altered in the World. At a Convention of the Apostles
and others, wherein the holy Ghost did peculiarly preside, when
the Question about Impositions was agitated, it was concluded
that nothing should be imposed on the Disciples but what was
<hi>necessary</hi> for them to observe antecedently to any Impositions,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. necessary though not in their own nature, yet in
the posture of things in the Churches, necessary to the avoidance
of scandal, whereby the observation of that injunction was to be
regulated. Nor was there among the things called necessary the
Imposition of any one thing positively to be practised by any of
the Disciples in the Worship of God, but onely an abridgement
of their Liberty in some few external things, to which it did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extend. But that Spirit of Wisdome, Moderation, and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereby they were guided being rejected by men, they began
to think that they might multiply Impositions as to the positive
practice of the Disciples of Christ in the VVorship of God at
their pleasure, so that they could pretend that they were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in themselves before the Imposition of them, which gives
as they say, a necessity to their Observations; which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
must be left to the Judgement-seat of Jesus Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi>
25. 45.</p>
            <p>It is not worth our stay to consider what is pretended concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the antiquity of Liturgies, from some yet extant that bear
the Names of some of the Apostles or Evangelists. There is one
that is called by the Name of <hi>James,</hi> printed in Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;
another ascribed unto <hi>Peter,</hi> published by <hi>Lindanus;</hi> one
also to <hi>Matthew,</hi> called the Aeohtopick; another to <hi>Mark,</hi> which
are in the Bible <hi>P. P.</hi> And pains have been taken by <hi>Santesius,
Pamelius</hi> and others, to prove them <hi>genuine;</hi> but so much in vain
as certainly nothing could be more. Nor doth <hi>Baronius</hi> in <hi>their
lives</hi> dare ascribe any such thing unto them. We need not any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97323:13"/>
longer stay to remove this Rubbish out of our way. They must
be strangers to the Spirit, Doctrine, and Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who can impose such Trash upon them, as these Liturgies are
stuffed withall? The common use of words in them not known
in the Ages of the Apostles, nor of some of them ensuing; The
parts in them whose Contrivers and Framers are known to have
lived many Ages after; The mentioning of such things in them,
as were not once dreamed of in the dayes whereunto they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
The remembrance of them in them as long before them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
who are suggested to be their Authours. The preferring
of other Liturgies before them when once Liturgies came in use,
with a neglect of them; which the utter silence of the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Writers, Stories, Councels concerning them, do abundantly
manifest that they are plainly Suppositions, of a very late Fraud
and Invention. Yea, we have testimonies clear enough against
this pretence. In <hi>Gregor. lib. 7. Epist. 63. Alcuinus, Amatorius,
Rabanus, lib. P. P. tom.</hi> 10. with whom consent <hi>Walafridus, Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,
Rupertus Titiensis, Berno, Radulphus Tangrensis,</hi> and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

many of whom shew how, when, and by whom the several parts
of that Publick Form which at length signally prevailed were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and brought into use.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The practice of the Churches in the first three Centuries as to Forms
of Publick Worship. No set Forms of Liturgies used by them. The
Silence of the first Writers concerning them. Some Testimonies
against them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is not about stinted Forms of Prayer in the Worship and
Service of God, by those who of their own accord do make use
of that kind of Assistance, judging that course to be better then
any thing they can do themselves in the discharge of the work of
the Ministry, but of the Imposition of Forms on others who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to stand fast in the Liberty with which Christ hath made them
Free, that we enquire. This Freedome we have manifested to
have been purchased for them by the Lord Jesus, and the use of it
continued by the Apostles in their own practice, and to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97323:13"/>
Churches planted by themselves. And this will one day appear
to have been a sufficient Plea for the maintenance of that Liberty
to the end of the world. Now though what is purely matter of
Fact among the succeeding Churches, be not so far Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as to be insisted on as a Rule exactly binding us to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; yet it is deservedly worthy of great Consideration,
and not hastily to be rejected, unless it be discovered to have
been diverse from the Word whereunto we are bound in all
things to attend. We shall therefore make some enquiry into the
practice of those Churches, as to this matter of prescribing of
Forms of Prayer in publick Church Administrations, so
farre as any thing thereof is by good Antiquity transmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
            <p>Our first Enquiry shall be into the three first Centuries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
confessedly the streams of Gospel Institutions did run most
clear and pure from humane mixtures, then in those following,
although few of the Teachers that were of Note do escape from
Animadversions from those, that have come after them. It cannot
be denied but that for the most part the Churches and their
Guides within the space of the time limitted, walked in the paths
marked out for them by the Apostles, and made conspicuous by
the Footsteps of the first Churches planted by them. It doth not
then appear, for ought as I can yet discover, that there was any
attempt to Invent, Frame and Compose any Liturgies or prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
Forms of administring the Ordinances of the Gospel, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to the discharge of that duty by vertue of spiritual Gifts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from Jesus Christ, much less for an Imposition of any such
Forms on the Consciences and Practice of all the Ministers of the
Churches within the time mentioned, If any be contrary mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it is incumbent on them to evince their Assertion by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of unquestionable Truth. As yet, that I know of, this is
not performed by any. <hi>Buronius ad An, Christi 58. num.</hi> 102,
103, 104, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> treating expresly of the publick Prayers of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christians, is wholly silent as to the use of any Forms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them; though he contends for their Worshipping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East, which custome when it was introduced, is most
uncertain: but most certain that by many it was immoderately
abused, who expresly worshipped the Rising Sun; of which abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Idolatry among Christians, <hi>Leo</hi> complains <hi>Serm. 7. De
Nativitate.</hi> Indeed the Cardinal <hi>ad An.</hi> 63. 12, 17. faintly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97323:14"/>
that some things in the Liturgy of <hi>James</hi> were composed
by him, because some passages and expressions of it are used by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril
of Jerusalem in his Mistagog.</hi> 5. But whereas <hi>Cyril</hi> lived not
within the time limitted unto our Enquiry, and those Treatises
are justly suspected to be suppositions, nor is the Testimony of
that Liturgy, once cited or mentioned by him, the weakness of
this insinuation is evident. Yea, it is most probable that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was the Composer of that forged Liturgy, he took those Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
out of those reputed Writings of <hi>Cyril,</hi> which were known
in the Church long before the name of the other was heard of. I
know no ground of expectation of the performance of that,
which as yet men have come short in, namely, in producing Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
for the use of such Liturgies as we are enquiring after,
considering the diligence, ability, and interest of those have been
already engaged in that enquiry. Now the silence of those, who
in all probability would have given an account of them, had any
such been in use in their dayes, with the description they gave us
of such a performance of the Worship of God in the Assemblies of
Christians, as is inconsistent with, and exclusive of such prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
Forms as we treat of, is as full an evidence in this kind as our
negative is capable of. In those golden Fragments of Antiquity
which we have preserved by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> I mean the Epistles of the
Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> about the Martyrdome of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and of
the Churches of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> concerning their Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we have not the least intimation of any such Forms of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
In the Epistle of <hi>Clemens,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in those of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in the Writings of <hi>Justin
Martyr, Clemens, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries,
there is the same silence concerning them. The
<hi>Pseudopegraphical</hi> Writings that bear the Names of the men of
those dayes, with any pretence of considerable Antiquity, as the
Canons of the Apostles, <hi>Quaestiones ad Orthodoxos, Dionysius Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarch.
Divin. Nom.</hi> will not help in the cause. For though in
some of them there are Prayers mentioned, and that for and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
such things as were not in <hi>Rerum Natura,</hi> in the dayes
wherein those persons lived, unto whose Names they are falsly
ascribed; yet they speak nothing to the point of Liturgies as sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our enquiry. Something I confess may be found in some of
the Writings, of some one or two of those of the third Century,
intimating the use of some particular Prayers in some Churches;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97323:14"/>
So <hi>Origen. Homil. 11. in Hierimea. Ubi frequenter in or at ione di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus,
da omnipotens, da nobis partem cum Prophetis, da cum Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolis
Christi tui, tribue ut inveniamur ad vestigia unigeniti tui.</hi> But
whether he speaks of a Form, or of the matter onely of Prayer, I
know not. But such Passages belong not unto our purpose.
Those who deal expresly about the Order, State, and Condition
of the Churches, and the Worship of God in them, their Prayers
and Supplications knew nothing of prescribed Liturgies; yea, they
affirm plainly that which is inconsistent with the use of them. The
account given of the Worship of the Christians in those dayes by
<hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is known as having been often
pleaded. I shall onely mention it in our Passage, and begin with
the latter. <hi>Illue,</hi> saith he, (that is towards Heaven) <hi>suspicientes
Christiani</hi> (not like the Idolaters who looked on their Idols and
Images) <hi>manibus expausis</hi> (not embracing Altars or Images as did
the Heathen) <hi>quia innocuis capite nudo, quia non crubescimus deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

their Prayers after their Priests or Sacrificers, but powring out our
Prayers conceived in our breasts, <hi>Apol. cap.</hi> 30. And again <hi>cap.</hi>

with, the advantage as well as the trouble will be theirs who
shall so do. Onely in their endeavour to that purpose, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of them that they would not labour to Impose on those
whom they undertake to inform, by the ambiguous use of some
words among the Ancient, nor conclude a prescribed Form of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
when they find mention of the Administration it
self, nor reckon reading of the Scriptures, or singing of Psalms as
parts of the Liturgy contended about, nor from the use of some
particular Prayer by some persons, argue for the equity or necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Composing such entire Liturgies, or Offices as they call
them, for all Evangelical Administratours, and their necessary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
So that these Conditions be observed, I shall profess
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97323:16"/>
my self much engaged unto any one who shall discover a Rise of
them within the limits of the Antiquity that hath been usually
pretended and pleaded in their justification and practice. For my
part I know not any thing that ever obtained a Practice and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
among Christians, whose springs are more dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
then these of Liturgies. They owe not their Original to any
Councels, General or Provincial; they were not the product of
the Advice or Consent of any Churches, nor was there any one of
them at any time compleated. No Pleas can I as yet discover in
them of old about Uniformity in their use, or any Consent in
them about them. Every Church seemeth to have done what
seemed good in the Churches own eyes, after once the way unto
the Use of them was opened. To whom in particular we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
for that Invention, I know not: It may be those who are
wiser do; and I wish they would value the Thanks that they
may have for the Discovery when they shall be pleased to make
it. They seem to me to have had but slender Originals. One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
one Form of Prayer, or Thanksgiving, or Benediction;
Another added to what he had found out, which was the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
task. Future Additions gave some compleatness to their
beginners. Those in the Greek Church, which bear the names
of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Basiil,</hi> seem to be the first that ever extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves to the whole Worship of the Church; not that
by them whose Names they bear they were Composed as
now they appear, unless we shall think that they wrote them
after their decease; but probably they Collected some Forms
into Order that had been by others Invented; making such
Additions themselves as they judged needful, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the use of them, to the Churches wherein they did
preside. The use of them being arbitrarily introduced, was not
by any Injunction we find, made necessary. Much less did any
one single Form plead for a general Necessity. In the Latine
Church, <hi>Ambrose</hi> used one Form, <hi>Gregory</hi> another, and <hi>Isidore</hi>
a third. Nor is it unlikely but the Liturgies were as many as
the Episcopal Churches of those dayes. Hence in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fifth Century in an <hi>African</hi> Councel, <hi>Can.</hi> 70. which
is the <hi>103d</hi> in the <hi>Codex Can. African;</hi> it is provided, that no
Prayers be read in the Administration of the Eucharist, but
such as have been approved in some Councel, or have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by some Prudent men formerly; which Canon with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97323:16"/>
some Addition is confirmed in the Second <hi>Milenitan</hi> Councel
<hi>Can.</hi> 12. and the Reason given in both is, least there should
any thing contrary to the Faith, creep into their way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
But this, as I said, was in the beginning of the Fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
after diverse Forms of Administration of holy things in
the Church, had by divers been invented. The finding out of
this Invention was the act of some particular men, who have
not been pleased to acquaint us with the Reason of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.
As yet it doth not appear unto us, that those Reasons
could possibly be taken from the VVord, the practise of the
Apostles, or the Churches by them planted, or those which
followed them for some Generations, nor from any Councel
held before their dayes; &amp; so it may be we are not much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to enquire what they were. Yet what is at present pleaded in
the behalf of the first Composers of Liturgies may in the way be
chiefly considered. Necessity is the first thing usually pretended.
Many men being put into the Office of the Ministry, who had
not Gifts and Abilities for the profitable discharge of the VVork
of the Ministry, unto the edification of the Church, they who
had the over-sight of them according to the custome of those
dayes, were enforced to Compose such Forms for their use, as
they judged expedient, so providing for the Edification of the
Church, which else would have suffered from their weakness
and insufficiency. Besides many parts of the VVorld, especially
the East, in those dayes swarmed with <hi>Anti Trinitarian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
of sundry sorts, who many of them by unsuspected wiles,
and dissimulations and subscriptions of Confessions, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to creep into the Office of the Ministry of the Church, partly
out of blind zeal to diffuse the poyson of their abominations,
partly out of carnal Policy to be made partakers of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which for the most part attended the Orthodox Profession.
This increased the necessity of Composing such Forms of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
VVorship, as being filled with Expression<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pointed against
the Errors of the Times, might be a means to keep Seducers
from imposing themselves on Ecclesiastical Administrations.
Thus there is no Antient Liturgy, but it is full of the expressions
that had been consented upon in the Counsels that were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened
for the Condemnation of those Errors, which were in
their dayes most rife and pernitious. On this ground do learned
men of all sorts conclude the Liturgy falsly ascribed to <hi>James,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97323:17"/>
to be younger then the <hi>Nieene</hi> and <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councels, from the
use of the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in it.</p>
            <p>But it doth not yet appear that these Reasons were sufficient
to justifie such an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnovation in the Churches of Christ. For
supposing that there were such a decay of Gifts and Abilities
among them that were called to the Administration of Gospel
Institutions, that they were not able to discharge their duty
in that work, to the edification of the Church, in like manner
as those had done who went before them, this must needs have
come to pass, either because our Lord Jesus Christ did cease to
give out his Gifts to his Church, as he had done in former dayes
upon his usual terms; or that men were negligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in the receiving of them from him, either not seeking them
at his hand, or not exercising and improving of them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his will and command. Other Reason of this decay that
I know of, cannot be assigned. To affirm the former on any
pretence whatever, is blasphemously to accuse our Lord Jesus
Christ of breach of Promise; he having solemnly engaged to
be with his Disciples, not for an Age or two, but to the end
of the World, and that by the Graces and Gifts of his Spirit.
I know it is pretended, that when Christians were multiplyed,
there was a necessity of appointing them Officers, who had
not the Gifts and Qualifications that otherwise would have
been esteemed necessary; But I know withal, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Christians should be multiplyed in the way of Christ, faster
then he is ready to give out Gifts for their edification. The
latter Reason above then must be granted to be the Cause of the
defect of Abilities in Church Officers, pleaded in the justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Introduction into the Church of composed Forms
of Administrations to be read by them. I wish then we might
in the fear of the Lord, consider whether the Remedy were
well suited unto the Disease. I suppose all impartial men will
grant that there ought to have been a return unto him endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
from whom they were gone astray, at least Gospel means
used for the obtaining of those Gifts of Christ, and the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of them being received. Finding themselves at the loss
wherein they were, should they not have searched their hearts
and wayes, to consider wherefore it was that the Presence of
Christ was so withdrawn from them, that they were so left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the assistanco which others ministring in their places before
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97323:17"/>
them had received; should not they have pulled out their single
Talent, and fallen to Trading with it, that it might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
under their care? Was not this the Remedy and Cure
of the breach made by them, that God and man expected from
them? Was it just then and according to the minde of Christ,
that instead of an humble returnal unto an holy Evangelical
dependance on himself, they should invent an expedient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them in the condition wherein they were, and so make all
such returnal for hereafter needless? Yet this they did in the
invention of Liturgies, they found out a way to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their spiritual negligence and sloth, and to render a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on the Lord Christ for supplies of his Spirit to enable
them unto Gospel Administrations altogether needless, they
had now provided themselves with an ability they could keep in
the Church, so that he might keep the furniture of his Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself. And this quickly became the most poysonous ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in the Apostacy of the latter Times.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any sufficient warrant for this Invention in the
Second Pretence. There were many Antichrists in the Apostles
time, yet they never thought of this Engine for their discovery
or exclusion out of the Church, Confessions of Faith, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledped
Forms of wholesome Words with the care of the
Disciples of Christ, or his Churches, which are enabled by him
to judge and discern of Truth and Error, are the preservations
against the danger intimated, that the Gospel hath provided.</p>
            <p>This being the entrance that the Liturgies enquired after,
made into the Churches of God, we are not much concerned
to enquire what was their Progress. That in the Western parts
of the World they all at length centred in the <hi>Roman Mass-Book</hi>
and <hi>Rituals</hi> we know. Their beginnings were small, plain, brief,
their use Arbitrary, the Additions they received were from the
endeavours of private men in several Ages, occasional for the
most part; the number of them great, equal to the various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations
of the Churches, until the Papal authority grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absolute and uncontroulable, the Roman Form was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on the World, that by innumerable artifices in a long tract
of Ages was subjected thereunto, and that contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of former Roman Bishops, who advised the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the different Forms of administrations which were
in use in several Churches. <hi>Mihi placet, ut sive in Romanis sive
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97323:18"/>
in Galliarum partibus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seu in qualibet Ecclesia aliquid invenisti
quod plus Omnipotenti Deo possit placere solicite eligas.</hi> Greg. Resp.
ad Interrogat. August.</p>
            <p>This being the State and Condition, this the Issue, That the
Invention of Liturgies to be read in the Worship of God was
come unto, before the Reformation, I shall briefly subjoyn
unto it an account of what was done in these Kiagdomes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
unto it, which will make way to the clear stating of
the question in particular that we are further to speak unto.
The History of our Reformation is known. I shall not speak
any thing that may reflect with the least dishonour on the Work
or the Workmen. We have abundant cause to bless the Lord
continually for the one and the other. Yet still we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that our Reformers were men, and that the Reformation
was a work performed by men; The former never claimed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
nor the latter, that I know of, Perfection; so that
some things that were done by the one, and in the other, may
admit of new Considerations without the reflexion of any thing
upon them, that the one and the other would not readily and
willingly admit. I shall therefore briefly give an account of that
part of the Work which concerns our business in hand. What
was the state of this Nation at the time of the Reformation,
and what were the minds of the greater part of men in them,
in reference unto the VVork, is sufficiently declared, in all the
stories of those dayes. God having been pleased to send the
saving Light of the Gospel into the minds and hearts of them
in chief Rule, that is King <hi>Edward,</hi> and some of his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
they found no small difficulties to wrestle withal in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the inveterate prejudices wherewith the Generality
of men were possessed against the work they intended. The far
greater part of the Clergy, true to their carnal present Interest,
with all their might and cunning opposed their endeavours. The
greatest part of the Nobility averse to their proceedings. The
Body of the people blinded with superstition and profaneness,
easily excited by the Priests (whose peculiar, concernment lay in
keeping all things in their old channel and course) to make head
against their proceedings; Foreign Nations round about fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
to the uttermost all home-bred discontents, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves, by the instigation of the Pope, to hinder the
work by all wayes that possible they could imagine. Amongst all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97323:18"/>
these the Body of the people, which are the Kings most special
care, as they are his strength and wealth, were looked on as
most to be regarded, as without whose concurrence their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of all others were like onely to consume themselves.
Now the people being in those dayes very ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with the Doctrines of the Scripture, were very little
or not at all concerned what perswasion men were of in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as to the Articles of pure belief, so as they might retain
the <hi>Agenda</hi> in the VVorship of God which they had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
unto. Hence it was that those Prelates, who were
the Instruments of the Papal Persecution in this Nation, wisely
stated the whole cause of their cruelty to be the <hi>Mass,</hi> or the
Worship of the Church, seldome unless compelled by Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
once mentioning of the Articles of Faith, which yet they
knew to be the main foundation of the difference between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and the Reformers; because in this particular they had the
advantage of the popular favour; the people violently interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselves in the behalf of that part of the present Religion
wherein their onely share did lye. Had they laid the Reasons and
Grounds of their Quarrel in the differences of Opinions about
the <hi>Credenda</hi> of the Gospel, they would scarcely have prevailed
with the common people to carry Faggot, for the burning of their
Brethren, for things whereof they understood little or nothing
at all.</p>
            <p>Our wise and provident Reformers considering this state of
things, and temper of the minds of men, however they resolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared for the <hi>Credenda</hi> of the Gospel, and asserted the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith from which the Romane Church had most eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apostatized, yet found in their concernment to attemper the
way of publick Worship as much as was possible with consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with the Articles of the Faith they professed, to that which
the popularity had been inured unto. Observing plainly that all
their concernments in Religion lay in the outward Worship
whereunto they had been accustomed, having very confused ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the speculative part of it, it was easie for them to
apprehend that if they could condescend to furnish them with
such a way thereof as might comply in some reasonable manner
with their former usuage, these two things would ensue. <hi>First,</hi>
That the main Reformation in the Doctrine which alone would
deliver the people from their prejudicate Opinions about the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97323:19"/>
Worship of God, would be carried on with less noise and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and consequently less contest and opposition. For whilst
they had a Way and Form of Worship proposed to them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they could be contented, those that were wiser might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and teach what they pleased, which in the Providence of
God proved in a short time a blessed means of delivering them
from their old entanglements and darkness. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That their
Priests who were their chief Instigators to all disorder and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the whole work of Reformation, finding a way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for their continuance in the possession of their places, and a
Worship prescribed which they could as easily perform and go
through withall, as what they had practised in former dayes,
might possibly acquiesce in the proceedings of their betters, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the temporal interest which they chiefly respected, to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And this afterwards accordingly they did, reading the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
Book</hi> instead of the <hi>Mass,</hi> without which supply of such wants
and defects in them as I shall not name, they would never have
entertained any thoughts of owning the Reformation, nor of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the people to submit themselves thereunto. On these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
and for these ends, it is evident from the story of those
times, that our present Liturgy was framed. Rejecting out of the
Offices before in use, such things as were directly contrary to the
Articles of Faith protested in the Reformation in hand, transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of what remained into <hi>English,</hi> with such supplies and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as the rejection of those things before mentioned made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
The Book mentioned in some haste, and with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
disadvantages for such a Work, was by our first Reformers
compiled. And indeed somewhat there was in this case not
much unlike that insisted on in the entrance of this Discourse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the believing Jews and Gentiles. Many of the Jews who
were willing to receive Christs Reformation in point of Faith
and Obedience, yet pertinaciously adhered to their old Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Worship; violently setting themselves against any that
durst speak a word against its Continuance. That there might
not be an endless contest and strife about the matter, and so the
progress of the Gospel be hindred amongst the one sort and the
other the Apostles taking in hand the old Worship, as to the
Gentile Worshippers whose case above came then under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
they reject and declare, abrogate all such Ceremonies
whose necessary observation had an inconsistency with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97323:19"/>
of the Gospel, proposing onely some few things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
which occasioned the greatest difference between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at variance.</p>
            <p>Now as this Composition of that Difference was accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the present Scandal, and the obligation unto its observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be regulated thereby; so by the removal thereof, its self
as unto any use in the Church of Christ did expire. Nor unlike
unto this of the Apostle seems the aim of our first Reformers to
have been, That they might win the People who had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to the way of Worship in use in the Papacy unto a
compliance with the Doctrine of the Gospel, and that there
might not be endless Contests about that which was presently to
be practised, which perhaps they though of small importance in
comparison of those weighty fundamental Truth which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to acquaint them with, and bring them to the belief
of, they provided for the use of such parts of it, and in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as were not openly inconsistent with the Truths, which was
in their hearts to communicate unto them. And it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
but that this constitution might have had the same end with
the other, if not of present use, being in things of another nature,
yet of a timely expiration, when notoriously useless as to the
main ends intended in it, had not the interest of some interposed
for its Continuance beyond the life and influence of all or any of
those causes or occasions. And hence it is that those streams at
this day run strongly and fiercely, by the addition and powring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
of adventitious rivulets, with showers or rather storms of
temporal interest, whose springs are all utterly long since dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up.</p>
            <p>The Book of Common Prayer being Composed as hath been
declared, became from its very Cradle and Infancy a bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to the Church of God in this Nation. Many of the People
and Ministers who seemed to be enlightened with a beam of
Truth, of an equal lustre and brightness with that which shined in
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he minds of their Brethren, wholly decried that prudential
compliance with the peoples ignorance and adherence to Popery,
which was openly avowed in the Composition and Imposition of
it, and called earnestly for a purer way of the Administrations of
Gospel Ordinances more agreeable to the Word and Primitive
times, then they apprehended that prescribed Form to contain
and exhibit. Others again in the justification of that whereof
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97323:20"/>
themselves were the Authours, laboured to recommend the
Book, not onely as to Truth, but as useful and very beneficial for
the edification of the Church. It is known also that the Contests
of men in this Nation about this Form of Divine Service, were
not confined to this Nation, but were carried by them into other
parts of the world. And should I pursue the suffrage that hath
lien against it, from the first day of its Composure, to this wherein
we live, never giving it a quiet possession in the minds and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men, with the various evils that have all along attended
its Imposition, I suppose it might of it self prevail with sober men
who desire <hi>their moderation should ne known to all, because the Judge
standeth at the door,</hi> to take the whole matter of the Imposition of
this, or the like Form once more under a sedate Consideration.
And they may perhaps be the rather induced thereunto, if they
will but impartially weigh that the Opposition to the imposed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
hath increased daily according to the increase of Light and
Gospel Gifts among men. So that there seems to be no way to
secure its station, but by an Opposition unto them and extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, which is a sad work for any that are called Christians,
to engage into.</p>
            <p>I presume the conscientious Reader will be able to discover,
from what hath been spoken, Rules sufficient to guide his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in reference unto the use of prescribed Liturgies. The story
of their Rise and Progress is enough to plead for a Liberty from
an indispensable necessity of their Observation. That which is of
pure humane invention, and comparatively of late and uncertain
Original, whose Progress hath been attended mith much Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and Persecution, stands in need of very cogent Reasons to
plead for its continuance. For others will not out-ballance the
evils that are asserted to flow from it. But it may be this will not
suffice with some for a final decision and determination of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
I shall therefore briefly state the <hi>Question</hi> about them,
which onely I shall speak unto, and try their use and usefulness by
that infallible Rule by which both we and they must be judged
another day.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Question stated. First Argument against the Composing and
Imposing of Liturgies. Arbitrary Additions to the Worship of
God rejected. Liturgies not appointed by God. Made necessary
in their Imposition: and a part of the Worship of God. Of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Worship. Instituted Adjuncts of Worship not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
Circumstances of Actions as such, not Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Worship. Circumstances commanded made parts of Worship.
Prohibitions of Additions produced, considered, applyed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>TO clear up what it is in Particular that we insist upon, some
few things are to be premised. 1. Then I do not in especial
intend the Liturgy now in use in <hi>England,</hi> any farther then to
make it an Instance of such Imposed Liturgies, whereof we
treat. I shall not then at all enquire what footing it hath in the
Law, how nor when established, nor what particular failings
are pleaded to be in it, nor what Conformity it bears with the
Roman Offices, with the like things that are usually Objected
against it. Nor, Secondly, do I oppose the directive part of this
Liturgy as to the reading of the Scripture, when it requires that
which is Scripture to be read, the Administration of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
by Christ appointed, nor the Composition of Forms
of Prayer suited to the nature of the Institutions to which they
relate, so they be not Imposed on the Administrators of them,
to be read precisely, as prescribed. But, Thirdly, this is that
alone which I shall speak unto; the Composing of Forms of
Prayer in the Worship of God, in all Gospel Administrations,
to be used by the Ministers of the Churches, in all Publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
by a precise reading of the words prescribed unto
them; with Commands for the reading of other things, which
they are not to omit, upon the penalty contained in the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole Service and the several parts of it. The liberty
which some say is granted for a man to use their own Gifts and
Abilities in Prayer before and after Sermons, will I fear as things
now stand, upon due Consideration, appear rather to be taken
then given. However it concerns not our present question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is taken for granted by those that plead for the strict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97323:21"/>
of a Book, that the whole Gospel VVorship of God
in the Assemblies of Christians, may be carried on and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without any such Preaching as is prefaced with the liberty
pretended.</p>
            <p>These things being Premised, I shall subjoyn some of the
Reasons that evidently declare the Imposition and Use of such
a Liturgy or Form of Publick Words, to be contrary to the
Rule of the Word, and consequently sinful.</p>
            <p>First, The Arbitrary Invention of any thing with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
for its necessary and indispensable use in the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, as a part of that Worship, and the use of any
thing so Invented and so Commanded is that Worship, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
and contrary to the Rule of the Word; But of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the Liturgy we treat of. It is an Invention of men, not
appointed, not commanded of God; it is commanded to be
used in the Publick Worship of God, by reading the several
Parts of it, according to the occasions that they respect; and
that indispensably; and is made a part of that Worship.</p>
            <p>There are Three Things affirmed in the Assumption concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Liturgy, <hi>First,</hi> That it is not Appointed or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is no Command of God either for the use
of this or that Liturgy in particular, nor in general that any such
should so be, and be so used as is pleaded. And this we must
take for granted, until some instance of any such Command be
produced. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is made Necessary by vertue of the
Commands of men, to be used in the Publick Worship of God.
About this there will be no difference. Let it be denied, and
there is an end of all this strife. I shall not dispute about other
mens practise. They who are willing to take it upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that the best way to serve God in the Church, or the
best Ability that they have for the discharge of their duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
consists in the reading of such a Book (for I suppose they
will grant that they ought to serve God with the best they have)
shall not by me be Opposed in their way and practise. It is onely
about its Imposition, and the Necessity of its Observance by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that Imposition, that we Discourse. Now the present
Command is, That such a Liturgy be alwayes used in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship of God, and that without the use or reading of
it, the Ordinances of the Gospel be not Administred, at any
time, nor in any place; with strong Pleas for the Obligation
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97323:21"/>
arising from that Command, making the omissions of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
to be sinful. It is then utterly impossible that any thing
should be more indispensably Necessary, then the reading of the
Liturgy in the Worship of God, is. It is said indeed, that it is
not Commanded as though in its self it were Necessary; either
a prescribed Liturgy or this or that, for then it were sin in any
not to use it, whether it were commanded by the Church or not,
but for Order, Uniformity, Conveniency, and the preventing
of sundry Evils that would otherwise ensue, it is commanded;
which Command makes the Observation of it Necessary unto
us. But we are not as yet enquiring what are the Reasons of its
Imposition. They may afterwards be spoken unto: and time
also may be taken to shew, that it were much more Tolerable,
if men would plead for the Necessity of the things which it seems
good unto them to Command, and on that ground to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their Observance, then granting them not Necessary in
themselves, to make them Necessary to be Observed meerly by
vertue of their Commands, for Reasons which they say satisfie
themselves, but come short of giving satisfaction to them from
whom Obedience is required. For whereas the Will of man
can be no way influenced unto Obedience, but by meer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Sovereignty, or conviction of Reason in and from the
things themselves, Commands in about things wherein they
own not that the Commanders have an absolute Sovereignty,
(as God hath in all things, the Civil Supream Magistrate in
things Civil that are good and lawful) nor can they find the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the things, themselves cogent, are a yoke which God
hath nor designed the sons of men to bear. But it is concerning
the <hi>Necessary use</hi> of the Liturgy in the Worship of God that we
are Disputing, which I suppose will not be denied.</p>
            <p>It remaineth then to consider whether the use of the Liturgy
as prescribed be made a part of the VVorship of God. Now
that wherewith and whereby God is commanded to be
worshipped, and without which all Observation or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his publick VVorship is forbidden, is it self made a
part of his VVorship. The Command with this, or thus, shall
you VVorship God, makes the Observation of that Command
a part of Gods VVorship. It is said that it is onely a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of VVorship but no part of it. Prayer is the VVorship
of God; but that <hi>this Prayer</hi> shall be used and no other, is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97323:22"/>
onely a Circumstance of it. So that though it may be possibly
accounted a Circumstance, or Accidentary part of Gods VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
yet it is not asserted to be of the substance of it. How far
this is so, and how far it is otherwise must be considered. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
are either such as follow actions as actions, or such
as are arbitrarily superadded and adjoyned by Command unto
actions, which do not of their own accord, nor naturally nor
necessarily attend them. Now Religious actions in the VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, are actions still. Their Religious Relation doth
not destroy their natural being. Those Circumstances then which
do attend such actions as actions, not determined by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
may be ordered, disposed of, and regulated by the
prudence of men. For instance, Prayer is a part of Gods VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Publick Prayer is so, as appointed by him. This as it is an
action to be performed by man, cannot be done without the
assignment of time, and place, and sundry other things, if Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Conveniency be attended. These are Circumstances
that attend all actions, of that nature, to be performed by a
Community, whether they relate to the VVorship of God or
no. These men may according as they see good regulate, and
change, as there is occasion: I mean they may do so, who are
acknowledged to have power in such things. As the Action
cannot be without them, so their regulation is arbitrary if they
come not under some Divine Disposition and Order; as that of
time in general doth. There are also some things, which some
men call Circumstances also, that no way belong of themselves
to the actions whereof they are said to be the Circumstances,
nor do attend them, but are imposed on them, or annexed unto
them, by the arbitrary Authority of those who take upon them
to give Order and Rules in such cases. Such is to Pray before
an Image, or towards the East, or to use this or that Form of
Prayer in such Gospel administrations and no other. These are
not Circumstances attending the nature of the thing it self, but
are arbitrarily superadded to the things that they are appointed
to accompany. VVhat ever men may call such Additions, they
are no less parts of the whole wherein they serve, then the things
themselves whereunto they are adjoyned. The Schoolmen tell
us, that that which is made so the condition of an action, that
without it the action is not to be done, is not a circumstance of
it, but such an adjunct as is a necessary part. But not to contend
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97323:22"/>
about the word; such additionals that are called Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial,
are made parts of Worship, as are made necessary by
vertue of Command to be observed. Sacrifices of old were the
Instituted Worship of God. That they should be offered at
the Tabernacle or Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and no where else, was
a circumstance appointed to be observed in their Offerings; and
yet this circumstance was no less a part of Gods Worship, then
the Sacrifice it self. In the judgement of most men not onely
Prayer, and the matter of our Prayer is appointed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the Lords Prayer, but we are commanded also to use
the very words of it. I desire to know whether the precise use
of these words be not a part of Gods Worship? It seems that
it is: For that which is commanded by Christ to be used in the
Worship of God, is a part of Gods Worship. The case is the
same here. Prayer is Commanded; and the use of these Prayers
is commanded; the latter distinctly as such, as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is made a part of Gods Worship. Nor is there any ground
for that distinction of the Circumstantial or Accidentary part
of Gods Worship, and Worship Substantially taken, or the
Substantial parts of it. The Worship of God is either Moral or
Instituted. The latter contains the peculiar wayes and manner
of exerting the former according to Gods appointment. The
Actions whereby these are joyntly discharged, or the inward
Moral Principles of VVorship are exerted in, and according to
the outward Institutions have their Circumstances attending
them. These in themselves nakedly considered, have in them
neither good nor evil; nor are any Circumstances in the VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, much less circumstantial parts of his VVorship,
but onely circumstances of those Actions as actions, whereby it
is performed. And whatever is Instituted of God, in and about
those Circumstances, is a Substantial part of his VVorship.</p>
            <p>Nor is the prescribing of such a Form of Prayer a regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those circumstances of Publick Prayer; for Decency,
Order, and Uniformity, which attend it as a publick Action,
but the superaddition of an adjunct condition, with which it
is to be performed, and without which it is not to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as it is Prayer, the VVorship of God. On this nature was
Sacrificing of old on the Altar at the Tabernacle or Temple, and
there alone. And many more instances of the like nature may
be given. Praising of God, and blessing of the People were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97323:23"/>
parts of the VVorship of God, appointed by himself to be
performed by the Priests under the Law. In the doing thereof
at certain Seasons, they were commanded to use some Forms
of words prescribed unto them for that purpose. Not onely
hereby the praising and blessing of God, but the use of those
Forms in so doing, became necessary part of the VVorship of
God. And so was the use of Organs and the like Instruments
of Musick, which respect that manner of Prasing him which
God then required. The Case is here no otherwise. Prayers
and Thanksgivings in the Administration of the Ordinances of
the Gospel are of the Instituted VVorship of God. Unto these,
as to the manner of their Performance, is the Imposition of the
Liturgical Forms spoken of, superadded; and their use made a
necessary adjunct of the duty it self, so as that it may not be
performed without them; which makes them a no less neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
part of the VVorship of God, then any of his Institutions
of old were, which related to the Circumstances and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Worship, as the Temple, Tabernacle, Altar, Forms
of Thanksgiving, and Confession, composed and prescribed by
the Holy Ghost himself.</p>
            <p>But I suppose this will not be much gain-said; by some it is
acknowledged in express terms, and for the matter of Fact, we
find that the Reading of a Book of Service, is with many taken
not to be a <hi>part,</hi> but the <hi>whole</hi> of the Worship of God, which
if it be done, they suppose God is acceptably Worshipped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado; and if it be omitted, whatever else be done in the
room of it, that God is not Worshipped at all.</p>
            <p>Our Enquiry then must be whether such Additions to or in
the Worship of God, besides or beyond his own Institution
and Appointment, be allowable, or lawful to be practised. I
shall first recite the words in general of some Testimonies that
lye against such a practise, and then consider what they most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
speak unto. Of this sort are <hi>Exod. 20. 4, 5. Thou shalt
not make unto thee any graven Image, or any likeness to any thing
that is in Heaven about, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that
is in the Water under the Earth. Thou shalt not bow down to
them nor serve them, for I the Lord the God am a jealous God, visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, &amp;c.</hi> Den. 4. 2. <hi>Ye
shall not adde unto the Word which I command you, neither shall you
diminish ought from it, that you may keep the commandments of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97323:23"/>
Lord your God which I command you,</hi> Chap. 12. 32. <hi>What thing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I command you observe to do it, thou shalt not adde thereunto, nor
diminish from it,</hi> Prov. 30. 6. <hi>Adde not unto his words least he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thee and thou be found a liar,</hi> Jer. 7. 31. <hi>They have built the
high places of Tophet which is in the valley of the Son of Hinnom to
burn their Sons and their Daughters in the fire, which I commanded
them not, neither came it into my heart.</hi> Matth. 15. 9. <hi>In vain do
they worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandment of men.</hi>
ver. 13. <hi>Every plant which my Father hath not planted, shall be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up.</hi> Also <hi>Mark 7. 7, 8. Revel. 22. 18. If any man shall adde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these things, God shall adde unto him the plagues that are written
in this Book.</hi> The Mind of God in these and the like prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Reader may find exemplified, <hi>Lev. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.
Iosh. 22. 10, &amp;c. Iudg. 8. 24. 1 Chron. 15. 13. 2 Kin.</hi> 16. 11, 12.
and in other places.</p>
            <p>Men who having great abilities of Learning, are able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
themselves from under the power of the most express rules
and commands, should yet methinks out of a sense of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(which they are ready to profess themselves convinced of
when occasion is offered to deliver their thoughts concerning
them) have compassion for those, who being not able to discern
the strength of their reasonings because of their fineness, are kept
in a conscientious subjection to the express Commands of God,
especially conceiving them not without some cogent cause reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>But least the present exasperation of the Spirits of men, should
frustrate that hope and expectation, let us consider what is the
precise intendment of the testimonies produced, being we have
reason to look well to the justice of our cause in the first place;
which being cleared, we may the better be satisfied in coming
short of favour where it may not be obtained. The places of
Scripture produced, are taken partly out of the Old Testament,
partly out of the New. And I suppose it will be granted that there
is an equal force of rule in the one, as in the other. For though
these in the Old Testament had their peculiar respect to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that <hi>was</hi> then instituted, yet they had not as <hi>then</hi> instituted
but as the Worship, which God himself had appointed. And
therefore their general force abides whilest God requires any
Worship at the hands of men; unless it may be made appear that
God hath parted with that Prerogative of being the Appointer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97323:24"/>
of his own Worship, now under the New Testament, which he
so vindicated unto himself under the Old. Take them then in
their general aim and intention, that which these and the like
Testimonies unanimously speak unto us, is this, That the will of
God is the sole Rule of his Worship, and all the concernment of
it, and that his Authority is the sole Principle and Cause of the
relation of any thing to his Worship, in a Religious manner; and
consequently that he never did, nor ever will allow that the wills
of his Creatures should be the rule or measure of his Honour or
Worship, nor that their Authority should cause any thing to hold
a new relation unto him, or any other but what it hath by the
Law of its Creation. As this is the sum and substance of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment, wherein so great a cloud of Expositors do
center their thoughts, that it will not be easie for any to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them, so that the other Texts produced are express to all
the Particulars of the Assertion laid down, may be easily evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>That the Lord asserts his own Aothority and Will as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
cause and rule of all his Worship, was the first thing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.
His repetition of <hi>My Words,</hi> what <hi>I have commanded,</hi>
and the like expressions, secure this enclosure. Unless men can
pretend, that there is the same reason of the words and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God himself, it is in vain for them to pretend a power
of instituting any thing in the Worship of God: For the formal
reason of every such Institutions is, That the Word of it is the
VVord of God. It is enough to discard any thing from a relation
to the VVorship of God, to manifest that the appointers of it
were men, and not God. Nor can any man prove that God hath
diligated unto them his Power in this matter. Nor did he ever
do so to any of the sons of Men; namely, that they should have
Authority to appoint any thing in his VVorship, or about it,
that seemeth meet unto their wisdome. VVith some indeed in
former days, he entrusted the work of Revealing unto his Church
and People what he himself would have observed, which dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
he closed in the Person of Christ, and his Apostles. But to
entrust men with Authority not to declare what he revealed, but
to appoint what seemeth good unto them, he never did it, the
Testimonies produced lye evidently against it. Now surely Gods
asserting his own VVill and Authority as the onely rule and cause
of his VVorship, should make men cautions how they suppose
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97323:24"/>
themselves <hi>like</hi> or <hi>equal</hi> unto him herein, especially being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of warrant from the approved Example or President of any
that have gone before them. If the example of any one in the Old
or New Testament could be produced, that of his own Mind and
Authority made any such Additions to the VVorship of God, as
that which we treat about, by vertue of any Trust or Power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
from or under him, and found acceptance in his so doing,
or that was not severely rebuked for his sin therein, some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
would seem to be given unto those, that at present walk
in such paths; although I suppose, it would not be easie for them
to prove any particular instances, which might have peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
from the general Law, which we know not, to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
warrant for their proceedings. But whereas God himself
having instituted his own VVorship and all the concernments of
it, doth also assert his own Authority and VVill as the sole cause
and rule of all the VVorship that he will accept, no instance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left on record of any one that ever made any Additions to
what he had appointed, on any pretence whatever, or by vertue
of any Authority wherever that was accepted with him; and
whereas the most eminent of those who have assumed that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to themselvea, as also the judgement of the reasons necessary
for the exerting of it, as to matter and manner, have been given
up in the righteous judgement of God to do things not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
yea abominable unto him (as in the Papal Church) it is not
unlikely to be the wisdome of men to be very cautious of intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselves into this thankless Office.</p>
            <p>But such is the corrupt nature of man, that there is scarce any
thing, whereabout men have been more apt to contend with God
from the foundation of the world. That their will and wisdome
may have a share (some at least) in the ordering of his VVorship
is that which of all things they seem to desire. VVherefore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
their pride and folly, to his asserting of his own Prerogative
in this matter, he subjoyns severe interdictions, against all or any
mans interposing therein; so as to take away any thing by him
commanded, or to adde any thing to what is by him appointed.
This also the Testimonies recited fully express. The Prohibition
is plain, <hi>Thou shalt not adde to what I have commanded. Adde not
to his Words,</hi> that is, in his VVorship to the things which by his
VVord he hath appointed to be observed; neither to the VVord
of his Institution, nor to the things instituted, Indeed adding
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97323:25"/>
things adds to the VVord; for the VVord that adds is made of
a like Authority with his. All <hi>Making to our selves</hi> is forbidden,
though what we so make may seem unto us to tend to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the VVorship of God. It is said men may adde nothing
to the substance of the VVorship of God, but they may order, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose,
and appoint the things that belong to the manner and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of it, and this is all that is done in the prescription of
Liturgies. Of Circumstances in and about the VVorship of God
we have spoken before, and removed that pretence. Nor is it safe
distinguishing in the things of God, where himself hath not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.
VVhen he gave out the Prohibitions mentioned
under the Old Testament, he was appointing or had appointed his
whole VVorship, and all that belonged unto it, in matter and
manner, way and order, substance and circumstance. Indeed there
is nothing in its whole nature, as it belongs to the general being
of things, so circumstantial, but that if it be appointed by God in
his VVorship, it becomes a part of the substance of it; nor can any
thing that is not so appointed ever by any be made a circumstance
of his VVorship, though many things are circumstances of those
actions, which in his VVorship are performed. This distinction
then directly makes void the Command, so that Conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
acquiesce in it. Besides we have shewed that Liturgies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and imposed, are necessary parts of Gods VVorship, and
so not to be salved by this distinction.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to testifie what weight he laip on the Observance
of these general Prohibitions when men found out other ways of
Worship then what he had appointed, though the particulars
were such as fell under other special interdictions, yet the Lord
was pleased to place the great aggravation of their sin in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of those general rules mentioned. This is that he urgeth
them with, That they did things by him <hi>not appointed;</hi> of not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
any thing in Religion, but what he requires, that he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them withall. The Command is general. You shall adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to what I have instituted; and the aggravation of the sin
pressed by him relates not to the particular nature of it, but to
this general command or prohibition; <hi>You have done what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you not.</hi> That the particular evil condemned was also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
other special Commands of God, is meerly accidental to
the general nature of the Crime they were urged withall. And
whereas God hath given out these Rules and Precepts; <hi>You shall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97323:25"/>
do whatever I command you, and according as I command you, you
shall adde nothing thereunto, nor take any therefrom;</hi> can the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of this Rule be any otherwise expressed, but thus:
<hi>They did the thing which he commanded not, nor did it ever come
into his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is said that the intention of these Rules and Prohibitions,
is onely to prevent the Additions of what is contrary to what
God hath appointed, and not of that which may <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end to the
furtherance and better discharge of his Appointments. The usual
answer to this acception is, That whatever is added, is contrary
to what is commanded, though not in this or that particular
command, yet to that command that nothing he added. It is
not the nature of any particular that is condemned, but the
power of adding, in those Prohibitions. Let us see then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these senses have the fairest evidence with the evident
purport and intention of the Rules, Precepts, and Prohibitions
under Consideration.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jesus Christ directs his Apostles to teach his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<hi>to do and observe whatever he commanded them.</hi> Those
who contend for the latter interpretation of these and the like
Precepts before-mentioned, affirm that there is in these words
a restriction of the matter of their Commission, to the express
commands of Christ. What he commands, they say, they were
to teach men to observe, and nothing else, nor will he require
the observance of ought else at our hands. The others would
have his intention to be, whatever he commanded, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
seemeth good to them to command, so it be not contrary
unto what was by him commanded. As if he had said, Teach
men to observe whatever I command them, and command you
them to observe whatever you think meet, so it be not contrary
to my commands. Certainly this gloss at the first view seems to
defeat the main intendment of Christ, in that express limitation
of their Commission unto his own commands. So also under
the Old Testament; given order about his Worship, the Lord
lets <hi>Moses</hi> know that he must do all things according to what
he should shew and reveal unto him. In the close of the Work
committed unto him, to shew that what he had done was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, it is eight or ten times repeated, that he did all
as the Lord commanded him: Nothing was omitted, nothing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97323:26"/>
added by him. That the same course might be observed in the
following practice, which was taken in the first Institution, the
Lord commands that nothing be added to what was so appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him; nothing diminished from it. The whole Duty then
of the Church, as unto the Worship of God, seems to lye in the
precise Observation of what is appointed and commanded by
him. To assert things may be added to the Worship of God,
not by him appointed, which in the judgement of those that
adde them, seem useful for the better performance of what he
hath appointed, so that they be not contrary unto them, seems
to defeat the whole end and intention of God in all those Rules
and Prohibitions; if either the occasion, rise, cause of them,
or their commendable Observance be considered. On these and
no better terms is that prescribed Liturgy we treat of, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and imposed. It comes from man, with Authority to be
added to the Worship that Christ requires, and ventures on all
the severe interdictions of such Additions, armed onely with the
pretence of not being contrary to any particular command, in
the matter of it (which yet is denied) and such distinctions, as
have not the least ground in Scripture, or in the Reason of the
things themselves, which it is applied unto. Might we divert
into particulars, it were easie to demonstrate, that the instances
given in the Scripture of Gods rejection of such additions, do
abundantly obviate all the Pleas that are insisted on, for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the general Prohibition.</p>

withall, may command in their own Names an Observance of
the things about which by Gods appointment their Authority
is to be exercised. Thus is it with Kings and Rulers of the
Earth. They are powers ordained of God, having Authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them by him. And being invested with power, they give
out their commands for the doing or performing of such or such
things, whereunto their Authority doth extend. That they
ought to be obeyed in things good and lawful, doth not arise
from the Authority vested in themselves, but from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
command of God, that in such things they ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.
Hence Obedience in general unto Magistrates, is a part
of our Moral and Religious Obedience unto God, as it respects
his Command, whatever the nature and object of it be. But the
performance of particular actions, wherein by their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
our Obedience exerts it self, being resolved into that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which is vested in them, is not <hi>Religious</hi> but Civil Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
any otherwise then as in respect of its general nature it
relates to the Command of God in general. No act I say, that
we perform, whereof this is the formal Reason, that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and commanded by man, though that man be entrusted
with power from God, to appoint and require acts of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is an act of Religious Obedience unto God in its self; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it relates not immediately to his divine Authority requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God doth exert his Authority immediately; and
that either directly from Heaven, as in the giving of the Law; or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97323:27"/>
by the inspiration of others to declare his will, unto both which
his Word written answereth. Now whatever is done in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Authority of God thus exerting it self, is a part of
that Religious duty which we owe to God; whether it be in
his first Institution and Appointment, or any duty in its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Revelation; or whether it be in the Commands he gives
for the Observation of what he hath formerly appointed. For
when God hath Commanded any things to be Observed in his
Worship, though he design and appoint men to see them obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
accordingly, and furnish them with the Authority of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
to that purpose, yet the interposition of that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of men, though by Gods Institution, doth not at all hinder,
but that the duty performed is Religious obedience, relating
directly to the Will and Command of God. The power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
in the case we have in hand is mans, not that of the
Lord: For though it be acknowledged that those who do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
have their Authority from God; yet unless the thing
commanded be also in particular appointed by God, the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is yielded is purely Civil, and not Religious. This is
the state of the matter under Consideration. The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Imposing Power is variously apprehended. Some say it
is the Church that doth it; and so assert the Authority to be
Ecclesiastical; every Church, say they, hath Power to order
things of this nature for order and decency sake; when it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
what the Church is that they intend, there some are at a
loss, and would fain insinuate somewhat into our thoughts that
they dare not openly assert and maintain. The truth is, the
Church in this sense is the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>King and Parliament,</hi> by
whose Advice he exerts his Legislitive Power. By their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was the Liturgy Composed, or it was Composed without
Authority: by their Authority it must be Imposed if it be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
what is, or was done in the Preparation of it by others,
unto their judgement hath no more influence into the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
imposition of it, when the act of a Person learned in the
Law, drawing up a Bill for the Consideration of Parliament,
hath into its binding Law Power, when confirmed. In this
sense we acknowledge the Power ordaining and imposing this
Liturgy to be of God, to be good and lawful, to be obeyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the utmost extent of that Obedience, which to man can be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97323:27"/>
due, and that upon the account of the Institution and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God himself. But yet supposing the Liturgy to fall
within the precincts and limits of that Obedience, yet the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
and use of it, being not Commanded of God, is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an act of Civil obedience, and not Religious, wherein the
Conscience lies in no immediate subjection to Jesus Christ.
It is of the same general nature with the honest discharge of
the Office of a Constable; and this seems in consistent with the
nature of the Worship of God.</p>
            <p>But whatever be the immediate imposing Power, we have
direction as to our duty in the last Injunction of our blessed
Saviour to his Apostle, <hi>Matth, 28. 20. Teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all things whatsoever I have commanded.</hi> In things which
concern the Worship of God, the commanding Power is
Christ; and his Command the adaequate Rule and Measure
of our Obedience. The Teaching, Commanding, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
of others to do and observe those Commands, is
the duty of those entrusted with Christs Authority under
him. Their Commission to Teach and Enjoyn, and our
Duty to Do and Observe, have the same Rules, the same
Measure, Bounds, and Limits. What they teach and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
beyond what Christ hath Commanded, they do it not
by vertue of any Commission from him; what we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what he hath Commanded, we do it not in obedience
to him; what they so teach, they do it in their own
Name, not his; what we so do, we do in our own strength,
not his; nor to his Glory. The Answer of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to
that Argument of the Protestant Divines from this place,
against the Impositions of his Church, is the most weak and
frivolous, that I think ever any Learned man was forced to
make use of; and yet where to find better will not easily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre.
Our Lord Jesus Christ saith, <hi>Go and teach men to do
and observe whatever I have commanded you, and so I am with
you;</hi> To which he subjoynes, <hi>It is true; but yet we are bound
also to obey them that are set over us, that is our Church Guides;</hi>
and so leaves the Argument as sufficiently discharged. Now
the whole Question is concerning what those Church Guides
may teach and enjoy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, whereunto we are to give Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97323:28"/>
by Christ; to which the Cardinal offers not one
word. The things our Saviour treats about, are principally
the <hi>Agenda</hi> of the Gospel, things to be done and observed
in the Worship of God. Of these, as was said, he makes his
own Command the adaequate Rule and Measure. <hi>Teach men
to observe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, all whatsoever I command;</hi> in their so
doing alone, doth he promise his Presence with them; that
is, to enable them unto the discharge of their duty. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
I say, all that shall to the end of the World, be
called to serve him in the Work of the Gospel, to <hi>teach.</hi> In that
Expression he compriseth their whole duty; as their whole
Authority is given them in this Commission. In their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed they are to command with all Authority; and
upon their non-obedience of men unto their teaching, either
by not receiving their word, or by walking unworthy of it
when it is received in the Profession of it, he hath allotted
them the course of their whole proceedings; but still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
that all be regulated by what they are originally
commissionated, and enabled to teach and command. Let
then the Imposition of a Liturgy be tryed by this Rule. It
was never by Christ Commanded to his Apostles, cannot by
any be taught as his Command, and therefore men in the
Teaching or Imposing of it, have no promise of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
nor do they that observe it, yield any obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him therein. This I am sure will be the Rule of Christs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
at his great Visitation at the last Day; the things which
himself hath Commanded will be enquired after, as to
some mens Teachings, and all mens Observation, and those
onely. And I cannot but admire with what peace and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to their own Souls, men can pretend to act as
by Commission from Christ, as the chief Administrators of
his Gospel and Worship on the Earth, and make it their
whole business almost to teach men to do and observe what
he never commanded, and rigorously to enquire after and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the observation of their own commands, whilest those of
the Lord Jesus are openly neglected.</p>
            <p>But let the Authority of men for Imposition, be supposed to
equal the fancy of any who through ignorance or interest are
most devoted unto it; when they come to put their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97323:28"/>
into execution, commanding things in and about the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, I desire to know by what Rule they are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in their so doing. All the actions of men are, or ought
to be Regular. Good or evil they are, as they answer to, or
dissent from their proper Rule. The Rule in this matter must
be the Word of God, or their own Prudence. Allow the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
to be the Rule, that is revealing what they ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and there is a total end of this Difference. What a
Rule the latter is like to prove is easie to Conjecture; but
there is no need of Conjectures where Experience interposeth.
The great Philosopher is blamed by some for inserting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of men Wise and Prudent, into his definition of
the Rule of Moral Vertue. For, they say that cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known, whose Rule and Measure is fluctuating and
uncertain. If there be ground for this Assertion in reference
to Moral vertues, whose Seed and Principles are in-laid in the
nature of Man, how much more is that Rule to be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when applied to things whose spring and foundation lies
meerly in supernatural Revelation. How various, uncertain,
and tumultuating, how roving this pretended Rule is like to
prove, how short it comes to any one single property of a
sufficient Rule, much more of all things that are necessary to
compleat a Rule of Prorocecome in such cases, were easie to
demonstrate. What good and useful place that is like to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the Worship of God, which having its Rise in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of man; is framed by the Rule of the wisdome of
man; and so wholly resolved into his Will, I may say will be
one day judged and determined, but that it is so already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in the Word of Truth.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>WE proceed to some further Considerations upon the
state of the Question before laid down; and shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
on some other Argument against the Imposition pleaded
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97323:29"/>
for. We have spoken to the Authority Imposing; our next
Argument is taken from the Thing or Matter Imposed, and the
End of that Imposition.</p>
            <p>An Humane Provision of means for the accomplishing of
any End or Ends in the Worship of God, for which Jesus
Christ himself hath made and doth continue to make Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to the exclusion of that Provision so by him made, is
not allowable, About this Assertion I suppose we shall have
no Contention. To assert the Lawfulness of such Provisions,
is in the first instance to exalt the Wisdome and Authority of
men, above that of Christ, and that in his own house. This
men will not nakedly and openly do, though by just conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it be done every day. But we have secured our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
by the plainness of its terms, against which no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
can lye. It remaineth then that we shew, that the
things mentioned in it, and rejected as disallowable are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
applicable to the Imposition of Liturgies contended
about.</p>
            <p>That the Prescription of the Liturgy, to be used as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
is the Provision of a means for the accomplishing of
some Ends in the Worship of God, the Judgement and the
Practise of those who Contend for it, do sufficiently declare.
Those Ends, or this End (to sum them up all in one) is, That
the Ordinances and Institutions of Christ may be quickly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
and solemnized in the Church with decency and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto the Edification of the Assemblies wherein it is used.
I suppose none will deny this to be the end intended in its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
it is so pleaded continually; nor is there uny other
that I know of assigned. Now of the things mentioned it is
the last that is the principal end; namely, the Edification of
the Church, which is aimed at for its own sake, and so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the whole Procedure of meer <hi>mediums,</hi> and those that
are so <hi>mediums</hi> as also to be estemed subordinate ends. Such
are Decency and Order, or Uniformity. These have not their
worth from themselves, nor do they influence the intention
of the Liturgists for their own sakes, but as they tend unto
Edification. And this the Apostolical Rule expresly requireth,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. The Prescription then of a Liturgy is a Provision
for the right Administration of the Ordinances of the Gospel
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97323:29"/>
uno the Edification of the Church. This is its general nature;
and in the Administration of the Ordinances of the Gospel,
consists the chief and main work of the Ministry: That this
Provision is Humane, hath been before  declared. It was not
made by Christ, nor his Apostles; but of men, and by men
was it made and Imposed on the Disciples of Christ. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
then that we Consider whether Jesus Christ have not
made provision for the same end and purpose; namely, that the
Ordinances and Institutions of the Gospel may be administred
to the edification of the Church. Now this the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
affirms, <hi>Ephes. 4. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Unto every one of
us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ;
wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high, he led captivity
captive and gave Gifts unto men,—He gave—some Pastors and
Teachers for the perfection of the Saints, for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
for the edifying of the Body of Christ; till we all came in
the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
Christ.</hi> The Lord Jesus who hath appointed the Office of the
Ministry, hath also provided sufficient furniture for the Persons
called according to his mind to the discharge of that Office, and
the whole Duty of it. That the administration of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the Gospel is the work of the Ministry I suppose will
not be denied. Now that this work of the Ministry may be
discharged to the edification of his Body, and that to the end of
the World, until all his People in every Generation are brought
unto the Measure of Grace assigned unto them in this life, is
expresly affirmed. He hath given Gifts for this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
namely, that the work of the Ministry may be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the edification of his Body. To say that the Provision
he hath made is not every way sufficient for the attaining of
the End for which it was made by him, or that he continueth
not to make the same Provision that he did formerly, are
equally false, equally blasphemous; the one injurious to his
Wisdome, the other to his Truth, both to his Love and Care
of his Church. For Decency and Uniformity in all his Churches
the Lord Jesus also hath provided. The Administration of the
same specifical Ordinances in the Assemblies of his Disciples
conveened according to his mind, according to the same Rule
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97323:30"/>
of his Word, by vertue of the same specifical Gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
by him bestowed on the Administrators of them, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
the Uniformity that he requires and is acceptable unto
him. This was the Uniformity of the Apostolical Churches,
walking by the same Rule of Faith and Obedience, and no
other; And this is all the Uniformity that is among the true
Churches of Christ, that are this day in the World. To ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that there should be an Uniformity in Words and Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Speech and the like, is an unpracticable Figment, which
never was obtained, nor ever will be to the end of the World.
And when men by the invention of Rites and Orders, began
to depart from this Uniformity, how far they were from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into any other, is notorious from that Discourse of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
on this matter, <hi>lib. 5. cap.</hi> 21. For these then the Lord
Christ hath made provision. And where there is this Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
unto Edification, let those things be attended unto, which
are requisite for the nature of Assembles meeting for such ends,
as Assemblies, and all the Decency and Order which Christ
requireth will ensue. I suppose it will not be safe for any man
to derogate from the sufficiency of this provision. If any shall
say, That we see, and find by experience that men called to
be Ministers are not so enabled to the Work of the Ministry,
as by vertue of the Gifts they have received to admidister the
Ordinancer of the Gospel unto the edification of the Church,
I shall desire them to Consider whether indeed such persons be
rightly called unto the Ministry, and do labour aright to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their duty in that Office; seeing that if they are so,
aud do so, there seems to be a direct failure of the Promise
of Christ, which is blasphemy to imagine. And it may be
Considered whether this pretended defect and want, do not,
where it is in those who are indeed called to the Work of the
Ministry, proceed from their neglect to stir up the Gifts that
they have received by the use and exercise of them, for which
end alone they are entrusted with them; And it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Considered whether their neglect hath not been occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
greatly by some mens imposing of prescribed Liturgies, and
others trusting to their use, in those things, and for those ends,
for which men are entrusted with those Gifts by Jesus Christ.
And if this be so, as indeed upon due search it will appear so
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97323:30"/>
to be, then we have a secret inclusion of the Provision made
by Christ for the ends mentioned, plainly intimated unto us,
before we arrive at the express Consideration of it.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; The provision that Christ hath made for
the discharge of the whole Work of the Ministry, in the
Administration of the Ordinances of the Gospel unto the
edification of his Church, is his Collation or bestowing of
Gifts on men rightly called to the Office of the Ministry,
enabling them unto, and to be exercised in that Work: In
the Prescription and Imposition of a Liturgy, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
made for the discharge of the Work of the Ministry in
the Administration of the Ordinances of the Gospel unto
the edification of the Church, in and by the precise reading
and pronouncing of the words set down therein without
alteration, diminution, or addition. It remaineth then to
Consider where this latter Provision be not exclusive of the
former, and whether the use of them both at the same time
be not inconsistent. The Administration of Gospel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
consists in Prayer, Thanksgiving, Instruction and
Exhortations, suitably applied unto the special nature and end
of the several Ordinances themselves, and the use of them
in the Church. For the right performance of all these, Christ
gives Gifts unto Ministers; the Liturgy a certain number of
Words to be read without addition or alteration, and this
<hi>toties quoties</hi> as the Ordinances are to be administered. Now
unless it can be made to appear, that an ability to read the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
words of the Liturgy, be the Gifts promised by Christ
for the discharge a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Work of the Ministers, which cannot
be done, it is most evident, that there is an inconsistency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the use and actual exercise of these several Provisions
of <hi>mediums</hi> for the compassing of the same end; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the necessary indispensable use of the Liturgy is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
exclusive of the use of the means provided by Christ,
and for that end, for which the Liturgy is invented and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
What dismal effects have issued hereupon may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
hereafter if need be. Certainly more then one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God, and more then one Promise of Christ
have been made void by this Tradition: And I desire that
none would be offended, if as my own apprehension I affirm,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97323:31"/>
That the Introduction of Liturgies was, on the account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, the principal means of increasing and carrying on
that sad defection and Apostasie, in the guilt whereof most
Churches in the World had enwrapped themselves. Nor doth
there lye at present any relief against this Consideration from
hence, that Ministers are allowed the exercise of their gifts
they have received in their Preaching, and Prayers before and
after Sermons; For First, that indeed there is such a Liberty
allowed, if the present Liturgy be so imposed as by some is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
is very questionable; many that are looked on as
skilled in that law and Mystery of it, do by their practise give
another interpretation of the intendment of its Imposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
making it extend to all that is done in the Publick Worship, the
bare Preaching or Reading of a Sermon or Homily excepted.
Nor Secondly, is that the matter enquired into, Whether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
may at any time, or in any part of Gods Worship make
use of their Gifts, but whether they may do it in all those Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,
for whose performance to the edification of his
Body, they are bestowed on them by Jesus Christ; which by
the Rule of the Liturgy we have shewed they may not; and I
doubt not but it will be granted by those who contend for the
Imposition of the Liturgy, that it extends to the principal parts,
if not the whole of the Publick Worship of God in the Church.
Now certainly it is necessary that Conscience be clearly satisfied,
that this prescription of an Humane Provision of means for such
Ends in the Worship of God, as Christ hath made provision
for, which is ex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luded thereby, be not against express rule of

Love of his Church, as also to the perfection the Scripture,
(2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16.) and whether it brings not the Ministers of

            </argument>
            <p>FUrthermore, the great Rule of Gospel Administrations is
that all things be done to Edification. This is the main End
of the Ministry its self, in all the duties thereof, that are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Evangelical. For this end was the Office of the Ministry
Instituted, for this end are Ministerial Gifts dispensed, for this
end were the Sacraments appointed, and all Church Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
Church Power, and whatever else belongs to Churches;
it is all Ordained for this End that the Body of Christ may be
edified and increased with the increase of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Col. 2. 19. Acts 9. 31. Rom.</hi> 14. 19, 15.

The full and adaequate Rule of all Church-order and duties is,
That all things be done to Edification. It doth not hence ensue
that whatever men shall judge to conduce to edification, may
be used by themselves or imposed on others in the Worship of
God. Christ himself, the onely wise and competent Judge in
such Cases, hath precisely himself determined what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
hereunto; having as on other accounts, so on this also,
limitted men to his prescription, because nothing is effectual
unto Edification but by vertue of his blessing, which is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely to his own Institutions. But this will undeniably
hence ensue, That whatever is contrary unto, or an hindrance
of Edification, oughr not to be appointed or observed in the
Worship of God. For certainly whatever is an hindrance of
that in any kind, unto whose furtherance all things of that kind
ought to contribute, their whole worth and vertue consisting
in that contribution, can have no due place amongst them. If
it appear that this is the state and condition of this Imposed
Liturgy in Church Administrations, I presume it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that it ought not to obtain any place or room amongst
them. The Edification of the Church depends principally on
the blessing of God upon the exercise of those Ministerial gifts
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97323:32"/>
which are bestowed on men for that end; namely, that the
Church be edified. God supplying seed to the Sower, blesseth
it with an encrease in the field where it is sowed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10.
The Gifts that are bestowed on Ministers are their principal
Talents that they ought to trade withall for the profit of their
Master; that is, the building up of his house wherein his wealth
in this world doth lye. Yea, all the Gifts that are bestowed by
the Spirit of Christ on men, are given them to profit withall,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. and they are required with them to act for God
in the edification of the Body of Christ, every one according
to his measure, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. This I suppose will be granted.
Moreover, that the Gifts bestowed by Christ on the guides of
his Church, the Ministers of the Gospel are proportioned
and suited to the end which he aimeth to accomplish by them,
as we have in part before declared, so it is evident from the
infinite Wisdome of him that bestows them. From both which
it will undeniably follow, that on the due and regular use
and employment of those Gifts which men receive from
Christ, depends and that solely the edification of his Church,
I suppose this will not be denied, where the Gifts bestowed by
the Spirit of Christ upon the Ministers of his Church, are used
and exercised in the Work of the Ministry, according to his
Mind and Will, there by his blessing the edification which he
doth intend will ensue. Let us then proceed. These Gifts as
the Scripture witnesseth, and experience convinceth are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in great variety and in several degrees. The greater and more
excellent they are in any entrusted with them, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
is the means of edification which the Lord affords unto his
Disciples by them. Edification then as in its general nature it
depends on the gifts of Christ which he bestows on the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of his Church, so as to the degrees of it, and its special fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance,
it depends on the degrees and special improvement
of those Gifts. For this cause all those to whom the work of
the Ministry is committed, as they ought to desire spiritual gifts,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1. that the Church may be edified by them, so to
covet earnestly the best gifs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. that they may singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
edifie the Church, and also seek to excel in those gifts,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. that the same word of Edification may be carried
on to the utmost. It may then be enquired how these spiritual
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97323:32"/>
gifts which we must suppose all Ministers of the Gospel in some
measure to have received, may be improved, so that they may
excel to the edifying of the Church, which is expresly required
of them: We say then, that the improvement and encrease of
spiritual gifts doth ordinarily and regularly depend on their due
and holy exercise. He that had a Talent and used it not, though
he endeavoured to keep it safe, yet it did not encrease; when
every <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e that traded with the stock wherewith they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted,
made a regular encrease according to the measure they
had received. And in Experience we daily see men Napkening
their Talents until they are taken from them; whilst others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Additions to their store, at least such supplies as that
their first Provisions fail not. Hence the great direction for the
exercise of the work of the Ministry is, to <hi>stir up the gift recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
by a due performance whereof in all persons entrusted
with them, is the whole work of edifying the body of Christ,
until it reach the measure appointed to every member, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
and finished. Edification then depends on the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gifts, and the improvement of Gifts on their due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
according to the mind of Christ. The want then of that
due exercise, either by the neglect of them on whom they are
bestowed, or any hindrance of it put upon them by others, is
the sole way of obstructing the improvement of spiritual gifts,
and by direct and immediate consequence of the edification of
the Church. Now this seems to be so much done by the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Liturgy and imposition of it, that it is impossible
for the wit of man to invent a more effectual expedient for the
compassing of that evil end. The main exercise of Spiritual gifts
on which their growth and improvement doth depend, lyes in
the administration of Gospel Ordinances. That is the work of
the Ministry for which they are bestowed. To hinder therefore
or forbid that exercise is directly to forbid the due, regular, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
means of their encrease, and so also of the edification of
the body of Christ; the means indispensably necessary unto it,
being removed and taken away. Now this is openly and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
done in the imposed Liturgy if imposed. It says expresly
that the Ministers of the Gospel shall not use or exercise any
Spiritual gift in the administration of those Ordinances for
which provision is made in the Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:97323:33"/>
And as in this Case the condition of the People who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the means of their edification, is sad, so that of the
Ministers of the Gospel miserable and deplorable. The Lord
Jesus Christ bestows gifts upon them, requiring the use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of them in the Work of the Ministry at their utmost peril;
Men on the other side, forbid them that use and exercise, and
that with such forcible Prohibitions as threaten to bear down
the whole publick exercise of the Ministry before the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. But
the Lord knows how to deliver those that are his out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.
It will be no relief against the force of this Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that there are some things left wherein Ministers may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their gifts and trade with their Talents; for as this is but
pretended, so it is not in this or that part of their Work, but
in the whole of the Ministry committed unto them, that Christ
indispensably requires of the guides of his Church, that they
should trade with their Talents and exercise their Gifts; and
accordingly are they to provide for their account at the last day:
By this one engine then at the same time are the people depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the means of Edification provided for them in the Care,
Wisdome, and Love of the Lord Christ, and Ministers brought
into a necessity of sinning, or fore-going the publick exercise of
their Ministry.</p>
            <p>Again in Particular; It is the work and duty of the Ministers
of the Gospel, to make Application of the Grace of Christ
whereof they are Stewards to the Flocks committed to their
Charge, and that according to the especial state and condition
of all especial wants which may any way be known unto them.
The way of their Application of this Grace, lyes principally in
the Administration of Gospel Ordinances. Therein are they to
declare, unfold, tender, and apply the Grace of Christ according
unto the wants of his Disciples, the good of whose souls they
watch for in particular. These wants are very far from being
the same, and in the same degree in and unto every Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or unto any one Congregation at all times, or unto all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in any Congregation, which is easily discerned by a faithful
and skilful Guide. The especial Application then mentioned
according to the Rule of the Gospel, and special Addresses unto
God in the Name of the Flock, with respect to the especial
wants of all or any of them, belongs to that edification, which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97323:33"/>
Christ hath appointed for his Church. Now how this duty can
be attended unto in the observance of a prescribed Form of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
from whence it is not lawful to digress, is beyond my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to apprehend. I confess men who scoffe at Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and deride spiritual Gifts, who thinks all Religion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the Observation of some carnal Institution, who neither
know nor care to come to an acquaintance with the spiritual
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> poor souls, nor do tremble at the threatnings of
Christ pointed against their negligence and ignorance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.
4. that suppose the whole Baptized World converted to God,
and Preaching its self on that account less necessary then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
at the first Plantation of the Gospel; that esteem the
doubts and temptations of Believers as needless scruples, and
their sedulous endeavours to grow in Grace and the knowledge
of our Lord Jesus Christ labour lost in hypocrisie; that perhaps
do envy at, and are troubled with the light and knowledge of
the People of God, and suppose they can discharge the Duty of
the Ministry by a bare reading of the Service Book to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
by themselves, or some Hired by them so to do, without
once enquiring into the spiritual Condition of them, the care of
whose souls they plead to be committed to them, may think
light of this Consideration; but those who know the terrour
of the Lord, and any thing of their own Duty, will be otherwise
minded. Yet farther; There seems to be in the Imposition of
a Liturgy to be used always as a Form in all Gospel Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
an unwarrantable abridgement of their Liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ hath made us free; and therefore sin in the Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Use of it. For as it is a sin in others to abridge us of the
Liberty purchased for us by Jesus Christ, so it is in us, to give it
up, and not to suffer in our Testimony for it. Now of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
purchased for us by Jesus Christ, so far as it relates to the
Worship of God there are two Parts; <hi>First,</hi> a freedome from
those Paedagogical Institutions of God himself, which by his
own appointment were to continue onely to the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> A freedome from subjection to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of men as to any new Impositions in or about the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. And the same Rule is given out as to
our duty and deportment in reference unto both these, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5:
1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. Now not to stand fast in the Liberty for us pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97323:34"/>
by Christ, is not to have that esteem of it as a Priviledge
given us by his Love as we ought to have, not that sense of it as
a duty enjoyned us by him which ought to be in us. I say there
is the same reason of both these in respect of Liberty. As we are
freed from <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institutions, so that none can Impose the
Observation of them upon us, by vertue of their first Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so are we also from any succeeding Impositions of men.
Our Liberty equally respects the one and the other. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
those Institutions, such was the tenderness of the Holy Ghost
and the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ by his directions and
guidance, that they would not, (no not for a season) enjoyn
the observance of any of them, no not of those which put men
on no positive Duties; but were meer abridgements in point of
some practises, upon the Disciples of Christ, but onely such
whose observation for that season was made necessary by reason
of scandals and offences, before any such Imposition of theirs,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. nor by a purity of reason if regard be had to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
can there any abridgement be lawfully made of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Christs Disciples by any Imposition of things of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort, unless it be as to the Observation of some such things as
are made necessary in case of scandal antecedent unto any such
Imposition. We grant then that there may be, yea, there ought
<hi>de facto</hi> to be an abridgement made of our Liberty, as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of some things at some times, which in general we are
made free unto, where that performance in the use and exercise
of our Liberty, would prove an hindrance unto Edification, the
great End whereunto all these things are subservient. But then
the case must be so stated antecedent to any Imposition. First to
Impose that which is not necessary, and then to assert a Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of its Observation least Scandal should ensue, is a Course that
men are not directed unto by any Gospel Rule or Apostolical
practise. The sum is, that abridgement of the Liberty of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
of Christ by Impositions on them of things which he
hath not appointed, nor made necessary by Circumstances ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
unto such Impositions, are plain Usurpations upon the
Consciences of the Disciples of Christ, destructive of the Liberty
which he hath purchased for them, and which if it be their duty
to walk according to Gospel Rule, is sinful to submit unto.
That of this nature is the Imposition of a Liturgy contended
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97323:34"/>
about, is evident. It hath no Institution or Appointment by
Jesus Christ, it is wholly of Men, there is nothing antecedent
unto its Imposition that should make it Necessary to be Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
a Necessity of its Observation is induced upon and by its
Imposition, which is directly destructive to our Liberty in Jesus
Christ. The Necessity pretended from the insufficiency of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
for the discharge of that which is their proper Work, hath
