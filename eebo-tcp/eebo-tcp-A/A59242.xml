            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECT. I. The Occasion of making these Reflexions: And the summe of that which follows.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Divine Providence having been so watchful over His <hi>Most Sacred Majesty</hi> in his wonderful preservation from dangers, and so miraculous in restoring him to his Throne, just and necessary it is that both Himself and his Counsel should make use of all lawful means to preserve him in safety, and his Subjects in Obedience and Peace. And because a greater obligation cannot be imagined among Christians then <hi>a Solemn Oath,</hi> it became them to make use of that Obligation indifferently to all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from</hi> Breda, April. 4.14. 1660.</note> the which in all probability would now at last have a greater effect by vertue of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <hi>Declaration of a Liberty to tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and that no Man shall be disquieted,
<pb facs="tcp:100532:3"/>
or call'd in question for differences of Opinion in matter of Religion, which do not disturbe the Peace of the Kingdom</hi>: by which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the chief cause which began and fomented the late Troubles and confusion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Notwithstanding seeing that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the application of that Preservatory and remedy of an Oath, hath lately occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned great Disputes, and unquietness of minds, in several persons; and seeing the Oath by none more readily taken and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly imposed on others, then by those who began the War, and promoted the Covenant, and of whose party not one was ever found that drew a sword for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; and on the other side by none more scrupled at or refused, then by those who alwayes assisted the King, and of whose party never any one drew a Sword against him, and withall of whose Loyalty his Majesty hath oft professed that he hath sufficient assurance: The consideration of all this begat in my mind an Opinion, that surely there lay hidden in these <hi>Oaths</hi> some <hi>Mystery</hi> fit to be discovered, and which is attempted in the following Reflexions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In which, 1. After a brief Declaration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the Nature of a solemn Oath, how high a point of Gods worship it is, and what Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and caution is to be used in it. 2. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> after the setting down the Formes of the two Oaths at this time imposed. 3. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> follow Reflexions upon the said Oaths in gross, shewing the occasion of the making of them, &amp;c. 4. After which it is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that the Oath of Supremacy as it lyes, and according to the sence of the first Lawgiver, cannot lawfully or sincerely be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100532:3"/>
taken by any Christian. 5. Then is declared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in how different a sence the two Oaths are taken by <hi>Protestants,</hi> 6. And by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
               <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> &amp;c. 7. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> what grounds <hi>Roman-Catholicks do</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally refuse to take the <hi>Oath of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> 8. And some of them make scruple to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> take that of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> 9. Lastly there are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> short Reflexions on his Majesties Gracious <hi>Declaration for tender consciences,</hi> shewing who have the justest pretentions to the benefit of it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All this is offered to the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all good Christians among us, to the end Advice may be taken whether it be for Gods honour, or the Kingdoms peace, that such Formes of Oaths so manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ambiguous, so inefficacious to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Loyalty and Peace in the generality of the Kings Subjects, so piercing and wounding to tender Consciences, &amp;c. should be continued to be imposed, or new Formes more effectuall for his Majesties se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity contrived, after the Example of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>SECT. II. Touching Oaths in General.</head>
            <p n="5">5. AN Oath, by which God is invoked as a witness, Surety and caution of whatsoever we affirm, renounce and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and a Revenger upon us if we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in any of these, is certainly an high Act of Religion: but such an one, as that like Medicines, it ought not to be used ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in cases of just necessity, and then with great advice and sincerity.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100532:4"/>6. The conditions therefore required by God himself in an Oath are expressed in this saying of the Prophet, <hi>Thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, and in Judgment, and in Justice.</hi> So that if an Oath be ambiguous, captious or false, it wants the condition of <hi>Truth.</hi> If it be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unnecessary, or indiscreet and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, it will be destitute of <hi>Judgment</hi>; and if in the Object and Forme of it, and in the mind of the Taker, there be not a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Eternal Law of God, it will want <hi>Justice</hi>: Lastly if with all these, it be not attended with fidelity in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is promised, (supposing it be a Promissory Oath) and this according to the intention of the Law-giver, it will be dishonourable, Irreligious and odious to God; and wanting any of these conditions it will respectively be destructive to those that so contrive or take it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All these conditions are doubtless with more then ordinary caution to be observed in Solemn, publick and <hi>National Oaths</hi>: the breach of which will involve whole Kingdomes in guilt and punishment, and this, even in the Opinion of Heathens, inevitably.</p>
            <p n="8">8. These things considered, if we will call to mind how many <hi>Oaths, Covenants, Abjurations,</hi> &amp;c. Ambiguous, Entangling, Trayterous, Contradicting one another, and consequently inducing a necessity of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have been sometimes voluntarily taken, or by a pretended Authority imposed on the Subjects, it will surely deeply concern us all to take some fitting course to avert Gods most just indignation from our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

against his or their Persons, their Crown or dignity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Colour of any such sentence or declaration, or otherwise; and will do my best endeavour to disclose and make known unto his Majesties Heirs and Successours all Treasons and Traiterous conspiracies which I shall know or hear of to be against him or any of them. And I do further swear that I from my heart abhorr, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and abjure as impious and hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call this damnable doctrine and positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That Princes which be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated or deprived by the Pope may be deposed or murthered by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or any other whatsoever. And I do believe, and in my conscience am resolved that neither the Pope nor any person whatsoever hath Power to absolve me of this oath, or any part thereof, which I acknowledge by good and full authority to be lawfully ministred unto me. And do renounce all Pardons and dispensations to the contrary. And all these things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear according to these expresse words by me spoken, and according to the
plain
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100532:6"/>
and common sense and understanding of the same words, without any equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation or mental evasion, or secret reservation whatsoever. And I do make this recognition and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment heartily, willingly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon the true faith of a Christian: So help me God.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>These are the formes of the two Oathes: Both which if they be understood according to the proper and natural sence of the words import, that there being only two kinds of</hi> Jurisdictions, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirituall <hi>and</hi> Temporal, <hi>both which are named here, the King within his Dominions is equally the Fountain and Root of them both: So that whosoever exercises any office or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy either in the State or the Church, does it (and must acknowledge so much) meerly by communication from the King, or a participation of so much of his power as he is pleased to impart. Upon which grounds it will follow not only that no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince, Prelate, &amp;c, No Assembly or Councel of Bishops, though never so Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical hath right to any superiority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction within these Kingdomes, but also that whatsoever any Bishop or Priest in the Kingdom &amp;c. acts in matters &amp; duties pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual, as conferring Orders Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, inflicting censures, administring Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments &amp;c. they do all this with a direct subordination to the King, &amp; as his Delegates or Substitutes: insomuch as if he pleases, he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100532:7"/>
may himself exercise all those functions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally, and may according to his pleasure suspend the execution of them in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

Neither is there at this day any Church or Assembly of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor perhaps any person (unlesse it be the</hi> Authour of Leviathan) <hi>that taking these Oathes, will or can, without contradicting his belief, mean all that the formes and clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of them do directly, properly and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically signify, as shall be Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>

            <head>SECT. IV. Reflections upon these two Oathes in grosse.</head>
            <p n="14">14.

            <p n="15">15. The Title of <hi>Supream head and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church of England,</hi> was first given to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, in a Petition addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto him by the Bishops, obnoxious to a <hi>Praemunire</hi> for having submitted to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Wolsey's</hi> Legantine power without the Kings assent. Now how far this new Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical

power of the King was intended to extend, will appear by following Acts of Parliaments, and by the Kings own proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in vertue thereof.</p>
            <p n="13">13. It was enacted by Parliament, 1. that no Canons or Constitutions could be made by the Bishops,<note place="margin">

By which means without one single voice of the Clergy, all former Ecclesiasticall Lawes might be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 4. An authority was allowed to the King to represse and correct all such errours,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100532:8"/>17. Hereby it is apparent that a Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction purely Spiritual was communicated to, or assumed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth; &amp; this he further shewed by many practises. For besides Jurisdiction, as if he had the Key of divine knowledge given him by Christ he set forth Books of instructions in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick doctrine by his own authority; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them hereticks that taught otherwise. The labour indeed, and we may say, drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of composing those books (as also of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting other spiritual functions) was left either wholly or in part to the Clergy; but when they had done, he perused them, and and made what additions and alterations he pleased in them, and without remanding them to the Bishops,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M S in Bibl. Col.</hi>
               </note> caused them to be printed. The Book with his Interlinings and Changes is still ex-tant.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Indeed it was only spiritual Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that he by his new Title of <hi>Head of the Church</hi> sought to deprive the Pope of: for he feared not his pretended temporal Power which in those dayes the world was little troubled withal. For he stood in need of a power to justify his Divorce and to dispense with the horrible Sacriledge designed by him; He was unwilling to be looked on by his Subjects as a <hi>Heathen and a Publican,</hi> and therefore to prevent this danger, he devest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pope, and assumed to himself the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Excommunication also, that is, not the execution of it, but the disposing of of it by Delegation to the Arch-bishop, who should execute it according to his will and directions only.</p>
            <p n="19">19. A further irrefragable proofe that it was a power purely Spiritual which that King challenged by his new Title; is taken
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100532:9"/>
from the Declaration of <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (the contriver of the Oath) as we find it recorded by <hi>Calvin</hi> himself; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>when</hi> Stephen Gardiner <hi>was upon the Kings affairs at</hi> Ratisbon, <hi>he there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occasion to expound the meaning of that Title of Supream head of the English Church gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to King Henry the eighth,</hi>

               <hi>taught that the King had such a power that he might appoint and prescribe new Ordinances of the Church, even matters concerning Faith and Doctrine, and abolish old: As tamely that the King might forbid the marriage of Priests, and might take away the use of the Chalice in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and in such things might appoint what he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="20">20. As for his Son King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, the same Title with the plenitude of power was given him, which he likewise, as very a child as he was, executed: for he by his Authority made Ecclesiastical Lawes to be new reformed, Church service and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Sacraments to be changed, and new Instructions in matter of Religion to be published, quite contrary to what the foregoing Head (though his Father) had decreed to be Christian Doctrine. And the reason was the same, because new Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was to be committed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour, for which he was loath to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100532:9"/>21. His elder sister succeeding, repealed and renounced this Jurisdiction, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to the Church: But her younger sister repealed her repealings, and took it again, when it was in as high language, yea higher, confer'd on her by Parliament. And there was a greater necessity for it, than her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had: For her Mothers Marriage was declared Null by the Pope, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her right to the Crown.</p>
            <p n="22">22. And that this was the design &amp; intention, of the Parliament in the first year of her Raign, when they renewed <hi>the Title of her Supremacy in Church</hi> matters, (though they blushed to call a Woman <hi>Head of the Church)</hi> may sufficiently be collected from a <hi>Speech</hi> yet extant, and made in that Parliament upon that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the then <hi>Lord Chancelour Nicholas Heath</hi>;<note place="margin">L. <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour Heaths</hi> speech, <hi>M.S.</hi>
               </note> For arguing very strongly against the said Title, and the Authority imported by it, he takes it for granted that by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Queen such a Title they must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake and fly from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi>: the inconveniencies of which he desires may be better considered. In the next place he recommends to their Advice, what this <hi>Supremacy</hi> is: For sayes he, <q>if it consist in <hi>Temporal Government,</hi> what further Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can this House give her, then she hath already by right of Inheritance, and by the appointment of God without their Gift? &amp;c. But if the <hi>Supremacy</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in <hi>Spiritual Government,</hi> then it would be considered what the spiritual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, and in what points it doth chiefly remain. I find, sayes he, in the Gospels, that when Christ gave to St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100532:10"/>
Government of the Church, he said to him, <hi>Tibi dabo claves Regni coelorum, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>I will give thee the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Now if you mean to give to the Queen that Authority which our Lord gave to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> if you will say, <hi>Nos tibi dabimus claves Regni coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, &amp;c. We will give to your Majesty the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> I pray you shew your Commission by which you are authorised to make such a Gift. Again, for the same purpose Our Lord said to St. <hi>Peter, Pasce,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pasce,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pasce,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Feed my sheep, Feed my sheep, Feed my lambs</hi>: As likewise, <hi>Tu aliquando conversus confirma fratres, When thou art converted, confirm thy Brethren.</hi> Now if you mean to say so much to the Queen, let us see your Commission, and withall consider whether her person, being <hi>a Woman,</hi> be in a capacity to receive and execute such an Authority, since St. <hi>Paul forbids a Woman to teach in the Church.</hi>
               </q> Thus argued the said <hi>Lord Chancelour,</hi> proceeding in the same manner upon other branches of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Government, and concludes, <hi>That without a mature consideration of all these premises, their honours shall never be able to shew their faces before their Enemies in this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">23. But notwithstanding all this, the Lords, &amp;c. proceeded to frame an Act without any distinct explication, whether it was a <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Spirituall Authority</hi> which they gave the Queen. Or rather they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it with such clauses, as that the most obvious sence of it imported that it was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100532:10"/>
an <hi>Authority purely spiritual,</hi> that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested her withall: and most certain it is, that if she had executed such an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, she might have justified her so doing by that Act.</p>
            <p n="24">24. However, after that Parliament was ended, but before the first year of her Raign was expired, such considerations as the Lord Chancelour had formerly in vain represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted had so great an influence upon the Queen, that she was obliged by an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition prefixed to her <hi>Injunctions,</hi> to declare that which the Parliament would not, that <hi>it was not her intent by vertue of that Act to challenge Authority and power of Ministry of Divine Offices in the Church, but only to have Soveraignty and rule over all manner of persons born within her Realmes, of what State either Ecclesiastical or Temporall, soever they be.</hi> Which explication of hers was confirmed four years after by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, yet without changing the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act, or any clauses in it.</p>
            <p n="25">25. And consequently she left ordering of matters purely Spiritual to Bishops, &amp;c. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly renouncing it; For as for the power of Excommunication, having again taken it from the Pope, she did not fear it from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her Bishops.</p>
            <p n="26">26. In the times succeeding after her, what qualifications were made and declared by three Kings touching spiritual Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shall be shewed afterward. They had not any such interests, nor such fears as the three foregoing Princes had; and therefore look'd with a more indifferent eye upon the matter: Without repealing lawes, or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Exteriour Forme of the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100532:11"/>
they esteemed it sufficient to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it by moderate interpretations, as shall be shewed.</p>
            <p n="27">27. As for the other <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> the compiler whereof was King <hi>James,</hi> the most sad and horrible occasion of it is but too well known; the intention of it is obvious, and the sence plain. So that it did not stand in need of such a Multiplicity of Acts of Parliament, with many clauses to shew the extention of it. Excepting <hi>one party,</hi> scarce any except against it; and were it not for some few incommodious expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and phrases (nothing pertaining to the substance and design of the Oath) it would freely and generally be admitted and taken, notwithstanding the foresaid parties condemning it, who take that advantage to decry the substance of the Oath, from which they have an aversion in as much as Fidelity is promised thereby.</p>

            <head>SECT. V. That the Oath of Supremacy as it lies, and according to the sence of the first Law giver, cannot lawfully and sincerely be taken by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christian.</head>
            <p n="28">28. IT is a truth from the beginning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Fathers of the Church, that all Kings are truly Supream Governours over the persons of all their Subjects, and in all causes even <hi>Ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="29">29. This is a right due to all Kings, though Heathens, Hereticks, &amp;c So that Kings by being converted to Christianity or Catholick Religion, have not any new Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction added, or their former enlarged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. They do not thereby become Pastours of Souls, but sheep of lawfull pastours: And it is not a new Authority, but a new duty that by their conversion accrews to them, obliging them to promote true Religion by the exercise of their Civil Authority and Sword: And subjects are bound to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and submit to this Authority of theirs, that is, not alwayes to do what Princes in Ecclesiasticall matters shall command, but however not to resist, in case their inward Beliefs be contrary to theirs, but patiently to suffer whatsoever violence shall be offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="30">30. Such a submission therefore to Kingly authority may, when just occasion is, be lawfully required by Kings from all their Subjects, yea a profession thereof by oaths. But such an one was not the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy when it was first contrived and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For there an authority in many causes purely spirituall, was by our Princes chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, as hath been shewed. Therefore if we consider that Oath as now imposed on Subjects infinitely differing from their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beliefe and Judgment, both in Point of doctrine and discipline, it is not imaginable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100532:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how it can be taken in such a sense as was first meant, by any congregations, no not even by that which is of the Kings own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="31">31. The Oath consists of two parts; one Affirmative, and the other Negative: The Affirmative clause obliges all the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects though never so much differing in their beliefs, to swear an acknowledgment that <hi>the King is the only supreme Head and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Realme, as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or causes as Temporal.</hi> And the Negative to deny that <hi>any forraign Prince, Prelate, &amp;c. hath or ought to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al within this Realme, and to renounce all such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="32">32. These two Recognitions, if the words be interpreted in their proper Grammatical sence (as all Oathes in reason ought to be, unlesse they be otherwise interpreted by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) and according to the intention of the first lawgiver declared by his practice, imply (excepting even a personal confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Orders, and administring sacraments) that all Jurisdiction purely Spiritual is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the Kings right. Now what Christian at this day alive will make these two Recognitions in the sence afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said? Yea what English Protestant will be willing to make even the Negative Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For if there be no Forraign power at all Superiour to the King in things or causes purely spiritual, then neither is the Pope a Patriarch of the West (which yet King <hi>James</hi> will not deny) neither can a lawful and free General Council oblige English Protestants,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100532:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which yet they so often protest to submit to. And as for the Affirmative clause, it is well known they do not admit it, at least in K.<hi>H.</hi> the eighth his sense; we may add, nor in Q. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths,</hi> as their 37 Article will testify, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rigorous sence of the words of the oath.</p>
            <p n="33">33. How much lesse then can any English Subjects divided both in belief and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Discipline from the Head and Body of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> submit to the same Oath? For can the King be acknowledged in all causes spiritual to be a Head of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of which he renounces, and is renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the being so much as a member? Shall he contrive, or order the contriving of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of belief respectively sutable to each Congregation, and bind his Subjects seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to subscribe thereto, when himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them to be false? Will he require some to be obedient to Bishops as instituted by Christ, and others to renounce them as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian? Some to use no other Forme of Service but the Common-prayer-book; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not that but the Directory; and others neither of them, but their owne crude ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and Non-sense? Will he command some to submit to the Pope as supreame pastour, others <hi>Calvin,</hi> others <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> or <hi>Socinus,</hi> or a <hi>John of Leyden,</hi> or a <hi>Knip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dolling</hi>?</p>
            <p n="34">34. It is evident that by vertue of this oath unchanged in any words, this Kingdom has at least thrice changed its Religion, and the whole frame of the Church. For in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths dayes, excepting onely in one point, it was intirely Catholick. In King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. his daies it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100532:13"/>
               <hi>Lutheran</hi>: and in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> very much <hi>Calvinistical.</hi> And which is strange, excepting Catholicks, those that did not change their belief, yet were content to take the same Oath. Which could not be done without framing to themselves diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sences and mental evasions, so as though all took the same Oath, yet each severally took a different Oath, with a meaning in all of them contrary to the intention of the Oath-makers.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Matters standing thus, what a burden of guilt most we suppose to lye upon these Kingdomes by occasion of an Oath so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly imposed on the whole Nation, which if we regard the force of the words, no man can take sincerely? And this guilt is the more aggravated in this respect that there cannot possibly be any real necessity for the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it. For since by an <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>Obedience, his Maiesty</hi> may be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his Subjects Loyalty, what necessity or use can there be of such ambiguous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of such a Supremacy which the King himself will not acknowledge, and the affirming or denying of which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes nothing to his safety? He has experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced great disloyalty from a world of those that have most freely taken it, and none at all from those Catholicks that have refused it. It is manifest that it was first contrived meerly on purpose that King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth might make a most filthy and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable use of it. But now at last his Majesty having been pleased to <hi>declare a liberty to tender consciences,</hi> a world of men there are in these Kingdomes that are or ought to be weary of colluding with men, and dis-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring

God in swearing according to a a Forme which they cannot but judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, though it were for no other reason but because it is ambiguous. And these are not <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> for they refuse the Oath: but many of distinct Sects from both Catholick and Protestant belief. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Christian conscience which is not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a matter in which the honour of God and the salvation or damnation of souls is so much concerned as in a solemn <hi>National Oath,</hi> or that would voluntarily make advantage for temporal ends of gain to themselves, or malice to others, by such an oath to ensnare the consciences of another, only pretends to be a Christian, but in his heart saies, <hi>There is</hi> no Christ, and <hi>no God.</hi>

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (saith he) <hi>disputing of Jurisdiction saith, There is a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Power in the Bishop of Rome; first of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: secondly of internal jurisdiction; thirdly of external jurisdiction: The first is referd to the sacraments; the second to inward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is in the court of Conscience: the third to that external Government which is practised in external Courts: And confesseth that of the first and second there is no question between us, but only of the third. Then of this</hi> (saith Carleton) <hi>we are agreed that the question between us and them is only of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction coactive in external courts, binding and compelling by force of Law and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Mulcts and punishments, beside excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. As for spiritual Jurisdiction of the Church standing in examination of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Faith, judging of Heresies, deposing of Hereticks, excommunication of notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours, Ordination of Priests and Deacons, Institution and Collation of Benefices and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Cures, &amp;c. this we reserve entire to the Church, which Princes cannot give or take from the Church. This power hath been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the Church without co-active jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, other then of Excommunication. But when matters handled in the Ecclesiastical Consistory are not matters of Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of a Civil nature, which yet are called Ecclesiastical, as being given by Princes, and appointed to be within the cognisance of that Consistory; and when the censures are not spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, but carnal, compulsive, coactive, here appeareth the power or the Civil Magistrate. This power we yield to the Magistrate; and here is the question, whether the Magistrate hath right to this power or Jurisdiction, &amp;c.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100532:16"/>
This then is the thing that we are to prove, That Ecclesiastical coactive power by force of Law and corporal punishments, by which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people are to be governed in externall and contentious Courts, is a power which of right belongeth to Christian Princes.</hi> Again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he sayes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. ibid. pag.</hi> 42.</note> 
               <hi>Concerning the extention of the Churches Jurisdiction, it cannot be denyed but that there is a power in the Church, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly internal, but also of external Jurisdiction. Of internal power there is no question made. External Jurisdiction being understood all that is practised in external Courts, or Consistories, is either definitive or Mulctative. Authority Definitive in matters of Faith and Religion belongeth to the Church. Mulctative power may be understood either as it is with Coaction, or as it is referred to spirituall censures. As it standeth in spirituall censures, it is the right of the Church, and was practised by the Church when the Church was without a Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and since. But coactive Jurisdiction was never practised by the Church when the Church was without Christian Magistrates: but was alwayes understood to belong to the civill Magistrate, whether he were Christian or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> After this manner doth <hi>Doctour Carleton Bishop of Chichester</hi> understand the <hi>Supremacy of the King</hi> acknowledged in the Oath.</p>
            <p n="41">41. In the last place <hi>Doctour Bramhall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Derry</hi> in our late Kings dayes, and now <hi>Archbishop of Armagh,</hi> thus declares both the <hi>Affirmative</hi> and <hi>Negative</hi> parts of the Oath touching the Kings supream autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in matters Ecclesiastical, and renouncing the Popes Jurisdiction in the same, here in <hi>England,</hi> in his book called <hi>Schisme guarded,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Schisme guarded.</note> &amp;c. The summe of which Book is in the Title-page expressed to consist in shewing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100532:16"/>
               <hi>that the great Controversie about Papal power is not a question of Faith, but of interest and profit; not with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but with the Court of Rome, &amp;c.</hi> This learned and judicious writer thus at once states the point in both these respects. <hi>My last ground,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>is, That neither King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, nor any of his Legislators did ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deprive the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>of the power of the keyes, or any part thereof; Either the key of order, or the key of Jurisdiction. I mean Jurisdiction purely spirituall, which hath place only in the inner Court of Conscience, and over such persons as submit willingly. Nor did ever challenge or endeavour to assume to themselves either the key of order, or the key of Jurisdiction purely spiritual. All which they deprived the Pope of, all which they assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to themselves, was the external Regiment of the Church by coactive power, to be exercised by persons capable of the respective Branches of it. This power the Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>never had, or could have justly over their Subjects, but under them whose Subjects they were. And therefore when we meet with these words or the like, (That no forraign prelate shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise any manner of power, Jurisdiction, &amp;c. Ecclesiastical within this Realm) it is not to be understood of internal or purely spiritual power in the Court of Conscience, or the power of the keyes, (VVe see the contrary practised every day:) but of external and Coactive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Ecclesiasticall causes in</hi> Foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentioso. <hi>And that it is, and might to be so understood, I prove clearly by it Proviso in one main Act of Parliament, and an Article of the English Church.</hi> [Which act &amp; article shall be produced afterward.] The Bishop continues
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100532:17"/>
               <hi>They (that is, the Parliament,) profess their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is meerly Political: What hath a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Ordinance with power purely spiritual? They seek only to preserve the Kingdom from rapine, &amp;c.</hi> And then having produced the Article, he concludes, <hi>You see the power is political, the sword is political, all is Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Our Kings leave the power of the keyes and Jurisdiction purely spiritual to those to whom Christ hath left it.</hi> Nothing can be more express then this so clear a testimony of so judicious a <hi>Bishop</hi> touching the <hi>Kings supremacy</hi> in matters Ecclesiasticall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Oath. Only we must be excused if we assent not to what he affirms, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>King Henry</hi> the Eighth his not assuming spiritual Jurisdiction.</p>

               <hi>Wheresoever our Lawes do deny all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Jurisdiction to the Pope in</hi> England, <hi>it is in that sence that we call the exteriour Court of the Church, the spirituall Court. They do not intend at all to deprive him of the power of the keyes, or of any spiritual power that was bequeathed him by Christ or by his Apostles, when he is able to prove his Legacy.</hi> To conclude,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. ib. p.</hi> 119.</note> omitting a world of other passages to the same effect, he saith, <hi>We have not renounced the substance of the Papacy, except the substance of the Papacy do consist in coactive power.</hi>

Moreover to warrant these explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of three so eminent men of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church, who write expresly upon the Subject, may be added, testimonies yet more authentick and irrefragable, of our Princes themselves, who are to be esteemed unquestionably authoritative interpreters of

And it is evident that if her meaning had been that <hi>the Oath</hi> should be taken according to that enormous latitude of power allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exercised by them, such a way of indefinite explication would have been far more burdensome and entangling to consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then before: For that would signifie, that all that swear should be obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

themselves in all the <hi>clauses of acts of Parliament</hi> made by those two <hi>Kings,</hi> and in all the actions performed by them, or else they will swear they know not what.

            <p n="51">51. IT is a wonderfull <hi>Mystery</hi> how it should come to pass that our <hi>English Prebyterians,</hi> &amp;c. should (especially now of late) with so much willingness and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness themselves swallow these Oaths, and so clamorously, not without threatning, urge the imposing them upon others.

            <p n="52">52. First for ther <hi>Doctrinal principles,</hi> I do not find that any of those Sects of late in <hi>England</hi> in peaceable times have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declared in what sence they allowed his Majesty to have a supreme Jurisdicton in causes Ecclesiastical or Spiritaul, <hi>as to themselves:</hi> But as to the oppression and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of poor <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> they have alwayes shew'd too great a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to exalt the Kings Authority, and to draw out and sharpen his sword, far more then himself was willing. I do not find that any of them have busied themselves, as a world of <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> have, with making discourses upon the <hi>Oathes.</hi> Their silence in this point wherein they are doubtless much concern'd one way or other, is surely very argumentative.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Who ever knew or heard to flow
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100532:22"/>
from the tongue, or drop from the pen of a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> so Christian a positon as is sincerely avouched both by <hi>English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and the generall body of Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> viz. <hi>That even in case a Christian or Heathen Prince should make use of his civil power to persecute truth, that power ought not upon any pretences to be actively resisted by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or force of armes: but though they cannot approve, they must at least patiently suffer the effects of his misused Authority, leaving the judgment to God only.</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, at least how unreceived such a Doctrine has hitherto been among their <hi>Brethren</hi> abroad, will but too manifestly appear in a volume entitled, <hi>Dangerous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> collected <hi>by Archbishop Bancroft</hi> out of severall books written by Calvinisticall preachers. What judgment <hi>their patriarch Calvin</hi> made of <hi>King Henry the eighths</hi> new <hi>Title of the Head of the Church,</hi> we have seen before,<note place="margin">

            <p n="54">54. And as for their <hi>practices</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> it were to be wished they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100532:22"/>
could be forgotten, especially all that has hapned the last twenty years: And it may suffiice only in gross to take notice, that the most efficacious <hi>Engin</hi> for begining the late war and engaging their party in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of it was a <hi>publick declaration,</hi> that their design was to root out Popish Doctrines, favoured by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> to abolish publick <hi>Formes of Church-service,</hi> and to destroy <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Church Government, root and branch,</hi> which had been established in <hi>England</hi> by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal authority of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="55">55. These things considered, is it not a great <hi>Mystery</hi> that such persons of such perswasions should be so zealous to take and impose generally either of these Oaths? To think that they do knowingly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and formally forswear themselves, and force others to do so, would be uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable. Therefore an <hi>Evasion</hi> they have to secure themselves in their own opinions from perjury. How little they deferr to Kings in their own Ecclesiastical matters and Government, yea how they declare that none must be excepted from their consistories and Synodical Jurisdictions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven externally coercive, is evident both in <hi>Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>land</hi> and elsewhere. And it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that in the <hi>form of an Oath</hi> lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the word <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> is studiously left out. How comes it then to pass that they can in <hi>England</hi> swear that <hi>the King is supreme Head and Governour in all causes Ecclesiastical or spirituall</hi>? Who can reconcile these things together in such a sence?</p>
            <p n="56">56. Surely it will be extremely difficult,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100532:23"/>
if not impossible to imagine any colourable Evasion or pretext for cousening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, except it be this, That both the Oaths were made only against <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> acknowledging the Pope to be supreme pastour of Gods Church, so that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can swear that he is no <hi>Papist,</hi> may freely and without scruple take those Oaths, as being nothing at all concerned in them: Whatever he does, he cannot be a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by vertue of the Oath, because he was not a powder-traytor.</p>
            <p n="57">57. If the secret of the affair do indeed lye on such an interpretation as this, then it will follow that none of the Kings Subjects are, or can by any oath as yet in force be obliged not to be traytors, but only such <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> as take the <hi>Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</hi> A hard case for his <hi>Majesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="58">58. This Evasion may perhaps serve for the <hi>Negative</hi> clause of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> wherein profession is made, That <hi>the Pope has no Jurisdiction in this Kingdom:</hi> But how will they defend themselves from the most principal <hi>Affirmative</hi> clause, <hi>That the King alone is supreme Governour in all causes Ecclesiastical</hi>? Till they express themselves in this point, no other expedient, <hi>I</hi> Suppose, can be found, but by denying that there are two distinct clauses in the oath, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently by saying that the whole Oath is but one simple assertion, viz. <hi>That the King is so far to be esteemed the supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as that the Pope is not above him: But yet a consistory of Presbyters though his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yea any single Minister in causes toùch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion and Church Government may be his superiour.</hi> Now if this guess hit right, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100532:23"/>
the like grounds the Oath of Allegiance will be interpreted too, as if they that take it should say thus, <hi>We promise Fidelity to his Majesty so sincerely, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Excommunication or sentence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation issuing from the Pope against him, we will not seek to depose or murther him. But if our teachers, or we our selves do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the word of God against any of his actions, or if we find in scripture that he loves not the pure reformed Religion, and shewes his dislike by any publick action, then he must look to himself: For these Oaths do not extend to such cases, no not so much as to hinder us from defending our purses with our swords against any illegall exactions. We are sure we are not Papists; that we readily swear, and that is enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="59">59. Notwithstanding if they look well upon <hi>the Oath,</hi> they will find the word <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> too stubborn to comply with this sence, where they profess the <hi>King to be the only supreme Governour</hi>: Unless they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the meaning to be, That he is <hi>only</hi> a Supreme Governour in regard of the Pope with whom he will have nothing to do, and who therefore is neither under him, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, and in regard of no body of the world besides, not the most pittifull Tub-Man. This indeed would be an evasion, the invention whereof is beyond the art of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation.</p>
            <p n="60">60. It is not here pretended, that by this evasion and no other, <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have the art to sweeten Oaths, which in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sence and understanding of all the rest of the Kingdom are point blank opposed, at least to their Brethrens Doctrines and their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100532:24"/>
own practises: So that the <hi>Author of these Reflexions</hi> must leave a more perfect disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their mysterious wayes to the eyes of the State infinitely more clear-sighted and penetrating.</p>
            <p n="61">61. As for the <hi>Independents,</hi> all that to me is known of them since they lately shew'd their faces to the destruction both of Church and State, is their <hi>new name</hi>: What they think of the Oaths, does not to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But the very name implying a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of all order and subordination in Church-Government even among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and their known practice having been an Usurpation of supreme authority to themselves, purchased with the most <hi>execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murther</hi> of their undoubted and too too mercifull Soveraign: if they can be so hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical as to take either of these Oaths, they will deceive no body: For it will be evident to all men, that not changing their tenents and courses, they must needs be perjured; so that to some it may be a doubt whether it be a lawfull or however an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient mean for the Kings safety to offer them the Oathes, or to relye upon their taking them.</p>
            <p n="62">62. All that for the present will be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the words or practises of these <hi>two Sects, is,</hi> That at least they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge so far a concurrence with the <hi>sence of Protestants</hi> touching these <hi>Oathes,</hi> that they do assure themselves that by them there is no <hi>Jurisdiction purely Ecclesiastical,</hi> attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or due to his <hi>Majesty:</hi> How far, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all they will permit his civil power to act in matters Ecclesiastical, till they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their minds, (if they be not too much
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100532:24"/>
discovered already) who can tell?</p>
            <p n="63">63. Besides these, other <hi>Scots</hi> there are in abundance, which the common voice tyes together as <hi>Samson</hi> did his Foxes, tail to tail, their faces all looking several wayes: however they are called usually <hi>Fanaticks.</hi> Of these some professe Obedience, others profess against it, but not any of them will swear either the one, or the other.

               <note place="margin">Q</note> considering that the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom besides, does unanimously agree at least in this point, That the Supremacy ascribed therein to his Majesty does not at all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the spirituall Jurisdiction of Pastours, with which the King does not meddle, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed does it concern him; for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the King whether one of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be for his faults excommunicated, or admitted to the communion; Whether he be an Ecclesiastical person, or a Lay-Man; as likewise whether his Excommunication or Ordination proceed from one beyond Seas, or at home; and the like is to be said of his Orders. Now since Catholick Faith teaches
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100532:25"/>
that secular power which <hi>belongs to Caesar, should be given to Caesar</hi>: and meer spiritual Authority over consciences, and upon spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall penalties only, should be given to the supreme and subordinate Pastours, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants wonder why Catholicks so perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded should refuse to swear that which they profess: Especially since by such a refusal they deprive themselves of a comfortable exercise of their Religion, and withall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves to many and grievous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties. They profess Loyalty to the King, and dare not swear it. And they hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade themselves, that if they did swear it, he would believe them, which is a grace that he will not afford to all: but by not swearing it when they are required by lawfull authority, they put themselves in an incapacity to make their Loyalty usefull to his Majesty, &amp; give perhaps scandal to many out of the Church, as if indeed there were some unknown principle of disloyalty in their Religion, which forbids them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by Oath that which they without oath willingly and almost unanimously profess. This is a mystery that Protestants wonder at.</p>
            <p n="65">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>R.</hi>
               </note>65. If Catholicks answer, that they are ready to swear that which Protestants so confidently affirm to be the sence of the Oath, but the Oath it self according to the present form they dare not take, because they find such a sence very unsuitable to the expressions in the Oath:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> The others will reply, That Catholicks take too much upon themselves, to give a sence to an Oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is declared by publick and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority: That Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100532:25"/>
would make a scruple perhaps at it, were it not that the sence in which they declare their taking of it so seems to them warranted by supreme authority, as no man can imagine, almost a more Authentick testimony: For that by the Oath our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would have no other then civil Regal authority in Ecclesiastical matters attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; and that as they themselves pretend not to a Jurisdiction purely spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, so neither do they envy or deny it to any of those whom our Lord has consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Pastours of souls in his Church: All this is attested by all particular Writers, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contradicente,</hi> by the voluntary asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Princes, the undoubted authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative interpreters of their own Lawes, who publickly approved such Writers, and also shew'd this by their Actions, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Omissions to exercise spiritual power. Further the same is attested by a publick Article or confession of Faith of the whole body of the English Clergy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and made an Ecclesiastical Law by Regal and Parliamentary authority: And Lastly by Acts of Parliament remaining in full force, so that in the opinion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants it is almost impossible to find stronger assurances of any truth, then are the proofs that this is acknowledged to be the true sence of the Oath. Thus say Protestants.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Notwithstanding in the judgment of Catholicks, the Negative clause in the oath,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> [viz. <hi>No forraign Prince, Prelate, &amp;c. hath or ought to have any Jurisdiction, power or authority Ecclesiastical or spiritual within this Realm</hi>] seems incapable of that sence, and directly contrary to a point of their Faith,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100532:26"/>
viz. that <hi>the Pope is supreme pastour of the whole Church in matters purely Ecclesiastical or spiritual.</hi> That clause has so horrible an aspect, it implies a renouncing even the Popes pastoral Authority, and this with so much Emphasis, that least the word [EC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLESIASTICAL] might possibly import a Civil authority in Ecclesiastical Courts, there is added also [SPIRITUAL:] that therefore a Catholicks tongue cannot repeat it, much less swear to an acknowledgment of it.</p>
            <p n="67">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note>67. But this excuse does not satisfie such Protestants as out of compassion to the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-sufferings of Roman Catholicks, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous that their Fidelity may be usefull to their Soveraign and Country.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that though the said clause might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deserve to be ill looked on by strangers, yet not so by Englishmen: Since the word [SPIRITUAL] has not the same Notion elsewhere, that it has in <hi>England.</hi> The Oath is to be administred not only to schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, but to all Lay-persons in Office, to Soldiers in ships, &amp;c. Now in <hi>England</hi> the word [ECCLESIASTICAL] is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understood by ignorant persons, and therefore for explanation of it there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded [OR SPIRITUAL,] which term when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is applyed to Jurisdiction, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in <hi>England</hi> no more then such Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is exercised <hi>In foro contentioso,</hi> and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Courts, which we call the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Courts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Schisme guarded.</note> and <hi>Spiritual Judges,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Authority,</hi> as my Lord of <hi>Derry</hi> well observes: for as for that purely spiritual Jurisdiction that a Bishop exercises in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or a Confessarius over his penitent in the internal Court of conscience, English
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100532:26"/>
Men ordinarily know little or nothing of it. And therefore if that clause were to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into Italian, French or Latin, the word [SPIRITUAL] ought not to be turn'd <hi>Spiritualem,</hi> but some other term must be invented, which should import this sence, and no more.</p>
            <p n="68">68. Again, though the clause sayes <hi>that the Pope has not any authority,</hi> no not so much as <hi>Ecclesiastical or Spiritual:</hi> it hath as they think, already been shewed that that phrase implies only that he hath not any such Regal or Civil authority by his own right and Divine Law, as the King challenges in matters Ecclesiastical, as the approved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by the words [SO AS] in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Admonition demonstrates. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it unusual among Writers, when they speak of a present matter, and would deny any thing concerning it, to deny it in inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite terms. So when our Saviour sayes to the Scribes, <hi>If ye were blind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joan. c.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>ye should have no sin</hi>; or, <hi>ye should not have any sin,</hi> his meaning is not, That if they had not had sufficient light whereby they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to be the Messias, they would not have been proud, malicious, adulterers, &amp;c. but only this, That the sin of <hi>infidelity</hi> should not have been imputed to them, which before he had charged them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Therefore although that clause look so hideously in the eyes of Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that if it stood alone, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered absolutely and simply by it self, they could not without renouncing a point of acknowledged Catholick Faith subscribe to it: Notwithstanding if it be considered with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100532:27"/>
dependence on the foregoing words of the Oath, it speaks a quite other language then otherwise it would in their opinion.</p>
            <p n="70">70. To give some examples of the like case. If it were proposed to an Orthodox Christian whether he would subscribe to these Assertions, <hi>The Father is greater then the Son,</hi> and, <hi>There is no evill, but God is the Author of it</hi>; He would doubtless refuse to subscribe to the former, as being Heretical, and to the later, as being moreover blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous. Notwithstanding having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that our Saviour speaking of himself as a man, said, <hi>My Father is greater then I am,</hi> and that the meaning is, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater then the Son, if the Son be considered according to his humane nature: And again that God has by his prophet speaking of Afflictions, said expresly, <hi>Is there any evill in a City, of which I am not the Author</hi>? and that the word [EVILL] in that speech doth not signifie sin, which it does, when it is mentioned absolutely and simply; but only punishment; then a good Catholick will make no difficulty in subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to both those sayings. Now the very same, say they, may be said touching this clause as it lies in the Oath, especially having been sufficiently declared that it is only a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill temporal Jurisdiction in Ecclesiastical Courts, &amp;c. which is denyed to belong to any other by right, except only the King.</p>
            <p n="71">71. But in all events, they conceive that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Roman Catholicks those might soonest be perswaded to admit a favourable interpretation of this oath, who maintain the doctrine of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> which is not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100532:27"/>
expresly excluded by this Oath, as it is by that of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> Though how can <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> be excluded, when according to them one <hi>Equivocation</hi> may be renounced by <hi>another</hi>? A most horrid example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>England</hi> has lately seen in the R. <hi>Padre Antonio Vais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="72">72. Neither do Protestants think that a Declaration formerly made by the Pope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> and forbidding Catholicks to take those Oaths with any Interpretation whatsoever, needs to be a hindrance to the taking of it in the forementioned sence so publickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched, but onely in any secret meanings invented, or mentally reserved by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons. For surely the Pope intends not to take a power from Law-givers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret their own lawes, nor to forbid their Subjects to admit their interpretations, if they be agreable to truth, and that the words be capable of being so interpreted, as these are pretended to be. Certain it is that the Pope was never informed of this so legal an interpretation: For if he had, he would never have forbidden that to distressed <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Catholicks,</hi> which to his knowledg all good Subjects in <hi>France, Germany, Venice,</hi> &amp;c. neither will nor dare refuse to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and profess. Besides, (say they) is <hi>England</hi> now become the only Kingdom in Christendom where all manner of Briefs must be immediately submitted to without a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Legal acceptation, and without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Motives, or suggestions by which they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re procured? It is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise now in the most Catholick Countries, and was formerly even in <hi>England,</hi> when it was most Catholick: the Lawes then made
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100532:28"/>
against receiving or executing Bulls from <hi>Rome</hi> without a publick admission under the penalty of incurring a Praemunire, are still in force.</p>
            <p n="73">73. If Catholicks rejoyning, say that there is another regard for which they are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling even to receive information touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny qualifications of these Oaths,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ob.</hi>
               </note> viz. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mere admitting a probability that they may lawfully and without prejudice to Catholick Faith be taken, would argue that so many vertuous, wise and holy Men as have suffered death, &amp;c. for refusing them, have suffred without any necessary cause: Such were <hi>Bishop Fisher,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> &amp;c. in King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>eights</hi> dayes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Priests since.</p>
            <p n="74">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note>74. Notwithstanding, say Protestants, such a consequence is not necessary: For first, it hath been shewed that <hi>King Henry the eighth</hi> intended to exclude the purely <hi>spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> of the Pope, his power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining matters of Faith according to former Lawes of the Church, &amp;c. And therefore no wonder that good Catholicks then would not betray their consciences. But it is well known that <hi>Sir Thomas More</hi> advised the King to limit some excesses of the Popes Jurisdiction.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>K. James</hi> defence of the Oath.</note> And an eminent writer, tells us that <hi>Bishop Fisher</hi> offered to take the Oath, if it might have been permitted him to explicate his sence of it, which could be no other then this, that he should deny the Popes temporal Jurisdiction. Secondly as for those that suffred in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, it is certain that all good Catholicks would never have esteemed it a Martyrdom to dye for refusing to the King a supreme Kingly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100532:28"/>
Power, and attributing that to the pope. They had therefore a quite different notion of what the state of <hi>England</hi> required by this Oath. But of late good occasion has been given for a more exact examination of it. For to make a sincere and ingenuous confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it was a Committee of the late rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parliament, that probably first of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what use they made of the foresaid <hi>proviso</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> 5. Eliz. to warrant them to take this Oath without submitting their Religion to the King. And the same use they judged that all other Sects might make of the same, and justify their so doing by <hi>law,</hi> even Roman Catholicks themselves.</p>
            <p n="75">75. All these things considered, it is no wonder that English protestants not being fully informed of the state of Catholicks, should wonder at Roman Catholicks for their so Universal agreement in refusing an Oath so interpreted, without the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their faith, but with so unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a prejudice both to their estates and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Religion.</p>
            <p n="76">76. <hi>The Authour of these Reflexions</hi> does freely acknowledge that he has been inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with more then ordinary diligence into the grounds upon which Protestants do make no scruple at all to take an oath, which if it had no Expounders to qualifie the sence properly imported by the words, he knows they could not take it with a good conscience Nay moreover he has given all the advantage that he could to the proofes produced by them to justify that no other sence ought to be given therto, by any English Subject: in so much as he may apprehend that he shall incurr a danger to be esteemed by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100532:29"/>
to have a design to encourage them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to take it, since that sence is such as is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry convenient to the principles of Catholick Religion.</p>
            <p n="77">77. But he protests the contrary. His <hi>end</hi> in writing all this is (besides a satisfaction given to his mind, that he cannot now without breach of Charity charge Protestants with such an unsincerity in their taking this Oath, as Presbyterians &amp;c. are apparently guilty of) to afford unto the World an illustrious proof of the most perfect sincerity, and the greatest tendernesse of conscience expressed on this occasion by the generality of English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that I believe ever was given by any Church since Christs time.</p>
            <p n="78">78. They live here in their own native Country with lesse priviledg then strangers, they are excluded from having any influence on any thing that concerns the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale of which they are freeborn Subjects; When laws are made against them as guilty persons, they are not permitted to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their cause from a few that only deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the penalties of those lawes; they are by lawes obnoxious to greater sufferings then enemies; they see their families impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished, their houses invaded by savage of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, their lives forfeited as Traytours, for entertaining those without whom they could not live otherwise then as Pagans, deprived of performing any service and worship to God, &amp;c. All these miseries they groan under without proofe of any demerit on their parts; the crimes of a few miserable seduced and seducing wretches, and their bloody Doctrine, by none in the Kingdom
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100532:29"/>
more detested then by themselves, are made their guilt. And these calamities they could avoid by taking an oath, the present new acknowleded sence whereof (as to his Majesties right) is just and lawful. And yet they dare not take it. Why? Because they fear God above all. But do not Protestants fear him too? They are no Judges of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of others. This they assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of, that if those that now take the Oath, had been to have framed it, they would have shewed a greater proof of their fear of God, then to have expressed the Kings <hi>Supremacy</hi> in termes fit for none but K. <hi>Hen. the VIII.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="79">79. But moreover great difference there is between the case of Protestants and Roman Catholicks in regard of this Oath. For Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants know that the first invention of this Oath was to explore the consciences of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and to tempt them to Schisme, by renouncing the Spiritual Authority of the head of Gods Church, which under perill of damnation they cannot do. They would not perhaps find so great difficulty, (<hi>without swearing,</hi>) only to say, <hi>That the King alone is the supreme Governour in all matters Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical within his Dominions, &amp;c.</hi> when they are obliged to say this to persons that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with them such power to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Civill: But <hi>an Oath</hi> to Catholicks is a thing so dreadful, that they dare not call God to witnesse that they sincerely swear an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement <hi>that the Pope has not, nor ought to have any Superiority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual,</hi> unlesse it might be permitted them at the same time, &amp; in the same breath to signify that this is intended of Civil, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100532:30"/>
Authority in Ecclesiastical causes. They tremble to swear in a phrase at the best <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous,</hi> or rather not ambiguous, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally contradictory to Catholick Doctrine: for all the words that they pronounce, and of their acknowledgment whereof they make God a witnesse, are such as they are perswaded to be manifestly erroneous. Now God is called a witnesse to what men say in an oath, not to what they think, unless they think as they say.</p>
            <p n="80">80. But moreover there is another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration that is more than sufficient to make the taking of this oath inconsistent with Catholick Religion: and that is, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that <hi>King James, Bishop Andrews,</hi> &amp;c. put between the two oathes of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> in regard of their <hi>End</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Defence of the Oath.</hi>
               </note> For sayes King <hi>James, The Oath of Allegiance (was</hi> not <hi>framed</hi> against Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks in general, but) <hi>only to make a separation between Catholicks of a peaceable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position &amp; in all other things good Subjects, and such Roman Catholicks as maintained the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Maxims of the Powder-traitours.</hi> But as for the Oath of <hi>Supremacy, the intention of the continuation of it, was to the end to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver who were Roman Catholichs, and who Protestants.</hi> So that whosoever takes that <hi>Oath,</hi> is presumed by King <hi>James</hi> &amp;c. to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he is <hi>no Catholick:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tort. tort. pag.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Bishop Andrews</hi> has the like expression: but withall he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovers the usesessness of that oath. <hi>For</hi> (saies he) <hi>what needs any oath at all to detect who are Roman Catholicks? For they refuse to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Protestants Church service, they will not come to our Sermons, they dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Eucharist with us, &amp;c. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100532:30"/>
any oath you may easily know who are Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="81">81. Lastly the principal <hi>proof</hi> by which Protestants demonstrate that by the Oathes no other Authority or Supremacy is given to our Princes, but civil only (which is the 37 <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>English Church</hi>) though it be sufficient to clear the <hi>Affirmative</hi> part of the oath, yet not so for the Negative, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes spiritual Jurisdiction. Yea in the same place it is expresly excluded: For the words following in the same Article do apparently give and require a very uncatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick sence of that <hi>Negative Clause</hi>; for there is expressely affirmed, <hi>The Bishop of Rome hath not any Jurisdiction in this Kingdom.</hi> Now since both <hi>King James, Bishop Andrews,</hi> and the thirty seventh Article, even in the very same places where they speak of <hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>papal power</hi> do as the former rightly state the Kingly, and leave the <hi>Papal (Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual) power</hi> indifinitely excluded, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention appears to have been to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and require an abrenunciation of a <hi>Catholick point of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="82">82. Upon these grounds <hi>Catholicks</hi> dare not but refuse to take the <hi>Oath of Supremacy.</hi> Perhaps by the <hi>new unlawful art of Casuistry</hi> some of them might think they could find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions: but generally such is the <hi>tendernesse of their consciences</hi> that they dare not think it lawful to make advantage of <hi>Casuistry</hi> in a <hi>Solemn Oath.</hi> Very likely Protestants will call them nicely scrupulous, foolish or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident for this their <hi>tendernesse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> But sure they will not suspect them <hi>disloyal,</hi> who attribute as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the King as themselves do: and if
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100532:31"/>
it were permitted them to confirm this by a clear Oath, in their own language, they would not yield to them in the fullnesse of the expression. If hereafter they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to grant them any ease from their pressures, if a harmlesse scrupulosity in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks shall bear those penalties which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect rebellion in others escapes, If to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the passion of not very good Subjects, those that are truly loyal shall be treated as Rebells, and their religion only punished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; however that will not be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those that punish it, all that remains for <hi>Catholicks</hi> to say, is, <hi>Dominus judicabit fines terrae.</hi>

            <p n="84">84. But they may impute only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the cause of such a refusal: for by some incommodious phrases unnecessarily thrust into it they have frighted many from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100532:31"/>
taking it: and as if they had conspired with that one <hi>too well known party</hi> which alone gave occasion for the framing it, they have given them advantage for those unnecessary phrases sake to fix upon all the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers a scandalous however unjust imputation as if they approved these abominable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, from which flowed that more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable <hi>Attentat,</hi> which deservedly wrung extreme severity from a Prince the most element that ever this Nation formerly had enjoyed.</p>
            <p n="85">85. In the following Reflexions therefore upon this Oath, justice requires that we should divide between the innocent and the guilty, between those that (not in this Kingdom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) have made that <hi>Principle of Disloyalty</hi> their <hi>distinctive Charter</hi>; and those that are ready to renounce that <hi>Principle,</hi> if they might be allowed to renounce it by any other, though more Emphatical expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="86">86. As touching the former unhappy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is observable that at the first publishing of the Oath, there were in every line and almost particle of it pointed out by them a several <hi>Heresie</hi>: All which Heresies are now at last vanished, excepting only one, which is that by which there is enjoyned [a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that so bruited <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> touching the <hi>Popes power of deposing Princes not for Heresie only but almost any other fault that shall be esteemed sufficient to deserve it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="87">87. This pretended <hi>Article of Faith</hi> is by such new <hi>De-fide-men</hi> grounded either upon the Actions of certain Popes since Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the seventh,</hi> which both for their own sakes and ours it is to be wished had never
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100532:32"/>
been done, or might be blotted out of all mens memories; or upon the <hi>Decrees</hi> of some <hi>Councels</hi> not received or acknowledged by Catholick Churches; but principally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent the third,</hi> in which an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is said to have been framed to oblige (not supreme Princes but) <hi>Temporales Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testates</hi> and <hi>Dominos, which bear Offices in States to take at Oath to root out of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions all Hereticks, upon penalty (if they do not performe what they swear) of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the pope to be deprived of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, &amp;c. yet reserving the right of the supreme Lord.</hi>

            <p n="88">88. All these Allegations have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unanswerably confuted by several learned <hi>Writers</hi> of our Nation: but because this last <hi>Decree</hi> of a Councel not so questioned, for as much as can be proved to have been decided in it, and because it is almost alone suggested to the tongues of some Catholicks among us, as the principal pillar of that pretended <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith,</hi> for the maintaining of which they are exhorted to forfeit their Estates and Lives, they are desired sadly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p n="89">89. <hi>First,</hi> that this <hi>pretended decree of faith</hi> has been disclaimed by a World of unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Catholicks; and <hi>Doctor Bishop</hi> the <hi>last Catholick Bishop but one in England,</hi> has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a book purposely against it; and no proof can be given, that it was ever received or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by any Catholick Kingdome out of <hi>Italy</hi>: The reasons whereof are, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these Decrees were never published by P. <hi>Innocent,</hi> nor so much as a copy of them extant either in the <hi>Body of Councells,</hi> or the

               <hi>Vatican Library,</hi> or any where else, till a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>German</hi> three hundred years after, said that he found them in a <hi>Manuscript,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled he knowes not by whom, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a meer <hi>Collection</hi> made by some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known person out of the <hi>Decretals</hi> of his <hi>Nephew Gregory the ninth.</hi> 2.

Above sixty Capitula were by the Popes order recited in the Assembly, and many of them pend in a stile as if they had been concluded (for that was the Popes expectation) but nothing at all could be plainly decreed: they seemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to some</hi> [PLACABILIA] <hi>passable, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Onerosa, <hi>but no conciliary Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made except one or two, (which was about the recovery of the holy Land, and the subjection of the Greek Church to the Roman) by reason of a war then begun between them of</hi> Pisa <hi>and</hi> Genua, <hi>which called the Pope from the Councel.</hi>

Moreover to demonstrate that they were purposely excepted, the <hi>Emperour Frederike</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five or six years after, published an edict to the very same intent, and in the very same language and titles, by which he intended to oblige only the <hi>Feudatary princes and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Empire</hi> by oath to root out here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy: And yet after all, no example can be produced either in the Empire, or other Christian States that such an oath was in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times imposed. This is the <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> for the maintaining of which it is by one party expected that all English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks should ruine both themselves and their Religion. It is not so in Catholick countries abroad: VVe know that <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> by a law of the Empire publickly permitted <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> in several provinces, and all the Kings of <hi>France</hi> since <hi>Henry the third,</hi> the <hi>Calvinists</hi> through their Kingdom, and yet the pope never so much as threatned, nor they feared a <hi>Deposition.</hi>

            <p n="93">
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100532:33"/>93. And as for the <hi>Doctrinal point of faith</hi> most shamelesly pretended to be involved in that or the like decrees, to wit, <hi>the Popes power of deposing Princes,</hi> what one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick State, Kingdom, Republick or City can the preachers of it name where it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or permitted to the people to be taught, even as <hi>a probable opinion</hi>?</p>
            <p n="94">94. It is well known that in <hi>France,</hi> in the year 1614. a book written by <hi>Suarez the Jesuite,</hi> purposely against this Oath, in which that <hi>Deposing power</hi> was asserted, was by a <hi>Decree of the Parliament of Paris</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned therefore to be burnt by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Executioner, <hi>as containing propositions scandalous, seditious, tending to the eversion of States, and inducing Subjects to practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lives and sacred persons of Kings,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p n="95">95. The like fate had several other books written by eminent persons of the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100532:34"/>
as <hi>Mariana, Bellarmine, Santarellus,</hi> &amp;c. which maintained the <hi>Popes temporal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> and <hi>power to deprive Princes,</hi> and <hi>to absolve Subjects from their Obedience.</hi> And particularly upon occasion of <hi>Santarellus</hi> his book, no less then eight Universities in that Kingdom, <hi>Paris, Valentia, Tholouse, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers, Bourdeaux, Bourges, Rheims and Caen</hi> did of their own accord, not expecting any command from the Court, in the year 1626. brand the <hi>Doctrine of the Popes depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing power</hi> with the Titles of <hi>impious, sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, infamous to Popes, ruinous to States, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="96">96. Yea moreover within these six Moneths a certain Priest of the Hermitage of <hi>Caen,</hi> called <hi>Fossart,</hi> a known Emissary of that society, having in his publick acts for a degree in that University advanced this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>That the Pope has a Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Temporals as well as Spirituals, and that he has power to depose and constitute Kings</hi>; though to evade a censure, he Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted his Assertion, saying <hi>that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that power of the Pope to extend only to Tyrants</hi>: notwithstanding by a Decree of the whole faculty of that University, <hi>both his proposition and exposition of it was censured to be impious, pernicious, seditious, and in all regards to be detested, and as such it was by them condemned.</hi> And the same <hi>Fossart</hi> being after this imprisoned, was sentenced by the <hi>presidial Court of Justice in Caen</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and bare-headed to acknowledge <hi>that the said propositions were false, contrary to the holy Decrees of Councels, to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal lawes of that Kingdom, and to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and rights of the Gallican Church.</hi>

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100532:34"/>97. Such is the judgment of the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks</hi> and <hi>State of France</hi> of this <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> from which was issued rivers of blood during the <hi>Ligue</hi> there. As zealous against the <hi>Temporall power of Popes,</hi> has the <hi>State of Venice</hi> shewed it self: And if other Catholick Kingdomes have not done the like, it is because they have not had such dismal occasions and provocations to declare their minds. In <hi>Spain</hi> indeed the Schools are connived at, to preserve it from extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, because by its assistance a great part of <hi>Navarre</hi> has been annexed to that crown, and some hopes of <hi>England</hi> too gave it credit there. But yet when the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> would interpose in temporal matters there without the Kings liking, he is as bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resisted as in any other Catholick King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome besides.</p>

with what indignation would they have heard only the mentioning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of such a Decree?

What stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity then, what blindness do they presume to find among us <hi>English Catholicks,</hi> that they should fancy that we do not evidently see that it is their own secular interest only that makes the same point of Doctrine to be <hi>de fide</hi> in an Island, and a pestilent errour <hi>in terra firma</hi>?</p>
            <p n="106">106. In vain therefore do they hope that all Catholicks which have not made them the Depositaries of all their reason and common

sence, will admit a <hi>position</hi> infinitely preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to their Religion, to their King, and to their own souls, which they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in regard of their own single Estates or persons. For suppose a <hi>Bull of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> should be procured from <hi>Rome</hi> against any <hi>Catholick Lord, Gentleman,</hi> or <hi>Farmer</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for some <hi>new Heresie of Jansenisme,</hi> or for denying their <hi>Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. and that in consequence thereof, the <hi>Pope</hi> by his <hi>temporal Authority</hi> should lay a sine upon their heads, or deprive them of their Titles and Estates: Would those <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Gentlemen</hi> quietly be content to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorded</hi> and become peasants, or would they pay their fines and resign their Estates to such <hi>Apostles</hi>? If not, as most certainly they would not, with what conscience would they suffer themselves to be perswaded that the Sacred person of their <hi>Soveraign</hi> only is obnoxious to slavery, beggery and danger?</p>

will not be deprived of their Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to renounce it, especially being assured that without renouncing of it the <hi>State</hi> will never acknowledg them for loyal Subjects. It is well known that in <hi>France</hi> there was an <hi>Oath</hi> framed by the whole Body of the <hi>fiers Estate,</hi> in which they are to be sound farr more <hi>comprehensive expressions</hi> then are in our Oath, for therein is expresly affirmed, <hi>That there is no power on Earth,</hi>

            <p n="108">108. This will suffice concerning that <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> which those who will not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to renounce, but rather maintain it to <hi>Article of faith,</hi> yet however will perhaps not refuse to profess themselves ready to swear. 1. <hi>That the Kings of</hi> England <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Pope, may not be murthered by their Subjects, and to detest the contrary as Heretical.</hi> 2. Yea moreover, <hi>that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any sentence of deprivation ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, upon what occasion soever to ensue, they will bear faith and true Allegiance to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and his successours.</hi> And what needs Princes desire any greater security (say they) what need they trouble themselves with their Subjects speculative opinions?</p>
            <p n="109">109. But (alas) a miserable security, a poor testimony or gage of fidelity is all this, God knowes. For first, <hi>Murder</hi> being an unjust killing out of malice, and with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate purpose, is a sin so horrible in it self, that God himself cannot make it lawfull,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100532:38"/>
much lesse the Pope: therefore in all reason instead of those words [<hi>May not be murdred</hi>] they ought to say [<hi>may not be killed by their Subjects</hi>] For otherwise notwithstanding that Oath the Pope may be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a competent Judge of life and death over our Kings to sentence them to the slaughter, and that sentence may be put in execution without <hi>murther</hi>: For who ever said that a Malefactour put to death by Law was murthered by the Judges sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?</p>
            <p n="110">110. But whether they say [<hi>May not be murthered</hi>] or [<hi>May not be killed</hi>] Princes will esteem themselves little advantaged by such an Oath, unlesse the swearers say withal [<hi>May not be deposed.</hi>] For whosoever has a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme just right upon any pretence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to <hi>Depose Princes,</hi> has thereby right to cause them to be <hi>killed,</hi> in case they by armes oppose the Execution of that sentence. And can it be imagined that any Prince judged an Heretick or otherwise guilty by the Pope, and by him sentenced to be deposed will thereupon quietly descend out of his Throne, and yield up his Scepter to one of a contrary Religion? Or rather, is it not most certain that they will not, but on the contrary bring with them many thousands of their armed Subjects to resist the execution of such a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; all which must together with them be killed or murthered before it can have its full effect?</p>
            <p n="111">111. In the next place touching the <hi>Offer</hi> made by the same persons, who without renouncing the position of the <hi>Popes deposing power</hi> will however <hi>swear future Allegiance to the King and his Successours, notwithstanding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100532:38"/>
any past or coming sentence of Deprivation</hi>; in what age do they hope to find in <hi>England</hi> a King that will be so simple, and so over good-natured as to believe them, or rely upon such a Promise, especially considering what passed little above <hi>fifty years</hi> since? Is that Oath to be believed which they that take it do know to be unlawful, and consequently to be <hi>ipso facto</hi> null and invalid, so that it must be repented of, and must not be kept? For either they must swear that assoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they shall have taken their rectifyed Oath, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> will have this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular priviledge annexed to their Empire, that they shall never deserve (let their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or practises be what they will) that the Pope should <hi>exercise</hi> his just authority of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>them</hi>; that they alone will be out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the worlds end of being denounced <hi>No-Catholicks</hi> or <hi>Rebells to the See Apostolick</hi>: And this none can swear without the spirit of prophecy, which they will hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the State here to believe to be in them: <hi>Or else,</hi> they will swear that though the Pope never so justly and necessarily exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his lawful authority should command the Deposition of any of our Kings, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve all their Subjects from their Allegiance, yet <hi>they</hi> against their duty, conscience and Religion will disobey such his lawful authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and continue in Allegiance to him, to whom in such circumstances an <hi>Article of their Faith</hi> obliges them to believe that no Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is due, but rather utmost hostility. Now who will believe such an Oath as this? Or rather will they not be esteemed for such an oaths sake, resolved to be disloyal both to God and man? After this manner argues <hi>the

               <hi>Suarez,</hi> writing upon this very Clause of this Oath.</p>
            <p n="112">112. I would to God I could <hi>have</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my conscience on this subject without danger of incensing or contristating any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But in the present conjuncture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, after so many years proof of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant fidelity of Catholicks to his Majesty, it being necessary that <hi>the State</hi> should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that such fidelity proceeded from a <hi>principle of Catholick</hi> Religion unalterable; to discourse upon such a subject with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying softnesse and tendernesse to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, without a free, hearty, sincere and confident renouncing of <hi>a false principle of disloyalty</hi> maintained but by a very few, but imputed to, and punished in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body of English Catholicks, would have been to betray the cause of Catholicks in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to justify the suspicion that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants have formerly had against our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="113">113. There is another sort of <hi>loyal, well meaning Catholicks,</hi> who have no scruple at all to renounce this pretended <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> nor to make any the most strict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> but in this Oath meet with some Expressions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious phrases nothing pertinent to the substance, which they out of tendernesse of conscience cannot swear to. For first, they seem to professe a Declaration of a point of Faith which a particular Christian cannot presume to do Again, they cannot say that <hi>Position</hi> of the <hi>Popes deposing power</hi> is <hi>Heretical</hi>: any other ill names they will be content to give it, but they dare not swear
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100532:39"/>
it is <hi>Heretical,</hi> because the contrary is not evidently in Scripture, neither has it been condemned by the Church.</p>
            <p n="114">114. For the former, Protestants perhaps will account it a needlesse <hi>scrupulosity,</hi> since those which framed the Oath never intended that any one that takes it should seem to make himself a judge and decider of a point of faith, but only to signify his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching it. Besides (say they) this is the ordinary stile by which a Profession is made abroad of the condemning and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of any erroneous propositions, which are by Parliaments and Courts declared to be <hi>impious, seditious,</hi> &amp;c. Not that each Doctour, or whole faculties take upon them an <hi>Authority Conciliary</hi> to propose doctrines to the church, but only to testify their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning them.</p>
            <p n="115">115. But the second difficulty will not so easily be cleared, which is the profession of <hi>detesting such a position as Heretical</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because catholicks know that it cannot be called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical</hi> according to the notion of that term universally received among them: and what notion Protestants have of that word does not appear by any publick Declaration of theirs; how then can catholicks by Oath protest a detestation of that position as <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> since if they understand it in their own sence they should swear that which they know to be false: and if in any other unknown sence, they shall swear they know not what? Besides they should by Oath testify, that all <hi>Popes</hi> that have exercised, and all writers that have maintained such a <hi>deposing</hi> power, are to be esteemed <hi>Hereticks,</hi> persons fit to be excluded from <hi>Catholick communion.</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:100532:40"/>
And what Catholick alive will presume to say this?</p>
            <p n="116">¶ 116. Such is the case of afflicted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks touching these two <hi>Oathes</hi>: their tendernesse about phrases hath hitherto been either interpreted, or at least treated as professed disloyalty. But their hope now at last is that his Majesty according to his most gloriously element dispositon, and the whole <hi>State</hi> so miraculously renewed, will with a compassionate eye look upon, and read their most secret thoughts touching this matter. Though their abilities and number be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, yet Justice even to a single person ought not to be esteemed so. They are not unwilling, nay they are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be obliged to make protestations of their unalterable Fidelity, Obedience and peaceable submission to the State: and if none other besides themselves shall be esteemed to deserved to be obliged hereto by <hi>Oathes,</hi> they are contended to endure such a mortification, and they beseech God that his Majesty may never have just ground to suspect any others, for then they are sure that without any Oaths at all he may be most <hi>secure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="117">117. If any <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> shall be still accounted necessary, they only beg that they may not seem to renounce the <hi>Supreme spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual jurisdiction</hi> of him whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the <hi>Head of Gods Church</hi>: or at least that for refusing to renounce this, and suffering for such a refusal, they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to suffer purely for their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the least imputation of <hi>Disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to his Majesty, which they will never be guilty of, whether they swear against it, or no.</p>
            <p n="118">
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:100532:40"/>118. That which they deprecate in the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> is that which God himself requires, that it may not be ambiguous, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be interpreted, nor charged with expressions which if they were absent would not prejudice the substance and intention of the oath: and being present do render the whole ineffectual. They are assured that the first framer of this Oath, <hi>K. James</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended <hi>to</hi> intangle the consciences of his subjects, and if he had foreseen that a few unnecessary words would have rendred them uncapable to serve him, he would never have made choice of such unhappy expressions. But so long experience having demonstrated what it is that wounds the consciences of Catholicks, they confidently hope that this tendernesse will shew how infinitely more tender they will be to keep the Fidelity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the oath, since they have kept it when they were treated as breakers of it, only for, I cannot say, not daring to professe it, for that have alwayes been ready to do: but for not dareing to say things unnecessary to be said, or that they understand not or are not permitted to Explicate their meaning.</p>
            <p n="119">119. Never certainly was there a time when it was either more seasonable or more necessary to obstruct all passages of jealousies amongst English Subjects, and to prevent all attempts of disturbing the Kingdomes peace. As for other <hi>Sects,</hi> the State will (it is hoped and prayed for) be assisted by a divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to provide against the particular tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of each: and as for <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> no other expedient will be necessary but to afford them means to shew abroad that Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which their Religion indispensably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100532:41"/>
them to. This indeed will be a great affliction to other Sects among us, who would rather forgive Catholicks for being real tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, then for manifesting themselves in the eyes and to the satisfaction of all to be good Subjects.</p>
            <p n="120">120. Certainly that old <hi>policy of Queen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths Calvinistical Statesmen</hi> is now very unseasonable, and was alwaies dangerous, of first fomenting divisions among Catholick Subjects, especially about <hi>principles of loyalty and disloyal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> and then exposing both the loyal and disloyal subjects indifferently to the same rigour of lawes. Surely it is of greater concernment now for his Majesties security to unite all Catholicks with one heart to assist and defend him by casting out all principles of disloyalty inconsistent both with Catholick and Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="121">121. Now what more efficacious mean, or rather what other mean is there for this then that which his Majesty may if he please con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr upon them by allowing such an <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Government</hi> among them by which there will be produced a true Christian Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Uniformity both in opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, and consequently by which without giving the least jealousy, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry very great security to the State, they may all be united to concurr in promoting his service?</p>
            <p n="122">122. Now to what special parties both within and without the continuation of a defect so projudicial is to be imputed, is but too well known. It is not to be doubted but that the forementioned party will make use of all their skill and power to oppose all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100532:41"/>
good correspondence among them, upon more then one <hi>Motive.</hi> For 1. A strong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which they have to <hi>independence,</hi> and to a promoting of their particular interests dividedly from all others (by which means they have got great power abroad, little for the publick good of this Kingdom) this will make <hi>a common union</hi> very unwellcome to them. 2. And again they will easily foresee that by this only means those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>principles of disloyalty</hi> which made them heretofore eminent abroad, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then be renounced. They will no longer be looked upon as the only <hi>Apostles</hi> of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign <hi>temporal power,</hi> either <hi>direct,</hi> or (which is as bad) <hi>indirect</hi>; the enormous <hi>writings</hi> and worse <hi>practices</hi> of their <hi>Forefathers,</hi> which only procured the continuation of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> and the framing of that <hi>of Allegiance</hi> together with the sharp lawes, not against them alone, must be condemned to the same fate that they have suffered in other Kingdomes: and lastly an advantage of corrupting good English Natures with Maximes of Morality odious to all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, and condemned by supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will be taken from them.</p>
            <p n="123">123. These cannot chuse but prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such dispositions very great mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as great as any of these, would be the framing of <hi>Oaths</hi> which all good Catholicks could securely take. For it is well known that they have been publickly told that it is for their advantage only that such <hi>Oaths</hi> are imposed here as cannot generally be taken, and that worse newes cannot come to their brethren abroad, then that such <hi>Oaths</hi> were taken away from Catholicks: Because they have a strong apprehension that themselves
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100532:42"/>
having been the sole clauses of those ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours against the whole body of English Catholicks, shall have but a small portion in any future indulgence without an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, satisfactory renunciation of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and an assurance given to teach the contrary, as they were obliged by an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> of the <hi>Parliament of Paris,</hi> A. D. 1626.</p>
            <p n="124">124. And that this was no suspicion groundlesly taken or invented, there was produced a well known verified story hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning toward the latter end of <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> raign:<note place="margin">

Hereupon certain of their Brethren went to <hi>Rome</hi> to carry such good newes thither, whither being come they were by that <hi>party</hi> branded with the names of <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Spies and Rebels to the See Apostolick</hi>: and moreover there was by one of the party [<hi>T.F.</hi>] compiled a <hi>Treatise in Italian</hi> to advise his holyness, <hi>That it was not good or profitable to the Catholick cause that any liberty or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should be granted by the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Because not for their own interest: For having been persons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver formerly admitted by publick authority into this Kingdom, and having given sad proofs of their temper, they did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason suspect that if only good loyal Catholick Subjects were tolerated, their so dangerous, and to themselves only advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous principles must be abandoned.</p>
            <p n="125">125. It is not therefore to be expected, but that a charitable concurrence of several Ecclesiastical pastours here would be to them
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100532:42"/>
very unwellcome. But the commodities and Benedictions flowing there-from are unexpressible. For 1. Though perhaps by a hindrance thereby given to that parties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided way of agitation here, the number of Catholicks among us might come to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished; yet then there would be none but good, charitable and obedient Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> free from all intelligence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs abroad. 2. Matters of discipline and Spiritual Government would not be only and immediatly ordered by a <hi>Court</hi> too far distant from us, and too much suspected by the State here. 3. <hi>English Catholicks</hi> would be freed from a burden, (and the <hi>King</hi> from jealousies) to which no other in the World are obnoxious. For in <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. none dare under utmost penalties execute <hi>orders</hi> or publish <hi>Mandats</hi> without express allowance from the <hi>State,</hi> though such briefs touched only spiritual matters. Whereas in <hi>England</hi> whensoever any such briefs are published at <hi>Rome,</hi> although upon information of one inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed party, there being no setled correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>pastours</hi> to whom they ought in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to be directed, &amp; by them <hi>communicated</hi> to their respective flocks, not only the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of particular Catholicks are disquieted, whilst some of <hi>their directours press</hi> the <hi>validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of them, &amp; others reclaim: but <hi>the State</hi> also, not causelesly, entertains jealousies, &amp; suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of secret practises, not being at all, or not sufficiently informed. All which inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by such a <hi>Government</hi> would be easily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded. 4. Lastly by this means Catholicks would be enabled to receive from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty any orders that may be for his service, and effectually put them in execution.</p>
            <p n="126">126. It is well known what important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

manner of convenience, not the least additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of security accrews unto his sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty or the State &amp;c. but on the otherside infinite prejudice to his afflicted Subjects: What then can be more just, more for Gods honour, more becoming the benignity of his Majesty, and more for the reputation of the Kingdom then that such <hi>ambiguous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> (suggested no doubt by some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular malignant spirits) should be cleared or taken away: and that Oathes should be conceived in such a form that they may be taken uniformly, sincerely and cordially by all good subjects, and must be refused by all ill Subjects; and withal that our Princes safety and the peace of the Kingdom may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, by them?</p>
            <p n="131">131. Besides the ambiguity, there seems now to be another <hi>Motive,</hi> more pressing, though none can be more weighty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a change in the Formes of the Oathes, and that is this. When the Oathes were made the intention of the State was to have one only Religion openly permitted in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and then the Catholick was that which appeared opposite to it, as having been formerly the only Religion of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and for this reason consequently the Oathes were framed either upon a jealousy of a doubtful title, or at least against some special point about the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi> which one party among Catholicks falsely pretended to be essential to their Religion, &amp; in consequence thereto gave too just cause to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="132">132. But of late the temper of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is strangely altered. God only knowes how many <hi>new Religions</hi> are star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

private spirit</hi>: All which perhaps think themselves little or nothing concerned in Oathes made against <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and therefore will not much stand upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them: by which means they, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their known <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,</hi> destructive both to Allegiance and peace, wlll passe for good subjects, without any obligation to renounce such <hi>principles,</hi> or change such <hi>practises</hi>: and only <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> will keep the Oathes, though they dare not take them: by which means being yet more odious to such Sects for keeping the Oathes then they would have been if they had broke them, the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that the others have against them, is to force them to take them. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them all <hi>the security of his sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> which was only intended by the <hi>Oathes,</hi> is not in the least measure provided for. Yea I may, I hope, be permitted to say, That his Majesty thinks himself secure of those that do not take the Oathes, and stands in great need of securing himself from too many that freely take them, and swear to be loyal to him. What then can be imagined more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for a cure to so great a confusion, then to change such inefficacious instruments of Loyalty?</p>
            <p n="133">133. But moreover since it is not to be doubted but that <hi>his Majesty</hi> will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his <hi>promise</hi> so publickly made of a <hi>liberty for tender consciences, and that none shall be called in question for differences of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in matter of Religion, which do not disturb the peace of the Kingdom</hi>: Those certainly will declare themselves most unworthy of the fruit of <hi>so unexampled a beingnity,</hi> that shall either expect from such a <hi>promise</hi> a liberty

to reserve any ill principles of Disloyalty, or that shall exclude from the benefit of it any other of his Subjects that shall submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to all possible proofs of renouncing such principles, and that have hitherto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Oathes taken, constantly adhered to him.</p>
            <p n="134">134. As <hi>his Majesty</hi> therefore has been pleased to take notice that among his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a different belief there are <hi>tender consciences,</hi> and has promised to have a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful regard to them: So it is most just and necessary that his <hi>Subjects</hi> likewise should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>his Majesty</hi> to have <hi>a tender conscience too,</hi> to which also they must have regard. Now wherein can He (or any in authority under him) more truly and perfectly shew that he has a tender conscience with regard to his Subjects, then by using his Authority to root out all <hi>ill Principles</hi> that disturbe peace, or dispose to sedition and Rebellion? For this end especially Princes were ordained by God: So that if they do otherwise, they should resist <hi>the ordinance of God,</hi> and become far worse then <hi>Tyrants</hi> to their people. Those Subjects therefore that would expect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the maintaining any principles of disloyalty should be esteemed a proof that they have <hi>tender consciences,</hi> do consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect that the King should give them leave, whensoever they have a grudge in conscience thereto, <hi>to depose him,</hi> and to put the whole Kingdom into confusion.</p>
            <p n="135">135. And now, till his Majesty shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to interpret his promise more distinctly, let any indifferent person judge, who they are among so many different beliefs that ought to be esteemed to have <hi>tender conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and to hold <hi>Opinions which do not disturb

the peace of the Kingdom</hi>: whether <hi>they</hi> that have and ever will be ready to give all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofes of <hi>loyalty</hi> both by words and deeds, so that the words by which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse this may not prejudice their relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on in a point of mere internal belief which has not any influence upon their Loyalty: and who if they cannot otherwise then by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying their faith be accepted and treated as loyal, will protest themselves bound in conscience and by their Religion never <hi>to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the peace of the Kingdom,</hi> but patiently to suffer as if they did disturb it; Or <hi>those</hi> which make no conscience to swear accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a Forme that requires loyalty, though they know that such a form in the proper sence of the words cannot consist with their belief; and when they have done, make lesse conscience of violating that duty which they know the law requires, and which ought to have been performed though they had never sworn it. Surely unlesse passion alone be judge, unlesse that be to be called a <hi>tender conscience</hi> which is none at all: and unless the Title of <hi>disturbers of the peace of the Kindom,</hi> be appropriated to those only that trouble no body, and wrongfully imputed to those only who are irreconcileable to all that love and promote peace and loyalty, both Protestants and Catholicks, there will be no errour in making a iudgment.</p>

It is purely from the fear of God that they deny unto the King <hi>a Spiritual Jurisdiction,</hi> and to the Pope a <hi>Temporal.</hi> Flattery, disrespect or malignity have not the least influence on either of these professions: If they should ascribe to the King a Pastoral authority in spiritual matters, or to any Spiritual Pastours a Lordly dominion over the persons or lives of other mens sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and much more over Kings themselves, they should give to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things which are Gods, and to God spiritually ruling in his <hi>Vicar,</hi> the things which belong to <hi>Caesar</hi>: they should herein wrong both the Pope and the King too, and by mixing or doubling either of their powers, destroy both. As for their Duty to Kings, they hear our Lord saying, <hi>The Kings of the Nations bear a Lordly Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but nor so yee</hi> (my Apostles:) <hi>I have not given to you any such authority</hi>: yea they find our Lord refusing to be a King, or so much as a Judge in temporal matters, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to pay tribute, nor to acknowledg <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> to have power from heaven over him. They hear the first Vicar of our Lord St. <hi>Peter</hi> commanding with an authority greater then <hi>ex Cathedrâ, Be subject to every humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the King as precelling all others, &amp;c.

that duty which is intended by the Oath: Those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall be excluded from the protection of lawes, or banished, or made the Victimes of publick rigour: But as for all other Sects, the names and number of which we do not know, or if we know many of their names, we scarce know how blasphemous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous are their secret tenents, only we know that they are haters of Antiquity, and learning; united in designes of destroying our Religion, our Estates and Government; and what care they are likely to have of his Majesties safety and dignity, hath been shewed these last twenty years: these are the only persons esteemed by us to have tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, because they are bound to disturb peace, to cry down Bishops, to gather hands against lawes, &amp;c.</hi> If any Protestants will make this <hi>profession,</hi> they will at least deal ingenuously; whether conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and prudently, or no, they must be <hi>judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="142">142. To conclude, if it be necessary (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it is) that Oaths should provide against ill principles, and consequently that the present Oaths should be interpreted or changed, then is the proper season to separate the guilty from the innocent: <hi>For he that justifies the wicked, and condemnes the just, both of them are an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Lord.</hi> Then is the proper time to have regard equally both to loyalty and <hi>tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> joyntly together: And an effectual <hi>mean</hi> to discover <hi>who are such tender consciences as his Majesty intends liberty to,</hi> would be to require from all parties a distinct and sincere explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in what sence and how far they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Majesty to be <hi>supreme,</hi> in all both <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> matters. After which, <hi>the State</hi> will easily find out who are the <hi>tender consciences</hi> that are most tender both of their duty to God and of his Majesties safety, and who are they from whom it will behove him to stand most upon his guards.</p>
