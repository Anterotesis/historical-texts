            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(amongst which, with the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi>
I place <hi>Painting)</hi> do so
naturally depend upon the
Countenance of Great Men,
that without their Protection, they seldom take
<hi>Root</hi> enough to defend themselves against
<pb facs="tcp:43902:4"/>
               <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Ignorance:</hi> Nor, on the other

<hi>Luxuriant,</hi> either sit Easie in its present
Enjoyments, or live Kindly in the Memory of
Posterity, without those Ornaments of its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi> But this <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
of Knowledge and Greatness, is always
more Conspicuous, where the <hi>Maecenas</hi> is not
only a <hi>Lover,</hi> but a <hi>Judge</hi> of the Beauties
of Ingenious Productions: This being, where
could I have sought a <hi>Patron,</hi> but in your
Lordship, for the Improvement of an <hi>Art,</hi>
which makes one of your chiefest Delights; and
in the Knowledge of which, you show as much
Skill as the <hi>Artists</hi> themselves do in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Secret Beauties are the great Charm
of Life to Dilicate Souls; but they want nice
Observers to be enjoyed; and <hi>Pictures</hi> have
that singular Priviledge, that though they seem
Legible <hi>Books,</hi> yet they are perfect <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:43902:4"/>
to them. 'Tis to remedy in some measure, this
Misfortune of so noble an <hi>Art,</hi> that I have
taken the pains; your Lordship will see if you
daign to look into this <hi>Volume,</hi> which is
Humbly Dedicated to you: The World, I am
sure, will justifie my choice of a <hi>Patron,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may do for the Book it self; for in
your Lordship, besides Nobleness of Birth, and
Eminency of Fortune and Dignity, there is an
Innate Sweetness and Candour, accompanied
with a Serenity of Temper, and Firmness of
Courage; which draw to you the Vows and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
of Mankind, and make Offerings of this
Nature to be but just Tributes to so known a
Merit. I should hardly, after this, dare to
mention my particular Obligations to your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Family, could I hope for a more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Occasion of Expressing that Gratitude
which I owe: They were laid upon me, not only
in my <hi>Infancy,</hi> but even some days after my
Birth; and so Generously contrived, that they
<pb facs="tcp:43902:5"/>
are like to last as long as I live: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I reckon my Dependance to be a part of
my Being; and shall as soon forfeit the one as
the other: I am only sorry that <hi>Fortune</hi>
concurs so little with my Wishes, as to have
made me hitherto an Useless Servant to your
Lordship, whose particular Merit I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
as much Admired, as others may do the
Splendour of your Fortune; the Influence of
both will, I hope, be felt by this Noble <hi>Art</hi> of
<hi>Painting;</hi> and I in my particular, shall be
continually studying how to express my <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>

here below, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
those ARTS by which we
attain that kind of Immortality,
do best deserve to be Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by us. Therefore <hi>Historians</hi> and
<hi>Poets,</hi> who keep, as it were, the
<hi>Registers</hi> of Fame, have always been
<pb facs="tcp:43902:6"/>
Courted by the Great and by the
Good, as knowing that the Merit of
their Actions depended upon their
<hi>Pens;</hi> but because those very Men
through whose Hands such Glorious
Atchievements were to pass, might
either be led away with <hi>Passion,</hi> or
swayed with <hi>Prejudice,</hi> to make a false
Representation of them to the <hi>World.
Providence</hi> yet kinder, gave us two
Arts, which might express the very
Lines of the Face, the Air of the
Countenance, and in it a great part
of the Mind of all those whom they
should undertake to Represent; and
these are, <hi>Sculpture</hi> and <hi>Painting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> the famousest
<hi>Sculptor</hi> of these <hi>Modern Ages,</hi> looking
one day earnestly upon a <hi>Statue</hi> of
St. <hi>Mark</hi> made by <hi>Donatello,</hi> after
<pb facs="tcp:43902:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
having long admired it, said at last,
<hi>That if Saint.</hi> Mark <hi>were like that Statue,
he would have believed his Gospel upon his</hi>
Physionomy, <hi>for it was the honestest Face
that ever was made.</hi> 'Tis hard to say,
whether he commended the <hi>Artist,</hi>
the <hi>Saint,</hi> or the <hi>Art</hi> it self most by
this Expression: But this Inference
we may make from it, That if the
Faces of <hi>Heroes</hi> do express the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Minds, those <hi>Arts</hi> which
perpetuate their <hi>Memory</hi> that way,
are the truest of all <hi>Records.</hi> This
made <hi>Alexander</hi> so sollicitous, that
none but <hi>Apelles</hi> should draw his <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:</hi>
and caused <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth to
value himself, upon having sat three
times to <hi>Titian,</hi> as if he had obtained
three Victories over <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
But there is in these <hi>Arts</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:43902:7"/>
               <hi>Charm</hi> for the <hi>Survivours</hi> as well as for
the <hi>Dead:</hi> And who is there of a
Vertuous MIND, or an Inspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
SOUL, who is not infinitely
pleased to contemplate the <hi>Looks,</hi> the
<hi>Meen,</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> of those who have done
great things amongst Men: the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
of <hi>Alexander;</hi> the sharp <hi>Quickness</hi>
and piercing <hi>Selerity</hi> of <hi>Caesar;</hi> the
<hi>Tranquil Magnanimity</hi> of <hi>Scipio;</hi> the
<hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> are still extant in
their <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Medals</hi> to such a
degree, that none of the <hi>Curious</hi> would
ever go about to give them another
<hi>Countenance</hi> than those that have been
transmitted to us this way.</p>
            <p>I shall not undertake to determine
here, which of these two <hi>Arts</hi> deserves
our Admiration most: The one,
makes <hi>Marble-Stone</hi> and <hi>Brass</hi> soft and
tender: the other, by a strange sort
<pb facs="tcp:43902:7"/>
of <hi>Inchantment,</hi> makes a little <hi>Cloth</hi> and
<hi>Colours</hi> show <hi>Living Figures,</hi> that upon
a flat <hi>Superficies</hi> seem <hi>Round,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the <hi>Eye</hi> into a Belief of <hi>Solids,</hi>
while there is nothing but <hi>Lights</hi> and
<hi>Shadows</hi> there: But this I may say in
favour of the Art of <hi>Painting,</hi> whose
praises I am now to <hi>Celebrate,</hi> That it
certainly is of a greater Extent than
<hi>Sculpture,</hi> and has an Infiniter Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to delight us withal.</p>
            <p>To see in one Piece the <hi>Beauty</hi> of
the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Verdant Glory</hi> of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Symmetry</hi> of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi>
and <hi>Temples;</hi> the <hi>Softness, Warmth,
Strength,</hi> and <hi>Tenderness</hi> of <hi>Naked Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
the <hi>Glorious Colours</hi> of <hi>Draperies</hi>
and <hi>Dresses</hi> of all kinds, the <hi>Liveliness</hi>
of <hi>Animals;</hi> and above all, the <hi>Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of our <hi>Passions, Customs, Manners,
<pb facs="tcp:43902:8"/>
Rites, Ceremonies, Sacred</hi> and <hi>Prophane:</hi>
All this, I say, upon a piece of por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
<hi>Cloth,</hi> easily carried, and as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
placed, is a <hi>Charm;</hi> which no
other Art can equal. And from this
Idaea of the Art, we may naturally
derive a Consequence of the <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Esteem</hi> due by us to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;
he who at the same time is both
<hi>Painter, Poet, Historian, Architect, Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
Mathematician,</hi> and <hi>Naturalist;</hi> he
Records the <hi>Truth,</hi> Adorns the <hi>Fable,</hi>
Pleases the <hi>Fancy,</hi> Recreates the <hi>Eye,</hi>
Touches the <hi>Soul;</hi> and in a word, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
you with <hi>Silent Instructions,</hi>
which are neither guilty of <hi>Flattery,</hi>
nor <hi>Satyr;</hi> and which you may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give over, or repeat with new
Delight as often as you please.</p>
            <p>If these <hi>Qualities</hi> do not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:43902:8"/>
recommend the Owner of them
to our Esteem, I know not what can;
and yet by a strange <hi>Fatality,</hi> we name
the word <hi>Painter,</hi> without reflecting
upon his Art, and most dis-ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
seem to place him among the
<hi>Mechanicks,</hi> who has the best Title to
all the <hi>Liberal Arts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antiquity</hi> did not so; and whoever
shall read the Tenth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the
Thirty-fifth <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Pliny;</hi> which is
nothing else but an <hi>Encomium</hi> of this
Art and its Artists, will find, that
Great Princes, and the most Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
Magistrates, thought <hi>Painters</hi>
fit to be their <hi>Companions. Alexander</hi>
was as often found to be in <hi>Apelles</hi>'s
<hi>Painting-Room,</hi> as in his <hi>Pallace;</hi> and to
Oblige him, parted with the Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
of all his <hi>Mistresses,</hi> because he
<pb facs="tcp:43902:9"/>
saw she had Wounded <hi>Apelles</hi>'s Heart:
<hi>Demetrius</hi> chose rather to Raise the
<hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> than to ruine a Piece
of <hi>Protogenes</hi>'s, which was painted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place where he could have
best <hi>Annoyed</hi> the <hi>Town;</hi> and while his
<hi>Camp</hi> was before it, would often go to
see <hi>Protogenes</hi> at Work, in a little <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-House</hi>
he had within the Precinct
of the <hi>Camp:</hi> And to show the <hi>Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Wit</hi> of the <hi>Painter,</hi> as well as
the <hi>Politeness</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> I cannot
omit the Answer <hi>Protogenes</hi> gave <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
when he asked how he durst
continue to Work with so much
<hi>Tranquility</hi> in the midst of the noise
of <hi>Arms,</hi> and the <hi>Disorders</hi> of a <hi>Camp?</hi>
He Civilly replyed, <hi>That the knew</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius
<hi>had War with the</hi> Rhodians,
<hi>but he was sure he had none with the</hi> Liberal
Arts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43902:9"/>
But to come nearer our own
<hi>Times; Francis</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> was so in <hi>Love</hi>
with <hi>Painters,</hi> that he got <hi>Italian Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
at any Rates, and obtained of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea
del Sarto,</hi> and <hi>Lionardo da Vinci,</hi> to
Honour his <hi>Court</hi> with their <hi>Presence</hi>
and <hi>Works;</hi> as he did the latter, with
visiting him when he lay a dying,
and suffering him to expire in his
Arms. <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi> was so fond
of <hi>Titian,</hi> that he gave his very <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi>
some <hi>Jealousie</hi> about him; but he
Cured them of it, by telling them,
<hi>That the Moments he gave to</hi> Titian, <hi>were
to be well managed, because he was not sure
to have his Company always; whereas he was
sure of theirs, who were more the Attendants
of his</hi> Fortune, <hi>than of his</hi> Person. When
he sent him any <hi>Present,</hi> which he did
often and nobly, he always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb facs="tcp:43902:10"/>
it with this <hi>Compliment, That his
Design was not to pay him for his Work,
which could have no Price:</hi> Which agrees
very well with what <hi>Pliny</hi> says of the
Princes and Great Men of <hi>Antiquity,
That they did not pay Pictures by Summs,
but by Heaps of</hi> Gold <hi>and</hi> Silver. <hi>In
nummo Aureo mensura accepit, non numero;</hi>
says <hi>Pliny</hi> of <hi>Apelles: Ridolfi</hi> in the
Life of <hi>Titian,</hi> reports, That one day
the same Emperour sitting for his
<hi>Picture,</hi> it happened, that <hi>Titian</hi> let fall
one of his <hi>Pencils;</hi> which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
presently took up, and gave
him again; which putting the <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to the blush, and obliging him to
make Excuses for the trouble the
Prince had taken; he was answered
by him, <hi>That</hi> Titian <hi>deserved to be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by</hi> Caesar. <hi>Raphael del Urbin</hi> was so
<pb facs="tcp:43902:10"/>
Acceptable to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth,
who was a most <hi>Magnificent, Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Prince,</hi> that he not only made him
of his <hi>Bed-Chamber,</hi> that he might have
his Company the oftner; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
had resolved to Create him <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
at his next <hi>Promotion;</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Sacred Purple</hi> it self a Reward
above the Merits of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Pencil:
But the Death of <hi>Raphael</hi> prevented
so <hi>Glorious</hi> an Acknowledgment of
his Deserts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rubens,</hi> in our days, after having
been in Favour with most of the
Great Princes in Christendom, was
at last chosen by the <hi>Infant Albert,</hi> and
the <hi>Infanta Isabella,</hi> to be their <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador</hi>
at <hi>London;</hi> where his Talent for
the Great Affairs of <hi>State</hi> was no less
admired than his <hi>Pencil,</hi> which has so
<pb facs="tcp:43902:11"/>
richly Adorned the <hi>Ceiling</hi> of one of
the best Rooms in <hi>Europe,</hi> I mean, the
<hi>Banquetting-House.</hi> And indeed, he
could never have fallen into a <hi>Court</hi>
that was more disposed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his Skill, than Ours was at that
Time: King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Memory,</hi> was not only the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Favourer, but the truest Knower
of all those <hi>Arts;</hi> and by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
the whole <hi>Court</hi> gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to those <hi>Refined Pleasures;</hi>
there being hardly a Man of Great
<hi>Quality,</hi> that had not a <hi>Collection,</hi> either
of <hi>Pictures</hi> or <hi>Antiques: Artists</hi> flowed
in upon us from all parts: And had
not the <hi>Bloody-Principled Zealots,</hi> who
are Enemies to all the Innocent <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
of Life, under the pretext of a
<hi>Reformed Sanctity,</hi> destroyed both the
<pb facs="tcp:43902:11"/>
Best of Kings, and the Noblest of
Courts, we might to this day have
seen these <hi>Arts</hi> flourish amongst us;
and particularly, this of <hi>Painting,</hi> which
was the <hi>Darling</hi> of that Vertuous <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch:</hi>
He had once <hi>Enrich'd</hi> our Island
with the noblest Collection that any
Prince out of <hi>Italy</hi> could boast of:
but those Barbarous Rebels, whose
<hi>Quarrel</hi> was as much to <hi>Politeness</hi> and
the <hi>Liberal Arts,</hi> as to <hi>Monarchy</hi> and
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> dissipated and destroyed the
best part of it.</p>
            <p>But with our late Blessed Monarch,
King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> all <hi>Arts</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to return from their Exile; and
to his Sacred Memory we owe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Incouragement they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
since; and it may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among his Faelicities and ours,
<pb facs="tcp:43902:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which were not few, that he did so;
for by that means we have him, as it
were, yet Living among us, by that
noble <hi>Statue</hi> of his, made by the best
of <hi>Modern Sculptors</hi> now living, I mean
Mr. <hi>Grialin Gibbons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have often wondred, considering
how much all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> are
Improved in these <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, and
particularly with us, that we have
never produced an <hi>Historical Painter,</hi>
Native of our own <hi>Soyl;</hi> we have had
a rare <hi>Architect,</hi> who was <hi>Inigo Jones:</hi> the
<hi>Banquetting-House,</hi> the <hi>Portico</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls
Church,</hi> and the <hi>Piazza</hi> of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi>
are three Pieces of his Doing, which
in their kind are hardly to be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Europe:</hi> We have likewise a
<hi>Sculptor,</hi> who, if he goes on as he has
begun, will be a <hi>Northern Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43902:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But for a <hi>Painter,</hi> we never had,
as yet, any of Note, that was an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Man,</hi> that pretended to <hi>History-Painting.</hi>
I cannot attribute this to
any thing but the little Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it meets with in this Nation;
whose <hi>Genius</hi> more particularly leads
them to affect <hi>Face-Painting;</hi> and in
that part we have had some who have
proved most Excellent <hi>Artists;</hi> as,
Mr. <hi>Oliver,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> the most
Correct in <hi>Miniature;</hi> and in <hi>Oyl, Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Walker:</hi> And even at this time,
Mr. <hi>Riley,</hi> who undoubtedly deserves
his Character of the first and best
<hi>Painter</hi> for Portraicts in our <hi>Age.</hi> But
our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> except some
few, who have eminently showed
their Kindness for this noble Art,
they are generally speaking, no
<pb facs="tcp:43902:13"/>
               <hi>Judges,</hi> and therefore can be no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
of an <hi>Art</hi> that lies all in nice
Observations.</p>
            <p>To Remedy this therefore, I have
undertaken this Work; which I have
so composed, as it may be read vvith
<hi>Delight</hi> by any vvho are but Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
vvith <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Pictures:</hi> The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
is, to make Painting <hi>Familiar</hi> and
<hi>Easie</hi> to the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of this
Nation, and to enter them so far in
the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance</hi> of the
<hi>Italian Painters,</hi> that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
vvith their Works, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their different <hi>Characters.</hi> This
I have done in three <hi>Familiar Dialogues;</hi>
in vvhich I never make use of a hard
<hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> but I first explain it: and
that nothing might be vvanting to
make it easie, I have also placed at
<pb facs="tcp:43902:13"/>
the end of the Book an Alphabeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Explanation</hi> of all the hard <hi>Words</hi>
used in the <hi>Lives</hi> of those <hi>Painters</hi>
that are here Sub-joyned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lives</hi> are all taken out of <hi>Vasa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri:</hi>
and for the Choice of them, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Arts Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
beginning with <hi>Cimabue,</hi> and
going on with all those who were, as
it were, the <hi>Inventers</hi> and <hi>Perfecters</hi> of
it by degrees, till I came to the Age
of <hi>Raphael</hi> and <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
a <hi>Second Part;</hi> which, besides
some more refined Observations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Art</hi> it self, will contain the
<hi>Lives</hi> of all the <hi>Modern Painters</hi> of any
Note, from the Time of the <hi>Caraches</hi>
to our Days, and an Account of its
present State all <hi>Europe</hi> over. After
this, I hope our People of <hi>Quality</hi> will
<pb facs="tcp:43902:14"/>
be sufficiently inflamed with the <hi>Love</hi>
of an <hi>Art</hi> which Rewards its <hi>Admirers</hi>
with the greatest Pleasures imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Pleasures so Innocent and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable,
that the severest <hi>Morals</hi>
cannot forbid the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of them;
Pleasures so Solid and Abounding,
that they are new every time they
are repeated; and in a word, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
that may be made <hi>Useful</hi> even to
the <hi>Covetous;</hi> for <hi>Pictures</hi> well bought,
are <hi>Money</hi> put out to <hi>Use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here have a great <hi>Scope</hi> to
<hi>Inveigh</hi> against those other <hi>Pleasures</hi> in
which this <hi>Nation</hi> places their greatest
<hi>Felicity;</hi> whil'st under the specious
names of <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Hospitality,</hi> we
Countenance the most <hi>Profuse Gluttony</hi>
and <hi>Exorbitant Drunkenness</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi>
sees: I might tell <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> That the
<pb facs="tcp:43902:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Loss</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Ruine</hi> of their <hi>Fortunes,</hi>
the <hi>Destruction</hi> of their <hi>Health,</hi> the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Tragical Accidents</hi> that attend Men
who once a day loose their <hi>Reason,</hi> are
all things worthy their serious <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
and from which, the <hi>Love</hi> of the
<hi>Politer Arts</hi> would reclaim them. But
I shall leave that <hi>Theam</hi> to our <hi>Divines,</hi>
and only sadly say with the <hi>Poet;</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Pudet haec Opprobia Nobis,</l>
                  <l>Audici potuisse, &amp; non potuisse refelli.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot forbear adding to this
little <hi>Reproof,</hi> an <hi>Observation</hi> that I have
made abroad; which is, That of all
the <hi>Civilized Nations</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> we are
the only that want <hi>Curiosity</hi> for <hi>Artists;</hi>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the midst of their <hi>Boggs</hi>
and ill <hi>Air,</hi> have their <hi>Houses</hi> full of
<hi>Pictures,</hi> from the <hi>Highest</hi> to the <hi>Lowest;</hi>
the <hi>Germans</hi> are also <hi>Curious</hi> in their
<pb facs="tcp:43902:15"/>
               <hi>Collections;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have as good as
can be had for <hi>Money;</hi> and that Art
seems now to take <hi>Sanctuary</hi> there;
and shall we, while we have a <hi>Prince</hi>
who has declared himself an Enemy
to all our <hi>Excesses,</hi> and a <hi>Patron</hi> of all
<hi>Vertuous Undertakings,</hi> be the only Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that shall follow <hi>Gross Delights!</hi> I
hope better of us; and that the <hi>Charm</hi>
of these Arts once well <hi>Comprehended,</hi>
will, like <hi>Moses's Rod,</hi> eat up all the
other, though never so well <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited</hi>
to be like <hi>Pleasures;</hi> while they
are, indeed, but so many <hi>Pains</hi> and
<hi>Plagues.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>THE extream delight you take
in Pictures, is a Pleasure you
have acquired abroad, for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
before you travelled, all Pictures
were alike to you, and you used to
laugh at the distinction that some of
your Friends did use to make of the
Pieces of this and the other Master,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43902:20"/>
saying, it was nothing but Humor
in them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>What you say is very true, and when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon it, I cannot but blush at my own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or rather willful Stupidity, that depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me of one of the most Refined Pleasures
of Life, a Pleasure as Lasting as Life it self,
full of Innocency and Variety, and so Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
that, alone, it often supplies the place
of Company and Books; and when enjoyed in
the company of others, it improves by being
shared, and growes greater by the number of
its Enjoyers, every one making some Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to his Genius and Inclination,
which still Illustrates the whole.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>I must confess I envy you this
Pleasure extreamly, for living, as we
do, in a Country where the severity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43902:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our Climate obliges us to be
much within Doors: Such a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
as this ought to be Cherished,
by all those who do not place their
Felicity, as too many of us do, in a
Glass of Claret: And I own, I would
willingly be of your Society, but
that there goes such a deal of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
to judg of a good Picture, that
I dispair of ever being qualified that
way, being naturally not much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to take pains for any Pleasure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>You are very much mistaken, every one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
is so far judg of <hi>Painting,</hi> as to
observe something in a Picture, that is like
to somewhat they have observed in Nature,
and that alone is capable of giving them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
if the thing be well represented; but
those indeed who joyn to that Delight, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43902:21"/>
particular knowledg of the manner how the
Painter has mannaged his Lines, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
his Lights and Shades, and how
he has disposed his Figures, and with what
Invention he has adorned his Story. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
have more Pleasure, as having in all
this a greater scope for their Observations;
and yet this, though infinitely hard for the
Painter to Execute, is but moderately diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for the Spectator to judg of it, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
only a Superficial Knowledg of the first
Principles of the Art, and a constant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Manners of the Different
Artists, which is acquired by viewing their
Works often, and Conversing much amongst
them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>That Superficial Knowledg of the
Principles which you speak of, is
wrapt up in such a company of hard
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43902:21"/>
Words, and crabed Terms of Art,
that a Man must have a Dictionary
to understand them, and a good
Memory to retain them, or else he
will be at a loss.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>If he undertake this Task with Order
and Method, it will prove extream easie;
for by following each part of Painting in its
proper Division, he will come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Terms of the Art insensibly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Pray in the first place, give me a
Definition of the Art of Painting,
that I may at once see what is aimed
at by it, and performed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>The Art of Painting, is the Art of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
any Object by Lines drawn upon
a flat Superficies, which Lines are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43902:22"/>
covered with Colours, and those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
applied with a certain just distribution
of Lights and Shades, with a regard to the
Rules of Symetry and Perspective; the
whole producing a Likeness, or true Idaea of
the Subject intended.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>This seems to embrace a great
deal; for the words Symetry and
Perspective, imply a knowledg in
Proportions and Distances, and that
supposes Geometry, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and Opticks, all which require
much Time to Study them, and so
I am still involved in perplexities of
Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>It is true, that those Words seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
some Knowledg of those Arts in the
Painter, but much less in the Spectator; for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43902:22"/>
we may easily guess, whether Symetry be
observed, if, for Example, in a Humane Body,
we see nothing out of Proportion; as if an
Arm or a Leg be not too long or short for
its Posture, or if the Posture its self be such
as Nature allows of: And for Perspective,
we have only to observe whether the Objects
represented to be at a distance, do lessen in
the Picture, as they would do naturally to the
Eye, at such and such distances; thus you
see these are but small Difficulties.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, would you not allow him to
be a Painter, who should only Draw
the Objects he intended to represent
in Black and White, or with bare
Lines upon Paper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>Yes without doubt, if what he did were
well Designed, for that is the Ground-work
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43902:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all Painting, and perhaps the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>What is it you call Design?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>Design is the Expressing with a Pen, or
Pencil, or other Instrument, the Likeness of
any Object by its out Lines, or Contors; and
he that Understands and Mannages well these
first Lines, working after Nature still, and
using extream Diligence, and skill may with
Practice and Judgment, arrive to an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in the Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Me thinks that should be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Matter, for we see many whose
Inclination carys them to Draw any
thing they see, and they perform it
with ease.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb facs="tcp:43902:23"/>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>I grant you, Inclination goes a great way
in disposing the Hand, but a strong Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
only, will not carry a Painter through;
For when he compares his Work to Nature,
he will soon find, that great Judgment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
as well as a Lively Fancy; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
when he comes to place many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
together in one Piece or Story, which
are all to have a just relation to one another.
There he will find that not only the habit of
the Hand but the strength of the Mind is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite;
therefore all the Eminent Painters
that ever were, spent more time in Designing
after the Life, and after the Statues of the
Antients, then ever they did in learning how
to colour their Works; that so they might be
Masters of Design, and be able to place rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
every Object in its true situation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:43902:24"/>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Now you talk of Nature and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
I have heard Painters blam'd
for working after both.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>It is very true, and justly; but less for
working after Nature than otherwise. <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaggio</hi>
a famous Painter is blam'd for having
meerly imitated Nature as he found her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any correction of Forms. And <hi>Perugin,</hi>
another Painter is blam'd for having wrought
so much after <hi>Statues,</hi> that his Works ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had that lively easiness which accompanies
Nature; and of this fault <hi>Raphael</hi> his
Scholar was a long time guilty, till he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
it by imitating Nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>How is it possible to erre in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Nature?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43902:24"/>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>Though <hi>Nature</hi> be the <hi>Rule,</hi> yet <hi>Art</hi>
has the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of Perfecting it; for you
must know that there are few <hi>Objects</hi> made
naturally so entirely <hi>Beautiful</hi> as they might
be, no one <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman</hi> possesses all the
<hi>Advantages</hi> of <hi>Feature, Proportion</hi>
and <hi>Colour</hi> due to each <hi>Sence.</hi> Therefore
the <hi>Antients,</hi> when they had any Great Work
to do, upon which they would <hi>Value</hi> themselves
did use to take several of the <hi>Beautifullest
Objects</hi> they designed to <hi>Paint,</hi> and out of
<hi>each of them,</hi> Draw what was most <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
to make up One <hi>exquisite Figure;</hi>
Thus <hi>Zeuxis</hi> being imployed by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Crotona,</hi> a City of <hi>Calabria,</hi> to
make for their <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Juno,</hi> a <hi>Female
Figure, Naked;</hi> He desired the Liberty
of seeing their <hi>Hansomest Virgins,</hi> out
of whom he chose <hi>Five,</hi> from whose several
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43902:25"/>
                  <hi>Excellencies</hi> he fram'd a most <hi>Perfect
Figure,</hi> both in <hi>Features, Shape</hi> and
<hi>Colouring,</hi> calling it <hi>Helena.</hi> At last in
the time of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> all the
<hi>Artists,</hi> both <hi>Painters</hi> and <hi>Sculptors,</hi> met
and considered how to give such <hi>Infallible
Rules</hi> to their <hi>Art,</hi> as no <hi>Artist</hi> should be
able to depart from them without Erring; and
to that end having examined all the <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> and how each <hi>Part</hi> of a
Humane Body ought to be, to make one <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished

<hi>The Rule,</hi> and all those that wrought

               <p>
                  <hi>Tradition</hi> has not told us that, but 'tis
very probable that the thing having so well
succeeded for one, was done for both, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
on for <hi>Children</hi> too, for we see the

study these Figures of the <hi>Antients</hi>

               <p>I confess the want of them is a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43902:26"/>
to our <hi>Painters,</hi> but we have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Prints</hi> and <hi>Casts,</hi> the Best things of that

            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Would you have a Painter study
nothing but Humane Figures?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>That being the most difficult in his Art,
he must cheifly Study it: But because no Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
can be well Represented without Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
therefore he must Learn to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
every thing, as Trees, Houses, Water,
Clothes, Animals, and in short, all that
falls under the notion of Visible Objects; so
that by that, you may guess how much Time
he must spend in this one part of Painting,
to acquire that Readiness, Boldness, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43902:26"/>
Strength, to his Designs; that must be, as
it were, the Ground-work of all he does.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>I have heard much of a difficulty
in Designing, called, <hi>Shortning,</hi> for
which I have seen Painters much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
by those who pretend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
Painting: Pray what is
<hi>Shortning?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Shortning</hi> of a Figure, is the making
it appear of more Quantity, than really it is;
the Figure having neither the Length nor
Depth that it shows, but by the help of the
Lights and Shades, and judicious mannaging
of the Out-lines, it appears what it is not;
and this is much used in Painting of <hi>Ceel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
and <hi>Roofs,</hi> where the <hi>Figures</hi> being
above the Eye, must be most of them Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to appear in their natural Situation.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43902:27"/>
And it is a thing, upon which great Painters
have Valued themselves, as supposing a great
Knowledg of the Muscles and Bones of the
Humane Body, and a great Skill in Design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> amongst the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Painters, is the greatest Master in that
kind.</p>

               <p>When a Painter has acquired any

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>That is not half his Work, for then he
must begin to mannage his Colours, it being
particularly by them, that he is to express
the greatness of his Art. 'Tis they that
give, as it were, Life and Soul to all that
he does; without them, his Lines will be but
Lines that are flat, and without a Body, but
the addition of Colours makes that appear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43902:27"/>
round; and as it were out of the Picture,
which else would be plain and dull. 'Tis they
that must deceive the Eye, to the degree, to
make Flesh appear warm and soft, and to
give an Air of Life, so as his Picture may
seem almost to Breath and Move.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Did ever any Painter arrive to

            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, several, both of the Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Painters. <hi>Zeuxis</hi> Painted <hi>Grapes,</hi>
so that the Birds flew at them to eat them.
<hi>Apelles</hi> drew Horses to such a likeness,
that upon setting them before live Horses, the
Live ones Neighed, and began to kick at
them, as being of their own kind. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Modern Painters, <hi>Hannibal
Carache,</hi> relates of himself, That going to
see <hi>Bassano</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> he went to take a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43902:28"/>
                  <hi>Book</hi> off a <hi>Shelf,</hi> and found it to be the
<hi>Picture</hi> of one, so lively done, that he who
was a <hi>Great Painter,</hi> was deceived by it.
The <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Raphael's Picture</hi> is so Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
that it seems to be <hi>Alive.</hi> And so do
<hi>Titians Pictures,</hi> who was the Greatest
<hi>Master</hi> for <hi>Colouring</hi> that ever was, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
attained to imitate <hi>Humane Bodies</hi>
in all the softness of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and beauty of
<hi>Skin</hi> and <hi>Complexion.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Beside the Mixture of <hi>Colours,</hi> such
as may answer the <hi>Painter's Aim,</hi> it lies
in a certain <hi>Contention,</hi> as I may call it,
between the <hi>Light</hi> and the <hi>Shades,</hi> which
by the means of <hi>Colours,</hi> are brought to
<hi>Unite</hi> with each other; and so to give that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43902:28"/>
                  <hi>Roundness</hi> to the <hi>Figures,</hi> which the
<hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Relievo,</hi> and for which we
have no other Name: In this, if the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
are too strong, the Piece is harsh and
hard, if too weak, and there be too much
<hi>Light,</hi> 'tis flat. I, for my part, should
like a <hi>Colouring</hi> rather something <hi>Brown,</hi>
but clear, than a bright gay one: But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
I think, that those fine <hi>Coral
Lips,</hi> and <hi>Cherry Cheeks,</hi> are to be
<hi>Banished,</hi> as being far from <hi>Flesh</hi> and
<hi>Blood.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Skins,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions</hi>
must vary, according to the <hi>Age</hi>
and <hi>Sex</hi> of the <hi>Person:</hi> An <hi>Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
requiring another <hi>Colouring</hi> than a
fresh <hi>Young one.</hi> But the <hi>Painter</hi> must
particularly take Care, that there be nothing
harsh to offend the <hi>Eye,</hi> as that neither the
<hi>Contours,</hi> or <hi>Out-Lines,</hi> be too strongly
<hi>Terminated,</hi> nor the <hi>Shadows</hi> too hard,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43902:29"/>
nor such <hi>Colours</hi> placed by one another as
do not agree.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Is there any <hi>Rule</hi> for that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>Some <hi>Observations</hi> there are, as those
<hi>Figures</hi> which are placed on the foremost
<hi>Ground,</hi> or next the <hi>Eye,</hi> ought to have
the greatest <hi>Strength,</hi> both in their <hi>Lights</hi>
and <hi>Shadows,</hi> and <hi>Cloathed</hi> with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Drapery;</hi> Observing, that as they lessen
by distance, and are behind, to give both the
<hi>Flesh</hi> and the <hi>Drapery</hi> more faint and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
<hi>Colouring.</hi> And this is called an
<hi>Union</hi> in <hi>Painting,</hi> which makes up an
<hi>Harmony</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> and causes the
<hi>Whole</hi> to appear one, and not two or three
<hi>Pictures.</hi>

               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>Then you think, the chiefest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of Colouring, consists in the
Imitation of Humane Flesh, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>Tints</hi> or <hi>Complexions</hi> to each
Age.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>There is a thing which the <hi>Italians</hi> call
<hi>Morbidezza;</hi> The meaning of which word,
is to Express the Softness, and tender Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> so as the <hi>Eye</hi>
may almost invite the Hand to touch and feel
it, as if it were Alive; and this is the
hardest thing to Compass in the whole <hi>Art</hi>
of <hi>Painting.</hi> And 'tis in this particular,
that <hi>Titian, Corregio,</hi> and amongst the
more <hi>Modern, Rubens,</hi> and <hi>Vandike,</hi>
do Excel.</p>

               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard, that in some <hi>Pictures</hi>
of <hi>Raphael,</hi> the very Gloss of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask,
and the Softness of Velvet,
with the Lustre of Gold, are so Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
that you would take them
to be <hi>Real,</hi> and not <hi>Painted:</hi> Is not
that as hard to do, as to imitate
<hi>Flesh?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>No: Because those things are but the still
Life, whereas there is a <hi>Spirit</hi> in <hi>Flesh</hi>
and <hi>Blood,</hi> which is hard to Represent.
But a good <hi>Painter</hi> must know how to do
those <hi>Things</hi> you mention, and many more:
As for Example, He must know how to Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Darkness of <hi>Night,</hi> the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Day,</hi> the Shining and Glittering of
<hi>Armour;</hi> the Greenness of <hi>Trees,</hi> the
Dryness of <hi>Rocks.</hi> In a word, All <hi>Fruits,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43902:30"/>
Flowers, Animals, Buildings,</hi> so as
that they all appear Natural and Pleasing to
the <hi>Eye.</hi> And he must not think as some do,
that the force of <hi>Colouring</hi> consists in
imploying of fine <hi>Colours,</hi> as fine lacks
<hi>Ultra Marine Greens,</hi> &amp;c. For these
indeed, are fine before they are wrought, but
the <hi>Painter</hi>'s Skill is to work them judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and with convenience to his Subject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>I have heard Painters blamed for
Finishing their Pieces too much:
How can that be?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>Very well: For an over <hi>Diligence</hi> in that
kind, may come to make the <hi>Picture</hi> look too
like a Picture, and loose the freedom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
And it was in this, that <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi>
who was, it may be, Superiour to
<hi>Apelles,</hi> in every part of Painting; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43902:31"/>
was nevertheless Outdone by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Protogenes</hi> could hardly ever give
over Finishing a Piece. Whereas <hi>Apelles</hi>
knew, when he had wrought so much as would
answer the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Spectator,</hi> and
preserve the <hi>Natural.</hi> This the <hi>Italians</hi>
call, <hi>Working A la pittoresk,</hi> that is
Boldly, and according to the first Incitation
of a Painters <hi>Genius.</hi> But this requires
a strong <hi>Judgment,</hi> or else it will appear
to the <hi>Judicious,</hi> meer <hi>Dawbing.</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43902:31"/>
                  <hi>Oyl Painting</hi> came up, most Masters
wrought that Way; and it is the most Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly
of all the ways of <hi>Painting,</hi> because
it is done upon a Wall newly Plaistered, and
you must Plaister no more, than what you can
do in a Day; the <hi>Colours</hi> being to Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the Mortar, and dry with it,
and it cannot be Touched over again, as all

Therefore there is great <hi>Practice</hi> required

               <p>Painting in <hi>Distemper,</hi> is when either
the Wall or Board you Paint upon, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with a certain Paste or Plaister, and
then as you Work, you temper your <hi>Colours</hi>
still with a Liquor made of the <hi>Yolk</hi> of an
<hi>Egg,</hi> beaten with the Milk of a <hi>Figg
Sprout,</hi> well ground together. This is a
way of Painting, used by <hi>Antient Masters</hi>
very much; and it is a very lasting <hi>Way,</hi>
there being yet things of <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s doing
upon <hi>Boards,</hi> that have lasted upwards of
Two Hundred Years, and are still fresh and
Beautiful. But since <hi>Oyl Painting</hi> came
in, most have given over the way of Working
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43902:33"/>
in <hi>Distemper.</hi> Your <hi>Colours</hi> in this
way are all <hi>Minerals,</hi> whereas in Working
in <hi>Fresco,</hi> they must be all Earths.</p>

               <p>The Secret of <hi>Oyl Painting,</hi> consists
in using <hi>Colours</hi> that are Ground with
<hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Nut,</hi> or <hi>Linseed,</hi> and with these
you paint upon a Cloth, which has first been
primed with drying <hi>Colours,</hi> such as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
Red Oaker,</hi> and <hi>Ombre,</hi> mingled
together. This manner of painting, makes
the <hi>Colours</hi> show more Lively than any
other, and seems to give your Picture more
Vivacity and Softness.</p>

               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, you may upon a dry Wall, having
first Evened it; and washed it over with
<hi>Boyled Oyls,</hi> as long as it will drink any
in, and when it is dry, prime it as you do a
Cloth. There is another Way of doing it
too, by applying a Paste or Plaister of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Composition, all over the Wall, then
Washing it over with <hi>Linseed Oyl,</hi> then
putting over that a Mixture of <hi>Pitch,
Mastick,</hi> and <hi>Varnish,</hi> boyled together,
and applyed with a great Brush, till it make
a Couch, fit to receive your priming, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
your <hi>Colours. Vassari</hi> gives

               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>It does not appear by any that have Writ
upon that Subject, that they did; And the
<hi>Moderns</hi> were a great while, before they
found it out. It was <hi>Discovered</hi> by the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of a <hi>Flemish Painter,</hi> called, <hi>John of
Bruges,</hi> who being Vexed at the <hi>Suns</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gluing
some <hi>Pictures</hi> of his made upon
Boards, resolved to find out a <hi>Way</hi> of
Painting upon <hi>Cloth;</hi> which he did <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,</hi>
and was much <hi>Admired</hi> for it, in
so much, that <hi>Antonio de Messina,</hi> a
famous Painter of his Time, came on purpose
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Lived many Years with
<hi>John of Bruges,</hi> to learn the <hi>Secret.</hi>
He afterwards Settled at <hi>Venice,</hi> and
there Taught it several of his Friends;
amongst the rest, to one <hi>Dominico Vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiano,</hi>
who coming to <hi>Florence,</hi> to Paint
the Chappel of the <hi>Portinari,</hi> brought this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43902:35"/>
secret with him; and had for chief Schollar,
<hi>Andrea del Castagno.</hi> It has been the
greatest help to Painting imaginable. For
before, it was hard to carry <hi>Pictures</hi> from
place to place, but now being done upon
<hi>Cloth,</hi> they may be carefully Rolled up,
and carried all the World over.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Pray what is painting in <hi>Chiaro
Scuro?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>It is a manner of Painting that comes
nearer <hi>Design</hi> than <hi>Colouring,</hi> it being
first taken from the Imitation of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
of <hi>Marble,</hi> or of <hi>Bronze,</hi> or other
<hi>Stones,</hi> and it is much used upon the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and Fronts of Great Houses and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
in Stories which seem to be of <hi>Marble,</hi>
or <hi>Porphire,</hi> or any other <hi>Stone</hi> the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thinks fit to Imitate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:43902:35"/>
This Way of <hi>Painting,</hi> which seldom
employs above two <hi>Colours,</hi> may be done in
<hi>Fresco</hi> upon a <hi>Wall,</hi> which is the best
Way; or upon Cloth, and then it is most
commonly employed for <hi>Designs</hi> of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arches,</hi> and in <hi>Decorations</hi>
of the <hi>Stage</hi> for <hi>Plays,</hi> and other such
Entertainments <hi>Vassary,</hi> gives the secret of
doing it either Way.</p>

               <p>I find that by little and little, I shall
penetrate into the secret of this Art, if
sometimes you will be as kind as you
have been now; for what you have
Taught me already, is so clear, and
easie, that I think I shall hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it; but I believe the Hardest is
yet to come. But before I engage any
deeper in this Mystery, I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be <hi>Informed</hi> of the History of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:43902:36"/>
that is, of its Rise, Progress,
Perfection, and Decay, both among
the Antient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and
amongst us <hi>Moderns.</hi>

               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>I confess, they are all ravishing
Entertainments, and infinitely to be
preferr'd before our other sensual
Delights, which destroy our Health,
and dull our Minds; and I hope
they are travelling apace this way.
But now pray satisfie my Curiosity
about this Art of <hi>Painting,</hi> and let me
know its whole History.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>To do that, I should begin with <hi>Adam,</hi>
and so search down all along throughly in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;</hi>
but for want of Guides in such a
<hi>Journey,</hi> I must set forth at some more
known Stage, and that I think must be
<hi>Graece;</hi> though there is great reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had the Art long
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43902:38"/>
before them, as they had most other <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Sciences</hi> since: Most of the great <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
of <hi>Graece</hi> travelled to <hi>Aegypt</hi>
for their <hi>Learning,</hi> witness <hi>Thales, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,
Democritus, Plato,</hi> and many
others; and it is likely that the <hi>Artists</hi>
might do the same: but however the place
where <hi>Painting</hi> first settled, was <hi>Corinth,</hi>
or <hi>Sicyone;</hi> there being some Dispute about
those two Towns, because there happened to be
Eminent Masters at them both much about the
same time, <hi>to wit, Cleanthes</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
and <hi>Telephanes</hi> at <hi>Sicyone;</hi> but the
<hi>Art</hi> in both these places was but in its Infancy;
those <hi>Painters</hi> contenting themselves with
drawing the out lines of one <hi>Colour,</hi> and
shaddowing them within: Some time after,
<hi>Cleophantus</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> Invented Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of <hi>Colouring;</hi> and that same Master
came into <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Demaratus,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43902:38"/>
of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> King of the
<hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Did <hi>Painting</hi> get so early into <hi>Italy?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a Dispute, whether it were not there first;
for there was a <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Ardea,</hi> a City
near <hi>Rome,</hi> on which were <hi>Paintings,</hi>
which were yet to be seen in the Time of the
Emperour <hi>Vespatian;</hi> which <hi>Tradition</hi>
affirm'd to be Antienter than the Foundation
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and by consequence, of an older
Date than the Time of <hi>Tarquinius Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
or his Father; and yet these Paintings
were so fresh and lively, that they seemed to
have been Painted but the other day.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that <hi>Painting</hi> remained with them a
great while in its <hi>Infancy,</hi> since the first
<hi>Painter</hi> of any Note, was above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43902:39"/>
Years after the <hi>Foundation</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that was <hi>Polygrotus</hi> of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
who first begun to draw <hi>Draperies</hi> in
the Women's Pictures, and to dress their
Heads in different Fashions; he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the first that ventured upon <hi>Historical</hi>
Pieces, having Painted the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi>
and the great <hi>Portico</hi> at <hi>Athens;</hi>
which from the Variety of Pictures in it, was
called, the <hi>Various.</hi> Both these Pieces he
did <hi>Gratis;</hi> which gain'd him the Love of
all <hi>Graece</hi> to that degree, that in a Publick
Assembly of the <hi>Amphictions,</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
that where ever he Travell'd all over
<hi>Graece,</hi> his Charges should be born by the
Publick.</p>
               <p>About thirty Years after him came <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodorus</hi>
the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who was Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Beauty and Strength of his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
he was the Master of <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43902:39"/>
carried <hi>Painting</hi> to its highest Perfection,
and acquired to himself great Riches, though
he never sold any of his Pieces, but gave them
all for nothing, saying, That if they were to be
duly valued, whole Kingdoms and Provinces
could not pay for them. He was besides so
Magnificent in his Humour, that being at the
<hi>Olympian Games,</hi> which was the noblest
Assembly of all <hi>Graece;</hi> he wore his Name in
Gold Letters upon his Cloak, that all might
take notice of him. He drew many Pieces,
but his chief was an <hi>Athlete,</hi> or <hi>Champion</hi>
of the <hi>Olympick Games;</hi> with which he
was so satisfied, that he wrote under it these
words;
<q>
                     <l>It may be Envyed,</l>
                     <l>But not Imitated.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His Concurrents in the Art were never the
less great Masters; amongst them were <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43902:40"/>
and <hi>Parrhasius;</hi> and with this last
<hi>Zeuxis</hi> had many Contests, in one of which he
owned himself overdone; for having agreed
each of them to draw something for <hi>Maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Zeuxis</hi> drew <hi>Grapes</hi> so rarely
done, that the <hi>Birds</hi> flew and peck't at them;
and thereupon he bidding <hi>Parrhasius</hi> show
his Piece; was by him presented with a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
with a <hi>Curtain</hi> before it; which <hi>Zeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xis</hi>
going hastily to draw, found that it was
nothing but a Painted One, so well done, that
it had deceiv'd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parrhasius</hi> out did him likewise in <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and boasting of his own Abilities, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
amongst other things, to be descended
from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and to have Conversation with
the <hi>Gods;</hi> saying, that the <hi>Hercules</hi> he
drew at <hi>Lindus,</hi> was the same that us'd to
appear to him in his Dreams; he was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
overcome publickly by <hi>Timantes</hi> at
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43902:40"/>
                  <hi>Samos,</hi> to his great Affliction; his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Character was, <hi>Well Finishing his
Pieces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timantes,</hi> on the contrary, was of a sweet,
modest Temper, and was Admirable in the
Expression of <hi>Passions;</hi> as appear'd by his
Famous Picture of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia;</hi>
where he drew so many different
sorts of <hi>Sorrow</hi> upon the <hi>Faces</hi> of the
<hi>Spectators,</hi> according to the <hi>Concerns</hi>
they had in that <hi>Tragical</hi> Piece of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
that being at last come to Represent
<hi>Agamemnon's</hi> Face, who was Father to
the Virgin, he found himself Exhausted, and
not able to reach the Excess of Grief that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
must have been showed in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon that Occasion; and therefore he
covered his Face with a part of his Garment;
saving thereby the Honour of his <hi>Art,</hi> and yet
giving some Idea of the greatness of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43902:41"/>
Sorrow. His particular Talent lay,
in giving more to understand by his Pictures,
than was really express'd in them; as he
shewed in the Picture of a <hi>Polyphemus</hi>
a sleep, in little; where to Intimate his <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantick</hi>
Proportion, he feigned some <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
who were measuring the bigness of his
<hi>Thumb.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>No, some of them were <hi>Asiaticks;</hi> whence
it came that <hi>Painting</hi> was divided into
two <hi>Schools,</hi> the <hi>Asiatick</hi> and the <hi>Greek;</hi>
and I believe they differ'd as much in their
<hi>Manners</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard
Schools</hi> do at this day: But the
<hi>Greek</hi> was likewise Subdivided into two
<hi>Schools</hi> more, which were called the <hi>Syci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onian</hi>
and the <hi>Attick;</hi> which I suppose,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43902:41"/>
might differ as the <hi>Florentine</hi> and the
<hi>Roman. Eupompus,</hi> who was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary</hi>
to <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> was the Author
of this last Subdivision, and was a very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<hi>Painter;</hi> his Chief <hi>Schollar</hi> was
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> the first of
that Nation who applyed himself to the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Arts;</hi> having studied <hi>Geometry,</hi>
without which, he used to say, no <hi>Painter</hi>
could Excell: He drew the <hi>Victory</hi> of
the <hi>Athenians</hi> at <hi>Phliante,</hi> and several
other Excellent Pieces. He was likewise
the first that taught his Art for a Set Price;
which was, a <hi>Talent</hi> in Ten Years for every
one of his <hi>Schollars.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>There were <hi>Talents</hi> of several <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys,</hi>
and several <hi>Values;</hi> but Authors,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43902:42"/>
when they mention <hi>Talents,</hi> do mean the
<hi>Attick Talent;</hi> and that, according to the

which in Ten Years, was not quite twenty
Pound a Year. But this <hi>Custom</hi> which he
brought up, was of great Improvement to
<hi>Painting;</hi> for after his Example, many

               <p>The <hi>Art</hi> it self was of that high Value
among the <hi>Graecians,</hi> that they thought it
an Imployment fit for none but Ingenious
Minds and free Spirits; and to that end,
<hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Inferiour Persons</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
by the <hi>Laws</hi> to apply themselves to it;
insomuch, that it has been observ'd, that in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43902:42"/>
whole Course of these <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Painting</hi> and
<hi>Statuary,</hi> never any <hi>Slave</hi> was known to
Practise them. But to return to our <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Pamphilus</hi> was the Master of the
Famous <hi>Apelles,</hi> who surpass'd all that ever
went before him, and was outdone by none that
came after him; he flourish'd about the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twelfth <hi>Olympiad;</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
pritty well to the three hundred and
twenty first Year of the <hi>Foundation</hi> of
<hi>Rome;</hi> he Painted <hi>more,</hi> as well as <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
than all his <hi>Contemporaries;</hi> and
<hi>wrote</hi> also divers <hi>Volumes</hi> about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the <hi>Art;</hi> which were of exceeding
Advantage to Posterity: His particular
<hi>Talent</hi> lay in <hi>hidden Graces,</hi> and in a
certain <hi>taking pleasingness,</hi> which result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Whole; valuing himself particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
upon <hi>knowing</hi> when to give over
working upon a <hi>Picture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:43902:43"/>
                  <hi>Protogenes</hi> was his <hi>Contemporary,</hi>
and chief <hi>Concurrent</hi> in the <hi>Art;</hi> he
liv'd in the Island of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> and the
Fame of his Works was such, that it drew
<hi>Apelles</hi> from Home, to go and see the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of them.</p>
               <p>Their first Interview was Remarkable, and
past in this manner: <hi>Apelles</hi> being Landed
at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> went straight to <hi>Protogenes</hi>
his Shop, or Painting-Room; where, finding
none but an <hi>Old Woman,</hi> and a Board
newly Prim'd, and Prepared for Painting, he,
without saying any thing, drew a Line of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Fineness of one <hi>Colour,</hi> and so went
his way: <hi>Protogenes</hi> being come Home, the
<hi>Old Woman</hi> shewed him the Line; which
he guess'd to be <hi>Apelles</hi> his Work; and
taking his Pencil, drew another over that,
finer than <hi>Apelles</hi>'s and of another <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;</hi>
telling the <hi>Old Woman,</hi> that if
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43902:43"/>
the Man came back that drew the first
Line, she should tell him, that he that drew
the second, was the Man he look'd for. In a
little time <hi>Apelles</hi> came, and seeing what
<hi>Protogenes</hi> had done, took the Pencil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and with a Stroke of a third <hi>Colour,</hi>
divided those two Lines so Subtlely, that they
were perfectly distinguishable, and so went his
way. <hi>Protogenes</hi> coming Home a little
after, and seeing what he had done, confess'd
himself Vanquish't; and presently ran to find
out <hi>Apelles,</hi> whom he brought to his own
House. This very Piece, with these three
Lines, and nothing else in it, was afterwards
carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> and long Preserved
among the <hi>Rarities</hi> of the <hi>Imperial
Pallace.</hi>

               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>This was a true Meeting of two

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:43902:44"/>
were equally Eminent, and

               <p>They were both of them well Bred, and us'd
to the Company of Persons of the best Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<hi>Apelles</hi> particularly, had his House al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
full of them: <hi>Alexander the Great</hi>
going often to see him Work, and not disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to enter into Discourse with him. This
Great Prince was so fond of his Works, and
so perswaded of their <hi>Immortality,</hi> that he
Publish't an <hi>Edict,</hi> forbidding any other
<hi>Painter</hi> to attempt the <hi>Drawing</hi> of his
<hi>Picture,</hi> as being desirous that the Idea of
his Person should be transmitted to Posterity
by the most Skilful Hand of his Age: How
much he lov'd <hi>Apelles,</hi> may be guess'd by the
Nobleness of the Present he made him; for
having, by <hi>Alexander's</hi> Command, drawn
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43902:44"/>
the Naked Picture of <hi>Campaspe,</hi> one of
the most <hi>Beautiful Women</hi> of her <hi>Time,</hi>
and <hi>Mistriss</hi> to that Great Prince, could
not defend his Heart against such Charms,
but fell desperately in Love with her; which
<hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving, very Generously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him with the <hi>Lady,</hi> thinking a Picture
of his Hand to be a sufficient Exchange for so
great a <hi>Beauty:</hi> And 'tis to be presumed,
that <hi>Apelles</hi> himself was of no ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
since the <hi>Lady</hi> went willingly to his Bed,
and liv'd with him all his Life in great <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</hi>
'Tis thought, that a famous Piece
of his, call'd, the <hi>Venus Dionaea,</hi> was the
Picture of that <hi>Lady.</hi>

and having besides, so strong an
<hi>Imagination,</hi> as they must have, to excell
in their Art. And <hi>Apelles</hi> did so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take the <hi>Idea</hi> of those he Painted, that
<hi>Physonomists</hi> and <hi>Fortune-Tellers</hi>
have often Practised their Art upon his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
with Success, foretelling what should
befall the Persons for whom they were made;
and to add to the Excellency of his Art, he
had a <hi>Varnish,</hi> the Secret of which dyed
with him, by which, he not only made his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>

               <p>'Tis hard to say; but if we may Judge by
the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> we
must give the Prize to that Famous <hi>Venus</hi>
coming out of the <hi>Sea;</hi> which he <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi>
in the <hi>Temple</hi> of his Father <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi>
and which, from her Action, was call'd

a part of it being spoil'd by <hi>Time,</hi> there was

               <p>A great many; and for ought we know,
might have lasted to our days, if they could
have escaped the Barbarity of those Nations
that Ruined the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> for
there were at <hi>Rome</hi> of his doing, <hi>Castor</hi>

Triumphing with the Image of <hi>War,</hi>
tyed by the Hands to his <hi>Chariot:</hi> and
these were Consecrated in the <hi>Forum</hi> of

               <p>Very little, except at <hi>Athens,</hi> where he
<hi>painted</hi> the <hi>Propyleum,</hi> or <hi>Antiporch</hi>
of the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Minerva:</hi> but his most
famous Piece was his <hi>Jalyssus,</hi> which was
<hi>Consecrated</hi> in the <hi>Temple of Peace</hi>
in <hi>Rome:</hi> 'tis said, he spent Seven Years
about it, and Coloured it over four times,
that it might the better resist the Injuries of

               <p>What was Represented in this
Picture?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>There has been great Dispute about that
in Antiquity, and since; some being of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that therein was Represented the City of
<hi>Jalyssus,</hi> with its <hi>Territory</hi> belonging to
the <hi>Rhodians:</hi> But that seems improbable,
because that <hi>Cicero</hi> always compares the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43902:47"/>
                  <hi>Jalyssus</hi> of <hi>Protogenes</hi> with the <hi>Venus</hi>
of <hi>Apelles;</hi> which would be very improper;
if it were only a <hi>Town:</hi> 'tis therefore more
probable, that it was the Picture of the Hero
<hi>Jalyssus,</hi> Founder of the <hi>Town,</hi> and who
was said to be Son to <hi>Apollo.</hi> Whatsoever
it was, the Piece was so Admired, that it
Sav'd the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> when it was
<hi>Besieg'd</hi> by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who could have
Carried it, if he would have <hi>Fired</hi> a part
of the <hi>Town</hi> where this <hi>Picture</hi> was; but
be chose rather to <hi>Raise</hi> the <hi>Siege,</hi> than to
destroy so fine a thing: Some say, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togenes</hi>
was yet alive, and working in his
<hi>Countrey-House</hi> in the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of
<hi>Rhodes,</hi> which were all Possest by the <hi>Army</hi>
of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> who hearing that he work'd
on quietly, sent to him to know the reason of
so much Security amidst so much Danger:
<hi>Protogenes</hi> made Answer, <hi>That he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43902:47"/>
knew his War was with the</hi> Rhodians,
<hi>and not with the</hi> Arts: Which Answer
so pleased <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that he gave him a
<hi>Guard,</hi> and went often, during the <hi>Siege,</hi>
to see him work. And thus you see, <hi>Art</hi> can
protect its own <hi>Sons</hi> in the midst of the
greatest Dangers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>I think, I have read somewhere,
that <hi>Protogenes</hi> was a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Pictures were understood
by his Countrymen, insomuch that
he was very Poor, and his Works
Sold for little or nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true, and he was beholding to the
<hi>Generosity</hi> of <hi>Apelles</hi> for his <hi>Fortune;</hi>
for he seeing how little he was valued at
Home, bought up a good many of his Pieces;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43902:48"/>
giving out, he intended to sell them again for
his own, and gave him a great Price for them;
which the <hi>Rhodians</hi> hearing, intreated him
to let them have them; which he did, but made
them pay well for them.</p>
               <p>These four, <hi>Zeuxis, Parrhasius, Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
and <hi>Protogenes,</hi> were the four Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Painters</hi> of <hi>Graece,</hi> which has made
me the more particular in speaking of their
Works, they having carried the Art to the
highest pitch it was possible to arrive to.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It remained in great <hi>Perfection</hi> for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Centuries;</hi> these great Masters hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made so many good <hi>Schollars,</hi> and left
such Admirable Precepts for the <hi>Art,</hi> that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43902:48"/>
it was impossible it could be lost for a great
while; nay, some <hi>Improvements</hi> were
made by Succeeding <hi>Masters</hi> in the Art of
<hi>Colouring,</hi> and making their Pictures of
a greater <hi>Relievo</hi> than those Antient <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
did. But it will not be amiss, to name
you succinctly some of the great <hi>Masters</hi>
that were, as it were, of the <hi>School</hi> of these
Antients; as likewise, to mention some of
their Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> then <hi>Pausias</hi> of <hi>Sicione,</hi> was a
<hi>Schollar</hi> of <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> as well as <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
and seems to have been the first that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Paint <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Ceilings;</hi> for
<hi>Apelles</hi> never Painted upon a <hi>Wall,</hi> but
upon a <hi>Board,</hi> or some portable Matter, that
his Works might be less subject to <hi>Fire,</hi> and
other Injuries of <hi>Time:</hi> There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
several good Pieces of this <hi>Master</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
at <hi>Rome; Lucullus</hi> gave two
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43902:49"/>
                  <hi>Talents</hi> for a Piece of his, of a <hi>Young
Woman</hi> making a <hi>Garland</hi> of <hi>Flowers;</hi>
and there was likewise in <hi>Pompey's The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre</hi>
a Piece of his, of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi>
much esteemed. This Town of <hi>Sicione</hi>
Furnished <hi>Rome</hi> with its greatest <hi>Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
for the <hi>Common Town-House</hi>
being run in <hi>Debt,</hi> Pawned their <hi>Pictures;</hi>
which were all, or most of them carried to
<hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Scaurus</hi> the <hi>Edile,</hi> to Adorn
the Magnificent Entertainment he made for
the People in the <hi>Forum Romanum,</hi> dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Magistracy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euphranor</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> was another
Famous <hi>Master,</hi> who lived about the four
hundred and tenth Year of the <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Rome;</hi> he gave a great <hi>Majesty</hi>
to his <hi>Figures,</hi> and was admirable in his
<hi>Proportions;</hi> there was a Piece of his in
the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Representing the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43902:49"/>
Counterfeit Folly of <hi>Ulyssus,</hi> in which he
was Yoaking a <hi>Horse</hi> and an <hi>Ox</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>About the same time was <hi>Cyelias,</hi> whose
<hi>Fame</hi> was such, that long after his Death,
a <hi>Piece</hi> of his, containing the <hi>Story</hi> of the
<hi>Argonantes,</hi> was bought by <hi>Hortensius,</hi>
the <hi>Famous Roman Orator,</hi> Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
with <hi>Cicero;</hi> and he paid <hi>forty four
Talents</hi> for it; which is about <hi>eight
thousand pound Sterling:</hi> He built a
<hi>Chappel</hi> on purpose for this <hi>Picture</hi> in his
<hi>Villa</hi> at <hi>Tusculum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of <hi>Euphranor's</hi> School came <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias,</hi>
who painted <hi>Women</hi> so rarely;
<hi>Rome</hi> was full of his Works, brought from
<hi>Graece:</hi> his most Famous Piece was <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
Hell;</hi> which he painted with such
great Attention, that he would often ask his
Servants, during that Labour, <hi>whether</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:43902:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>he had Din'd, or no?</hi> He was offered
seventy <hi>Talents</hi> by King <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi>
which is above ten thousand <hi>pounds,</hi> for this
Piece; but he chose rather to Honour his own
Countrey with it, and presented it freely to
the Town of <hi>Corinth.</hi> It seems, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
an Admirable <hi>Statuary;</hi> for <hi>Pranite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
being asked, which of all his <hi>Statues</hi> he
valued the most? made answer, those which
<hi>Nicias</hi> finished for him: so great a value he
had for his <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after, there flourished in
<hi>Athens</hi> one <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> a rare <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi>
and most excellent <hi>Painter;</hi> after
that <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> had Conquered <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi>
King of <hi>Macedon;</hi> being in <hi>Athens,</hi>
he desired the <hi>Athenians</hi> to give him some
one of their most Learned Men to Breed up
his Son; and they by one Accord named <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodorus</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:43902:50"/>
for that Employment; with whom

            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>All this while, these are all <hi>Greek</hi>
Masters; had the <hi>Romans</hi> none of
their own?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and very famous Ones; witness that
<hi>Fabius,</hi> who was Sirnamed <hi>Pictor,</hi> of one
of the greatest <hi>Families</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> he
painted the <hi>Templum Salutis</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi>
they had likewise <hi>Paunius,</hi> who was both Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and Painter, and painted the <hi>Temple</hi> of
<hi>Hercules</hi> in the <hi>Forum Boarium. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius,</hi>
a <hi>Roman Knight,</hi> painted many
things at <hi>Verona;</hi> and that which was very
singular, and never practised but by himself,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43902:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was, that he painted with his <hi>Left Hand.
Atterius Labeo,</hi> who had been <hi>Pretor,</hi>
was famous for his Works in this kind. But
to say the truth, the <hi>Romans</hi> being a War-like
Nation, were most taken up that way, and
the great Men amongst them contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with being able to Judge of <hi>Arts,</hi> and
to incourage them by their Riches, which they
profusely layed out in Pieces of Painting and
Statuary: Thus <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> Consecrated
in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> from whom his
<hi>Family</hi> was deriv'd, two Pieces, one an
<hi>Ajax,</hi> another a <hi>Medaea;</hi> both Admirable
Figures. <hi>Augustus</hi> did the same; and
in Imitation of him, all the <hi>Great Men</hi>
purchased the Works of the <hi>Greek</hi> Painters
and Statuaries at any Rate; insomuch that
<hi>Graecia</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> were almost deprived of
all the best <hi>Originals,</hi> which were brought
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there preserved, till several
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43902:51"/>
Accidents of Fire, and the Invasion of <hi>Rome</hi>
by the Barbarous Nations, consumed them;
insomuch that now there are but a few Pieces
of antient <hi>painting</hi> left. But I hope we
need not much regret that loss, when we shall
reflect upon the Admirable Works of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Painters, who have arriv'd to that
<hi>perfection</hi> in the Art, which perhaps would
astonish those <hi>Antient Artists</hi> themselves,
if they could revive and see them.</p>

               <p>From the decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and
the Invasion of the <hi>Goths,</hi> &amp; other Barbarous
Nations, it continued decaying, and was in a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43902:52"/>

Rapines and Murders; the <hi>Zeal</hi> likewise
of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> did not a little

having prevailed at last, the <hi>Bishops</hi>

laboured all they could to extinguish
the very Memory of the <hi>Heathen Gods;</hi>
and therefore threw down all those wonderful
<hi>Statues, Sculptures, Paintings,</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43902:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other Ornaments of their <hi>Temples;</hi> which
they did not out of any hatred they had to
those <hi>Arts,</hi> but out of a <hi>Blind Zeal,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
their <hi>Superstitious Worship;</hi>
by which, they nevertheless so crushed those
<hi>Arts</hi> themselves, that for many hundreds of
Years they lay buryed and neglected.</p>

               <p>There remained in <hi>Graece</hi> some little
footsteps of the Art; and from thence it was,
that about the Year 1250, there came some
<hi>Painters,</hi> who could hardly be called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
having scarce any more knowledge of
the <hi>Art</hi> than just to draw the <hi>Out-lines</hi>
without either <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Proportion;</hi> the
first Schollar they made in <hi>Italy,</hi> was at
<hi>Florence,</hi> and was called <hi>Cimabue;</hi> who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43902:53"/>
being helped by Nature, soon out did his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and began to give some strength to his
Drawings, but still without any great Skill,
as not understanding how to manage his Lights.
and Shadows, or indeed, how to <hi>Design</hi>
truely; it being in those days an unusual
and unattempted thing to Draw after the
<hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His chief Schollar was <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> who was
very Famous for his Time; he freed <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
from that first Stiffness of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Masters, and began to give some Air to the
Heads, and some Softness to the <hi>Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
with better Aptitudes to his <hi>Figures,</hi>
as also, some Loosness in his <hi>Drapery;</hi> nay,
he attempted something of Shortning and
Perspective, though but imperfectly; he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
began to show in his Pieces some effects
of the Passions of the Mind, such as <hi>Fear,
Love, Anger, Pity,</hi> &amp;c. But he still was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43902:53"/>
far from expressing the Liveliness of the Eyes,
the softness of Flesh, and the strength of the
Muscles in Naked <hi>Figures,</hi> as having seen
nothing of that kind to direct him, or help
him in this first beginning of the Art.</p>
               <p>After him <hi>Thaddeo Gaddi</hi> had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a better <hi>Colouring,</hi> and more Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his <hi>Figures. Simon Sanese</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to understand the <hi>Decorum</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:</hi>
and <hi>Stephano Scimmia</hi> with
his Son <hi>Tomaso</hi> added some strength to their
<hi>Drawings,</hi> and perfected themselves in
<hi>Perspective,</hi> but still keeping to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Ghiotto;</hi> which was continued by
<hi>Spinello, Arctino, Jacopo, Casentino,
Antonio, Venitiano, Andrea, Pisano,
Nino,</hi> and several others, who still got
<hi>ground</hi> a little, but could not fall into that
free manner of the <hi>Imitation of Nature</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:43902:54"/>
which <hi>Masaccio</hi> first attained to both in
<hi>Sculpture</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> having quite
layed aside <hi>Ghiotto's</hi> way.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>About two hundred Years; all which time
we may call the <hi>Infancy</hi> of Painting; but
<hi>Masaccio,</hi> by great Study and Application,
having found out the true way of placing his
Figures upon a plain Superficies, with due
Shortnings; which all the other Masters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him had not understood; invented like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
an easier way of drawing the <hi>Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
with loose and natural Foldings; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
attempted Naked Figures, and succeeded
in them better than any before him; but in
<hi>Perspective</hi> he was admirable; there being
yet extant in <hi>Florence</hi> a Piece of his, where
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43902:54"/>
there are Houses drawn in <hi>Perspective,</hi>
with so much Skill, as to show both the <hi>Inside</hi>
and <hi>Outside</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>In his Time <hi>Sculpture</hi> was come to a great
<hi>Improvement,</hi> chiefly by the prodigious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of that great <hi>Architect</hi> and <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
Philippo di Ser Brunelesci;</hi>
as also by his other <hi>Contemporaries,
Donatello, Lorenzo, Ghiberti,</hi> and
several others; who having discovered some
of the best <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
them carefully, had attained to a rare
Boldness in <hi>Design,</hi> and opened the way to
the <hi>Painters</hi> to draw with more Exactness
and Truth, as also, to give more Sweetness to
the Naked Figures of <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
so that with the help of several other
Eminent <hi>Artists,</hi> Painting was come, as it
were, to its <hi>Adolescence</hi> or <hi>Youth,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing being extreamly mended; their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:43902:55"/>
being more Copious and Richer in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments;</hi>
their <hi>Drawings</hi> truer &amp; near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Nature;</hi> their <hi>Colouring</hi> more <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful;</hi>
and in a word, the whole Manner
of Painting being altered from what it was in
the Time of <hi>Ghiotto.</hi>

               <p>Pray, who were the great <hi>Painters</hi>
of this Second AGE, as one may
call it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were many, but chiefly these,</hi> Pietro
della Francia, Lazaro Vasari, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello
da Messina, Andrea del Castag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
Dominico, Ghirlandaio, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,
Botticello, Francesco, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Andrea Mantegna; <hi>and many
others.</hi>

            <sp>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:43902:55"/>
               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>These were all <hi>Florentines,</hi> as I take
it; or at least, bred in the <hi>Florentine</hi>
Schoole: Was there no other place
in <hi>Italy</hi> that produced Artists of the
same kind at that time?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, at <hi>Venice,</hi> and all over <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
there were several Painters of Repute;
at <hi>Venice</hi> particularly, the two <hi>Bellini</hi>
were deservedly Famous; and at <hi>Ferrara,
Lorenza Costa,</hi> and <hi>Hercole Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rese;</hi>
but still Painting kept, as it were, in
its <hi>Youth,</hi> alike in all places; and most of
the Masters then living, thought they had
attained the <hi>Ne plus Ultra;</hi> whereas
they were infinitely short of that Skill which
those of the Third <hi>Age,</hi> or, as I may call it,
the <hi>Virility</hi> or <hi>Manhood</hi> of Painting
did arrive to.</p>

               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, what was wanting in their
Works; for methinks, you have
said already, that they were truely
<hi>Designed,</hi> and finely <hi>Coloured;</hi> that
they understood <hi>Invention,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;</hi>
that they were not Ignorant
in <hi>Perspective,</hi> and the Art of <hi>Shortning</hi>
their Figures: all which are the
hardest things in <hi>Painting.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>There wanted a <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which
their <hi>Successors</hi> gave to their Works; and
particularly, an <hi>Easiness;</hi> which hides the
pains and labour that the <hi>Artist</hi> has been at;
it being with <hi>Painting</hi> as with <hi>Poetry;</hi>
where, the greatest <hi>Art,</hi> is to conceal <hi>Art;</hi>
that is, that the <hi>Spectator</hi> may think that
easie, which cost the Painter infinite Toyl and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43902:56"/>
Labour: They had not likewise, that sweet
Union of their <hi>Colours</hi> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
found out, and first attempted by
<hi>Francia Bolognese,</hi> and <hi>Pietro Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gino;</hi>
and so pleasing it was to the Eye,
that the People came in flocks to stair upon
their Works, thinking it impossible to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but they were soon undeceived by <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo
da Vinci;</hi> whom we must own as
the <hi>Father</hi> of the Third Age of <hi>Painting,</hi>
which we call the <hi>Modern;</hi> and in him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was wanting; for besides strength of
<hi>Design,</hi> and true <hi>Drawing,</hi> he gave bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Rules,</hi> more exact <hi>Measures,</hi> and
was more profound in the Art than any before
him.</p>

               <p>He <hi>flourished about two hundred Years

of the rare Painters that the World has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
which were,</hi> Giorgione di Castel,
Franco, Andrea del Sarto, Raphael
del Urbino, Antonio di Correggio,
H. Parmigiano, Polidoro, Julio Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano,
Perino del Vaga, and Michael

               <p>These are all famous Names, and
known to all those who have ever
heard of <hi>Painting;</hi> therefore, I would
fain be informed more particularly
of their Excellences.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>The best way for that, will be, to read
their <hi>Lives,</hi> done by <hi>Vasari;</hi> but in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43902:57"/>
mean time, to satisfie your Curiosity, I will
say a little of every one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giorgione</hi> was of the School of <hi>Venice,</hi>
and the first that followed the Modern <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
way; for having by chance seen some things
of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> with that new way
of strong Shadows, it pleased him so much, that
he followed it all his Life time, and imitated
it prefectly in all his <hi>Oyl Paintings:</hi> he
drew all after the <hi>Life,</hi> and had an excellent
<hi>Colouring;</hi> by which means he gave a
Spirit to all he did; which had not been seen
in any <hi>Lombard Painter</hi> before him; and
that was his particular Character; he was
as great a <hi>Musitian</hi> as he was a <hi>Painter,</hi>
and played admirably upon the <hi>Lute;</hi> he
dyed Young, having got the <hi>Plague</hi> of his
<hi>Mistress,</hi> who having it upon her, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of his <hi>Embraces;</hi> of which they both
dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:43902:58"/>
                  <hi>Andrea del Sarto</hi> wrought with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Diligence and Care, insomuch that
his Works are highly valued, and his Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was the sweetest in the World, but there
wants Strength and Spirit, which <hi>Andrea</hi>
had not himself, being of a mild timerous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and distrustful of his own Capacity, as
also setting very little Value upon what he did;
which made him live and die Poor and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
not having got in all his life time
much Money, except when he was in <hi>France,</hi>
in the Service of that King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Raphael del Urbin</hi> was the greatest
Painter that ever was; having made himself
a Manner out of the Study of the <hi>Antients</hi>
and the <hi>Moderns,</hi> and taken the best out of
both; he was admirable for the easiness of
<hi>Invention, Richness,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in his
<hi>Composition, Nature</hi> herself was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by his <hi>Colouring,</hi> he was Judicious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43902:58"/>
measure, and proper to his Aptitudes;
in a word, he carried <hi>Painting</hi> in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Perfection, and has been outdone by none:
His particular Talent lay in <hi>Secret Graces,</hi>
as <hi>Apelles</hi>'s did among the <hi>Antients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonio di Correggio,</hi> among the
<hi>Lombards,</hi> was an exquisite Artist; for
without ever having been out of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
he attained to the greatest difficulties
of the Art; never did any Body handle <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
better, nor Paint with a greater <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo;</hi>
but particularly, the <hi>tender Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
he gave his <hi>Naked Figures,</hi> surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
all <hi>Masters</hi> of his Time, and perhaps, all
that ever were; he worked most at <hi>Parma,</hi>
retir'd, and little taken notice of, having a
<hi>great Family,</hi> and working hard to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them: <hi>Painting</hi> ows much to him; and
particularly, the manner of drawing Hair
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43902:59"/>
loose and natural; which no <hi>Painter</hi> before
him had attained to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francesco Muzzuoli,</hi> otherwise called,
<hi>Il Parmigiano,</hi> was one of the rarest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Lombard</hi> Painters; <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Neatness,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> in his <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
were his Character, together with an
art of making <hi>Landskips,</hi> and other <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,</hi>
beyond any of his <hi>Time:</hi> and if
he had not taken a Humour of Studying
<hi>Chymistry,</hi> and seeking the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
Stone,</hi> he would have been, perhaps.
the most excellent Painter of his Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polidoro,</hi> from carrying <hi>Stone</hi> and
<hi>Mortar</hi> in the Pope's <hi>Buildings,</hi> came to
try his <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Designing;</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made an Intimate Friendship with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turino,</hi>
a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who was then work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the new <hi>Lodgings</hi> in <hi>Fresco;</hi> he
followed his study so close, that they two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43902:59"/>
several Frontispeeces, and Outsides
of <hi>Pallaces</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> and their Genius was
so conformable, that their Work seemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the same Hand, though both of them
work'd together upon the same Piece; their
<hi>Invention</hi> was the richest, and <hi>Design</hi> the
easiest that it was possible to see; and to this
day, they are the best <hi>School</hi> for Painters,
they having contributed to the Art as much
as any; they painted most of the best <hi>Roman
Stories</hi> up and down <hi>Rome;</hi> but did them
all with that great Judgment, that to those
who are conversant with the <hi>Customes</hi> and
<hi>Dress</hi> of that <hi>Nation,</hi> all seemed mighty
proper and easie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julio Romano,</hi> was <hi>Raphael's</hi> Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and his Beloved Schollar, none having so
well Imitated him either in <hi>Manner, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
Design,</hi> or <hi>Colouring;</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43902:60"/>
he was besides, pleasant in his Conversation, of
a jovial, merry Humour, and infinitely suiting
with the sweetness of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Temper; no
Body understood <hi>Antiquity</hi> better, for he
had extreamly studied <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Pillar,
where all the <hi>Roman Habits, Engines
of War, Ensigns, Arms,</hi> &amp;c. are rarely
well Represented: He was besides, an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Medallist,</hi> and spent much Money and
Time in that Study: his chief Works are at
<hi>Mantua;</hi> where he liv'd the best part of
his Life, and dyed Rich, and in great Favour
with the Duke of that Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perino del Vaga</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> in
<hi>Raphael</hi>'s Time, and grew excellent by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
his and <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>'s Works;
he was a bold and strong <hi>Designer,</hi> having
understood the <hi>Muscles</hi> in <hi>Naked Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
as well as any of his time; he had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Talent for <hi>Grottesk;</hi> of which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43902:60"/>
kind there are many Pieces of his in <hi>Rome;</hi>
but his chief Works are at <hi>Genova</hi> in the
Pallace of <hi>Principe Doria;</hi> he was a very
universal <hi>Painter</hi> both in <hi>Fresco, Oyl</hi> and
<hi>Distemper,</hi> and first taught the true work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Grottesks</hi> and <hi>Stucco Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Michael Angelo Buonaroti</hi> was the
greatest <hi>Designer</hi> that ever was, having
studied Naked Bodies with great Care; but
he aiming always at showing the most difficult
things of the Art, in the Contorsions of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and Convulsions of the Muscles, Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Painting is
not so agreeable, though much more profound
and difficult than any other; his Manner was
Fierce, and almost Savage, having nothing of
the Graces of <hi>Raphael,</hi> whose Naked Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
are dilicate and tender, and more like
<hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> whereas <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>
doth not distinguish the <hi>Sexes</hi> nor the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43902:61"/>
                  <hi>Ages</hi> so well, but makes all alike Musculous
and Strong; and who sees one Naked Figure
of his doing, may reckon he has seen them all;
his <hi>Colouring</hi> is nothing near so <hi>Natural</hi>
as <hi>Raphael's;</hi> and in a word, for all <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sari</hi>
commends him above the Skies, he was a
better <hi>Sculptor</hi> than a <hi>Painter:</hi> One may
say of <hi>Raphael</hi> and of him, that their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
were opposite, and both great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signers;</hi>
the one endeavouring to show the
Difficulties of the Art, and the other aiming
at Easiness; in which, perhaps, there is as
much Difficulty.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43902:61"/>
Did Painting after their Time
decay? Or, has it since been Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by more Modern Painters? For
all those whom you have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
lived almost two hundred
Years ago.</p>

               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot say, <hi>it has Decayed,</hi> but it has
rather <hi>Improved,</hi> till within these few
Years that it seems to be at a stand; and I
fear, must Decay, both for want of <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,</hi>
and because all things that have
attained their utmost Period, do generally
decline, after they have been at a stand for
some time.</p>

               <p>Pray, who were those that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

               <p>After the Death of <hi>Raphael</hi> and his
<hi>Schollars</hi> (for, as for <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>
he made no <hi>School) Painting</hi> seemed to
be Decaying; and for some Years, there was
hardly a Master of any Repute all over <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
The two best at <hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>Joseph
Arpino</hi> and <hi>Michael Angelo da Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravaggio,</hi>
but both guilty of great Mistakes
in their Art: the first followed purely his
<hi>Fancy,</hi> or rather <hi>Humour,</hi> which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
founded upon <hi>Nature</hi> nor <hi>Art,</hi> but had
for Ground a certain Practical, Fantastical
<hi>Idea</hi> which he had framed to himself. The
other was a pure <hi>Naturalist,</hi> Copying <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
without <hi>distinction</hi> or <hi>discretion;</hi>
he understood little of <hi>Composition</hi> or
<hi>Decorum,</hi> but was an admirable <hi>Colourer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But much about the same time, the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
of <hi>Bologna</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43902:62"/>
two Brothers Painted together the famous Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
of the <hi>Pallazzo Farneze: Hannibal</hi>
the Youngest, was much the greatest <hi>Master;</hi>
though his Eldest Brother <hi>Augustin</hi> was
likewise admirable; they renewed <hi>Raphael</hi>'s
Manner; and <hi>Hannibal</hi> particularly, had
an admirable Genius to make proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
any Manner he saw, as he did by <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reggio,</hi>
both as to his <hi>Colouring, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi>
and <hi>Motions</hi> of the Figures; in
a word, he was a most Accomplish'd <hi>Painter,</hi>
both for <hi>Design, Invention, Compofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Colouring,</hi> and all parts of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
having a Soveraign Genius, which made
him <hi>Master</hi> of a great <hi>School</hi> of the best
Painters <hi>Italy</hi> has had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustin</hi> his Elder Brother was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Painter,</hi> and a rare <hi>Ingraver;</hi>
He far surpassed <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself in
the Accomplishments of the Mind; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43902:63"/>
his knowledge in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and
<hi>Philosophy,</hi> he was an admirable <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
and a very good <hi>Poet</hi> in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
He Founded the <hi>Academy</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
in <hi>Bologna;</hi> in which, besides <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing</hi>
after the <hi>Life,</hi> there was Taught
<hi>Simmetry, Perspective,</hi> the reason of the
disposing the <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Lights, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi>
and <hi>Architecture;</hi> and Discourses
were made upon <hi>Stories</hi> and <hi>Fables,</hi> and
the Manner of Placing them, and the Art of
Colouring them; insomuch that <hi>Painting</hi>
was much Improved by him.</p>
               <p>He left a <hi>Natural Son,</hi> whose Name
was <hi>Anthony,</hi> and who dyed about twenty
four Years Old; 'twas thought he would have
gone beyond <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself, the little that
he has left behind him being of a bolder flight
than any of the <hi>Carraches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:43902:63"/>
                  <hi>Lodovico Carrache,</hi> the <hi>Uncle,</hi> was
he that first Instructed <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and was
an Eminent <hi>Painter,</hi> having studied the
Manner of <hi>Correggio;</hi> he excelled in
<hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Colouring,</hi> and was chiefly
Imitated by <hi>Guido Rheni;</hi> who, though a
<hi>Schollar</hi> of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s, yet thought the
<hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Colouring</hi> of <hi>Lodovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi>
to be preferr'd to <hi>Hannibal's;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Heads of <hi>Guido</hi> are not inferiour
to those of <hi>Raphael</hi> himself.</p>

               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Pray, who were the chief Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of this School of the <hi>Caraches?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>The most Remarkable were <hi>Guido Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
of whom I was speaking, <hi>Sixto Bada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locchi,
Albano, Dominichino, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guido Rheni</hi> acquired both more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43902:64"/>
and Riches than any of the School of
the <hi>Caraches,</hi> there being hardly a Prince
in <hi>Europe</hi> that has not endeavoured to get
some of his Pieces, which he sold at what Rates
he pleased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixto Badalocchi</hi> dyed Young, but was
the best <hi>Designer</hi> of the whole School of
the <hi>Caraches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albano</hi> work'd most in Little, but with
a great Genius, and an admirable Sweetness,
having besides, all the Parts of an Excellent
Painter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dominichino</hi> was one that took much
Pains, and had not that happy Facility which
his other Contemporaries had, but he was very
Profound in all the Parts of Painting; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that bating the inimitable Graces of
<hi>Guido,</hi> he seems to out-do him in every thing
else; and particularly, in greatness of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:43902:64"/>
                  <hi>Cavaliero Lanfranc</hi> was another of
the famous Disciples of <hi>Carache,</hi> and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Rome</hi> several things in Concurrence
with <hi>Guido</hi> and <hi>Domenichino;</hi> he had
a great Fire, and a noble Manner of Design
and Colouring, but not always so Correct as
he should be.</p>
               <p>There was likewise one about the same time,
or a little after, who seems to have been his
own Master, and to have been the Head of a
School; and that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pietro Berettini di Cortona,</hi> who
was a most Accomplished Painter, and a great
Composer, much Facility in his Inventions,
and a particular way of Cloathing his <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
were his distinguishing <hi>Characters;</hi>
but besides, he was Universal; Painting all his
Ornaments himself, and that to a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as well in <hi>Landskip</hi> as in <hi>Fruits,
Flowers, Animals,</hi> &amp;c. His Forms are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43902:65"/>
very Correct, as having studied all the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> better than any Painter
of his Age, there being scarce an Old Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
left Un-Designed by him; his <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
is a little stiff, and that is his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fault.</p>

               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks, all this while, you have
said nothing of some of the most
Famous <hi>Painters</hi> in the World, <hi>to wit,
Titian, Tintoret, Paul Veronese,</hi> and the
<hi>Bassans.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>They are all of the <hi>Lombard School,</hi>
and I designed to treat of them by themselves,
as indeed, they deserve; but in the mean
time, since you have mentioned them, I will
give you a short Character of each of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titian</hi> was the best <hi>Colourer,</hi> perhaps,
that ever was; he <hi>Designed</hi> likewise very
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43902:65"/>
well, but not very exactly; the Airs of his
Heads for Women and Children are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and his <hi>Drapery</hi> loose and noble; his
<hi>Portraits</hi> are all <hi>Master-pieces,</hi> no man
having ever carried <hi>Face-Painting</hi> so far;
the Persons that he has drawn having all the
Life and Spirit as if they were alive; his
<hi>Landskips</hi> are the Truest, best Coloured,
and Strongest that ever were: He was
very Laborious, Copying with his own Hand
all that he did for ten Years; that he might
thereby acquire a Facility: He lived to be a
hundred Years Old within one Year, and
Painted to the last; but what he did at first
and at last, is easily distinguished from his
other Works which he did in his Prime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul Veronese,</hi> Disciple of <hi>Titian,</hi>
Painted with grert Grace, and adorned his
<hi>Figures</hi> with Beautiful <hi>Draperies,</hi> but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43902:66"/>
his <hi>Composition</hi> was gross, and <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
poor, neither did he <hi>Design</hi> Correctly,
his <hi>Colouring</hi> it exquisite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tintoret</hi> had a great Genius; &amp; if he had
had as much Patience as he had Fire and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity,
he would have Excell'd; but he is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in his <hi>Design,</hi> and his <hi>Composition</hi>
and <hi>Ornaments</hi> are mean, his <hi>Colouring</hi>
is very good.</p>
               <p>The two <hi>Bassans</hi> had but a poor Genius,
confined to one Manner, and with little Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety;
but their <hi>Colouring</hi> is Admirable,
and their <hi>Animals</hi> Designed Truely, and
with great <hi>Relievo;</hi> as for other Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they had neither <hi>Invention</hi> nor <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of <hi>Design.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with them, I think, I may shut up
my Account of the <hi>Italian Painters</hi> of any
great Fame.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:43902:66"/>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>Has there been no <hi>Painters</hi> of the
first Rank out of <hi>Italy?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>Few or none, but some there have
been, that had they seen <hi>Italy,</hi> would
certainly have been of the very first Rate;
Others there are too, who having seen that
Countrey, have brought out of it a Manner
and Colouring little Inferiour to the best
Masters there; the first were <hi>Albert
Durer</hi> and <hi>Holbins,</hi> who were both
Profound in the Art; they were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries</hi>
to <hi>Raphael,</hi> and would
have puzzled him if they had lived at
<hi>Rome,</hi> to shake off their <hi>Gothick</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<hi>Raphael</hi> had <hi>Albert Durer</hi> in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43902:67"/>
great Admiration, and used to hang his
Prints in his Chamber, and study them:
Amongst those who have been in <hi>ITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY,</hi>
the two best are <hi>Rubens</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rubens</hi> had a great <hi>Genius,</hi> much
Fire, and yet great Softness; he was
Learned in the Art, but without <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
in <hi>Design;</hi> his <hi>Colouring</hi> is
equal to <hi>Titian's,</hi> whose Works he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Studyed, and like him, followed <hi>Nature</hi>
more than the <hi>Antique;</hi> he has more <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility</hi>
than <hi>Titian,</hi> more <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Profoundness</hi> than <hi>Paul Veronese,</hi>
and more <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Repose</hi> than
<hi>Tintoret:</hi> His Chief Study was upon
these three; out of whom he made
himself a Manner beyond them all; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43902:67"/>
such an one as has not been out-done by
any.</p>
               <p>The best of his Schollars was <hi>Vandike;</hi>
who seems to have best understood his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Rules</hi> and <hi>General Maxims;</hi>
nay, he has even surpassed him in the Dilica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Expressing true <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi>
particularly, in some small <hi>Cabinet
Pieces:</hi> Had he not spent so much time in
<hi>Portraits,</hi> he might have been a great
<hi>History Painter;</hi> though he did not <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
with great <hi>Correction.</hi>

               <p>I Have read with great pleasure
the Lives of most of those <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
whom we discoursed of at our
last Meeting; and that Study has
given me so muuh Insight into the
Art, that I must needs own, that a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43902:69"/>
General Painter, such as <hi>Raphael</hi> and
some others were, is a most extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sort of Man; it being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
he should not only have a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and Spirit infused from above,
but also, that he be fraught with all
the best part of acquired Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
here below; and I do no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
wonder now, that we have so few
of such Transcendent Artists.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>The World here in our <hi>Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi>
has a Notion of <hi>Painters</hi> little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
than of <hi>Joyners</hi> and <hi>Carpenters,</hi> or
any other <hi>Mechanick,</hi> thinking that their
Art is nothing but the daubing a few <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
upon a Cloth, and believing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ought to be expected from them at
best, but the making a like Picture of any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys
Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:43902:69"/>
Which the most Ingenious amongst them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
stop there; and though their <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
would lead them further into the noble
part of <hi>History Painting,</hi> they check it, as
useless to their <hi>Fortune,</hi> since they should
have no Judges of their Abilities, nor any
proportionable Reward of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.
So that till the Gentry of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are better Judges of the Art, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
we should ever have an <hi>Historical
Painter</hi> of our own, nor that any excellent

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>What you say is very true, and
therefore I think it would be a good
work to inform us how we should
Judge of <hi>Paintings,</hi> and distinguish
the Good from the Bad; as also, to
teach us how to know the different
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43902:70"/>
Hands and Manners of those great
Masters already extant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>To do that perfectly, would be a Work of
great length, and perhaps, ingage me in the
Secrets of the Art it self, to such a degree,
as my Discourse would be fit for none but
<hi>Painters</hi> to read; therefore I shall not do
that; but if a few Rules of Common Sense
and Obvious Notions will suffice, as I believe
they will, to make any one a Judge of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
I am content to give you that sort of
Observations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>Pray do, and in as easie Terms as
you can, that I may Communicate

               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>I must then repeat to you what I
told you at our first Meeting; which
is, <hi>That the Art of Painting has three
Parts;</hi> which are, <hi>Design, Colouring,</hi>
and <hi>Invention;</hi> and under this third, is
that which we call <hi>Disposition;</hi> which is
properly the Order in which all the Parts of
the Story are disposed, so as to produce one
effect according to the Design of the <hi>Painter;</hi>
and that is the first Effect which a good
Piece of History is to produce in the <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi>
that is, if it be a Picture of a <hi>joyful
Event,</hi> that all that is in it be <hi>Gay</hi> and
<hi>Smiling,</hi> to the very <hi>Landskips, Houses,
Heavens, Cloaths,</hi> &amp;c. And that all
the <hi>Aptitudes</hi> tend to <hi>Mirth.</hi> The fame,
if the <hi>Story</hi> be <hi>Sad,</hi> or <hi>Solemn;</hi> and so
for the rest. And a Piece that does not do
this at first sight, is most certainly faulty,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43902:71"/>
though it be never so well <hi>Designed,</hi> or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so well <hi>Coloured;</hi> nay, though there be
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> in it; for as a
<hi>Play</hi> that is designed to make me <hi>Laugh,</hi> is
most certainly an ill one if it makes me <hi>Cry.</hi>
So an <hi>Historical Piece</hi> that doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Effect it is designed for, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to an <hi>Excellency,</hi> though it be never
so finely <hi>Painted.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>But as one may be delighted with
the Verses and Composition of an
Ill <hi>Play,</hi> so we may be pleased with
the <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Colouring</hi> of a Picture
that is ill <hi>Disposed.</hi>

               <p>'Tis true, but that is but an Imperfect
Joy, and such an one as reflects more upon the
<hi>Artist,</hi> than if he had made an Attempt to
please us by <hi>Order,</hi> and had failed in his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43902:71"/>
                  <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Colouring.</hi> Such was the
fault of one, who being to draw the <hi>Story</hi> of
<hi>Moses</hi> striking the Rock in the <hi>Desert</hi> to
get Water for the <hi>People of Israel,</hi> made
a <hi>Rock</hi> indeed, and the <hi>People</hi> about it,
but drew the <hi>Landskip</hi> of a Countrey full of
<hi>Pasture,</hi> and <hi>Beautifully Green</hi> and
<hi>Fertile;</hi> not considering that such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
have no need of <hi>Miracles</hi> to produce
Water in them; without which they cannot be
supposed <hi>Fertile:</hi> whereas he should have
drawn a Countrey, as indeed it was, <hi>Burnt
up, Sandy,</hi> and <hi>Barren,</hi> that the <hi>Miracle</hi>
might have been both more necessary and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
and though this <hi>Countrey</hi> were never
so finely done by him, yet that Errour of
<hi>Judgment</hi> made the Piece Intollerable, and
not to be looked upon without Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:43902:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The next thing to be considered in an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical</hi>
Piece, is the Truth of the <hi>Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and the Correction of the <hi>Design,</hi> as
<hi>Painters</hi> call it; that is, whether they have
chosen to imitate <hi>Nature</hi> in her most <hi>Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Part; for though a Painter be the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
of <hi>Nature,</hi> yet he must not take her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously.
as he finds her, but have an <hi>Idea</hi>
of all that is Fine and Beautiful in an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
and choose to Represent that, as the
<hi>Antients</hi> have done so admirably in their
Paintings and Statues: And 'tis in this
part that most of the <hi>Flemish Painters,</hi>
even <hi>Rubens</hi> himself, have miscarryed, by
making an ill Choice of <hi>Nature;</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Beautiful <hi>Natural</hi> is not the
Product of their Countrey, or because they
have not seen the <hi>Antique,</hi> which is the
Correction of <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Art;</hi> for we may
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43902:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
say that the <hi>Antique</hi> is but the best of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
and therefore all that resembles the
<hi>Antique,</hi> will carry that Character along
with it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>I remember, you reckoned it to
me among the Faults of some <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
that they had studied too long
upon the <hi>Statues</hi> of the Antients;
and that they had indeed thereby
acquired the Correction of <hi>Design</hi>
you speak of; but they had by
the same means lost that Vivacity
and Life which is in Nature, and
which is the true Grace of <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true, that a Painter may fall
into that Errour, by giving himself up too
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43902:73"/>
much to the <hi>Antique;</hi> therefore he must
know, that his Profession is not tyed up to that
exact Imitation of it as the <hi>Sculptor</hi>'s is,
who must never depart from that exact Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of Proportion which the <hi>Antients</hi>
have settled in their <hi>Statues;</hi> but <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Figures</hi> must be such as may seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have been Models for the <hi>Antique,</hi>
than drawn from it; and a Painter that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
has studied it at all, will never arrive at
that as <hi>Raphael,</hi> and the best of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>
Painters have done; who seem to have
made no other Use of the <hi>Antique,</hi> than by
that means to choose the most Beautiful of
<hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another Caution to be observed too
in this Choice of <hi>Forms,</hi> which is, to keep a
Judicious Aptitude to the Story; for if the
Painter, for <hi>Example,</hi> is to draw <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:43902:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he must not give him the Softness and
Tenderness he would give to <hi>Ganimedes;</hi>
nay, there is a difference to be made in the
very same Figure at different times: and
<hi>Hercules</hi> himself is to be made more <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bust,</hi>
fighting with <hi>Anteus,</hi> than when he
sits in <hi>Dejanira's</hi> Lap. But above all, the
Painter must observe an equal <hi>Air,</hi> so as not
to make one part <hi>Musculous</hi> and <hi>Strong,</hi>
and the other <hi>Soft</hi> and <hi>Tender.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another thing to be considered like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
upon the viewing of any <hi>Story;</hi> which is,
whether the Painter has used that Variety
which <hi>Nature</hi> her self sets us a Pattern for,
in not having made any one Face exactly like
another, nor hardly any one Shape or Make
of either Man or Woman. Therefore the
Painter must also vary his Heads, his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
his Aptitudes, and in a word, all the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43902:74"/>
Members of the <hi>Humane Body,</hi> or else
his Piece will <hi>Cloy,</hi> and <hi>Satiate</hi> the
<hi>Eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Remainder of what belongs
properly to that part called <hi>Design;</hi> we
must consider if every <hi>Figure</hi> moves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly;
as, if a <hi>Figure</hi> be to strike, whether
the Arm and all the Body show the vigour of
such a Motion; and the same if he is to Run
or Dance; and therein consists one of the
greatest <hi>Masteries</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> and which
requires some Knowledge in <hi>Anatomy,</hi>
that the <hi>Muscles</hi> be rightly express'd. As
for <hi>Shortnings,</hi> they are things of great
Difficulty, and few understand the Beauty of
them; which is, so to cheat the Eye, that a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
that in reality is not a Foot in length,
shall seem to be five or six Foot long; and
this depends upon <hi>Opticks,</hi> and is most in
use in <hi>Ceilings</hi> and <hi>Vaults.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>These are good Observations for
Naked Figures; but few Pieces are
all of that sort, most being Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and they say, that the Effect of
<hi>Draperies</hi> is of great Consequence to
the Piece, and therefore to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with great Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller,</speaker>
               <p>Tis very true, 'tis one of the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
parts of <hi>Painting;</hi> and the best Rule
is, that your <hi>Drapery</hi> be in large <hi>Fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
Noble and Simple, not repeated too
often, but following the Order of the Parts;
and let them be of <hi>Stuffs</hi> and <hi>Silks</hi> that are
commonly worn, of beautiful <hi>Colours,</hi> but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43902:75"/>
sweet, and such as do not trench upon the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi>
too harshly, and by that means they will
be of great Use for the Union of the Whole;
either by reflecting the Light, or giving such
a Fund as is wanting for the other <hi>Colours</hi>
to appear better. They serve also to fill up
any empty place in the Picture.</p>
               <p>There is also a Judicious Choice to be made
of <hi>Draperies,</hi> according to the Quality of
the Persons: <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Grave
People</hi> must have Ample and Long <hi>Robes;
Countrey People</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> must
have Close, Short <hi>Draperies; Young
Maids</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> must have them Light,
Thin, and Tender. They that follow the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
of the <hi>Antients</hi> in <hi>Statues,</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be Stiff, as <hi>Raphael</hi> was at first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that they used little Foldings, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated;
which do best in <hi>Marble</hi> or <hi>Brass.</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43902:75"/>
But Painters who have the Command of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
Lights,</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their <hi>Draperies,</hi> and let them fly as
they please. <hi>Titian, Paul Veronese,
Tintoret, Rubens,</hi> and <hi>Vandike,</hi>
have painted <hi>Drapery</hi> admirably; and
indeed the <hi>Lombard School</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
in that and <hi>Colouring,</hi> as the
<hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Florentine</hi> in <hi>Design</hi> and
<hi>Nudity.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>What is properly the Colouring
of a Piece of Painting?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>It is the Art of employing the <hi>Colours</hi>
proper to the Subject, with a regard to the
<hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> that are incident
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43902:76"/>
to the Story, either according to the Truth
of it, or to the <hi>Painter's Invention:</hi>
and out of the <hi>Management</hi> of
these comes all the <hi>Strength, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo,
and Roundness</hi> that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
have: 'tis hard to give Positive Rules
here, it depending much on <hi>Practice;</hi> but
the most General is, so to manage your <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
Lights,</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> that the
Bodies enlightned may appear by the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of your <hi>Shadows;</hi> which by that
means may make the Eye rest with Pleasure
upon them; and also, that there be an
imperceptible passage from your <hi>Shadows</hi>
to your <hi>Lights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis generally observed likewise to make the
greatest <hi>Light</hi> fall upon the middle of the
Piece, where the principal Figures ought to
be, and to lessen it by degrees towards the
sides till it loose it self. In gentle <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:43902:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
avoid strong <hi>Shadowings</hi>
upon the Naked Members, least the black
that is in them seems to be part of the Flesh.
But above all, there is a thing called by the
<hi>Italians, Il degra demento de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lori;</hi>
which in <hi>English</hi> may be termed,
<hi>The diminishing of Colours:</hi> And it
consists in making an Union and Concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Colours</hi> in the formost part of
your Piece, and those that are behind, so that
they be all of one tenour, and not broke; and
by this means every part corresponds with
another in your <hi>Picture,</hi> and makes up
one Harmony to the Eye.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Face-Painting</hi> alone, it is to
be managed another way, for there you
must do precisely what <hi>Nature</hi> shows
you.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Beautiful Colours</hi>
may be employed, but they must be such
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43902:77"/>
as make not your Piece like a <hi>Picture,</hi>
rather than like <hi>Nature</hi> it self; and
particularly, you must observe to express
the true <hi>Temper</hi> as well as the true
<hi>Phisionomy</hi> of the Persoms that are
Drawn; for it would be very absurd to
give a Smiling, Airy <hi>Countenance</hi>
to a <hi>Melancholly Person;</hi> or, to
make a <hi>Young, Lively Woman,
Heavy</hi> and <hi>Grave.</hi> 'Tis said of <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
that he expressed the <hi>Countenance</hi>
and true <hi>Air</hi> of the Persons he Drew,
to so great a degree, that several <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionomists</hi>
did predict Events upon his
Pictures to the Persons Drawn by him,
and that with true Success. If after
that, you can give your <hi>Picture</hi> a great
Relievo, and make your <hi>Colours</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the true <hi>Vivacity</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:43902:77"/>
you have done your Work as to that part
of Painting, which is no small one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
next to <hi>History,</hi> the most difficult
to obtain; for though there be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Invention</hi> required, yet 'tis neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to have a <hi>Solid Judgment</hi>
and <hi>Lively Fancy.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, what is properly <hi>Invention</hi>
in a Picture?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Traveller.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Invention</hi> is the Manner of Expressing
that <hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>Story</hi> which the Painter
has chosen for the Subject of his Piece; and
may principally be divided into <hi>Order</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:43902:78"/>
and <hi>Decorum.</hi> By the first, the
Painter places the parts of his <hi>Subject</hi>
properly, so as the Spectator may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the thing did not happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than as it is there Represented;
and so as the whole Content of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
though it imbrace never so many
<hi>Figures,</hi> make but one <hi>BODY,
Agreeing</hi> with its self in all its
Parts.</p>
               <p>For Example: Suppose a Painter
to Represent the <hi>Story</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi>
gathering <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Desart;</hi>
he must so order it, that the Persons
employed in the Piece do all do the same
thing, though in different Aptitudes; and
there must appear in their <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
the same Joy and Desire of this
<hi>Heavenly Food;</hi> and besides, he must
Represent a <hi>Countrey</hi> proper, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43902:78"/>
give his <hi>Figures</hi> their <hi>Draperies</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
of the <hi>Nation</hi> he Represents:
all this <hi>Raphael</hi> has done in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Story:</hi> and indeed, that part of
<hi>Invention was so great in him,</hi>
that he seldom <hi>Designed</hi> a <hi>Story</hi> in
his first <hi>SCHIZZOS,</hi> that he did
not do it four or five several ways, to choose
at last the best. But to do this, a
Painter, besides a <hi>Fanciful, Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Genius</hi> of his own, must help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by reading both <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and Conversing with <hi>Poets</hi> and
Men of <hi>Learning;</hi> but above all, the
Painter must have a care that he pitch
not upon such an <hi>Invention</hi> as is beyond
his Forces to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:43902:79"/>
Some <hi>Observations</hi> there are about
the Number of <hi>Figures</hi> fit to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in an <hi>Historical Piece. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal
Carrache</hi> was of Opinion, that
a Piece that contained above twelve <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
could never be free from <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
and the Reason that he used to
give, was; first, <hi>That he thought
that no Piece could be well with
more than three great</hi> Gruppos, <hi>or</hi>
Knots <hi>of Figures:</hi> And Secondly,
<hi>That that Silence and Majesty
which is necessary in</hi> Painting, <hi>is
lost in that Multitude and Croud
of Figures.</hi> But if your <hi>Subject</hi> be
such as constrains you to a Multitude,
such as the Representation of a Battle, or
of the Last Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> then you
are likewise dispensed from that great
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43902:79"/>
Care of Finishing; but must chiefly study
<hi>Union,</hi> and the disposing of your
<hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Shadows.</hi> The Painter
must also take Care, that his <hi>Scene</hi> be
known by his Piece at first view, by some
Ingenious <hi>Invention</hi> to express the
<hi>Countrey:</hi> Such wos that of <hi>Nealces</hi>
a <hi>Greek Painter,</hi> who having Drawn
a <hi>Sea-Fight</hi> between the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
and the <hi>Persians;</hi> to express, that the
<hi>Action</hi> happened at the Mouth of the
<hi>Nile,</hi> made an <hi>Ass</hi> drinking by the side
of the River, and a <hi>Crocodile</hi> ready
to devour him; that being the proper <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
of that River.</p>
               <p>The second part of <hi>Invention</hi> is
<hi>Decorum;</hi> that is, that there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Absurd nor Discordant in the
Piece: and in this part, the <hi>Lombard</hi>
Painters are very faulty; taking Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43902:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that move one almost to <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
Witness <hi>Titian</hi> himself, who Drew
Saint <hi>Margaret</hi> a Stride upon the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon:</hi>
and most of the <hi>Lombard</hi> Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are subject to a certain Absurdity
of <hi>Anachronisaie's</hi> Drawing. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
our Saviour upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> and
Saint <hi>Francis</hi> and Saint <hi>Benedict</hi>
looking on, though they did not live till
eight hundred Years after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
<hi>Passion.</hi> All Indecencies are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be avoided: and <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>
doth justly deserve to be Censured,
in his great <hi>Picture</hi> of the <hi>Day of
Judgment,</hi> for having exposed to view
in the Church it self, the secret parts
of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> and made Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
among the <hi>Blessed</hi> that kiss one
another most tenderly. <hi>Raphael</hi> on the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43902:80"/>
contrary, was so great an Observer of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi>
that though his Subject led
him to any Liberties of that kind, he
would find a way to keep to the Rules of
<hi>Modesty:</hi> and indeed, he seems to
have been Inspired for the Heads of his
<hi>Madonna's</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to imagine more Noble <hi>Physio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies</hi>
than he gives them; and withal,
on Air of Pudour and Sanctity that strikes
the Spectator with Respect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Friend,</speaker>
               <p>This puts me in mind of the
moving part of Painting; which
is, the stirring of the Affections
of the Spectator by the Expression
of the Passions in the Piece; and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43902:81"/>
methinks this might well be called
a part of Painting.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>It is Comprehended under that of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;</hi>
and is indeed the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
part of it, as depending intirely
upon the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of the
<hi>Painter,</hi> who can express things no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than as he conceives them; and
from thence come the different Manners;
or, as one may call them, <hi>Stiles of
Painting;</hi> some <hi>Soft</hi> and <hi>Pleasing,</hi>
others <hi>Terrible</hi> and <hi>Fierce,</hi> others
<hi>Majestick,</hi> others <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Humble,</hi>
as we see in the <hi>STILE</hi> of PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETS;

were generally of two or three

he had a <hi>Talent</hi> for Expressing the

            <head>The LIFE of
CIMABUE:
A Florentin Painter.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT Deluge of Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which, for divers
hundreds of Years, had
overwhelm'd <hi>Italy,</hi> had
not only ruin'd all the
publick Fabricks and the
product of the Industry
of the Antients, but likewise so extinguished
the Arts themselves that there was not an
Artificer in any kind left: when it pleased
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43902:85"/>
God that about the year 1240, there was Born
in <hi>Florence, Jean Cimabue</hi> who first Revived the
Art of Painting.</p>
            <p>He was of the Family of the <hi>CIMABVE,</hi>
in those dayes reputed Noble; and being a
promising Child, his Father sent him to
Schoole to the Monestry of <hi>Sancta Maria No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vella,</hi>
where one of his Relations was profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of Grammer to the Novices of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
But he instead of minding his Book,
used to spend all his time in Drawing of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of Men, or Horses, or the like, upon
Paper, or the backside of his Books: Following
thus the powerful dictates of Nature, which
design'd him for another Profession, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time, those who Governed in <hi>Florence,</hi>
invited some Painters out of <hi>Greece,</hi> that the
Art of Painting which was totally Lost,
might be Restored among the <hi>Italians;</hi> and
the first work they undertook, was the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of the <hi>Gondi</hi> in <hi>Sancta Maria Novella,</hi> which
they Painted; the Front and Vault of it is
now so Ruin'd by time, that the Work is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43902:85"/>
hardly to be discerned. Here <hi>Cimabue</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his secret Inclination, used to get from
School and pass all day with those Painters,
to see them work. So that at last, his
Father perceiving how fond he was of that
Art, agreed with the <hi>Greek</hi> Painters to take
him to their Care, they judging that he was
very likely to succeed in the Profession. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in a short time he was so help'd by
Nature, that he surpassed his Masters, both
in Design and Colouring; for they not at all
attentive to Improve their Art, had conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves with a plain flat manner; as
we may see in those of their Works that have
been preserved to our time; but <hi>Cimabue</hi>
though he imitated them, yet he had a much
freer way, as appears by his Works that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
The chief of which are the back of
the great Altar in <hi>Santa Cecilia,</hi> and in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta
Croce a Madonna,</hi> which is yet fastned to
a Pillar on the right hand of the Quire: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he drew a Saint <hi>Francis</hi> upon a
Field of Gold; and which was new in those
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43902:86"/>
days, he drew the Figure after the Life as
well as he could, and round about in the
Borders all the Story of his Life in twenty
Squares, full of little Figures, all upon a Field
of Gold.</p>
            <p>After this, having undertaken a great Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
for the Monks of the Order of <hi>Val-Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosa,</hi>
in the Abby of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Florence,</hi> he
shewed in that Work much more Diligence
and Invention, and particularly in the Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a <hi>Madonna,</hi> with her Son in her
Arms, adorned by a number of Angels round
about, the whole upon a Field of Gold; which
Piece was by the Monks, placed upon the great
Altar of the said Church, from whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in process of time taken away to make
room for one of <hi>Alisso Baldovinetti,</hi> it was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in one of the Chappels on the left side of
the Church.</p>
            <p>After this, Working in <hi>Fresco</hi> at the Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of the <hi>Porcellana,</hi> in the middle of the great
Gate, he Drew on one side, the Figure of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43902:86"/>
the other our Saviour, with <hi>Cleophas</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
all of them whole lengths; and in the
Cloathing he shewed much more freedom and
strength than had yet been seen, leaving the
old Fashioned way, which was full of Lines
and Porfils, and giving a softness not before
known; for this hard flat manner, was all
that at first those Painters had attained to, and
that not by any Rules or Science, but by a
certain Tradition, with which they contented
themselves, leaving it to one another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever dreaming of mending their way of
Designing, or that of their Colouring, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their Pieces with any sort of Invention.</p>
            <p>By this time the Fame of <hi>Cimabue</hi> began to
be so spread, that he was sent for to many
Remote places, and amongst the rest to <hi>Ascesi,</hi>
a City of <hi>Vmbria,</hi> and the place of the Birth
of Saint <hi>Francis;</hi> there in the lower Church
in company of some of those <hi>Greek</hi> Painters,
he Painted some of the Ceiling and the sides
of the Church, with the Stories of the Lives
of our Saviour and Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> in all which
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43902:87"/>
he so far outdid the <hi>Greeks</hi> his Concurrents,
that taking courage he resolv'd to Paint by
himself, and undertook the upper Church in
<hi>Fresco:</hi> There over the Quire, he Painted in
four places divers Stories of our Lady, that
is her Death, when her Soul is carried by
Christ into Heaven upon a Throne of Clouds,
and when in the middle of a Quire of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
he puts the Crown upon her Head,
there being at her Feet great numbers of
Saints of both Sexes; all which now are almost
consum'd by Time. Then in the Five Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Vault, or Ceiling, he Painted
likewise many Stories.</p>
            <p>In the first over the Quire, he Drew the
four Evangelists bigger than the Life, and
that so well, that even to this day, the Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
do acknowledg a good Manner in them;
the freshness of the colouring of the Flesh,
shewing still how much Painting was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Cimabue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:43902:87"/>
The second Partition, he filled with Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Stars, upon a Field of Azure Ultra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine.</p>
            <p>In the third, He made in every Square, a
Round, and in that a Figure, which were in
all four, to wit, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi>
Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and Saint <hi>Francis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth, He filled with Stars, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>And in the fifth, He Painted the four
Doctors of the Church, and by each of them,
one of the first Founders of the Monastical
Orders; a Work certainly, that required
great Pains and Diligence.</p>
            <p>Having finished the Ceilings, he Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the left side of the Church with six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Stories; Eight out of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Eight out of the New. Then
over against them, again he Drew sixteen
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43902:88"/>
Stories more, which were the chief Actions
of our Saviour, and of the Blessed Virgin,
ending with the Assumption of our Lady,
and the coming down of the Holy Ghost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Apostles. All which works besides, that
they were of so great an Extent, were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
well Disposed, and with Judgment
and Invention carried on; so that without
doubt, they must raise a great Admiration
in the Men of those Times, who had never
seen any thing like them, and even in me,
who saw them in the Year 1563, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Two Hundred Years after they were
made. They produced that Effect, that I
could not but wonder, how <hi>Cimabue,</hi> in so
much Obscurity of the Art, had been able
to see so clear. Having finished these, he
began to Paint the remainder of the Church,
from the Windows downwards, but being
called away to <hi>Florence,</hi> about some private
Concerns, they were afterwards Finished by
<hi>Ghiotto.</hi> One Observation I cannot omit,
which is, That of all these Paintings, those
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43902:88"/>
that have best preserved themselves are those
of the Vaults and Ceilings, as being least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
by the Dust, and other Accidents.</p>
            <p>Being come back to <hi>Florence,</hi> he Painted for
the Church of <hi>Sancta Maria Novella,</hi> where he
first went to School, a great piece of our Lady,
which is still to be seen between the Chappel
of the <hi>Rucillai,</hi> and that of the <hi>Bardi di Vernia,</hi>
and was the biggest Picture that had yet been
seen in those days. One may perceive by the
Angels that are drawn in it, that he had still
the <hi>Greek</hi> way of his first Masters, though
bettered, and endeavouring at the Modern
way of Painting. It produced nevertheless,
so much Wonder, in the people of those
Times, that it was carried from <hi>Cimabues</hi>
House to the Church with Trumpets before
it, and in a solemn Procession, and he was
highly Rewarded and Honoured by the City
for it. There is a Tradition, that while <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabue</hi>
was doing this Piece in a Garden, he had
near the Gate of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>Charles of
Anjou King of Naples,</hi> came through <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:43902:89"/>
where being Received with all possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of Honour, amongst other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
the Magistrates carried him to
see this Piece; and because no Body had yet
seen it, all the Gentry of <hi>Florence,</hi> both Men
and Ladies, waited upon him thither, with
so much extraordinary Joy and Feasting, that
the people changed the Name of the place,
and called it <hi>Borgo Allegry,</hi> as much as to say,
the <hi>Merry Suburb;</hi> which Name it has retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this day, though it has since been enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the City.</p>
            <p>There are some Works of his likewise in
<hi>Pisa,</hi> and amongst the rest one in the Cloyster
of <hi>Sancta Francesco,</hi> near the Church Door in
a corner. Tis a Story of our Saviour upon
the Cross, with some Angels round about
him, who seem to carry certain Words with
their Hands to the eare of a <hi>Madonna,</hi> who is
all in Tears on one side, and to Saint <hi>John</hi> the
Evangelist on the other side; the words to the
Virgin are these, <hi>Mulier Ecce filius tuus:</hi> And
to Saint <hi>John, Ecce Mater tua.</hi> And then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43902:89"/>
Angel holds in his Hands these other
Words, <hi>Ex illa hora accepit eam Discipulus in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi>
In all which we may observe, That <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabue</hi>
begun to open the way to Invention by
the means of Words, which though they
were but a poor contrivance, yet they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that his Fancy was stirring and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to express its self.</p>
            <p>Having thus by means of his Works acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to himself great Fame, and a good Estate,
he was at last joyned in company with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolfo
Lapi,</hi> a Man in those days famons for
Architecture. In the Fabrick of <hi>Sancta
Maria del. Fior in Florence,</hi> in which Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being arrived to the Age of Sixty
Years, he Died in the Year 1300. having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitated
Painting as it were from the Dead.
He left many Disciples, and amongst the rest,
<hi>Ghiotto,</hi> who proved an Excellent Master, and
Lived in the same House that his Master
<hi>Cimabue</hi> had done in the <hi>Strada Dellocomero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cimabue</hi> was Buried in <hi>Sancta Maria del
Fiore.</hi> And we may say, That if he had not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43902:90"/>
been followed so close, and so much Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by his Schollar <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> his Fame would
have been much greater; as appears by these
Verses of <hi>Dante:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Credette <hi>Simabue</hi> nella Pittura,</l>
                  <l>Tener lo campo e hora ha <hi>Ghiotto</hi> il Grido,</l>
                  <l>Si che la Fama di colui oscura.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cimabue</hi> his Picture is yet to be seen, done
by the Hand of <hi>Simon Sanese,</hi> in the Chappel
house of <hi>Sancta Maria Novella,</hi> made in <hi>Porfil,</hi> in
the History of Faith; in a Figure which
has a Lean Face, a little Red Beard, in point
with a <hi>Capuche,</hi> or <hi>Monks Hood,</hi> upon his
Head, after the fashion of those Times:
And the Figure next to him, is <hi>Simon Senese</hi>
himself, who Drew his own Picture by the
means of two Looking Glasses.</p>
            <p>I have nothing more to say of <hi>Cimabue,</hi> but
only that in a little Book of Designs, where
I have some of all the Masters, since his time.
I have likewise two or three little Things of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43902:90"/>
his in Red Minium, by which, though now
a-days they may appear somewhat stiff, yet
one may perceive by them, how much Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was beholden to him.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of
GHIOTTO
A
FLORENTINE:
Both Painter, Sculptor, and Architect.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GHIOTTO</hi> was Born in the Year
1276. within Fourteen Miles of the
City of <hi>Florence,</hi> in the little Village
of <hi>Vespignano,</hi> his Father's name was <hi>Bondone,</hi>
a plain Country Man. When he was about
Ten years Old, his Father used to send him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43902:91"/>
out to keep Sheep, and while they were
Feeding, he used to Draw something or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the Sand: Finding in himself a
strong Inclination for Design, one day <hi>Cima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue,</hi>
going for some Occasions of his own,
from <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Vespignano,</hi> found <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> who
while his Sheep were Feeding, was drawing
one of them after the Life, upon a plain flat
Stone, with another Stone, somewhat sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at both ends; having never Learned the
way of doing it from any, but from Nature.
<hi>Cimabue</hi> astonished, stood still, and having
considered the Child and his Work, he ask'd
him, If he would go and Live with him at
<hi>Florence?</hi> To which the Child answered, That
if his Father was willing, he would go with
all his heart. Whereupon he went to <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi>
his Father, who was easily persuaded to
give him <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> as thinking it a preferment
for the Child; so <hi>Cimabue</hi> took him along
with him to <hi>Florence,</hi> there being well Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>Cimabue,</hi> and helped by Nature. He
had not long applied himself to Designing,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43902:91"/>
but he quite put down that old flat <hi>Greek</hi>
way, and becoming a strong Imitator of
Nature, began to revive that which has been
since called the Modern Way of Painting:
For he used often to draw Men and Women
by the Life; a thing that had not been Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in Two hundred Years before, or at
least, not with that Success and Skill that
<hi>Ghiotto</hi> had; as appears by some Things of
that kind, which we have preserved to this
day. Amongst the rest, he Drew <hi>Dante Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghieri,</hi>
the famous Poet of those Times, and
his Intimate Friend, as may be seen in that
Chappel of the Palace of the <hi>Podesta</hi> of <hi>Florence:</hi>
In the same Chappel, is likewise the Picture
of <hi>Ser Brunetto Latini, Dantes</hi> Master, and of
M. <hi>Coriso Donati,</hi> a noble Citizen, and of
great Renown in those Times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s first publick Works, were in the
Chappel of the High Altar. In the Abby at
<hi>Florence,</hi> in which he did many good things,
but particularly, an Annunciation of our
Lady, by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> in which the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43902:92"/>
Fear and Surprise of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
she being so frighted, that she is
ready almost to run away. The Picture of the
great Altar, is likewise of <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s hand, and
is preserved there, for the respect they bear
to the Memory of so great a Man. In <hi>Sancta
Croce,</hi> there are likewise four Chappels, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him; three between the <hi>Sacristy,</hi> and the
great Chappel, and one on the other side over
against: The first is the Chappel of M. <hi>Ridolpho
de Bardi,</hi> which is that where the Bell-ropes
are, and the Life of Saint <hi>Francis;</hi> at whose
death, many of his Moncks seem to express
very much Grief. In the other Chappel,
which belongs to the <hi>Beruzzi,</hi> there are two
Stories of the Life of Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to
whom the Chappel is dedicated; and in them
the dancing of <hi>Herodias,</hi> with all the other
<hi>Apparatus</hi> of a great Feast, which is very well
and lively designed: As likewise two other
Stories of Saint <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> are Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable;
to wit, that where he Resuscitates
<hi>Drusiana,</hi> and when he is himself, carried up
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43902:92"/>
to Heaven. In the third Chappel, which
belongs to the Family of the <hi>Giugni,</hi> and is
likewise called, <hi>The Chappel of the Apostles;</hi> he
has Painted many Stories of their Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And in the fourth, which is on the
other side of the Church, towards the <hi>North,</hi>
which belongs to the <hi>Tolinghi,</hi> and the <hi>Spinelli,</hi>
and is Dedicated to our Lady; he painted
the Story of her Birth, her Marriage to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
the Annunciation, the Adoration of
the <hi>Magi,</hi> and when our Lady offers her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Son to <hi>Simeon;</hi> which is one of the finest
Things in the whole Work. For besides the
great Affection with which the Old Man
seems to receive our Saviour, the Action of
the Child is admirable; for being half afraid,
he turns to his Mother, and takes her about
the Neck, as Children use to do, at the sight
of any new Object that frights them.</p>
            <p>In the Chappel of the <hi>Baroncelli,</hi> in the
same Church, there is a piece in Distemper,
of the Hand of <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> where the Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Lady in Heaven, is expressed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43902:93"/>
with infinite Labour, there being a very
great number of several Figures, and a
Choire of Angels and Saints, most Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
done; and because that in this Piece,
he has written his Name and the Year, in
Letters of Gold. All Artists must needs have
<hi>Ghiotto</hi> in the highest esteem, considering the
Beginnings he gave so long ago, to true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing,
and good Colouring. In the same
Church of <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> are many other of
his Works, and in the <hi>Refectory Sacristy,</hi> and
other places.</p>
            <p>He Worked likewise in the Church <hi>Del
Carmine,</hi> in the Chappel of Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi>
the whole Life of that Saint divided in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
pieces. In the Pallace of the <hi>Guelfes
Party</hi> in <hi>Florence,</hi> there is likewise of his
Hand, a History of Faith in <hi>Fresco,</hi> most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
well Painted; and in it amongst the
rest, is the Picture of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi>
who created the Magistrates of the <hi>Guelfe
Party,</hi> giving them his own Coat of Arms,
which they keep to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:43902:93"/>
Having done these things in <hi>Florence,</hi> he
was Invited to <hi>Astisa,</hi> a City in <hi>Vmbria,</hi> where
<hi>Cimabue</hi> had Painted before, by the then Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>Franciscans, Fra. Gioranni Di Muro
della Marca;</hi> there he undertook the upper
Church, and painted in it Sixteen Stories, of
the Life and Gests of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> of each
side of the Church; and to say truth, in this
Work, he acquired great Fame: For there
is in it great Variety, not only of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
and Aptitudes of the Figures, but
likewise in the whole Composition; in which
he has showed himself a great Observer of
Nature, as well as of the Dress and Customs
of those Times. And among the rest, there
is a Story, where one being very Thirsty, in
whose Looks, the longing for Water shows
it self, drinks stooping at a Fountain, with
wonderful Affection, in so much that one
would think it were a Live Figure. And
indeed, in this whole Work, <hi>Ghiotto</hi> followed
Nature so close, that he deserves to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Nature's Disciple; for the great Order,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43902:94"/>
Proportion, and Facility, that he has showed
in it all along.</p>
            <p>He painted likewise in the Church below,
many things of the Life and Glorification of
Saint <hi>Francis;</hi> in all which he showed great
Variety of Invention, and amongst other
things, drew his own Picture, rarely well,
in one of those Stories: And over the Door
of the <hi>Sacristy,</hi> is a Saint <hi>Francis</hi> in <hi>Fresco,</hi>
who recieves the Stigmats upon his Knees,
which is so Devout, and full of Affection, that
I take it to be the best thing that <hi>Ghiotto</hi> ever
did.</p>
            <p>Having finished his Painting at <hi>Astisa,</hi> he
returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> where as soon as he was
Arrived; he undertook a piece to send to
<hi>Pisa;</hi> it was the Story of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> in
that horrible Desert of <hi>Vernia,</hi> where besides
the Landskip of Rocks and Trees, proper
to that place; the Saint himself was placed
in that Rapture, of receiving the Stigmats,
and in it showed a most fervent desire of
them, and a most zealous Love towards our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43902:94"/>
Saviour, who appears in the Air, environed
with Angels; and in the lower part of the
Piece, are three Stories of the same Saints
Life most admirable! This Picture, which to
this day, is kept with great Veneration, in
the Church Saint <hi>Francisco di Pisa,</hi> upon a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laster
near the great Altar: Was the occasion
that the <hi>Pisans,</hi> having finished their Fabrick
of the <hi>Campo Sancto,</hi> according to the design of
<hi>Giovanni di Nicola,</hi> one of their own Citizens,
sent for <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> to Paint one part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of it; That as on the Outside, it
it was adorned with Marble and Sculpture,
performed with great Expence; covered with
Lead on the Top, and within full of Statues
and Tombs of the Antient, brought from
many parts of the World, so that it might
be Adorned with the best Modern Painting
on the Inside, by the best Painter then Extant.
<hi>Ghiotto</hi> therefore painted on one of the sides
within, six Stories of the Life of <hi>Job</hi> in <hi>Fresco;</hi>
and because he considered, that on that side
where he was to Work, the Sea Wind did
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43902:95"/>
chiefly blow, which being moist, was apt
to make the Marble sweat, as it does in most
of the Houses in <hi>Pisa,</hi> which being mingled
with a Salt, that comes out of the Stones, was
apt to eat up the Colours: He caused a Coat
of Lime plaister and beaten Brick, mingled
together, to be laid on pettry thick every
where, where he was to Work; and by that
means he has so well obtained his end, that
the Pictures he made there, are preserved to
this day, and might have been much better
kept, if the negligence of those who should
have taken care of them, had not let the wet
come to them in some places, which has made
them scale and look black: Besides, that it is
the nature of Plaister, when mingled with
Quicklime, to mould and grow moist with
time, and by consequence, must of necessity
spoil the Colours, though at first it seems to
take well with them.</p>
            <p>In those Stories of his, besides the Picture
M. <hi>Farinata de Gliuberti,</hi> there are many very
fine Figures: As particularly, Some Country
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43902:95"/>
people, who bring <hi>Job</hi> the ill news of the loss
of some of his Flocks, and have the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Men truly Afflicted for so great a
Calamity: Likewise, there is the Figure of
a Servant, who stands by <hi>Job,</hi> as he is all full
of Sores, and is forsaken by every one, with
a Fan in his Hand, to give him the comfort
of a cool Air, and drive away the Flies from
his Sores, while with the other Hand he
stops his Nose because of the stench. This
Figure has a marvellous Aptitude in all its
parts; and indeed, all the Figures of these
Stories, both Men and Women, have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Heads, and the Drapery is wrought with
great Beauty and Softness.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder therefore, if this Work
spread his Fame far and near, in so much
that <hi>Pope Benedict</hi> the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> of <hi>Trevisi,</hi> sent into
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> a Gentleman of his Court, to see
what sort of Man <hi>Ghiotto</hi> was, and to give
him an account of his Painting, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to Employ him in Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church
at <hi>Rome.</hi> This Gentleman having staid some
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43902:96"/>
time at <hi>Sienna,</hi> and there informed himself
what Excellent Masters there were at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
in Painting and Musick, came at last
to <hi>Florence;</hi> and going streight to <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s
House, he found him at Work in his Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rome. Having told him the <hi>Popes</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and how he designed to Employ
him: He desired of him, to send some piece
of Design by him to his Holiness. <hi>Ghiotto,</hi>
who was a pleasant ready Man, took a sheet
of White-paper, and setting his Arm close
to his Hip, to keep it steady, he with one
stroke of a Red-lead Pencil, drew a Circle so
round, and so equal, that it was wonderful
to see it: Then presenting it to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he told him smiling, That there was
a piece of Design, which he might carry to
his Holiness. Says the Courtier, half angry,
Shall I have nothing but this to show the
<hi>Pope?</hi> That's more than enough, said <hi>Ghiotto,</hi>
put it among the other Designs you have
from other Painters, and see whether it will
not make it self known. The Gentleman
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43902:96"/>
seeing he could get nothing else from him,
left him in discontent, being half afraid he
had put a Jear upon him, and that he should
be Laughed at, at his return to <hi>Rome.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
being come, and showing the <hi>Pope</hi> all
the other Designs, he shewed this also of
<hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s, telling the <hi>Pope</hi> how he had done it
without Compasses, or so much as stirring
his Arm from his Side. The <hi>Pope,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
something of the Art, easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by this, how much <hi>Ghiotto</hi> in
strength of Design, did Excel all the other
Painters of his Time; he therefore sent for him
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there being extreamly satisfied
with his Skill, he made him Paint Five Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Life of <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour, in Saint
<hi>Peter</hi>'s, and in the <hi>Sacristy</hi> the chief piece, all
which were done by <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> with so much
diligence and care, that a more finished Work
in Distemper, never was performed by him.
And the <hi>Pope</hi> rewarded him accordingly, for
besides many Favours he bestowed upon him,
he presented him with Five hundred Ducats
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43902:97"/>
of Gold, which for those days, was a Noble
present.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Ghiotto</hi> stayed at <hi>Rome,</hi> he contracted
a great Friendship with <hi>Oderici de Agobbio,</hi> an
Excellent Master in <hi>Miniature,</hi> who was then
Employed by the <hi>Pope</hi> to paint a great many
of Books, of the Library of the <hi>Popes Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi>
in <hi>Miniature;</hi> most which have since
been lost, or have otherwise perished by
Time. I have in my Book of Collections of
Antient Designs, some pieces of this <hi>Oderico,</hi>
who indeed, was an Excellent Master, but
yet <hi>Franco Bolognese,</hi> who Worked at the same
time for the <hi>Pope,</hi> was much beyond him; as
may be seen likewise in my Book of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
where there is amongst the rest, an
admirable Eagle and a Lion, that breaks a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Tree, all in <hi>Miniature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> having liked <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s Painting,
ordered him to paint Stories of the Old and
New Testament, all round Saint <hi>Peters:</hi>
Whereupon to begin, he made the Angel that
is over the Organ, of Seven Palms high, as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43902:97"/>
also many others, most of which have been
Ruined, when the Old Church of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
came to receive New Walls, and some
likewise have been carried from the Old
Church, and placed under the Organ; as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
a <hi>Modonna,</hi> which being painted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wall, was by the means of Irons and
other Fastnings, taken out of the Wall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and placed in a handsome conspicuous
part of the House of Doctor <hi>Nicolo Acciaivoli,</hi>
a <hi>Florentine,</hi> and a great Lover of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
pieces of Art: He adorned this piece
of <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s with rich Carvings, and Modern
Pictures round about it.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s Hand, is likewise the Ship of
Musaick Work, which is over the three Gates
of the <hi>Portico,</hi> in the entrance to Saint <hi>Peters:</hi>
For besides the strength of the Design, the
Aptitude of the Apostles in different postures
of working against the Storm, is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and particularly the Sail of their Ship,
seems so fill'd with Wind, and has so much
<hi>Relievo,</hi> that a true Sail can scarce have more;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43902:98"/>
and yet it is mighty difficult to make up of
pieces of Glass such an union of Lights and
Shadows as is there, and which could hardly be
Equalled by the Skilfulest Pencil. There is
besides upon a Rock, one that Fishes with a
Line, in whose looks the patience of that
Sport is rarely well Represented, together
with the hopes of taking something at
last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pope Benedict</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> being dead, <hi>Clement</hi> the
<hi>5tb.</hi> Succeeded him, and Transferred the <hi>Papal
Court</hi> to <hi>Avignon,</hi> whither likewise <hi>Ghiotto</hi> was
obliged to go: And being there, he not only
did many things in <hi>Avignon,</hi> but in many
places in <hi>France,</hi> as well in <hi>Fresco,</hi> as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.</hi>
After some stay there, having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
satisfied the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Inclination, he was
by him largely Rewarded, and he returned
to <hi>Florence</hi> full of Honour and Riches, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him that <hi>Pope</hi>'s Picture, which he
gave afterwards to <hi>Taddeo Gaddi,</hi> his Schollar.</p>
            <p>This Return of <hi>Ghiottos</hi> to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was in the Year 1316. but he was soon
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43902:98"/>
called away again: For at the Instance of the
<hi>Signori della Scala,</hi> he went to <hi>Padoua,</hi> where
in the Church, called the <hi>Sancto,</hi> newly built
in those days, he painted a Chappel most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously.
From thence he went to <hi>Verona,</hi> and
painted divers Things in the Palace of <hi>Messer
Cane della Scala;</hi> amongst the rest, the Picture
of that Lord. In his Return to <hi>Florence,</hi> he
was obliged to take <hi>Ferrara</hi> in his way, to
obey the commands of the Lords of <hi>Este,</hi> for
whom he did many Things in that City: At
the same time, <hi>Dante</hi> the famous Poet, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Ghiotto</hi> was at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and being
himself at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> where he was then in
Exile, wrought so with him, that he got
him to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> where he painted in <hi>Sancta
Francisco,</hi> some Stories in <hi>Fresco,</hi> for the <hi>Signori
di Polenta,</hi> and from thence he went to <hi>Vrbino
Arezzo,</hi> in both which places he wrought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Things, and so Returned to <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1322. he was again Invited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
by <hi>Castruccio Castrucani,</hi> Lord of <hi>Luca,</hi> where
in the Church of Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> he painted a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43902:99"/>
               <hi>Christ</hi> in the Air, and with him the four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
of that City, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Regolo,</hi>
Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paulin,</hi> who seem to
recommend to our Saviour a <hi>Pope</hi> and an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
which 'tis thought were <hi>Frederick</hi> of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas</hi> the <hi>5th. Antipope:</hi> At the
same time, 'tis thought that <hi>Ghiotto</hi> gave the
Design of the Castle of Saint <hi>Fridiano,</hi> in the
City of <hi>Luca,</hi> which is a most Impregnable
Fortress, it is otherwise called the Fortress
<hi>Della Giusta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Robert King</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> writ to
his Son, the King of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who was then
at <hi>Florence,</hi> that he should by all means send
him <hi>Ghiotto</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> because that having just
then made an end of Building the Royal
Nunnery of <hi>Sancta Chiara,</hi> he desired the
Church might be adorned with Pictures of
<hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s Hand. He obeyed with joy the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of so great a Prince, and painted divers
of the Chappels with Stories of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and some of the New; particularly
those out of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> are thought to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43902:99"/>
be the Invention of the Poet <hi>Dante,</hi> as also
those very well Invented Stories of the
Church of <hi>Assisa,</hi> they having been Intimate
Friends: And though 'tis true, <hi>Dante</hi> died
the Year before, yet 'tis possible that they
might have Talked together of those Stories
of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Naples, Ghiotto</hi> painted in
the <hi>Castello del Novo,</hi> many Things, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Chappel, where he so pleased the King,
that very often he used to go and sit by him
when he was at Work; for <hi>Ghiotto</hi> was as
pleasant in his Conversation, and as ready in
his Wit, as with his Pencil. One day, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very hot, the King said to him, If I were
as you, <hi>Ghiotto,</hi> I would leave off Working
this hot Weather: And so would I, Sir, said
<hi>Ghiotto,</hi> if I were as you. Another time the
King desired him to paint the people of
his Kingdome Emblematically; he drew an
Ass with an old pack Saddle upon his Back,
and another new one before him, to which
he was smelling, as liking it very well, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43902:100"/>
upon both the Saddles, the Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The King having desired him to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
what that Picture meant, he said, It
was the Condition of his people, who were
alway desirous of Novelty, and ready to
change their old Master for any new one.
He painted likewise for the King a Hall,
which was afterwards ruined by King <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi>
in which were the Pictures of most of the
great Men of that Age, and amongst the rest
his own.</p>
            <p>In his Return from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Gaeta,</hi> and painted in the <hi>Annuntiata,</hi>
some Stories of the New Testament, which
are now much spoil'd by Time; but yet not
so, but that <hi>Ghiotto</hi>'s own Picture is very
distinguishable, being near a very fine Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix
of his doing.</p>
            <p>Having staid some time at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was
prevailed with by <hi>Signor Malatesta,</hi> who was
then Lord of <hi>Rimini,</hi> to go with him to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
where in the Church of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi>
he Drew many Stories; all which were lost
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43902:100"/>
when the Church was new Built by <hi>Sigismond
Malatesta,</hi> but in the Cloister there remains
yet the Story of <hi>Beata Michellina,</hi> which for
many Reasons, is one of the best Things that
<hi>Ghiotto</hi> ever did; for besides the Liveliness of
the Heads, which are all Miraculous, and
the strength and force of the Drapery, which
is Incomparable: There is a young Woman
as Beautiful as 'tis possible for a Woman to be,
who to free her self from the Calumny of
Adultery, Swears upon a Book with a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Aptitude, having her Eyes fixed upon
her Husband, who put her to her Oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of a Black Child she was brought to Bed
of, which he could not believe was his; and
as the Husband shows Distrust and Anger in
his Countenance, so does the Innocent Lady
show Truth and Simplicity in hers, with so
much Piety in her Looks, as was enough to
convince all the Slanders; by that she was no
Adulteress.</p>
            <p>The shortnings likewise that are in another
piece of this Story, where there are a great
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43902:101"/>
number of poor People, are very <hi>Commendable,</hi>
and much to be valued by all Artists, since it
is from them that we have the first Principles
and Manner of doing them, though they are
not in that perfection which they have since
attained to. But above all the other Things
that are in this Work, is the Aptitude of the
Saint her self, while she receives, from the
Usurers she had sold her Land too, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which she orders immediately to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed
to the poor; for in her there appears
so much scorn ad unconcernment for
Riches, that the very sight of them seems to
offend her; while on the other hand, the
very picture of Covetousness seems to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in a Figure of one, who looking
towards a Notary, to make him sign the
Writings, has at the same time both his
Hands upon the Money, expressing both his
Greediness and Distrust: And in the three Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
that hold the Habit of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> in
the Air, there is much to be commended,
particularly in the Drapery, the Foldings of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43902:101"/>
which are so easie and natural, that it must
be confessed, that <hi>Ghiotto</hi> was Born to bring
Light to the Art, in all its parts. He drew
in a Ship, which makes a piece of this Work,
<hi>Signor Malatesta,</hi> most wonderfully strong and
lively, with many other Figures of Seamen,
all in proper Aptitudes; and there is a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
particularly remarkable in its action,
for seeming to Talk with others, he puts one
Hand to his Face to spit into the Sea, and not
offend those he Talks with; and indeed this
is altogether one of the best Things done by
<hi>Ghiotto,</hi> who accordingly received both great
Rewards, and infinite Commendations from
<hi>Signor Malatesta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being Returned to <hi>Florence</hi> with great
Riches, he wrought a Crucifix in a field of
Gold in <hi>Sancto Marco,</hi> and another of the same
nature in <hi>Sancta Maria Novella,</hi> in which last,
<hi>Paccio Campana</hi> his Servant, wrought with him.</p>
            <p>After this, in the Year 1327. <hi>Guido Tarlati
da Pieta Mala,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arezzo</hi> being Dead,
his Relations having a mind to Erect a sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43902:102"/>
Monument for him, as for one who in
his time, had been the Head of the Gibeline
Faction in <hi>Tuscany:</hi> They writ to <hi>Ghiotto</hi> to
make them the most Magnificent Design that
he could, and at the same time desired him to
provide them a Sculpture of his own chusing,
of the best that were then in <hi>Italy: Ghiotto</hi>
made the Design and sent it them very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,
and the Monument was Finished by
it afterwards.</p>
            <p>The number of his Works is so great, that
it is very hard to Enumerate them all, but
we cannot but mention a piece of his, in the
Church of the <hi>Fratri Humilianti</hi> of all Saints of
<hi>Florence,</hi> 'tis in Distemper, and represents the
Death of our Lady, with the Apostles about
her. <hi>Michael Angelo Bonaronti,</hi> used to say,
That the Aptitudes of this Story could not be
better: And indeed, it is Wonderful, that
one who Learned the Art of himself, and
without a Master, almost, should have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to such Excellency, as to be Admired
by the greatest Masters, Two hundred Years
after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:43902:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In the Year 1334. on the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> he
undertook the Steeple of <hi>Sancta Maria del Fiore,</hi>
and having laid the Foundation very strong,
Twenty Yards deep, and of great Stones; the
Work was continued according to his Design,
which was after the Gothick Manner of those
days. All the Stories that were for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of it, were designed by himself, the
compass of the Tower at the bottom, was a
Hundred Yards, that is Twenty five Yards
for every side, and it was a Hundred and
forty four Yards high; it was to have on the
top a Pyramid Fifty Yards high, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a piece of old Artichecture, all Modern
Architects have still been against the Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi> of <hi>Lione Ghiberti,</hi> has Writ, that <hi>Ghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otto</hi>
did not only make the Model for the
Tower, but also made Models for the Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where divers of the Stories were done
in <hi>Relievo,</hi> which <hi>Lorinzo</hi> says he saw: And it
is not Incredible, since Design and Invention
are the parents of Sculpture as well as Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

For this Work <hi>Ghiotto</hi> was made a Citizen
of <hi>Florence,</hi> and Endowed with a Hundred
Florins of Gold yearly from the Publick;
which in those days was considerable. He
Lived not to see it Finished, and it was after
his Death pursued by <hi>Taddeo Gaddi.</hi> His death
was in the Year 1336. and was much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Countrymen, having had in his
Life-time the Esteem of all, and the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of most of the Excellent Men of the
Age he Lived in: And amongst the rest of
<hi>Dante</hi> and <hi>Petrarch,</hi> who makes mention of
him in his Will, and in a <hi>Latin Epistle</hi> in the
sixth Book of his Familiar ones, in these
Words: <hi>Atque (ut a veteribus ad nova ab Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

            <head>The LIFE of
LEONARDO
DA VINCI,
A
Florentine Painter, and Sculptor.</head>
            <p>IT may be seen by <hi>Leonardo Da Vinci,</hi> as much
as by any other Example, that the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Influences do sometimes so Unite in
one Subject, as to make all that's performed by
that Person, to seem almost Divine, and not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43902:104"/>
acquired by any Humane Industry: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the admirable Beauty of <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the infinite Graces of his Mind, and the
exquisite Penitration with which in all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and Arts, he attained to the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
part of them with ease, do show that
he had from above, most extraordinary Gifts.
The strength of his Mind was always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a Dexterity, which alone would
have made its Way through the World; and
he had besides, a Greatness and Magnanimity
in him, more befitting a Prince than a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Man. All which made him not only
Beloved and Esteemed in his Life time, but
highly Renowned and Honoured after his
Death to all Posterity.</p>
            <p>He was Son of <hi>Piero da Vinci,</hi> and in the first
beginning of his Education, shewed so strong
an Inclination to all sorts of Learning, that
had he constantly pursued any one, he must
have have been a Prodigie in that kind, but
he was so various, that that did very much
hinder his Excelling. At his first learning
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43902:104"/>
to cast Account, he used to puzzle his Master
with Questions about <hi>Arithmatick,</hi> and that in
a few Months after he had first applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to it. He next gave himself to Musick,
and particularly to play upon the Lute, in
which he grew so Excellent, which he would
play Extempore, things that would Charm
all that heard him; and yet though he was
so variously addicted, he still followed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing,
and making of things in <hi>Relievo,</hi> as
two Arts, that above all others did please his
Fancy, and fix his Application. His Father
taking more particular notice of this last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
took one day some of his Designs,
and carrying them to <hi>Andrea del Verochio,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Painter, and his intimate Friend, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him to tell him Ingeniously, whether
his Son <hi>Leonardo</hi> was ever like to succeed in
that Way?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrea</hi> was astonished at the sight of such
bold Beginning, and exhorted his Father to
give him all sort of Encouragement in that
Way: Upon which, his Father ordered him
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43902:105"/>
to go constantly to <hi>Andrea</hi>'s Painting-House,
there to Improve himself. <hi>Leonardo</hi> obeyed
with joy, and not content with Designing
alone, he Exercised himself in all those Arts
which are any ways depending upon it, or
useful to a Painter, or Statuary, such as <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
Architecture, Perspective,</hi> &amp;c. in all which
he attained to a great perfection. He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the first that had thoughts of putting
the River of <hi>Arno</hi> into a Chanel from <hi>Pisa</hi> to
<hi>Florence,</hi> Inventing all sorts of Mills, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Machines, useful for so great a Design.
But because his chief profession was Painting,
he spent much time in Drawing by the Life,
and often likewise in making Models of
Earth, and then Clothing them with fine
Linnen wet, with the greatest patience in the
World: He would Draw them upon Silk,
or fine Linnen, in Black and White, with the
point of his Pencil, that it was a most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thing to see them; some of which I
have in my Book of Designs. What he did
upon Paper, was with so much diligence and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43902:105"/>
delicacy, that no Man ever came near him.
I have a Head of his in <hi>Chiaro Scuro,</hi> which is
Divine, and shows with what singular
strength he Conceived, and with what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Dexterity he executed his Thoughts
with the Pencil. When he was weary of
Painting, or Statuary, he used to busie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in finding out Ways how to Level
Mountains with ease, or make Passages
through them, from one Valley to another;
as also by Leavers, Strings, Pulleys, to raise
great Weights, and by other Machines to
drain the Water from low places; so that
his Brains were perpetually employed, and
of all these Things he made Designs, many of
which I have seen. And in them, he was so
Curious, as sometimes to Draw the whole
Lying, or Coiling of a Cable, or other Ropes, so
as you might see the Winding of it from one
end to the other; there is one of these in a
Print, and in the middle are these Words,
<hi>Leonardo Vinci Academia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:43902:106"/>
He was so extream diverting in Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he drew every Body after him;
and having, as we may say in comparison of
others, Wrought but very little, yet he Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Splendidly, having always many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and Horses; for which last, he had a
great Passion, and used to Draw them by the
Life. He loved all sorts of Animals indeed,
and would often buy Birds alive out of their
Cages, only to let them go, and restore to
them their lost Liberty. So great was his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Bounty, and the sweetness of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
in a word, no Man in his Time, ever
acted with so much Readiness, Vivacity, and
Grace, which gave a particular Character to
all that he did; though in his Art he begun
many Things, but hardly Finished any, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conceived them with so much Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that his Hand afterwards, could not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Idaea of his Mind.</p>
            <p>After having Worked some time with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea
del Verocchio,</hi> his Master employed him in
a piece of his Undertaking, of the Story of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43902:106"/>
Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Baptizing of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi>
and in it <hi>Leonardo</hi> drew an Angel, that held
some Clothes of our Saviour, which he Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
so well, that he put down all the other
Figures of <hi>Andrea,</hi> in so much, that scarce
any thing but <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s Angel, was taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. This so angered his Master, to be
out-done by his own Schollar, and a Young
Man, that he never more would handle a
Pencil, or Colours.</p>
            <p>There being a very rich Tent of Gold and
Silk of Tapistry Work to be made in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
for the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> the Undertakers
agreed with <hi>Leonardo,</hi> to make the Cartoon.
The Story being that of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when
they eat the forbidden Fruit in Paradise.
There he Drew in <hi>Charo Scuro,</hi> a delicious Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of Plants and Flowers, full of variety of
Animals, done with so much diligence and
patience, and so Natural, that none but so
divine a Genius, could ever do the like. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest there is a Fig-Tree, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the admirable shortnings of its Leaves
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43902:107"/>
and Branches, is painted with such Care, that
it would astonish any one to consider, how
'twas possible for a Man to do a Thing with
so much patience. There is likewise a Palm-Tree,
which has its Branches so Lively, and
their Situation, and exact Simmetry so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
that none but <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s Genius, could
ever compass it. The Cartoon being finished,
was left upon his Hands, the Tapistry Work
not being gone on with, as was first designed;
and it is at this time in the House of Saint
<hi>Octaviano de Medici,</hi> it being presented to him
not long ago, by <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s Uncle.</p>
            <p>One day, his Father, <hi>Ser Piero da Vinci,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his Country House, was desired by one
of his Tenents, to get him a Buckler painted,
which he had made out of a Figg-Tree, cut
down in the Ground; <hi>Ser Piero</hi> took the Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and the fellow being very useful to him,
in Fishing, Fowling, and other Country
Sports, he carried it to his Son, and desired
him to Draw something or another upon it.
<hi>Leonardo</hi> seeing the Buckler ill shaped and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43902:107"/>
crooked, streightned it and Polished it, and
then having carefully plaistered it over, he
began to consider what he should Draw there,
that might Fright any one at first sight, like
<hi>Medusas</hi> Shield. To this end, he got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a Room, where no Body came but
himself, a Collection of Serpents, Lizards,
Crickets, Butterflies, Grashoppers, and such
like Animals; from the assemblage of all
which, strangely put together, he made up
an Animal most horrible to look too, who
seemed to poyson the Air with his Breath;
for he placed him in a kind of a dark Grotto,
sending Fire out of his Mouth, and Smoke
out of his Nostrils, in so strange a manner,
that it would fright any one to see it. He
took so much pains about it, that the stink
of those dead Creatures was intollerable in
the Room, though not at all perceived by
<hi>Leonardo,</hi> so attentive he was upon his Work.
The thing being finished, he told his Father,
that he might have the Buckler when he
pleased. One Morning then, <hi>Ser Pierc,</hi> his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43902:108"/>
Father, came and knocked at the Door, and
desired the Buckler: <hi>Leonardo</hi> opened the Door,
but desired him to stay a little: So return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Room, and having placed the
Buckler in an obscure Light, upon his Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Desk, he called in his Father; who not
expecting any such thing, was of a sudden
struck with the Apparition of such a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and retired two or three steps back. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo</hi>
stopped him, and said, This Work I see
will answer its end, take it and carry it to
whom you have promised it. The thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
wonderful to his Father, who was
extreamly pleased with it, and having secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bought another Buckler, which he caused
to be Painted with some ordinary Invention,
he kept <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s, and gave the other to his
Servant, who took it so kindly, that he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him faithfully ever after.</p>
            <p>Some Months after, <hi>Ser Piero,</hi> sold <hi>Leonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>'s
Buckler secretly in <hi>Florence,</hi> to some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Merchants, for the Sum of a Hundred
Ducats, who sold it to the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> for
Three hundred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:43902:108"/>
               <hi>Leonardo</hi> made likewise a most delicate <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna,</hi>
which <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> used to keep
in his Chamber; and amongst other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of it, he had drawn a Glass full of
Water, with Flowers in it, where besides the
lovelyness of the Flowers, he had counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
drops of Water upon them, as delicate
as the Natural ones. He made also for <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio
Segni,</hi> his Intimate friend, a Neptune up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Stormy Sea, carried in his Chair, drawn
by Sea Horses, with Whales, and other Sea
Monsters about him, and the Heads of some
Sea Gods, most delicately designed; and this
Piece was by <hi>Fabio Segni,</hi> Son to <hi>Antonio,</hi> given
to <hi>Messer Gioranni Gaddi,</hi> with this Epygram,
<q>
                  <l>Pinxit Virgilius Neptune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pinxit Homerus,</l>
                  <l>Dum Maris undisoni per vada flectit equos,</l>
                  <l>Mente quidem vates illum conspexit uterque,</l>
                  <l>Vincius ast Oculis jureque vincit eos.</l>
               </q>
He took a fancy once to draw in Oyl, a Head
of a <hi>Medusa,</hi> with the strangest dress of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43902:109"/>
and Snakes, that 'tis possible to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine:
But it being a Work that required
great time to Finish it, it had the fate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Things, and remained Imperfect;
but as it is, it holds its place amongst the
chiefest Raritys of our Duke <hi>Cosimo;</hi> as also
that of an Angel, who holding one of his
Arms in the Air, shows a shortning from
the Shoulder to the Elbow; that is most Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly
and strong. For <hi>Leonardo</hi> sought chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give a great <hi>Relievo</hi> to his Things, and
for that Reason, made his Grounds and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
as dark as possibly he could, seeking out
the strongest Blacks of all kinds; so that his
Manner seemed almost a Night, rather than a
Shadow made by the Light of the Day.</p>
            <p>When ever he saw any one of an odd Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy,
either with strange Hair, or Beard,
he would have followed him a whole Day till
he had so got the Idea of him; that being
come Home, he would Draw him as like, as
if he sat to him. And of this sort, there
are many Heads, both of Men and Women;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43902:109"/>
many of which, I have in my Book of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs:
And amongst the rest, the Head of
<hi>Americo Vespuci,</hi> designed with a Coal, and is
the Head of a fine Old Man. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that of <hi>Scaramuccia,</hi> Captain of the
<hi>Gypsies.</hi> He begun likewise, the Story of the
Adoration of the Three Kings, where there
are very good Heads; it remains Imperfect,
in the House of <hi>Signor Amerigo Benci.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened, that <hi>Lodovico Forta,</hi> being
made Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> in the Year 1494. and
he being a Prince that delighted extreamly in
Musick, <hi>Leonardo</hi> was sent for, to play upon
the Lute before him. He was received with
great Honour by the Duke, and there in his
Presence, he overcame all the Musitians that
were come from all parts to play before him.
The Instrument he plaid upon, being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Work of his own Hands, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the shape of a Horses Head, the best
part of it of Silver; but so shaped, that it
yielded a sweeter and lowder Sound, than
the ordinary Lutes. The Duke having reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43902:110"/>
his Conversation, and found him most
extreamly Agreeable, and of so ready a Wit,
that amongst other things, he was the best
maker of Extempore Verses, of any of his
Time, was pleased with him beyond Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>The first Work he did for the Duke in
Painting, was a Nativity of our Saviour;
which the Duke presented to the Emperor.</p>
            <p>Then he undertook the Story of the last
Supper, in the Convent of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi>
called, <hi>Sancta Maria delle Gratie,</hi> in <hi>Milan:</hi> In
it he gave so much Majesty and Gravity to
the Heads of the Apostles, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to leave our Saviour's Unfinished; not
being able to attain to the Expression of that
divine Greatness, which ought to be in the
Image of the Son of God. But one thing
most Admirable was by him performed in
this Piece, which was to express in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Apostles, that Concern and
Trouble which they were in, to know which
of them it was that should betray our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43902:110"/>
And one may discern in their different
Looks, Love, Fear, and Anger, which were
the Passions naturally rising in their Breasts,
upon the doubt raised in them by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Words: And on the other side, in <hi>Jadas</hi>'s
Countenance, there appears so much False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Hatred, and Treachery, that it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.
The whole Work besides, is in all its
parts, a Masterpiece of Incredible diligence;
for the very Cloth of the Table, is done with
such Exactness, that Linnen it self, shows
not better nor finer.</p>
            <p>'Tis said, that while <hi>Leonardo</hi> was Painting
this piece, the Prior of the Convent used to
be very troublesome to him, in pressing him
too Indiscreetly, to make an end of it. For
it seemed very strange to him, to see <hi>Leonardo</hi>
come sometimes, and be half a day together,
doing nothing but look upon his Work, in
the posture of a Man in a Rapture; whereas
he thought the Work might have gone on all
that while, as well as digging the Garden,
or any other Labour used to do. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43902:111"/>
               <hi>Leonardo</hi> minded but little what he said
to him, he made his Complaints to the Duke,
and that with so much heat, that the Duke
sent for <hi>Leonardo;</hi> and very Gently and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
put him in mind what the Prior's
Importunity had so often Solicited for in
vain. <hi>Leonardo</hi> knowing the Duke to be a
Man of Judgment, and capable of hearing a
Rational Account, was content to Discourse
with him about his Art (which he never
had done with the Prior.) And told him,
that without doubt, his Highness could not
but understand, that Men of a great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Genius in many Professions, but
particularly in his, did take more pains
while they were Conceiving their Idaeas,
than while they were Executing of them:
And that so it was with him, for he had yet
two Heads to Finish, the one of our Saviour,
for the Model of which, he had none upon
Earth, nor could hardly Imagine any that
should represent all that Beauty, Divine
Graces, which were to appear in Divinity
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43902:111"/>
Incarnated. The other of <hi>Judas,</hi> which gave
him likewise great Trouble, it being hard
for him to create in his Mind, a Form that
should express the Face of one, who after so
many favours received from his Lord and
Creator, should yet have so wicked a mind
as to Betray him. But that for this last, he
would endeavour to find some ill looked fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
or another; and that however, when all
things failed, he could take the Prior's face,
who had disturbed him so Impertinently.
The Duke extreamly pleased with his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
fell a Laughing heartily, and told
him, He was in the right. And the Jest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to the Prior's Ears, he was glad to
let <hi>Leonardo</hi> alone, and mind the other Affairs
of his Convent. And <hi>Leonardo</hi> on his side, fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<hi>Judas</hi>'s Head so, as it appears, the Picture
of Treachery it self; but for our Saviours, it
remains to this day Imperfect.</p>
            <p>The Excellency of this Piece, struck the
King of <hi>France</hi> with so much Admiration,
when he had taken <hi>Milan,</hi> that he resolved to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43902:112"/>
have it Transported into <hi>France;</hi> and sending
for the ablest Ingeneers, he promised them a
noble Reward, and bid them spare for no
Cost, that should be necessary to that Effect.
But it being painted upon a Stone Wall, the
thing was thought Impracticable by any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
or Contrivance whatsoever; and so
<hi>Milan</hi> remained in possession of this Noble
piece of Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonardo</hi> Drew likewise in the same Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
the Pictures of the said <hi>Lodovico,</hi> Duke
of <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian,</hi> his Eldest Son, and
of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second Son, who were since,
both of them, Dukes of that place; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
they are most admirable Things.</p>
            <p>Amongst other Projects, which <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s
Working Head put the Duke upon: One was
to make a Horse of <hi>Bronse,</hi> of prodigious Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and upon it, to place the Dukes Statue,
of the same Mettle. And accordingly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
it, but by reason of its Vastness, found
such difficulty in Casting it, that it remained
Unfinished. And some do Imagine, that his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43902:112"/>
first design was never to bring it to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they say, he used to do with most
of his Undertakings. But I think that
they wrong him, and that the Reason of his
frequent Interruptions, and not Finishing
what he had begun, proceeded more from
the unlimitted greatness of his Mind, which
conceived things above Humane perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
than from any unsteadiness of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
in the pursuance of them: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
they that have seen the Model of Clay,
made by him for this Statue, do own, that
there could be nothing more Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
It remained to be seen, till <hi>Francis</hi>
the <hi>1st.</hi> took <hi>Milan,</hi> and then among other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
committed in the City, the Souldiers
broke it all to pieces.</p>
            <p>He applyed himself amongst other things, to
a most particular Knowledg of the Anatomy
of Humane Bodies, being helped in this Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
by <hi>Marc-Antonio de la Torre,</hi> an Excellent
Phisitian, and professor of Philosophy in
<hi>Padoua:</hi> Who likewise made admirable use of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43902:113"/>
the Hand of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> having got him to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
a whole Book of Anatomy in Red Chalk.
And there he first Drew all the Bones and
Joynts, then added the Tendons and Muscles,
having also made for each a particular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
in Letters written upside-down, with
his Left Hand, so as they cannot be Read
any otherwise, but by a Glass. A great part
of these papers about Anatomy, do remain
in the Hands of <hi>Francisco da Melzo,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Milan,</hi> who in <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s time, was a
most delicate Youth, and was much beloved
by him; he keeps them as Sacred as Relicks,
as he does <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s Picture likewise.</p>
            <p>There are yet in a <hi>Milaness</hi> Painter's hands,
some Writings of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> which Treat of
<hi>Painting,</hi> and of the Way of <hi>Designing</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring;</hi>
but Written as the rest, in Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
made with his Left Hand, upside-down.
This Painter came, not long ago, to <hi>Florence</hi>
to see me, being desirous to print this Work
of <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s, and afterwards he went upon
this design to <hi>Rome;</hi> but I have had no account
how the thing succeeded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:43902:113"/>
But to return to <hi>Leonardo:</hi> In his Time,
the King of <hi>France</hi> came to <hi>Milan,</hi> where <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo</hi>
for his Reception, being desired to do
something Extraordinary, made a great Lion,
which by Springs, Walked of its self a good
many paces to meet the King, and then
opening his Breast, shewed it full of <hi>Flower-de-Luces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having during his stay at <hi>Milan,</hi> made
some Schollars, amongst whom, was <hi>Salai,</hi>
whom he chose for his Beauty, and Taught
him many Secrets of the Art, he returned
to <hi>Florence;</hi> there he found that <hi>Philippino,</hi> a
famous Painter of that place, had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Picture for the Great Altar of the
<hi>Nuntiata,</hi> in the Convent of the <hi>Frati de Servi;</hi>
whereupon he declared, that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do such a piece too: which <hi>Phillippino</hi> hearing,
and being a very Gentile Man, yielded his
place to <hi>Leonardo.</hi> And the Monks desired
<hi>Leonardo,</hi> that he might the better attend the
Work, to Lodg in their Convent, where
they Entertained him with his Family. He
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43902:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a great while with them, before he could
be prevailed with to Work a stroke, but at
last he made a <hi>Cartoon,</hi> and in it a <hi>Madonna,</hi> a
Saint <hi>Ann,</hi> and <hi>Christ;</hi> all which Figures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Finished, raised so much Admiration in
the whole City, that during the time of two
or three days, there was a continual Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Men and Women, to go and see them;
every one returning astonished, at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
Skill of <hi>Leonardo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in the <hi>Madonna</hi>'s Face, there was all
that Beautiful Innocence, that might become
a Virgin Mother of <hi>Christ;</hi> who having her
Child in her Lap, showed an humble Joy,
for the Felicity she enjoyed in so Lovely an
Infant, whom while she regarded with Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
a little Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who was
playing with a Lamb, drew the Looks of his
Mother Saint <hi>Ann,</hi> who with a Smile, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the joy of her Heart, to see she had
at last a Son, that was in his Infancy, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
to the Saviour of the World. But the
<hi>Cartoon</hi> being made, <hi>Leonardo</hi> forsook the Work,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43902:114"/>
and the Monks entertained <hi>Philippino</hi> again,
who died likewise, before he could Finish
his; and then the <hi>Cartoon</hi> was sent into
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonardo</hi> likewise undertook the Picture of
<hi>Mona Lisa,</hi> Wife to <hi>Francesco Giocondo,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Worked upon it four Years together,
left it nevertheless Unfinished. It is now
in the King of <hi>France</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Pallace in <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau;</hi>
whoever had a mind to see how well
Art could imitate Nature, might have been
satisfied in looking upon this Head, for there
were all the Minutest Things represented to
a Miracle. The Eyes had that Brightness
and Water, that is naturally in them; and
the Hairs of the Eyebrows, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
hard to do, was so exactly painted,
that one might see the Artist had made
them to rise from the Flesh, just as they do
through the Pores; sometimes thicker, and
sometimes thinner. The Nose had all those
little pits, which we see in plump fresh
Faces; and the Mouth was represented with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43902:115"/>
all its finishings; the Rose Colour of the
Lips ending by little and little, and uniting
with the Flesh Colour of the Cheeks and
Chin: The Neck was so strong and lively,
that through its delicate Whiteness, one
would think, one saw the Veins, and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Arteries. In a word, this Piece
was finished at a Rate, to make any Artist
afraid of ever attempting any thing like it.
'Tis said besides, That he never made this
lovely Lady sit for her Picture, but he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
some Body to Sing, or play upon some
Instrument, with some Buffoons to make
Sport, and keep her in good Humour, that
the Picture might have nothing of that Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness,
which very often spoils the Painters
whole Design; and accordingly this had an
Air of Joy and Pleasantness, that rejoyced
every one that saw it.</p>
            <p>The Excellency of this, and other Works
of this Noble Artist, made the whole City at
last, desirous to have some Considerable Piece
of his doing, which might Adorn the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43902:115"/>
and preserve the Memory of so great a
Genius. Therefore the Great Council-Hall
being newly Rebuilt, and the Architecture
of it having been ordered by the Three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Architects of those Days, <hi>Giulian of
Saint Gallo, Simon Pollaivoli,</hi> called <hi>Chronaca,</hi> and
<hi>Michel Angelo Buonarotti.</hi> It was by publick
Decree of the Council, Ordered, that <hi>Leonardo
Da Vinci</hi> should Paint it. Whereupon <hi>Piero
Soderini,</hi> the then <hi>Gonfalaniero di Sustitia,</hi> agreed
with him about it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonardo</hi> having chosen for his Painting-Room,
a Hall of <hi>Sancta Maria Novella,</hi> called,
<hi>La Sala del Papa,</hi> begun a <hi>Cartoon</hi> there, and
in it the Story of <hi>Niccolo Pinccinino,</hi> General
to <hi>Philip,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> there amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, he Drew a Troop of Horse, that
Attacked a Foot Company, and put them to
the Rout; where you might see the Rage
and Fury of the Combatants in their Faces,
and all their Actions: As also in the Horses
themselves, two of which Rising an end,
had fastned upon the Pikes, and Foot Soldiers,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43902:116"/>
one of which endeavouring with his Back,
to shove off a Horse that presses upon him,
lays hold of the Ensign, to get it out of the
Hands of two others, who having each of
them their Swords drawn in one Hand,
and their other upon the Ensign, try to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, against that first; and another Old
Soldier in a Red Cap, who seems to threaten
with a back blow, to cut off the Hands of
those two, who had laid hold of the Ensign's
Staff, and who with the fiercest Aptitude
imaginable, try to keep their hold. There
is besides, underneath the Horses Feet, two
Figures shortned, who being closed, and one
upon another, do all that is possible, the one
with his Arm raised on high, and a Dagger
in it, threatning present Death; and the
other striving with his Arms and Legs, to
avoid it. Great also is the Variety of dress,
in which he has put his Figures with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Helmets, and other Arms; but chiefly
his Mastery is great in the forms and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of his Horses, which <hi>Leonardo</hi> always
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43902:116"/>
made more Beautiful and Musculous, than
any other Painter. The only Fault of this
piece was, that thinking to Work in Oyl
upon the Wall, he made so gross a Mixture
for his first Couch, that his Colours began to
sink in, which made him forsake the Work
in that place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonardo</hi> was of a very great Soul, and most
Generous in all his Actions, not capable of
suffering himself to be lessened, as appeared.
When going once, as he used to do every
Month, to receive his Allowance from the
State, at the House of the <hi>Gonfaloniero Piero
Soderini;</hi> the Treasurer would have made
him take some of it in Rowls of Brass Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
and other such Money, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused:
Telling the Treasurer, who took it
ill, That he was no Farthing Painter. And
when afterwards, <hi>Piero Soderini</hi> himself, let
fall some Words, as if <hi>Leonardo</hi> had not dealt
well with the State in his Bargain; he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, got together by the means of his
Friends, all the Money he had ever received
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43902:117"/>
from the Publick, and carried it to <hi>Soderini,</hi>
who nevertheless, refused to accept it.</p>
            <p>At the Creation of <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> he
went to <hi>Rome</hi> with Duke <hi>Julian,</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi>
who was very much delighted with all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Entertainments, particularly those
of Chimistry; in which kind, <hi>Leonardo</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
had many fancyful Experiments. Such
as to make a thin Composition of Wax, out
of which he made little Animals, into which
Blowing, they flew through the Air, as long
as the Wind within them lasted.</p>
            <p>Among other Capricious Amusements of
his own Art, he bestowed the pains to fit
Wings to a live Lizard, found in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> by the Gardener: The
Wings were made of the Scales of other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
mingled with Quick-silver, which
made a strange Glittering and Shaking when
the Lizard moved; then having made him
Horns, and a Beard, he kept him Tame in a
Box, and used to fright his Friends, with
showing him of a sudden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:43902:117"/>
He used often likewise, to take Sheeps
Guts, and cleanse them to that Thinness, that
they would lie in the palm of his Hand: In
another Room hard by his, he had placed a
pair of Smiths Bellows, which putting into
one end of the Sheeps Gut, he would blow
them up to that Bigness, that they who were
in the same Room, would be fained to get up
into a Corner, the Guts appearing as Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent
as Glass. And this <hi>Leonardo</hi> used to say,
was the best Emblem of Virtue, which while
hid, lies in a little Room, but being once blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by Fame, would fill the whole World.
He had a Hundred of these Tricks. He busied
himself in the Knowledg of <hi>Perspective,</hi> and
<hi>Looking Glasses:</hi> He endeavoured likewise, by
Mixtures and Distillings, to find out the best
Oyls and Varnish, to preserve Pictures after
they were made, but in that he often succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ill; as he did particularly in a Picture of a
<hi>Madonna,</hi> with her Child in her Arms, upon
which he had bestowed infinite pains, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it to <hi>Signor Baldassari Turini,</hi> Datary to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43902:118"/>
               <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth; it is now much spoiled.</p>
            <p>'Tis said, that being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and having
undertaken a Piece for the <hi>Pope,</hi> he began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to fall a Distilling of Herbs and Oyls
for the Vernish: Which being told to <hi>Leo</hi> the
Tenth, he cried out, alas, This Man will
do nothing, for he begins at the wrong end.</p>
            <p>There was a great Fewd between him and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel
Angelo Bonarti,</hi> in so much that <hi>Michel An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>
left <hi>Florence</hi> upon it, and went to <hi>Rome;</hi> and
<hi>Leonardo</hi> then also went to <hi>France,</hi> where he was
extreamly well received by the King, who
had divers things of his Doing, and amongst
the rest, the <hi>Cartoon of the Saint Anna,</hi> which he
much desired might be Coloured by him. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo,</hi>
according to his Custom, amused the King
with promises a great while, till at last he
fell Sick, and after many Months Indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
finding Death to draw near, he desired
to be Informed of the Duties of a Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
after which, with much show of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for his Sins, he would needs rise
out of his Bed to receive the Eucharist; and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43902:118"/>
while he was in that attempt, the King, who
often used to visit him, came in: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
straining to shew his Respect to the King,
he was taken with a fainting Fit, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of Death. In which, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
held his Head, while he Expired in the
Arms of so Great a Prince, as the best time
and place to give up a Soul so Divine as his
was.</p>
            <p>The Loss of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> was sensibly Regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by all that knew him, no Artist ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Honoured a Profession more than he did
the Art of Painting. He added to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Colouring in Oyl, which was found
out before his Time, a certain Darkness of
Shadows, from whence the Moderns have
learned to give great <hi>Relievo</hi> to their Figures.
We have of him likewise, a most perfect Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
of Men and Horses. He would have
Excelled in Statuary likewise, if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
for the Three fine Statues made by <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesco
Rustici,</hi> and placed upon the Gate of Saint
<hi>John</hi>'s Church, are of <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s Ordering, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43902:119"/>
as good for Design and Casting, as any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
ones we have.</p>
            <p>He had for Disciple, <hi>Givoan Antonio Boltraffio,</hi>
a <hi>Milaness,</hi> a Person very understanding in
the Art, who in the Year 1500. Painted in
the Church of the <hi>Misericordia</hi> at <hi>Bologna,</hi> a
piece in Oyl; where was our Lady, with her
Son in her Arms, Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and
Saint <hi>Sebastian,</hi> naked, and he that Caused it
to be made, Drawn after the Life, upon his
Knees. In it he Writ his Name, and added
to it, Disciple of <hi>Leonardo Da Vinci;</hi> it is a fine
Piece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marco Vgioni,</hi> was likewise his Schollar, who
in <hi>Sancta Maria della Pace,</hi> Drew the Death of
the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the Wedding of <hi>Cana</hi> in
<hi>Galilee.</hi>

            <head>The LIFE of
ANDREA
DEL SARTO,
A
Famous Florentine Painter.</head>
            <p>AFter having Writ the Lives of divers
Great Painters, who Excelled, some in
Colouring, some in Design, and some in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
we are at last arrived to the Life of
<hi>Andrea del Sarto,</hi> a most Excellent Artist, in
whom Nature and Art Concurred, to show
all that Painting can do, either in <hi>Design,
Colouring,</hi> or <hi>Invention.</hi> And to say truth, if
<hi>Andrea</hi> had been of a Temper as bold as his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43902:120"/>
Judgment was profound, he would have been
without any Equal in his Profession; but a
certain natural Timidity and Simplicity,
with which he was endowed, deprived him
and his Works of that Strength and Boldness,
which added to his other Qualities in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
would have made him Sublime in every
kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrea</hi> was Born in <hi>Florence,</hi> in the Year
1478. his Father was a Taylor, and exercised
that Calling to his Dying day, from whence
<hi>Andrea</hi> took his Name, and was called <hi>Del
Sarte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was first bound Prentice to a Goldsmith,
and in that profession, his chief delight was
<hi>Designing</hi> of something or another of his <hi>Trade,</hi>
being much more pleased to do that, than
to handle either the <hi>Hammer,</hi> or the other <hi>Tools</hi>
belonging to it: Which being observed by
<hi>John Barile,</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Painter, but an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
one, he took the Child home with him,
to Teach him the Art of Painting. It is
wonderful with what Application and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43902:120"/>
               <hi>Andrea</hi> followed his Designing, though
under so mean a Master, particularly in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of his Colours, which he did with so
much Art, that all the Painters of the Town
were Surprised at it. Having stay'd Three
Years with <hi>John Barile,</hi> he seeing how great
an Artist <hi>Andrea</hi> was like to prove, talked of
him with <hi>Pietro di Cosimo,</hi> who at that time,
was reputed one of the best Painters that <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
had. <hi>Pietro</hi> took <hi>Andrea</hi> to be his Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and he had not had him long, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a great Kindness for him, seeing him
so Ardent and Industrious, to advance his
Skill. For <hi>Andrea</hi> spent all his Hours of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and the Holy-days, which other young
Men gave to their Recreation, in Designing
in the Great Hall, called <hi>La Sala del Papa,</hi>
where were the <hi>Cartoons</hi> of <hi>Michel Angelo,</hi> and
<hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> and did Out-do all the other
young Men, both <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi>
who were used to come to the same place.
Amongst all those who in great Numbers
used to frequent that Hall, <hi>Andrea</hi> made a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43902:121"/>
particular Friendship with <hi>Francis Bigia,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Jl. Francia,</hi> and <hi>Andrea</hi> being weary of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with his Master, who was grown very
Old, told <hi>Francia,</hi> that he had a mind to take a
Chamber to himself. <hi>Francia,</hi> who had the
same Design, because his Master, <hi>Mariotto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertinelli,</hi>
had given over the Trade, Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with him, and they took a Room in the
<hi>Piazza del Grano,</hi> dividing equally the Profit of
what they undertook, and each putting his
Hand to the Work, while they stayed there.
<hi>Andrea</hi> painted in the Cloister of Saint <hi>John
Baptist,</hi> Twelve Stories of the Life of Saint
<hi>John,</hi> which he acquired so much Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Fame by, that now beginning to be
better known, he and his Friend, took a
new Lodging by the Convent of the <hi>Anunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata.</hi>
While they were there, an Old Fryar
of the House hearing of <hi>Andrea</hi>'s Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
which were in every Bodies Mouth,
he considered how to have his Ends of him,
without any great Charge; and by this time,
<hi>Jl. Francia</hi> and he, being, of Friends, become
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43902:121"/>
Rivals in their Profession. The Monk told
<hi>Andrea,</hi> that he had now an Opportunity to
make himself known to the World, and
gaining such Esteem, as he needed never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to want Work; that his friend <hi>Francia</hi>
had offered to do the thing, but that he had
so much kindness for him, that he should
have the preference; and that he counselled
him not to stand upon any Price, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he would acquire in so great a Work,
would be Reward enough. <hi>Andrea,</hi> who was
but poor Spirited, and Simple, hearing that
<hi>Francia</hi> was mentioned for the Work, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
closed with the Fryar, and agreed
with him for Ten Crowns a Story, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no Body else should be concerned in the
Work.</p>
            <p>In a little time, he finished Three Stories
of the Life of Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> the Founder of
the Order of the <hi>Servites;</hi> and in one of them
he Drew some Gamesters under a Tree. Who
being reproved by Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> for Swearing
and Blaspheming, did but Laugh at his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43902:122"/>
when on a sudden, a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap
Killed two of them, and frighted the
others. In this piece, <hi>Andrea</hi> showed what
Variety of Invention he was capable of, for
besides the frighted postures of the Gamesters,
he drew a Woman, who running out of her
House, at the Noise of the Thunder, appears
so out of her self, that nothing can be more
Natural. And he also feigned a Horse broke
loose at the same Noise, who Leaping and
Bounding in an extraordinary manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
the disorder of the Whole, with much
Strength.</p>
            <p>Having finished one side of the Cloister,
and finding the Work too Laborious for the
price, he desired to be released of his Bargain,
which the Fryar was loath to do; but at last
did consent, provided <hi>Andrea</hi> painted two Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
more at his Conveniency, and he would
allow him something a better Rate. The
Reputation he acquired by these Stories, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
brought him as much Work as he
could desire. And he made many Stories
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43902:122"/>
and Pictures of all kinds, both for publick,
and for private Persons; which it would be
too long to Enumerate here. The profit and
advantage he made by them, would have made
him Live very plentifully, had he not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his Condition, by falling in Love with a
young Woman, who was then Married to
another; but whose Husband dying soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
she became <hi>Andrea</hi>'s Wife. From that
time forward, he was very uneasie, both in
his Fortune and Humour, for besides the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance
of a Married Life, he was often
disturbed with Jealousie, and his Wifes ill
Humours; but to return to his Works.</p>
            <p>The Company of the <hi>Scalzo,</hi> for whom he
had made his first Work, of the Story of
Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> being desirous to have him
finish the whole Life, engaged him a new:
He therefore made them two Stories more of
the same Subject. In the first, Saint <hi>John</hi> is
Preaching to the Multitude, and shows in the
Burnt hew of his person, the Austerity of
his Life, but particularly, the Air of his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43902:123"/>
Countenance, is full of Spirit and
Zeal, the Variety of the Auditorys attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is no less well Expressed, by the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
at his Doctrine. But he showed
much more Skill in the second Story, where
Saint <hi>John</hi> is Baptizing a great Multitude of
People, some whereof are putting off their
Clothes, others Naked in the Water, and all
showing in their Aptitudes, a marvellous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of being cleansed from their Sins; every
Figure being most perfectly mannaged, so
that though it be in <hi>Chiaro Scuro,</hi> they seem
to be of Marble. 'Tis not to be omitted, that
while <hi>Andrea</hi> was about this piece, there came
some prints of <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> out of which
<hi>Andrea</hi> took some Figures, and fitted them
for his manner; which though it is often
done by good Masters, yet some took occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to think, that <hi>Andrea</hi> was wanting in the
point of Invention.</p>
            <p>He made likewise for a Merchant, a Friend
of his, who often Traded into <hi>France</hi> with
Pictures; one of our Saviour, Dead, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43902:123"/>
some Angels about him, in sad compassionate
Postures; and this piece did so generally
please every Body, that <hi>Andrea</hi> was prevailed
upon to have it Cut, and Printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> by
<hi>Agostino Vinctiano,</hi> a good Graver: But the
thing having miscarried in his Hands, so as
to lose much of its Beauty, he could never be
persuaded afterwards, to suffer any of his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
to be Graved. The Original its self;
was Sold to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was so
pleased with it, that he Bespoke many things
besides, of his Doing; which with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion
of some Friends, made <hi>Andrea</hi> resolve
to go for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, <hi>Francis the First,</hi> having taken
Order for his Journey, and advanced Money
to him at <hi>Florence;</hi> He was no sooner arrived
at Court, but he Experienced that Princes
Liberality, before ever he began to Work. The
first Picture he made, was of the Dophin,
who was then in Swadling Clothes, being not
above two Months Old; the King liked it so
well, that he presented him Three Hundred
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43902:124"/>
Crowns in Gold. Next, he made the Picture
of Charity, which was by that Prince so Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued,
that he Ordered a pension for <hi>Andrea,</hi>
promising him any thing, provided he would
stay at Court; being much taken with the
Quickness of his Work, and the Easiness of
his Humour. He went on therefore, doing
many pieces for the King and Court. When
one day as he was Working upon a St. <hi>Jerom,</hi>
for the Queen Mother, he received Letters
from his Wife from <hi>Florence,</hi> which made him
resolve upon his Return thither; pretending
some Domestick Affairs, and promising the
King not only to come back, but also to bring
his Wife with him, and a choice Collection
of Pictures and Sculptures. The King trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, gave him Money for all those things,
and <hi>Andrea</hi> took his Oath upon the Bible, to
Return in a few Months.</p>
            <p>Being arrived at <hi>Florence,</hi> he enjoyed his fine
Wife and his Friends, and for several Months
gave himself up wholly to pleasure: At last,
having spent his own Money, and the Kings
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43902:124"/>
too, he was nevertheless resolved to go back
for <hi>France;</hi> but the Entreaties and Tears of
his Wife, had more power over him, than his
Honour or Oath, and so he Settled a new
in <hi>Florence,</hi> being fallen from a very Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Condition, to a very Mean one. The
King finding himself Deceived, grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Angry, and for many Years, would
not look upon a <hi>Florentine Painter</hi> with a good
Eye; Threatning, that if ever <hi>Andrea del
Sarto</hi> fell into his Hands, he would use him as
his Fault deserved.</p>
            <p>While he was away, the Company of the
<hi>Scalzo,</hi> had hired to <hi>Francia</hi> their Cloister,
and he had Finished in it, two Stories: But
now hearing <hi>Andrea</hi> was come back, they set
him to Work again, and he painted four Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
more. In the first, is Saint <hi>John</hi> taken
Prisoner, and brought before <hi>Herod.</hi> In the
second, is the Supper, and Dancing of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias.</hi>
In the third, is the Decolation of Saint
<hi>John,</hi> in which, the figure of the Hangman
half Naked, is admirably Designed. In the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43902:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fourth, <hi>Herodias</hi> presents the Head of Saint
<hi>John Baptist</hi> to her Mother; and in this, there
are some Figures in posture of Admiration,
which are Excellent. And these four Stories
have been a long time the Study, and as I
may say, the School of the young Painters in
<hi>Florence,</hi> both Natives and Strangers.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1523. the Plague being in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
and near it <hi>Andrea,</hi> by the help of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
Brancacci,</hi> retired to <hi>Mugello,</hi> and there
was set to Work by the Nuns, of the Order
of the <hi>Camaldoli,</hi> in their Church of Saint
<hi>Peter.</hi> He had carried his Wife and Children
with him, and the Nuns made so much of
his Wife, that <hi>Andrea</hi> resolved to do his best
to Oblige them: He therefore painted a Piece
of our Saviour, Dead, and the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi>
Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist, and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi>
Lamenting about the Dead Body: As also
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> looking on. In
all which, the Aptitudes are strangely well
Executed, and the whole finished to a Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
degree. And indeed, this Picture has
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43902:125"/>
made that Nunnery more Famous, than all
its other Ornaments, though it be a very
Magnificent Monastry.</p>
            <p>The Plague being over, and <hi>Andrea</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Florence,</hi> it happened that <hi>Frederick</hi> the
Second, Duke of <hi>Montova,</hi> passed through
<hi>Florence,</hi> and saw there in the Palace of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
the Picture of <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the Tenth, in the
middle of Cardinal <hi>Gulian Medicis,</hi> who was
then <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, and Cardinal <hi>Rosti.</hi>
The piece was done by <hi>Raphael,</hi> and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
thing in its kind: Whereupon the
Duke took his time while he was at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and Begged it of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> who very
graciously granted it to him, and sent Order to
<hi>Octavian</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> to deliver it to the Duke's
Order. <hi>Octavian,</hi> who was a great Lover of all
things of Art, was much troubled, that <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
should lose such a Rarity, but however
not daring to disobey the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Commands,
he made Answer, that the Duke should have
it; but desired he would be pleased to give
him time to make a New Frame to it, the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43902:126"/>
Frame being Old, and out of Fashion. But
he immediately sent for <hi>Andrea,</hi> and telling
him how the Case stood, said, He knew no
Remedy, but to Copy most diligently that
of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and send the Copy to the Duke;
and that too, must be done with all the Secresie
imaginable. <hi>Andrea</hi> fell presently to Work,
and was to Exact and Careful in his Copy,
that <hi>Octavian</hi> himself, who understood Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well, could hardly tell one from the
other. The Painter having Counterfeited
some Mould Spots, which were in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
to the greatest Exactness that was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Having therefore hid the Original, the
Copy was sent to the Duke, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
satisfied with it, and so far from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the Cheat, that <hi>Gulio Romano,</hi> who
was <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Schollar, and then Working for
the Duke, was Deceived as well as himself;
and would have persisted in that Opinion, to
his Dying day, if some Years after, <hi>Georgio
Vassari,</hi> who was a Creature of <hi>Octavian</hi> of
<hi>Medicis,</hi> and had seen <hi>Andrea del Sarto</hi> copy
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43902:126"/>
the Picture: Going to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and being
there courteously Entertained by <hi>Giulio,</hi> had
not undeceived him. For amongst other Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
<hi>Giulio</hi> showing him this as a piece of
<hi>Raphael</hi>'s, he told him he was mistaken: To
which <hi>Giulio</hi> replyed, How, mistaken! As
if I did not remember the very Strokes that
I my self Wrought in some part of it. To
which <hi>Vasari</hi> replied, He was still mistaken;
and to convince him, shewed him a little
Mark on the Back, which was made there on
purpose by <hi>Andrea;</hi> because when the two
Pictures were together, they were apt to be
mistaken one for the other. <hi>Giulio</hi> having
seen the Mark, was Astonished, but said at
the same time, I Value it nevertheless, but
rather the more; it being a much rarer thing,
to have a Great Painter imitate the manner of
another so Exactly, than to do great Things
of his own.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Messer Baldo Magni</hi> of <hi>Prato,</hi>
having a mind to have a good Picture for the
Church of the <hi>Madonna del Carcere:</hi> Amongst
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43902:127"/>
other Painters who were mentioned to him,
<hi>Andrea</hi> was the Man he most inclined too, but
one <hi>Nicolo Soggi Santonino,</hi> having many
Friends, <hi>Messer Baldo</hi> was over persuaded to
let him have the Doing of it, though he had
sent for <hi>Andrea:</hi> Who being arrived, this <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colo</hi>
was so Impudent, as to offer to lay a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that he would out-do <hi>Andrea</hi> in any
Subject. <hi>Andrea</hi> provoked beyond Measure,
though naturally poor Spirited enough, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
That he had a Prentice with him, who
had not been long a Painter, but he would
lay of his side against <hi>Nicolo,</hi> scorning to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himself in the Contest, as being like to
reap little Honour by the Victory; and so
returned to <hi>Florence.</hi> In the mean time, one
of the Servile Fathers, in giving leave to a
Lady, to permute a Vow she had made, had
obliged her to cause a <hi>Madonna</hi> to be made,
in a part of their Convent: And the Father
having the disposing of the Money, spoke to
<hi>Andrea</hi> to undertake it, though the price was
but small. He, who never stood for Money,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43902:127"/>
said, he would. And Drew our Lady, with
her Son in her Arms, and a Saint <hi>Joseph,</hi> who
leaning upon a Sack, looks upon a Book, that
is open before him. This Work, both for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
Grace, Colouring, and <hi>Relievo,</hi> shows him
to have surpassed all former Painters to this
day; and is now visited by Strangers, under
the famous Name of the <hi>Madonna del Sacco,</hi> 'tis
upon the Door of the Cloister of the <hi>Annunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi>
as you go into the Church.</p>
            <p>There wanted one Story to the Cloister, of
the Company of the <hi>Scalzo,</hi> therefore <hi>Andrea,</hi>
who had much greatned his Manner, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Figures that <hi>Michel Angelo</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
and almost Finished, for the <hi>Sacristi</hi> of
Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> put a Hand to this last Story,
which was the Birth of Saint <hi>John Baptist;</hi>
the Figures in it are of a greater <hi>Relievo,</hi> than
any he ever made before. And particularly,
there is the figure of a Woman, who carries
the New Born Babe to the Bed-side, where
Saint <hi>Elizabeth</hi> receives it; that is an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
figure. The figure of <hi>Zachariah</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43902:128"/>
who Writes his Sons Name upon a piece
of Paper, which he holds upon his Knee; is
a most Lively thing. As likewise, the figure
of an Old Woman, who sitting by, seems to
Laugh at the Child-bearing of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who
was also an Old Woman.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>John Baptista della Palla,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made an excellent Collection of Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Pictures, to Adorn an Appartment
for <hi>Francis</hi> the first, which should be the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of that kind, that could be had, spared no
Cost to get the best things that were in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi>
and amongst the rest, he set <hi>Andrea</hi> to
Work, giving him hopes, that it would be a
means to make him recover the Kings favour,
and return to his Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrea</hi> therefore made two Pictures, the one
the Sacrifice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Aptitudes and
Colouring of which are Admirable; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
a Passage, or Landskip, most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
done, and proper to the Story. The
other, the Picture of Charity, with Three
little Boys about her; but neither of these
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43902:128"/>
Pictures came to the King's Hands, for <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tista
della Palla,</hi> being taken prisoner. <hi>Philippo
Strozzi</hi> bought the first, and presented it to
<hi>Alphonso Davalos,</hi> Marquis <hi>Del Guasto,</hi> who
placed it in the Isle of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> hard by <hi>Naples,</hi>
in a Pallace that he had there. And the other
was Bought of <hi>Andrea</hi>'s Wife, after her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
Death, by <hi>Dominico Conti,</hi> a Painter;
who Sold it again to <hi>Nicolo Antenori,</hi> who keeps
it as a Rare piece, as indeed it is.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Octavian</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how much <hi>Andrea</hi> had mended his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of late, was desirous to have a piece of
his Doing. And <hi>Andrea</hi> who was much Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to him for many Favours, made him a
<hi>Madonna,</hi> with her little Son upon her Knees,
who turns his Head towards a Saint <hi>John
Baptist,</hi> who is held by his Mother Saint <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth;</hi>
the whole Wrought with Incredible
Art and Diligence. The Picture being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and brought to <hi>Octavian</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> he
liked it extreamly; but it Being the time of
the Siege of <hi>Florence,</hi> and he being taken up
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43902:129"/>
with other Thoughts, desired <hi>Andrea</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose
of it to whom he would: To which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea</hi>
made no other Answer, then that it was
made for him, and that it should be his, or
no Bodies; and accordingly refused all the
Offers, and Entreaties that were made to him
by other people, though <hi>Octavian</hi> had desired
him to Sell it, and keep the Money for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>The Siege being over, and the Family of
<hi>Medicis</hi> Settled in the Government, <hi>Andrea</hi>
carried his Picture once more to <hi>Signior Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viano,</hi>
who then took it with Joy; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him twice the Value of it, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him over and above: And this Picture is
still in the Hands of his Lady.</p>
            <p>During the Siege of <hi>Florence,</hi> some of the
chief Commanders that were in the Cities
pay, having run away with the Moneys they
had received, Order was given, to have them
Painted upon the Front of the Pallace of the
<hi>Podesta,</hi> and <hi>Andrea</hi> was spoke to do it: He
excused himself in publick, and gave the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43902:129"/>
of it to one of his Prentices, called, <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
del Buda;</hi> but he privately every day went
in at a Hole made in the Wall, and came out
again by Night, so that the Work was by him
so Finished, that the Persons designed to be
Represented, seemed to be there Alive. But
afterwards, by Order of the Government,
they were Wiped out, as well as some Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Citizens, who in that time had been
declared Rebels, and painted in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by <hi>Andrea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Siege, the Plague was discovered
in the City, and <hi>Andrea,</hi> whether out of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of it, or by some other Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Life, fell Sick; where being forsaken
by his own Wife, for fear of the plague, he
Died no Body knows how, and was Buried
with little Ceremony, in the Church of the
<hi>Serviles,</hi> hard by his House.</p>
            <p>He was but Two and Forty Years Old, and
he continually had so Improved himself to
that Time, that it is to be thought, if he had
Lived longer, he had still added some new
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43902:130"/>
Improvement to the Art. He wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to have Worked some time in
<hi>Rome,</hi> to have made his Manner, which was
Sweet and Free, Noble and Great, by the
viewing of the Antiquities that are there;
the Study of which alone, is that which gives
Richness of Invention in Story, and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Figures. But the Reason why he
wanted that Accomplishment, was, because
while he was there, it was when <hi>Raphael</hi> had
already made many Excellent Schollars,
young Men, of a fresher Date than <hi>Andrea,</hi>
who found that it would cost him a terrible
deal of pains, to keep pace with them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being naturally poor Spirited, he thought
it best to go back to <hi>Florence,</hi> where his Works
were already Admired, and Valued, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they deserved, though he in his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
took so little for them; that they who
have since Sold any of them, have had three
times the Value of their first Cost.</p>
            <p>After his death, his Designs were in the
Hands of <hi>Dominico Conti,</hi> one of his Schollars,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43902:130"/>
though none of the best; he had a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but all did not attain to so great a degree
of Skill, as some did. The best were <hi>Jacopo
da Puntormo, Andrea Ignazzella,</hi> who has painted
a Country House, some where by <hi>Paris,</hi> much
after <hi>Andrea</hi>'s manner. <hi>Il solos meo Pier Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco
di Jacopi di Sandro, Francesco Salviati,</hi> and
<hi>Georgio Vasari,</hi> the Author of these Lives,
though he Lived but a very little while with
him: <hi>Jacopo del Conte Nannoccio,</hi> who is still in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dominico Conti,</hi> out of Gratitude, caused a
Marble Effigies of his Master, to be set up
against a Pillar, in the Church of the <hi>Serviles,</hi>
with this Inscription:</p>

            <head>The LIFE of
RAPHAEL
DEL URBIN,
A
Painter and Architect.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>RAphael</hi> was Born in <hi>Vrbino,</hi> a known Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Italy,</hi> upon a <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> in the
Year 1483. his Father's Name was <hi>Giovanni
de Santi,</hi> a Painter of no very great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but a Judicious and Discreet Man:
And, who having himself been Entred in
an ill Way, and by a Master of the Old
Manner, had yet so much Knowledg, as to
direct his Son in a better; finding him a very
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:43902:132"/>
forward Child, and much enclined to the
Art, in so much, that even under his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
he had so far profited, as to be very
useful to his Father, in divers pieces that he
Wrought in the State of <hi>Vrbin.</hi> But he as a
kind Father, being very sensible that <hi>Raphael</hi>
could never attain to any great Skill by his
Teaching, resolved to find him out a better
Master; and pitched upon <hi>Pietro Perugino,</hi> who
had then the Reputation of one of the most
Excellent Masters of his Time. <hi>Pietro</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the offer made him of <hi>Raphael</hi> for his
Schollar: And as soon as he saw the great
Beginnings he had already in the Art of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing,
and withal, observed the sweetness
of his Temper, and the modesty of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
he made that Judgment of him,
which since has been confirmed by Effects
'Tis a thing worth Observing, that <hi>Raphael</hi>
studying the Manner of <hi>Pietro Perugino,</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
it so well in every thing, that his
pieces could not be known from his Masters;
as appears to this day, by a piece in Oyl, which
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43902:132"/>
he did for <hi>Madonna Magdalena de Glioddi.</hi> In
Saint <hi>Francesco</hi> of <hi>Perugia.</hi> 'tis an Assumption
of our Lady, and our Saviour putting the
Crown upon her Head; the Twelve Apostles
are round about the Sepulcher, admiring the
Coelestial Glory she is Adorned with. 'Tis
done with great Diligence, and they who
are not very Skilful in knowing of Manners,
would easily believe, it were of <hi>Pietro Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gino</hi>'s
doing; and yet without doubt, it is of
<hi>Raphael</hi>'s. Who painted likewise, two pieces
in <hi>Citta di Castello,</hi> the one a Crucifix, in the
<hi>Dominican</hi> Church; in which, if he had not
Writ his Name, there is no Body that would
believe it <hi>Raphael</hi>'s, but rather <hi>Pietro Perugino</hi>'s.
The other a Marriage of our Ladies, in which
one may particularly observe, how <hi>Raphael</hi>
gains upon <hi>Perugino,</hi> and begins to Surpass
him. In this Piece, there is a Temple drawn
with so delicate a Prospective, that it is Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
to observe, what Difficulties and Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Art, he showed in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:43902:133"/>
Having by this time, attained to some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
he was called by his Friend <hi>Pintu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richio,</hi>
who had undertaken the Painting of
the Library of the <hi>Domo,</hi> at <hi>Sienna,</hi> at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the Second, who was Native
of that place; and <hi>Pinturichio,</hi> knowing <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>
to be a most Excellent Designer, was
glad of his Assistance, who accordingly made
divers of the <hi>Cartoons</hi> for that Work, but did
not continue, because he had a mind to go to
<hi>Florence,</hi> to see the <hi>Cartoon</hi> of <hi>Leonardo da Vinci,</hi>
which he had made for the great Pallace Hall;
which had made such a Noise in the World,
that all the Lovers of Art, came far and near
to admire it. Particularly, <hi>Michel Angelo,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
also at the same time, made some Naked
Figures in Competition with <hi>Leonardo,</hi> which
were no less admirable. Being come to <hi>Florence,</hi>
and having admired those Works as Divine,
the City pleased him likewise so well, that he
resolved to Live in it for some time.</p>
            <p>There he presently contracted Friendship,
not only with all the young Painters of his
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43902:133"/>
Time, but also with many of the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Citizens, by whom he was highly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and Caressed, particularly by <hi>Taddeo
Taddei,</hi> who Lodged him in his House, and
made him constantly Eat at his Table: And
<hi>Raphael,</hi> who was not to be overcome in Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
made two pieces for him, which have
something more of the Way of <hi>Perugino,</hi> than
of that which he Studied since. He was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
likewise with <hi>Lorenzo Nasi,</hi> for whom
he made an Excellent <hi>Madonna;</hi> but it,
in the Fall of his House, which was Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by an Earthquake, was all broken
to pieces; nevertheless, the pieces being Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out of the Ruines, were put together as
well as might be, and are yet preserved by
<hi>Baptista Nasi,</hi> a great Lover of the Art, and
Son and Heir to the said <hi>Lorenzo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Father and Mother
being both Dead, he was forced to go to <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bino,</hi>
to look after his Domestick Affairs; and
there he did some pieces for <hi>Guidobaldo da Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeltro,</hi>
who was then Captain General of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43902:134"/>
               <hi>Florentines;</hi> and amongst the rest, a Picture
of our Saviour in the Garden, and the three
Apostles asleep at a distance: This piece is so
perfectly Finished, that no Miniature can be
better. It was given by <hi>Signora Leonora,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Vrbin</hi>'s Wife, to <hi>Don Petro Quirini,</hi> and
<hi>Don Paulo Justiniani, Venetians</hi> and <hi>Hermites</hi> of
the <hi>Camaldoli,</hi> and was by them placed as a
Relick in the chief Room of the said Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Vrbin</hi> he went to <hi>Perugia,</hi> where he
Worked for the Nuns of Saint <hi>Antonino,</hi> and
made them a Picture, where according to the
Simplicity of those Ladies, he made our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Cloathed, sitting in his Mothers Lap;
and on one side of our Lady, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> Saint <hi>Cecily,</hi> and Saint <hi>Katherine;</hi> to
those two Virgins, he gave the sweetest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,
with the finest Dress for their
Heads, a thing Rare in those Days. The
whole Work is very much Esteemed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the first in which <hi>Raphael</hi> began
to change his Manner, since his being at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,,</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:43902:134"/>
so that now it differed as much from
his Master <hi>Perugino</hi>'s, as if it had been two
distinct Hands. After some stay at <hi>Perugia,</hi>
he returned to <hi>Florence</hi> again, and there fell
to Studying very hard, both by the Old
Paintings of <hi>Mosaccio,</hi> and by the New ones
of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> and <hi>Michel Angelo.</hi> He Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a most particular Friendship with <hi>Fra.
Bartholomeo di San Marco,</hi> having his Colouring
in great Esteem, and endeavouring to Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it; and in Exchange, he Taught <hi>Fra.
Bartholomeo,</hi> the manner of Working things
in Prospective, to which the Good Father was
an absolute Stranger: But his Study was again
Interrupted, by the Importunity of some great
Persons of <hi>Perugia,</hi> so that he was forced to
return to that place. He carried with him
a <hi>Cartoon,</hi> which he had done at <hi>Florence,</hi> at the
Solicitation of the <hi>Signora Atalanta Baglioni.</hi>
The Story was the Burial of our Saviour. In
this piece, <hi>Raphael</hi> has admirably Expressed
the Grief of our Lady, who is fallen in a
Swound, by the Dead Corps; and that of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43902:135"/>
Saint <hi>John,</hi> who with his Hands crossed in
each other, and looks down with the saddest
Countenance imaginable. And indeed, who
ever shall well consider the Diligence, Care,
and Affection, with which this piece is Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
must be in a kind of Ravishment at the
Air of the Figures, the Beauty of the Drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and above all, a certain Sweetness that is
spread all through the Work.</p>
            <p>There being about this time, many Artists
of all kinds Employed at <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Pope Giulio</hi>
the Second, <hi>Bramanto</hi> of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> amongst the
rest being there, Writ to <hi>Raphael,</hi> to whom
he was something a Kin, to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> for
that he had spoke to the <hi>Pope</hi> of him. At his
arrival, being very well received by the <hi>Pope,</hi>
he found him busied in Embellishing his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and particularly, in Painting his best
Rooms in <hi>Fresco,</hi> by the Hands of the most
famous Masters of that Time; there was one
Room quite finished by <hi>Pietro della Francesca;
Luca di Cortona,</hi> had very much forwarded a
<hi>Facciata,</hi> or Frontice-piece of another. And
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43902:135"/>
               <hi>Don Pietro della Gasta,</hi> Abbot of Saint <hi>Clement</hi> of
<hi>Arezzo,</hi> had begun another Story. Likewise
<hi>Bramantino</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> had made some Figures,
which being done after the Life, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
Valued. <hi>Raphael</hi> therefore took to
himself the Chamber of the <hi>Segnatura,</hi> and
there begun a Story of the Divines agreeing,
Philosophy and Astrologie, with Divinity;
and in it are drawn all the Antient Wise
Men and Philosophers, disputing in different
Manners. By themselves there are some
Astrologers, who have made Figures upon
Tables, and send them to the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
by certain Angels. But amongst the
rest, is the Figure of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> lying all along
upon the Stairs, with his Dish in his Hand;
which is a very Contemplative figure, and
much to be Commended, as well as the figures
of the Astrologers, whose Aptitude in Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with their Compasses upon Tables, is
admirable. There is among other Figures,
one of a Young Man, who opening his Arms,
and bending his Head on one side, seems to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43902:136"/>
be in the act of admiring; it is the Picture
of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi>
who was then in <hi>Rome. Raphael</hi>'s own Picture
is also there, next to <hi>Zoroaster</hi>'s, who holds a
Caelestial Globe in his Hand; and the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician,
who seems so attentive with his
Compasses, is the Picture of <hi>Bramante,</hi> and
so like him, that he seems alive.</p>
            <p>He adorned his Work with a most delicate
Prospective, and such Variety of fine Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
of so delicate a Manner, that Pope
<hi>Julio</hi> caused all that had been done by other
Masters, both Old and Modern, to be quite
Demolished, to make room for more of his.
But <hi>Raphael</hi> spared some of the Work of <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,
Antonio Sodoma,</hi> of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> and made use
of the Compartiments and Grotesks of it:
And in the four Rounds, he made four Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
of some Signification to the Stories
under them, and turned each of them to its
proper Story.</p>
            <p>In the first, is a Woman, which is made
to represent Knowledg, and on each Hand a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43902:136"/>
Goddess <hi>Cybele;</hi> she sits in a Chair, and is
Represented with many Breasts, with which
the Antients painted their <hi>Diana Polimasta.</hi>
Her Clothes are of four Colours, to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the four Elements; from her Head to
her Waste, is the Fire-Colour, and from her
Waste downwards, the three others, the
Water being the last; and there are by her
some young Children, very finely done.</p>
            <p>In another Round towards the Window,
which looks upon <hi>Belvedere,</hi> is Represented
<hi>Poesie,</hi> in the person of <hi>Polyhimnia,</hi> Crowned
with Laurel, and with an Air more than
Mortal: She directs her Looks to Heaven,
having two Youths by her, who by their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity,
seem ready to receive her Commands;
underneath this, was the Story of <hi>Parnassus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third Round, which is over the
Story, where the Doctors of the Church are
ordering the Mass; there is represented Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
with Books, and other Ornaments
about her, and likewise two Boys.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:43902:137"/>
In the fourth Round, is Justice with her
Ballances, and a Sword, with two Boys, as
all the others.</p>
            <p>He made likewise in the four Corners of the
Vault, or Ceiling, four Stories, but of lesser
Figures, yet extreamly well Designed, and
delicately Coloured; and they are <hi>Adam</hi>'s Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the forbidden Fruit, which looks towards
the Story of Divinity underneath; near that
of <hi>Astrologie,</hi> there is that Art, which places
the fixed Stars and Planets, all in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Situation. Over the Picture of <hi>Poesie,</hi>
there is the Story of <hi>Marsias,</hi> who is tied to
a Tree, and Flead by <hi>Apollo;</hi> and over, the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>
of the giving the Civil and Canonical
Laws, there is the Story of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Judgment,
when he Ordered the Child to be cut in two.</p>
            <p>Having finished the Vault, or Ceiling, we
must now say, what were the Stories painted
underneath.</p>
            <p>In that part which looks towards <hi>Belvedere,</hi>
he drew the Mount <hi>Parnassus,</hi> with the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Helicon,</hi> and upon the Mountain made a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43902:137"/>
Wood of Laurels, so Green and Lively, that
the very trembling of the Leaves by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
breath of Air stirring about them, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
perceptible; and in the Air, there flie
about an infinite number of Cupids, who
gather Branches of Laurel, and having form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them into Garlands and Wreaths, scatter
them all about the Hill, which is filled with
Poets in different postures; some Sitting,
some Standing, some Writing, some Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and others Talking together by pairs,
or more, as the Painter thought fit to sort
them. But the Figures are all so Lively
and their Actions so proper and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that one would really think, the
Workman Inspired with some of that Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which the Poets lay claim too. These
Figures were all done after some Antient
Statues, or Models; and the Modern Poets,
who are there Represented, and were then
Alive, and are all done after the Life. There
on one Side, you see <hi>Ovid, Virgil, Emius, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullus,
Catullus, Propertius,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
Singing of Verses, and having one at
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43902:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Feet, who Writes them down. Then in
a <hi>Gruppo</hi> by themselves, are <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the
<hi>Nine Muses,</hi> with such Beauty in the Air of
their Heads, that one may easily know them
to be the Divinities of Verse. On the other
Side, is the Learned <hi>Sappio,</hi> the most Divine
<hi>Dante,</hi> Gentle <hi>Pearch,</hi> and Amarous <hi>Boccaccio,</hi>
with a great many more of the Moderns; the
whole Work being extreamly well finished.</p>
            <p>On another Wall in the same Room, he
drew our Saviour and the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> Saint
<hi>John Baptist,</hi> the Apostles, the Evangelists and
Martyrs, all upon Clouds in the Air, and
above over them, God the Father, who sends
the Holy Ghost over a great number of Saints
of all sorts. There are likewise, the four
Doctors of the Church, with <hi>Domenick Francis,
Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure Scotus, Nicolas di
Lira Savanarola,</hi> and a great many Divines
drawn, many after the Life: In the Air are
four Boys, who hold the four Evangelists.
The Excellency of this Picture is great, for
as the Figures are all Sitting, and in the Air
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43902:138"/>
the Shortnings are very Artificial; so as they
slide away from the Eye by degrees, just as
if they were of true <hi>Relievo.</hi> Their Drapery
likewise is very Curious, both in the Fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Liveliness of Colours: The Air of
our Saviour's Head is admirable, having in
it all that Mildness and Pity, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Divinity, made Man.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it was <hi>Raphael</hi>'s particular Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
to give the proper Air to his Heads, as
he has done here all along; making our Ladies
Countenance Sweet and Gentle, the Apostles
Grave, but Honest and Plain, the Martyrs
Zealous, and full of Faith: But particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he showed great Art in the Heads of the
Doctors of the Church, who disputing two
by two, or three by three, show in their
Countenances great Curiosity, and in their
Actions an endeavour of discovering the truth
of all their Doubts.</p>
            <p>On the other side of the Room by the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
he drew <hi>Justinian,</hi> giving his Laws to
the Doctors, who correct them; and over
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43902:139"/>
him, <hi>Temperance, Force,</hi> and <hi>Prudence;</hi> and on
the other hand he drew the <hi>Pope,</hi> giving the
<hi>Decretals,</hi> or <hi>Cannon Law;</hi> and in the person of
the <hi>Pope,</hi> he drew <hi>Pope Julio,</hi> after the Life; as
also <hi>Jean, Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Pope Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth; Anthony Cardinal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte,</hi>
and <hi>Cardinal Alexander Farneze,</hi> who was
also <hi>Pope,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Third.</hi> The
<hi>Pope</hi> remained extreamly satisfied with this
Work; and that nothing might be wanting
to set it out, he sent for <hi>Francis Giovanni di Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
who was famous for <hi>Carving</hi> in <hi>Wood,</hi> to
make the Frames; who not only did that,
but also adorn'd the Room with most dilicate
Doors and Seats, which gave him great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with the <hi>Pope;</hi> and indeed, in that sort
of Work, there was never any that exceeded
this <hi>Fra. Giovanni;</hi> as may be seen to this day
in a <hi>Sacrista</hi> in <hi>Verona,</hi> the place of his Birth, in
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Sancta Maria</hi> in <hi>Organo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Raphael:</hi> His Skill and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
increased so together, that the Pope
would needs have him undertake a second
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43902:139"/>
               <hi>Chamber</hi> towards the <hi>Sala Grande;</hi> but first, he
drew the Pope's own Picture at length, so
strong and lively, that it astonished all those
who saw it; and it is to this day preserv'd in
<hi>Sancta Maria del Popolo,</hi> together with a Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his doing; both these Pictures are showed
only upon Holy-days.</p>
            <p>All this while, though <hi>Raphael</hi> had acquir'd
very great fame, and though he was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
studying the best pieces of Antiquity in
<hi>Rome,</hi> yet he had not hitherto given any Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Majesty to his <hi>Figures;</hi> his Manner,
though soft, yet being mean and low in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
great things.</p>
            <p>But it happened about this time, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Angelo,</hi> who was painting the Pope's <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
was forced to fly to <hi>Florence,</hi> for an Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that shall be mentioned in his Life, and
left with <hi>Bramante</hi> the Key of the <hi>Chappel;</hi> who
being an Intimate Friend of <hi>Raphael's,</hi> showed
him the whole Work, that he might compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi>'s Manner; which he did
so strongly, that immediately he went and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43902:140"/>
did over again the <hi>Figure</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
which he had already finished in the Church
of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> and gave it that noble, great
Manner which most of the Works of <hi>Michael
Angelo</hi> have; who being come back to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and having seen this Alteration of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s
Manner, imagined presently, that <hi>Bramante</hi>
had been false to him in his absence, to oblige
his Friend <hi>Raphael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Augustin Chigi,</hi> a very Rich
Merchant of <hi>Sienna,</hi> but Living in <hi>Rome,</hi> and a
great Admirer and Encourager of <hi>Artists,</hi> made
<hi>Raphael</hi> draw that famous <hi>Galataea</hi> in a <hi>Sea-Char,</hi>
environed with <hi>Tritons</hi> and <hi>Sea-Nymphs,</hi>
and <hi>Gods;</hi> as is yet to be seen in his Pallace of
<hi>Transtevere:</hi> and being extreamly satisfied with
that Work, which has an unimitable sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and nobleness in it, he got him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
a <hi>Chappel</hi> for him in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Sancta
Maria della Pace,</hi> on the Right Hand; and in
it <hi>Raphael</hi> drew some <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Sybils;</hi> which
are particularly esteemed among all the things
he ever did; but he had then seen <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>'s
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43902:140"/>
               <hi>Chappel,</hi> and had taken to that magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
new way; and in it likewise he showed
a most dilicate and perfect <hi>Colouring,</hi> as appears
in the Women and Children; all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
together, made this Work be valued
for the best he ever did, and that from which
he drew his greatest Fame, both Dead and
Alive.</p>
            <p>After this, he went on with the Rooms of
the Pope's <hi>Pallace;</hi> where he painted the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a <hi>Miracle</hi> that happened at <hi>Orvieto</hi> to a
Priest, who being Incredulous in the point of
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> had the <hi>Host</hi> dissolved into
Blood before him, as he Celebrated <hi>Mass:</hi> In
the person of the Priest, whose Face is all red
with Shame and Confusion, you may see the
fright so strange an Accident put him in,
and the very trembling of his Hands is sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Lookers on; round about him, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>
drew many <hi>Figures,</hi> some Serving <hi>Mass,</hi>
others at a distance, in different Postures and
Aptitudes upon the hearing the strangeness
of the thing; and amongst the rest, there is a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43902:141"/>
Woman with a Child in her Arms, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told the thing by another, expresses great
wonder in her Looks and Action, with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Womanish Behaviour and Grace: On
the other hand he feigned Pope <hi>Julius</hi> to be
present at this <hi>Miracle,</hi> and drew him, and
Cardinal St. <hi>Georgio,</hi> with many others of his
<hi>Court;</hi> and in the empty part of a Window,
which was in his way, he painted a <hi>Stair-Case,</hi>
with different <hi>Figures</hi> upon it; so that it
united with the rest of the Story, and made it
one intire piece. And in truth, it must be
said of <hi>Raphael,</hi> that in the Invention and
Composition of any Story whatsoever, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
all the <hi>Painters</hi> of his Time, and had a
clear and strong Imagination, as he showed in
the same Room, in a Story over against this:
it is, when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is kept by <hi>Herod's</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in the Prison; where the <hi>Architecture</hi> is
so judicious and various, and yet so proper for
the place, that one must confess his Genius to
be admirable, in adapting his Inventions to
the truth of the History, according to what
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43902:141"/>
is delivered us in Writing; as here, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and horrour of the Prison, the deep Sleep
that oppresses the Souldiers, the splendour of
the <hi>Angel</hi> at his appearance, by which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is so enlightned, that all that is in it is
distinguishable; there are all Beauties proper
to the Story; as also, when Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> freed
from his <hi>Chains,</hi> goes out of the Prison in the
company of the <hi>Angel;</hi> for Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
is that of a Man in a Dream; and in
the Guards without, there is a Surprize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Sleeping and Waking, while one of
them with a Torch in his hand, endeavours to
waken the rest; and by that means, gives the
necessary Light to the Piece, to see the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and Posture of the Souldiers; and where
that Light doth not fall, the <hi>Painter</hi> hath
most ingeniously made use of the <hi>Moon:</hi> all
which being likewise painted within a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
th<gap reason="illegible: broken type" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Facciata</hi> is still the more obscure;
and the<gap reason="illegible: broken type" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> by it happens, that when any one
looks upon the <hi>Picture,</hi> the Light strikes him
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43902:142"/>
in the Face, and the true Light from without
makes, as it were, a contest with the painted
Light within, and makes you see the very
smoak of the Torch, and the splendour of the
<hi>Angel</hi>'s Appearance so strong, that you can
hardly perswade your self it is a thing paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the shadows of the <hi>Armour,</hi> the reflexion
and warmth of the other Lights being paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such a proper Gloominess, that it
must be owned, he is the Master of Masters in
<hi>Colouring</hi> and <hi>Invention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He drew likewise another Story about the
attempt that <hi>Heliodorus</hi> made to Rob the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Time of the High
Priest <hi>Onias;</hi> where the furious action of an
invisible Horseman, waited upon by two on
Foot; and striking <hi>Heliodorus</hi> from his Horse,
is remarkable; for his Followers not seeing
those that strike him, and wondering at his
fall, are so surprized, that they let slip out of
their hands the Treasures and Riches of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> which they had already begun to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
at a distance, is the holy Priest <hi>Onias</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43902:142"/>
his knees, with his Eyes and Hands lifted
up to Heaven, expressing in his Countenance
the Joy, mingled with Grief and Compassion,
that that action of Violence, and the sudden
Relief sent from Heaven, had produced in
him; there are besides, many of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
who being got upon the Bases of the
Pillars, and holding by them, are in very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
postures, strongly attentive to the Event
of the Business, with various Expressions
of Astonishment and Fear in their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>This Work was so wonderful in all its
parts, that to this day, the <hi>Cartoons</hi> are had in
the greatest esteem imaginable: and <hi>Signior
Francisco Massini,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Cesena,</hi> who
without any Master, by his own Industry,
has attained to a great perfection in <hi>Painting;</hi>
has amongst his rare Collection of <hi>Designs</hi> and
<hi>Relievoes,</hi> some Pieces of this <hi>Cartoon,</hi> and keeps
them with the true Veneration due to such
Relicks.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Raphael</hi> was thus incouraged by
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43902:143"/>
the Pope, and astonishing on his side the whole
World with the noble productions of his <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
Death took away <hi>Giulius</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> the
great Patron of all Arts: but <hi>Fortune,</hi> though
envious in that, yet was kind in his Successor
<hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth;</hi> who ordered all the projects of
his Predecessor to be continued, being himself,
both by Birth and Inclination, a most Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<hi>Prince:</hi> accordingly, <hi>Raphael</hi> pursuing
his work, drew on another side of the same
Room, the coming of <hi>Attila</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and his
being met at the foot of <hi>Monte Mario</hi> by <hi>Leo</hi>
the <hi>Third,</hi> then <hi>Pope,</hi> who oblig'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
back again only by the Gravity of his
Aspect. In this place <hi>Raphael</hi> drew Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> with Swords
drawn in their hands to defend the <hi>Church,</hi> and
they have in their Countenances and Actions
that <hi>Coelestial Ardour</hi> with which Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires
its Saints in defending the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<hi>Attila,</hi> who is upon a dilicate black
Horse, with white Feet, and a Star in his
Forehead, lifts up his Eyes, as frighted with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43902:143"/>
the Vision, and seems to turn away from it,
and desire to be gone; in his Company are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Horsemen, whose Horses are most rarely
done, particularly, a Spotted <hi>Gennet,</hi> which is
mounted by a <hi>Figure,</hi> who shows all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
that may be, being Armed in some places
with Armour that resembles the Scales of
<hi>Fishes,</hi> which he took from <hi>Trajan's Column,</hi>
where there are people Armed after this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.</hi>
He drew likewise, after the Life, some
<hi>Mace-Bearers</hi> that wait upon the <hi>Pope;</hi> and
with them, the whole <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi>
and the <hi>Grooms</hi> that lead the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Horse, upon
which he is Cloathed in his <hi>Pontifical Habits;</hi>
and under the person of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the then present Pontife <hi>Leo</hi> the
<hi>Tenth,</hi> with many of his <hi>Courtiers;</hi> all after the
Life. And indeed, we may say of all other
<hi>Pictures,</hi> that they are <hi>Pictures;</hi> but of <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s,
that they are <hi>Alive;</hi> the very <hi>Flesh</hi> seems
to be soft and tremble at the touch, and is full
of spirit and feeling: so that his Reputation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43902:144"/>
in this particular, is beyond that of all that
ever were before, or since.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Picture</hi> of the same <hi>Pope,</hi> with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Giulian</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Rossi,</hi> where
the Figures seem to be absolutely round; and
out of the Piece, the <hi>Velvet</hi> and <hi>Damask</hi> which
the <hi>Pope</hi> wears, have both the softness and shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which is proper to them, and the <hi>Ermines</hi>
so natural, that they seem real; in a word,
there seems to be no Colours there, but all
real <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Gold;</hi> there is upon the Table a
Parchment painted in <hi>Miniature,</hi> and a Silver
Bell; which are both finished beyond expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
but amongst the rest, there is one of the
Balls of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Chair, which being guilded,
reflects the Light upon the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Shoulders
and the Room, as if it were the real <hi>Sun Beams:</hi>
In a word, 'tis impossible for any Master to go
beyond this. For this Piece the <hi>Pope</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him richly; and it is yet to be seen in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
amongst that Duke's Collections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raphael</hi> finding himself thus highly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
and Esteemed, and having a generous
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43902:144"/>
Spirit of his own, built a Pallace to preserve
his Memory to Posterity, it is in <hi>Borgo a Novo;</hi>
and <hi>Bramante,</hi> one of the best <hi>Architects</hi> in his
Time, made the Model of it in Cast
Work.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> a famous <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Painter,</hi> and an admirable Ingraver of
Prints, sent his Picture to <hi>Raphael;</hi> it was <hi>wove</hi>
upon a Cloth, so as to be seen alike on both
sides the Cloth, he having taken the Lights
from the Cloth, and the Shadows from some
Water Colours which that Cloth was wrought
with. The Picture was very much admired
by <hi>Raphael;</hi> who in Return, sent <hi>Albert</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of his best Drawings; and being desirous
to try <hi>Albert</hi>'s way of Graving in plates of
<hi>Brass,</hi> he made <hi>Marc Antonio</hi> of <hi>Bologna</hi> apply
himself entirely to that Art; in which he
proved so excellent, that afterwards he was
<hi>Raphael</hi>'s chief <hi>Graver;</hi> and most of the things
we have of that kind, of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s, are done by
him; who indeed surpassed <hi>Albert Durer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
as appear'd, when he counterfeited the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43902:145"/>
Story of the <hi>Passion</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> done by <hi>Albert,</hi> and
put <hi>Albert</hi>'s Name to it, and it sold so well
for the true one, that <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> to prevent
the Cheat, was fain to make a Journey from
<hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there complain to the
<hi>Government, Mark Antonio</hi> being at that time <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi>
there; and yet he only obtained, that
his Mark should not be counterfeited; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
liberty for any body to Imitate the rest,
that could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark Antonio</hi>'s best things after <hi>Raphael,</hi> are,
<hi>Lucretia</hi> killing her self, the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi>
the <hi>Massacre</hi> of the <hi>Innocents</hi> the <hi>Rape</hi> of <hi>Hellen,
Sancta Felicita</hi> boyl'd in Oyl, and her Children
Beheaded about her; <hi>Neptune,</hi> with little Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
out of the <hi>Enerde</hi> about him; a <hi>Venus</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
by a <hi>Cupid;</hi> God Blessing the Seed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> where is a Maid with the two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
the famous <hi>Galataea</hi> of <hi>Ghigi;</hi> and in a
word, most of the things painted by him in
the Pope's Pallace. There were likewise two
other famous <hi>Gravers</hi> that did many of his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43902:145"/>
things; <hi>to wit, Marco di Ravenna,</hi> &amp; <hi>Agostiano Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiano,</hi>
who marked his Prints with this Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>A. V.</hi> as the other did with <hi>Raphael</hi>'s, thus, <hi>R. S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Raphael</hi> made for the <hi>Monks</hi> of
<hi>Sancta Maria della Spasmo,</hi> in <hi>Palermo,</hi> a Picture
of our Saviour's carrying his <hi>Cross;</hi> which is
held as a most miraculous piece: in it the
Rage of his Crucifiers is exprest in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Countenances, and our Saviour lying
under the Load of his <hi>Cross,</hi> all bath'd in <hi>Sweat</hi>
and <hi>Blood,</hi> looks most passionately upon the
three <hi>Maries,</hi> who are in Tears by him; there
is likewise Saint <hi>Veronica,</hi> who with much
Charity and Compassion hold out her hands
to wipe his Face with a clean Linnen Cloth;
and behind, the Work is filled with Men on
Horseback, and on Foot, who croud out of
the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to go and see the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This piece was like to have miscarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
going home; for a most horrid Storm
having broke the Ship in which it was, upon
a Rock, and all the Men and Goods perishing,
this Picture being in a Case, was carried by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43902:146"/>
the Winds &amp; Seas as far as the Coast of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
and there taken up and opened, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
was by publick Order dispos'd of, it
having not at all been spoil'd, though it had
lain so long in Salt Water; the noise of this
Accident came at last to the Ears of the
<hi>Monks</hi> for whom the <hi>Picture</hi> was made; and
with much ado, by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Intercession,
they obtained from the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to have it restored, paying first the
Charges of those that had taken it up; which
they did largely, and so sent it to Sea a second
time; where it had better Fortune, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
safe in <hi>Palermo,</hi> and is no less famous there
than Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> is in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Amidst these Works for private persons,
<hi>Raphael</hi> neglected not to carry on the painting
of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Pallace, and in a little time he fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Chamber call'd, <hi>Di Torce Borgia;</hi> in
which he had made on every side a Story: in
one was the burning of the <hi>Borgo Vecchio,</hi> in
the Time of Saint <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Fourth;</hi> where he
puts it out with his Blessing alone, though all
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43902:146"/>
means had been tryed to quench it before, but
in vain. In this Story the Painter has drawn
all the Horrour of a Fire surprizing people
unprepar'd; some Women there are, who
while they are carrying Water to quench the
Fire, are, by the Storm of Wind which then
blew, all disordered in their Hair and Cloths,
and many of them blinded with Smoak, so as
not to know one another, or see what they
are doing. In another place, there is drawn
an Old Decrepit Man upon the Back of a
Young Man his Son, just as <hi>Virgil</hi> describes
<hi>Aenaeas</hi> and <hi>Anchises;</hi> and in the Figure of the
Young Man, is to be seen the Strength of his
<hi>Body</hi> as well as the Courage of his <hi>Mind,</hi> &amp; the
difficulty with which he struggles in holding
the Old, Helpless Sick Man, and avoiding at
the same time the Flames and Ruine that are
about him; on the other side, upon the top
of a House all on Fire, is a Lady naked in
her Smock, and holding a Child in her Arms,
which she is trying to throw it to one below,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43902:147"/>
who holds out his Arms and a Blanket to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Child; and in both these Figures,
the fear of the <hi>Flames,</hi> mingled with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for their tender Infant, are rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
nor is less admirable the Figure of
a Woman, who being all in an undress and
disorder, frighted in her looks, drives before
her two or three little <hi>Children,</hi> whom she
beats, to make them make hast to avoid the
fury of the fire: there are some other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who falling down on their knees before
St. <hi>Leo,</hi> seem to begg of him to stop the fury
of the fire; as he doth. The other Story is
of the same St. <hi>Leo;</hi> where the Painter has
drawn the Port of <hi>Othia,</hi> surpriz'd by a Navy
of <hi>Turks,</hi> who had a design to make the <hi>Pope</hi>
Prisoner: there you may see the <hi>Christians</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailing
the <hi>Turk's Fleet,</hi> now got to Sea, and
taking several Ships, the <hi>Captives</hi> of which are
Landed and set a Shore, being dragg'd by their
Beards into the presence of St. <hi>Leo,</hi> who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth</hi> in his <hi>Pontifical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi>
between <hi>Cardinal Bibiena</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Julian</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:43902:147"/>
of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who was afterwards <hi>Clement</hi> the
<hi>Seventh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other two Stories are, the <hi>Sacred Inuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of King <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> by this
<hi>Pope Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth,</hi> and the <hi>Crowning</hi> of him by
the same; and in them <hi>Raphael</hi> has drawn
most of the <hi>Courtiers</hi> of both Princes, after the
Life, and according to the Dress they were
then in; just by the King is a <hi>Child</hi> upon his
Knees, holding the Regal Crown, which is
<hi>Hyppolito</hi> of <hi>Medicis;</hi> who was since <hi>Cardinal,</hi>
and <hi>Vicechancellour</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Coeling</hi> of this Room was already paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the hand of <hi>Pietro Perugino, Raphael's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
he forbore therefore, out of respect to
him, to make any Alterations in it, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to remain entire as it was. 'Twas
hard for <hi>Raphael</hi> to do all these things by his
own hands; and therefore he was forced to
imploy divers excellent Workmen in all kinds;
and he had Designers, not only over all <hi>Italy,</hi>
but as far as <hi>Graece;</hi> that nothing might be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43902:148"/>
wanting that was any ways useful or Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to his Profession.</p>
            <p>After this, he painted a <hi>Hall</hi> for the <hi>Pope;</hi>
where having drawn in <hi>Terresta</hi> some Figures
of Saints and Apostles, he caused the rest of
the Room to be painted by <hi>Giovanni di Vdine</hi>
his Schollar; whose Genius lay particularly
in drawing all sorts of <hi>Animals,</hi> beyond any
Painter of his Time; he therefore drew all
those the <hi>Pope</hi> had at that time; as, a <hi>Cameleon,</hi>
a <hi>Civet-Cat,</hi> an <hi>Elephant,</hi> some <hi>Lyons, Monkeys,
Parrots,</hi> adorning the Intervals with <hi>Grottesks</hi>
of all kinds.</p>
            <p>He adorned the Pope's Pallace, not only
with Painting, but also with Architecture;
having, after the death of <hi>Bramante,</hi> given a
noble Design for the great <hi>Stair-Case</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
with much more Order and Ornament
than <hi>Bramante</hi> had invented, following in that
the Magnificent Humour of that Pope, who
spared no Cost of that kind; therefore <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
chose out divers able Men in most Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and assign'd them their Tasks, setting
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43902:148"/>
               <hi>Guiovanni di Vdine</hi> over the <hi>Grotesks</hi> and <hi>Stucco
Work; Giulio Romano</hi> had the overseeing of the
Figures, which were made most of them by
<hi>Giovan Francesco il Bologna, Perino del Vaga, Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legrino
da Modona, Vincensio da San Gimiano, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro
Caravagio,</hi> and many others; and for the
Carvings, he made <hi>Gian Barile</hi> do all those
over the Doors, and on the Ceiling.</p>
            <p>He made many Pictures for <hi>Forreigners,</hi> and
particularly, some for the King of <hi>France;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which, that of the Battle of Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
and the <hi>Devil,</hi> is esteemed a most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
piece: in it he drew a great burnt
<hi>Rock</hi> for the Center of the Earth, out of the
cleft of which came flashes of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone;</hi>
and in the person of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> all scorch'd
in his Members, you might perceive all the
<hi>Rage, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Spight</hi> that could be in a Soul
that had lost Empire and Peace, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to eternal pains and anguish: the
Figure of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> on the contray, is made
with a Coelestial Air, which expresses the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43902:149"/>
force with which he has overthrown <hi>Lucifer</hi>
at his feet; the King of <hi>France</hi> sent <hi>Raphael</hi> a
noble Reward for this piece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raphael</hi> was in his Nature of a very amorous
Complexion; for which reason, he took much
pleasure in drawing some of his Mistresses,
and other handsome Women, being always at
the Ladies Command; which made many of
his Friends likewise have Complacency's for
him in that kind something extraordinary;
as that of <hi>Signior Augustin Chighi,</hi> his great
Friend; who having obtain'd of <hi>Raphael</hi> to
paint the <hi>Lodge</hi> in his Pallace, he found that he
did not much mind the Work, by reason of a
Mistress he there had, to whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
going; whereupon he made means
to the Lady, and with much ado, obtain'd of
her to come and stay at his Pallace, and keep
<hi>Raphael</hi> company whil'st he work'd: by which
means the <hi>Lodge</hi> was finished to his Mind: he
made all the <hi>Cartoons</hi> with his own hand, and
coloured himself the best part of the Figures;
in the <hi>Vault</hi> or <hi>Ceiling</hi> he drew a Banquet of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43902:149"/>
the Gods and Goddesses; and in them one may
see many Habits taken from the Antients;
and he made <hi>Giovanni da Vdine</hi> make a Border
of <hi>Flowers, Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> in <hi>Festoons,</hi> most
extreamly fine.</p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>Pope</hi> gave order for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest
Hangings of Silk and Gold that it was
possible to make, and ordered them to be made
at <hi>Antwerp;</hi> to which place the <hi>Cartoons</hi> were
sent by <hi>Raphael,</hi> all drawn and coloured by his
own hand; and by the <hi>Artists</hi> there so exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
imitated, that the Silk and Gold seem
Colours, and not Weaving; and indeed, it is
an astonishing thing to see how the very Hair
and Beards of the Figures are as distinct and
fine as the Life it self; and the Houses, Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips,
Prospectives, all as Natural and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
as any <hi>Painter</hi> can make them: this Work
cost the <hi>Pope</hi> seventy thousand Crowns, and is
still preserved in the <hi>Papal Chappel.</hi> Much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time likewise he began the great
Hall above Stairs, where the Victories of
<hi>Constantine</hi> are painted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:43902:150"/>
Having thus described most of the Works
of this excellent <hi>Painter;</hi> before I come to
other particulars of his Life or Death, I
think it may not be amiss, to say something
of his manner in painting.</p>
            <p>At first, he imitated the manner of his
Master <hi>Pietro Perugino,</hi> and mended it much,
both for <hi>Colouring, Invention,</hi> and <hi>Design;</hi> but
coming afterwards to see the manner of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo
da Vinci,</hi> whose Heads, both of Men and
Women had all the Life and Spirit imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and whose Figures had a particular Grace
and Motion, not expressed by any before him;
<hi>Raphael</hi> became astonished, and resolved to
study <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s manner; which he did with
infinite pains and diligence; and yet, in some
things, was forc't to come short of <hi>Leonardo;</hi>
for though in the Opinion of many, he out
did him in a certain <hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,</hi>
yet in strong <hi>Conceit,</hi> and a certain great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Design,</hi> he could not reach him; nor
indeed, hardly any <hi>Painter</hi> could come up to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43902:150"/>
               <hi>Leonardo</hi> in that point; but <hi>Raphael</hi> came nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
him, particularly in the Graces of his
Colouring. This first manner of his, which
he learn'd from his Master <hi>Pietro Perugino,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little, mean, and of small Design, became
in time a great trouble to him; for it hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him from Learning to draw Naked Figures,
and gave him great difficulty in all Shorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and such like Excellencies of the Art,
which he saw so rarely performed by <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Angelo Buonaroti;</hi> and indeed, any one besides
himself would almost have despaired, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that all this while he had thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his time, and must now turn Schollar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
as he did with admirable Patience and
Ingenuity, studying Night and Day to arrive
to <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>'s way; which was full of
difficulty in all its parts, and this in a time
when his Hand and Head were almost set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
upon another way, which he had
learn't in his Youth, when Impressions are
strongest.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Raphael</hi> began first to change his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43902:151"/>
manner, he had never studied <hi>Nudities</hi> any
otherwise than just to do them a little by the
Life, which with the grace he gave his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
did pritty well; but he was an utter
Stranger to <hi>Anatomy,</hi> which teaches the lying
of the <hi>Muscles</hi> under the Skin, and how they
swell and shorten in action, according to the
different postures of the person; also, the
manner of their Insertion, and the Concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Bones and Joynts; all which he
studied with great application, and became
excellent in the knowledge of whatever
might make a rare <hi>Painter;</hi> yet perceiving too,
that in this part of painting, he should
be forc't to come short of <hi>Michael Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo;</hi>
and knowing, that it is not Naked Figures
alone, that give Reputation to a great <hi>Painter;</hi>
but, that Invention and Disposition were
things that did enoble the Art as much as any
thing, he applyed himself to them with great
success, enriching his Compositions with great
variety of Prospectives, and new ways of dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43902:151"/>
his Figures; adding to this, most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Heads of Men, Women, and Children;
and in a word, not being able to come up to
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in one thing, he resolved to be
so universal in all the other parts of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that few, or none should be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with him: he was not a little beholding
to <hi>Fra. Bartholomeo di San Marco;</hi> who having
a good way of Painting, well founded in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi>
and accompanied with a pleasant <hi>Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
though sometimes he used too strong Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to give his Figures a greater <hi>Relievo; Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>
took of his manner so much, both for
<hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Colouring,</hi> as he thought fit; and out
of it, and some other select Observations upon
other Masters, he made to himself a Manner;
which was ever after call'd, <hi>Raphael's Manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and the perfection of which appear'd in those
<hi>Sybils</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> which he made in the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>La Pace:</hi> and if <hi>Raphael</hi> had stuck to this
Manner of his, and had not still sought to
make it appear greater by the strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Figures, it had been often more agreeable,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43902:152"/>
and of greater Reputation to him; for even
those <hi>Nudities</hi> of his in the Chamber of <hi>Torre
Borgia,</hi> are not exact; nor do those which were
made by him in the Pallace of <hi>Augustin Chigi</hi> in
<hi>Transtevere,</hi> please and satisfie a Judicious Eye,
because they want that Grace and Sweetness
which was the proper Character of <hi>Raphael;</hi>
and besides, he only Designed them, but left
the Colouring to others; which Errour of his
he at last perceiving, resolved to do something
that should be all his own; and accordingly,
did the <hi>Transfiguration of Christ</hi> in the Church of
<hi>S. Pietro Montorio;</hi> in which are all the parts
of good painting; and if he had not, out of
a Humour, made use of <hi>Printers Black</hi> in the
Shadowings, which of its own Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
still blacker and blacker, and spoiles
the other Colours with which it is mingled,
I believe that Piece would have been fresh and
fine to this day; but that has so blackened it,
that it seems as it were <hi>Tinto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made this Discourse at the end of
<hi>Raphael</hi>'s Life, to show how much Care, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43902:152"/>
and Diligence he us'd, to attain to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;
and likewise, to give, as it were, an
Advertisement to other <hi>Painters,</hi> that they
should not go about to force Nature in those
things to which it doth not strongly incline
them, least they loose their Labour, and be
forc't at last to desist with shame.</p>
            <p>Now to return to the Life of <hi>Raphael.</hi> He
had a great Intimacy with Cardinal <hi>Bibiena;</hi>
who was continually solliciting of him to
Marry, and had a <hi>Niece</hi> of his ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon him: <hi>Raphael</hi> at first put him
off gently, taking three or four Years time
to consider of it; at the end of which, the
Cardinal still solliciting him about it,
and claiming, as it were, a promise from
him; he finding himself ingaged in some
measure, and loath to disoblige the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
accepted of his proffered <hi>Neece;</hi> but
so still, as not to come to an absolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
for besides the aversion he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
to a Married Life, he had besides,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43902:153"/>
another design, which made him seek all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
possible from entring into so strong
an Ingagement: The thing was this; he
having Serv'd the <hi>Pope</hi> a great while, and
having a very considerable Summ due to
him from the COURT, he had divers
hints given him, that as soon as the <hi>Sala
Grande</hi> he was now painting should be
Finished, the <hi>Pope</hi> would recompence his
Pains and extraordinary Capacity with a
<hi>Cardinal's CAP:</hi> It being certain, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> designed a numerous Creation of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals:</hi>
amongst whom were some of less
Merit than <hi>Raphael.</hi> In this hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
keeping Marriage at a distance, and
following secretly other amorous Delights,
it happenened, that he committed once such
an Excess that way, that he came Home
with a pritty high <hi>Feaver;</hi> the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
being called, and he concealing the
true Cause of his Distemper, which they
feared, was an <hi>Inflammation,</hi> they ordered
him to be Let Blood; whereas they should
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43902:153"/>
have given him <hi>Cordials</hi> and <hi>Restauratives;</hi>
the effect was, that he sounded away; and
immediately finding himself decay, he
took care to send away his Mistress out
of his House, and provided handsomely for
her; and then making his WILL, he
left all he had to <hi>Giulio Romano</hi> his Schollar,
and to <hi>Gian Francesco Florentino,</hi> otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Il Fattor,</hi> together with a certain Priest
of <hi>Vrbino,</hi> who was A-kin to him; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Signior Baltasar da Pescia</hi> the Pope's <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Executor</hi> of this his last Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament:
after this, having Confessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
very Penitently, and received the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
he yielded up the Ghost on a <hi>Good
Fryday,</hi> in the Seven and Thirtieth Year
of his Age, the same day he was Born
on.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> and all the <hi>Court</hi> were much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for his Loss; and indeed, we may
say, that it was the greatest that the Art
of <hi>Painting</hi> ever received; it having been
ever since at a Stand, and rather in danger
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43902:154"/>
of declining, than in hopes of advancing to
a greater Perfection: He was so Courteous
and Obliging to all those of his Art, that if
at any time any one had begg'd a <hi>Design</hi>
of him, whether he were his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
or no, he would leave all to serve
him; which made him be so Beloved,
that when he went to <hi>Court,</hi> he was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
attended by fifty, or threescore of
the best Artists of all kinds who followed
him, to show their Respects. And one
thing he brought to pass, which I think,
was never done before nor since; which
was, that all those <hi>Painters,</hi> and other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
in great Number, who worked under
him, and in concurrence with one another,
laid aside all Envy and Jealousie, and lived
in the greatest Union and Concord ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
which proceeded from nothing so
much as from that admirable Example of
Sweetness and Mildness that <hi>Raphael</hi> set
them. In a word, he was not only the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43902:154"/>
Wonder, but the Delight of all <hi>Rome,</hi> who
thought his Vertue beyond Reward, as it
was above all Imitation. He lived Great,
died Bewailed, and Regretted by every one.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of
GIORGIONE
DA CASELFRANCO.
A
VENETIAN PAINTER.</head>
            <p>ABout the same time that <hi>Florence</hi> grew so
Famous by the Works of <hi>Leonardo
Da Vinci, Venice</hi> received no small Ornament
from a Native of that Countrey, <hi>to wit, Giorgio</hi>
of <hi>Castelfranco,</hi> who had the Sir-Name of <hi>Gior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione</hi>
given him. He was Bred up in <hi>Venice,</hi>
and first applyed himself to <hi>Musick;</hi> for which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43902:156"/>
he had so rare a Talent, that both for Singing
and Playing upon the <hi>Lute,</hi> he was Famous,
and always invited to all Consorts, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Musick-Meetings.</hi> After this, he applyed
himself to learn to <hi>Design;</hi> in which Nature
gave him a great Facility; and he in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
studied her most, <hi>Designing</hi> every thing
after the Life it self; which made him not
only out-do the two <hi>Bellini</hi>'s then in <hi>Vogue,</hi>
but stand in Competition with those <hi>Tuscan</hi>
Painters, that were the Authors of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
way of Painting; some things of <hi>Leonardo
da Vinci</hi>'s doing being come to his Hands,
wherein there was a great Strength, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
an admirable Management of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowings;
he was extreamly delighted with
that manner, never forsaking it, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to imitate and improve it in all his
<hi>Oyl-Paintings;</hi> from whence it proceeded, that
all his Pieces had a Spirit and Life, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
before in that Countrey; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that a Beautiful Colouring, he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:43902:156"/>
he was far beyond all the <hi>Lombard</hi> Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>His first Application was to <hi>Portraits,</hi> in
which he succeeded admirably; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that of the Great <hi>Gonsalvo,</hi> whom he drew
by the Life, in Armour, when he came to
make a Visit to <hi>Agostino Barberigo,</hi> the <hi>Doge</hi> of
<hi>Venice;</hi> this Picture so pleased the Great <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salvo,</hi>
that he took it with him into <hi>Spain.</hi>
Many more of his Pictures are spread over all
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was no less excellent in Painting in
<hi>Fresco;</hi> and amongst the rest, there is the Front
of the Pallace of <hi>Soranzo</hi> in the <hi>Piazza</hi> of <hi>San
Baolo;</hi> in which, besides many Stories done
after the ordinary manner of <hi>Fresco</hi> Painting,
there is one done in Oyl upon the Wall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Fresco</hi> manner, which is very singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
it has preserved it self against all the
Wind and Rain, and is fresh to this day,
though it be exposed to the <hi>South</hi> Winds;
which in moist Countries, such as <hi>Venice</hi> is,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43902:157"/>
are the most terrible Destroyers of <hi>Fresco</hi>
Work, that can be.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1504, there happened a great
Fire near the <hi>Rialto,</hi> in which, amongst other
Buildings, the <hi>Fondaco,</hi> or Trading-House of
the <hi>German</hi> Nation, was quite burnt to the
Ground: the Senate in a short time Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
it more Magnificent and Convenient
than before; and <hi>Giorgione</hi>'s Fame being great,
he was ordered to paint it in <hi>Fresco</hi> on the
Outside. This Building standing in the most
frequented and populous part of the City,
<hi>Giorgione</hi> thought he could not choose a better
place to show the Excellency of his Art; and
therefore without confining himself to any
Set Story, he drew such Figures as should best
sute with that Design; therefore you see in
some places the Figures of Women, in others,
those of Youths in various Aptitudes, with
Lyons Heads, Angels, Cupids, and other such
things by them; the meaning of which, none
to this day could ever understand, but the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
are admirable in their kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:43902:157"/>
The best piece of <hi>Oyl-painting</hi> of his doing,
is of our Saviour carrying his <hi>Cross;</hi> where
there is a <hi>Jew</hi> that pulls him; that is a most
singular Figure: this Piece is in the Church
of <hi>San Rovo;</hi> and by the great Devotion that
People show to it, it is thought to do Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
He worked much out of <hi>Venice;</hi> as, at
<hi>Castelfranco,</hi> and in the <hi>Trivisano;</hi> and many
Pieces of his were bought up, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to Forraign Parts, to show that <hi>Tuscany</hi>
alone had not the prize of <hi>Painting,</hi> but that
other parts near the <hi>Alps,</hi> had their Share in
that noble Art.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Andrea di Verrochio</hi> being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to make the Famous Horse of <hi>Bronve,</hi>
some <hi>Sculptors</hi> took occasion to praise <hi>Sculpture</hi>
beyond <hi>Painting,</hi> because that one might walk
round a piece of <hi>Sculpture,</hi> and view it on all
sides with delight, whereas a piece of <hi>Painting</hi>
could never represent but one side of a Body at
once: <hi>Giorgione</hi> having heard them out, said,
that they were extreamly mistaken, and that
he would undertake to do a Figure in <hi>Painting,</hi>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:43902:158"/>
which should show the Fore and Hind Parts,
and the two sides, without being put to the
trouble of going round about it, as <hi>Sculptors</hi>
are to view a <hi>Statue.</hi> This seem'd an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
beyond belief; but he thus brought it
to pass.</p>
            <p>He drew the Picture of a Young Man naked,
showing his Back and Shoulders, and having
at his Feet a <hi>Fountain</hi> of clear Water, in which
there appeared by reflection, all his fore parts;
on the left side of him he placed a bright shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Armour, which he seemed to have put off,
and in the glistering of that, all the left Side
was seen in <hi>Porfile;</hi> on his right Side he plac'd
a great <hi>Looking-Glass,</hi> which represented his
right flam by its reflexion,</p>
            <p>This Piece was look'd upon as a thing of a
rare Invention, and seems to give the prize to
<hi>Painting,</hi> which can in one view represent
much more than <hi>Sculpture</hi> can.</p>
            <p>He drew, amongst other Pictures, that of
the famous <hi>Catharina Cornaro,</hi> Queen of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
by whom the State of <hi>Venice</hi> long enjoyed, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43902:158"/>
do to this day lay claim to that Crown. That
Piece is in the Pallace of <hi>Cornaro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giorgione</hi> being so rare a <hi>Painter,</hi> and so great
a <hi>Musitian,</hi> could not choose but be Amorous;
he fell most extreamly in Love with a Young
Beauty, who was no less charmed with him;
and while they were in the heat of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
the <hi>Plague</hi> being then at <hi>Venice,</hi> she
fell ill of it, but not thinking it was that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
admitted <hi>Giorgione</hi> to her Bed, where the
Infection seizing him, they both died; he was
but thirty four years old, when this fatal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
took him from his Friends, who could
hardly comfort themselves for his loss. He
left two excellent Scollars, <hi>to wit, Sebastiano Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiano,</hi>
who was afterwards <hi>Frate del Piombo</hi> at
<hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Titian da Ladore;</hi> who not only
equalled his Master, but surpassed him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of
Michael Angelo
BUONAROTTI,
A
Painter, Sculptor, and Architect.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LOdovico di Lionardo Buonarotti Simone,</hi> was a
Gentleman of the Countrey about <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
and the Father of <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi>
who was born in the Year 1474; being not
very rich, and his other Children being put
out <hi>Apprentices</hi> to Trades, he designed his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
for a Schollar, and accordinly, sent him to
School; but the Child used to play Truant
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:43902:160"/>
often, and spend his time in <hi>Designing,</hi> finding
in himself a most powerful Inclination that
way; which his Father endeavoured to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as thinking it below the dignity of his
Family (which was descended from the Earls
of <hi>Canosu)</hi> to have one of his Children a <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
but at last, the strength of Nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
against the Rules of Prudence, he put
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to <hi>Domenico Ghirlandai,</hi> who was
then reputed the best <hi>Painter</hi> in <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was then about fourteen, and in less
than two years time, he followed the Art with
so great application, that his Master said, he
was astonished at the progress he made, as also
at the boldness of his <hi>Pencil;</hi> for one day, a
Schollar of <hi>Ghirlandio</hi>'s having drawn some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
cloathed, out of a Work of the said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and succeeded pretty well, according to
the <hi>Design; Michael Angelo</hi> took the paper, and
making with a pen new Centers to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
that his Fellow Schollar had drawn, not
only mended his Drawing, but showed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:43902:160"/>
some Faults that were in his Master's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal;
which boldness of a Youth of his Age,
argued a prodigious Genius for the Art.</p>
            <p>Much about that time <hi>Lorenzo</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi>
who was a mighty lover of <hi>Sculpture,</hi> and used
to lament, that there was not then one young
promising <hi>Sculptor</hi> in <hi>Florence,</hi> set up a kind of
<hi>Academy</hi> in his Pallace, for the Improvement of
Youth that way, and desired <hi>Guirlandaio,</hi> that if
he had any of his <hi>Apprentices</hi> that were hopeful
Young Men, he would send them to him; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
he sent him <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> and
<hi>Francesco Granaccio,</hi> as the most hopeful of his
School. There was an old Head of a <hi>Faun,</hi> or
<hi>Satyr,</hi> which was made <hi>Laughing;</hi> and it struck
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi>'s fancy so, that taking the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi>
that <hi>Sculptors</hi> use, which he had never
handled in his Life before, he fell to trying to
imitate that Head, and at last did it so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> astonished at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Genius, commended him extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily;
and observing, that he had added
of his own Invention, to make the <hi>Faun</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:43902:161"/>
show his Teeth and part of his Tongue; he
told him laughing, and with a Design to make
sport, that that was improper, for that Old
Men, as that was, never had all their Teeth;
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> thinking he was much in the
right, went next day, and broke a Tooth of
the <hi>Satyr</hi>'s, ordering the Gums likewise to
look as if it were fallen out, and then showed
it to <hi>Lorenzo</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who laughed heartily
at <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>'s Simplicity, but resoved to
cherish his <hi>Talent,</hi> and therefore sending for
his Father, desired he would let him stay in
his Family, and he would take care of him;
which his Father very readily granted.</p>
            <p>He stayed there four Years, during which
time, by the advice of <hi>Politian,</hi> a great <hi>Virtuoso</hi>
and Lover of <hi>Art,</hi> he undertook to Carve in
<hi>Marble</hi> the Battle of <hi>Hercules</hi> with the <hi>Centaurs;</hi>
which he did so rarely, that to those who shall
consider it now, it will appear rather the <hi>Work</hi>
of an intelligent well practised Master, than
of a Young Student, as he was then. There is
likewise a <hi>Nostra Donna</hi> of <hi>Basso Relievo</hi> in <hi>Marble,</hi>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:43902:161"/>
done by him much about the same time, with
a design to imitate the Manner of <hi>Donatello;</hi>
which he has done to a Miracle; and this is
the only Piece of <hi>Basso Relievo</hi> that ever he did,
and is therefore preserved with great Care in
the <hi>Pallace</hi> of <hi>Medicis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi> being dead, and his Son <hi>Peter</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself Insolently in the Government,
great Revolutions followed, and the Family
of <hi>Medicis</hi> was quite driven out of <hi>Florence;</hi>
which <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> foreseeing, and being
afraid, least his Dependance on that Family
might be of fatal Consequence to him, had
withdrawn himself some Weeks before to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi>
and thence to <hi>Venice;</hi> where finding no
Work, he returned to <hi>Bologna,</hi> in order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<hi>Florence,</hi> but having forgot to take a
<hi>Pass</hi> at his coming in, he was seized going out,
and <hi>Fin'd</hi> more Money than he was then
worth, not being able to pay it, just as he was
going to Prison, one <hi>Signior Giovan Francesco Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandi</hi>
took pity of him, payed the Money,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:43902:162"/>
and carried him home to his own house, where
he staid a whole <hi>Twelve-Month</hi> with him; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his stay he did but one piece of Work,
which was, to add to an old piece of <hi>Sculpture</hi>
in <hi>MARBLE</hi> of the Sculpture of
St. <hi>Dominick;</hi> there being an <hi>Angel</hi> holding a
<hi>Candlestick</hi> wanting, and another <hi>Figure</hi> of about
a Yard long; both which he supplyed so well,
that they are the two best <hi>Figures</hi> in the whole
Work, though it was done by <hi>Giovan Pisano</hi>
and <hi>Nicolo de Larta,</hi> Sculptors of great
<hi>Fame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> and there
made for <hi>Pier Francesco</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> a Saint <hi>John;</hi>
and a little after, for <hi>Baltaser del Milanese,</hi> a <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>
sleeping; which being showed to <hi>Pier
Francesco,</hi> he told <hi>Baltasar,</hi> that it might pass
for <hi>Autique,</hi> if it were buried under Ground a
while, and made to look old; <hi>Baltasar</hi> took the
hint, and carryed it to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he buryed it
in a <hi>Vigna,</hi> having first broke the Arm of it;
and so after some time had it dug up, and sold
it for <hi>Antique</hi> to the Cardinal <hi>San Giorgio</hi> for
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:43902:162"/>
two hundred Crowns, sending <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>
only thirty for his pains. Others relate the
thing otherwise; but all agree, it was taken
for <hi>Antique,</hi> and fell at last into the hands of
Duke <hi>Valentino,</hi> and he gave it the Marchioness
of <hi>Montsua,</hi> where it still remains. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> got by it, was so
great, that he was sent for to <hi>Rome,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Family of Cardinal <hi>San Giorgio,</hi>
where nevertheless, he was a whole Year
without Imployment, the Cardinal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
but little of either <hi>Painting</hi> or <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
but a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman called <hi>Jacopo Galli</hi>
understood his Merit better, and got him to
make him a <hi>Cupid</hi> of Marble, and by it a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
of a <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who holds a Cup in his
Right Hand, and in his Left, a <hi>Tyger's</hi> Skin
and a Bunch of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which a Young <hi>Satyr</hi>
trys to eat some of; in which <hi>Figures, Michael
Angelo</hi> made, as it were, a mixture of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of both Sexes, having given it the Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Limbs, and Strength of the Men, and
withal, the roundness and fleshiness of the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43902:163"/>
Women, which gave him the Bell above all
Modern Artists of <hi>Rome</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>His fame increasing every day with his
Skill, the Cardinal of <hi>Rouen,</hi> who was then
Chief Minister of <hi>France,</hi> desiring to leave
something at <hi>Rome</hi> that should preserve his
Memory there, bespoke <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to make
him a <hi>Picta,</hi> as it is called in <hi>Italian;</hi> that is,
our Lady with our Saviour's Dead Body in
her Lap: he did it with so much Care, and
finished it with such admirable Diligence,
that 'tis impossible to see any thing better in
<hi>Marble;</hi> particularly, the Dead Body of our
Saviour is so exquisitely formed, with all the
<hi>Muscles, Veins,</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> and yet made so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dead, that no Art in the World can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it; some blame him for having made
the Virgin's <hi>Face</hi> too Young; but they do not
consider, that Virgins unspotted preserve
their <hi>Freshness</hi> a great vvhile; the <hi>Drapery</hi> is
the noblest and loosest in the World; vvhich
is one of the hardest things in <hi>Sculpture.</hi> In
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:43902:163"/>
Summ, he showed so much Art in this Piece,
that, contrary to his Custom, he put his
Name to it; some say, he was provoked so to
do by some <hi>Lombard</hi> Artists, who being come
to look upon it, one of them asked the other
whose Work it was, and the other made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that it was done by <hi>Il Gobbo,</hi> a great
<hi>Sculptor</hi> then living at <hi>Milan;</hi> which <hi>Michael
Angelo</hi> over-hearing, Carv'd his Name in a
Girdle that goes about the <hi>Madonna</hi>'s
Breast.</p>
            <p>About this time his Friends at <hi>Florence</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him back to undertake an odd piece of
Work, which was thus; a piece of <hi>Marble</hi> of
about nine Yards high, had been given to one
<hi>Simon da Fiesola,</hi> who had begun a Gyant in it,
but with such ill Success, that those that
were to pay for it had layed it by as a thing
spoiled; but it being a fine piece of <hi>Marble,</hi>
the <hi>Gonfaloniero Soderini</hi> had proposed to <hi>Lionardo
da Vinci</hi> and to <hi>Andrea Sansovini,</hi> an excellent
<hi>Sculptor,</hi> to do something with it; <hi>Andrea</hi> was
willing, but said, they could not make a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43902:164"/>
out of it without adding some pieces;
which <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> hearing, undertook to
do it without putting any piece to it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it was delivered to him.</p>
            <p>He therefore began, and made a Model of
<hi>Wax,</hi> and fram'd the Statue of <hi>David,</hi> with a
Sling in his hand; and then, having enclosed
a place with Boards, he fell to work upon the
<hi>Marble,</hi> and would not suffer any Body to see
what he did; he had much ado to make it
serve for his design, the first <hi>Sculptor</hi> having
spoiled it, so that he was forc'd to leave in
the Extremities of his Figure, some strokes
of the former Chizzel; which nevertheless,
did not any ways deform it; after much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
having miraculously Created a new
thing out of an old deformed Carcase, there
was much Contention among the <hi>Ingeneers</hi> of
the City, how to transport it to the place
where it was to be set up; but at last, <hi>Giulian</hi>
of St. <hi>Gallo,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Antonio,</hi> were the
Contrivers of a Machine, in which it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43902:164"/>
suspended by Cables, and then raised by
degrees with Leavers, to the place it was to
stand in; as soon as it was uncovered, all the
Town flocked to see it; and to say truth,
it not only surpasses all Modern Statues,
but may come in competition with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> ones; for as to exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Measure, Beauty of Shape and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and dilicate Centers of the Legs, with a
cleanness of all the Limbs, nothing can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
it; the Aptitude of its Posture, and the
Air of the Head are Divine: and in a word,
after it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may never desire to see any, either
Modern or Antient, for there is all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in it that Art can give; and yet to show
how <hi>Artists</hi> must sometimes humour Great
Men, who pretend to be Judges, and are not;
the <hi>Gonfaloniero Soderini</hi> found fault with the
Nose, and said it was too big; whereupon
<hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> to please him, took a <hi>Chizzel</hi> in
one hand, and in the other a little <hi>Marble</hi> dust
that lay upon the Scaffold by him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to mend the Nose, struck three of four
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43902:165"/>
blows with the wrong end of his <hi>Chizzel,</hi> and
let the Dust fall by little and little, and then
called to the <hi>Gonfaloniero</hi> to ask him how he
liked it; who told him, that that little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had quite made it another thing; at which
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> laughed in himself, for he had
not touch'd it any ways to alter it. The
<hi>Gonfaloniero</hi> paid him four hundred Crowns
down.</p>
            <p>Having succeeded thus rarely in <hi>Sculpture,</hi>
he nevertheless would not omit to show his
Excellency in <hi>Painting;</hi> and therefore, at the
Request of <hi>Agnolo Doni,</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Citizen, and
his Friend, he made him a <hi>Madonna</hi> upon her
Knees, holding of her little Son upon her
Hands, and lifting of him to St. <hi>Joseph,</hi> who
seems to receive him: He has particularly
expressed in the Eyes of the <hi>Madonna,</hi> the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of a Mother admiring the Beauty of
her Child; and in the Looks of Old <hi>Joseph,</hi>
all the Respect and Devotion which he must
have for a Child which he knew to be Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:43902:165"/>
Born: And in the Piece, at a distance, to
show his Art the more, he made several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Figures, some standing, others sitting, all
admirably Finish'd; and indeed, it is one of
the best <hi>Oyl-Paintings</hi> he ever did, he having
worked but little that way.</p>
            <p>The Picture being Finished, he sent it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to <hi>Agnolo Doni,</hi> and withal, a Note for
seventy <hi>Crowns,</hi> to be paid down immediately;
<hi>Agnolo</hi> thought it too much to lay out in a
Picture, and therefore sent him but forty;
upon which <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> sent back the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
and required a hundred <hi>Crowns</hi> or the
Picture; <hi>Agnolo</hi> then was content to give him
the other thirty, and sent them by the Man
that demanded a hundred; but <hi>Michael Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
to punish him for Bargaining for so rare a
Piece, sent the Money back, and demanded a
hundred and forty, which was the double of
his first Price, or else the Picture: <hi>Agnolo,</hi>
who knew the true Value of it, immediately
sent him all he desired, and glad he had it
so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:43902:166"/>
About that time, <hi>Lionardo da Vinci</hi> having
done some Stories in the Chamber of the
<hi>Great Council,</hi> in the publick <hi>Pallace,</hi> the <hi>Gonfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniero
Piero Soderini</hi> bargained with <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>
to do one side of the same Room, and
gave him for his Subject the War with
<hi>Pisa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> being to Paint in concurrence
with <hi>Lionardo,</hi> who was one of the greatest
Artists of the World, shut himself up, as his
Manner was, and made a <hi>Cartoon,</hi> in which he
drew a world of Naked Figures, which he
supposed to be bathing themselves in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Arno,</hi> and to belong to the <hi>Camp,</hi> which
was hard by; and at the same time there was
an Allarm given, which made these Figures
all endeavour to get on their Cloaths and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
in various postures; amongst the rest,
there was an Old Fellow who had a Garland
of <hi>Ivy</hi> about his Head, and was just come out
of the Water, and trying to put on his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which by reason of the Wetness of his
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43902:166"/>
Legs, were hard to pull on, and he being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
frighted with the noise of the Drums
and Allarm, seemed to use all the Strength
of his <hi>Muscles</hi> and <hi>Nerves</hi> to make haste,
making such a Face at the same time, as show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he was all over in action from the
Head to the Toe; there were besides, <hi>Gruppos</hi>
of Horseman beginning the Fight, and others
of Foot at a distance coming on, some in the
Shade lost, others in the Light strong and
vigorous, and all in great variety of Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes:
So that nothing could be either bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Designed, or more ingeniously Invented;
and particularly, the Shortnings were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and strong, beyond all that had yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Cartoon</hi> being afterwards carried to
a Room in the Pallace called <hi>La Sala del Papa</hi>
has there been the Study of all the <hi>Painters</hi>
of that Age, both Natives of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners;</hi>
for <hi>Raphael del Vrbin, Francesco Granac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,
Andrea del Sarto, Jacobo da Puntormo, Perin
del Vaga,</hi> and several others, made their Study
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:43902:167"/>
of it: for which reason, it was at last remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the Pallace of <hi>Medicis;</hi> and the great
Liberty Strangers had to come to it, making
it be less watched, it was in the end, in the
Sickness of the Duke <hi>Giulian</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> stole
away by pieces; and some of it is yet to be
seen in the House of <hi>S. Vberto Strozzi</hi> at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Year 1504, Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Second</hi>
having suceeded <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> he sent to
<hi>Florence</hi> for <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> with a design to make
him erect a Stately Sepulchral Monument for
himself: Accordingly, having sent him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for his Journey, he ordered him to go to
the Quarries of <hi>Marble</hi> at <hi>Carrara,</hi> and there to
see the Stones cut out as he would have them.
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> spent eight Months intire in
that Employment, and sent so much <hi>Marble</hi>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> as filled half the great place before
Saint <hi>Peters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole design of the Monument was to
contain above forty Statues of <hi>Marble,</hi> besides
little Boys, Ornaments, and other Carvings;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43902:167"/>
about the Corniches it was to be, as it were,
an <hi>Ile</hi> in the middle of a Chappel, so as it might
be walked all round, and considered from the
Out-side. Of this Work he finished four Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and began eight more; which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Finished, by reason of the Pope's Death.
Of all these, his <hi>Moses</hi> is the most Excellent;
it is about five Palms, of white <hi>Marble,</hi> in a
sitting posture, leaning one hand upon the
Tables of the <hi>Law,</hi> and with the other stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Beard; the very Hairs of which are
expressed as if they were living Hairs; the
rest of his Countenance is of the greatest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Sweetness imaginable, the <hi>Drapery</hi> is
Loose, Long, and Noble; and in a word, the
whole Figure is Exquisite beyond Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the <hi>Sculptor</hi> having expressed something
of that <hi>Divinity</hi> which was in a Man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
so familiarly with the DEITY it
self.</p>
            <p>'Tis said, that while he was doing this
Work, the rest of the Marble he had bespoke
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43902:168"/>
at <hi>Carrata,</hi> came to Town, and that <hi>Michael
Angelo</hi> being gone to acquaint the <hi>Pope</hi> with it,
and finding him busie, payed for the bringing
the Marble, out of his own Pocket, that the
Workmen might be gone home who had
brought it; some time after he went again
to the Pallace to acquaint the <hi>Pope,</hi> to whom
he used to have very free access, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was come, and to desire his Holiness to
take order about the paying for it: it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that day, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was otherwise
employed; and the <hi>Porter</hi> told him, he must
have Patience, for he had Orders not to let
him in: a Courtier that stood by, ask'd him
if he knew him; to whom the Porter reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he knew him very well, but must
obay his Orders. This Answer, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
angred <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> so, that he told the
<hi>Porter,</hi> that he should tell his Holiness, when he
asked for him next, he was gone about some
other Affairs; and so without further delay
went home, and ordering his Servants to sell
all his Furniture to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and follow him
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43902:168"/>
to <hi>Florence;</hi> he took <hi>Post</hi> two hours after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
and rode that night to <hi>Poggi Bonzi,</hi>
out of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Territories. There five
Courriers overtook him with LETTERS
from the Pope, desiring his Return; to all
which he only made answer by a little Note,
<hi>That he desired his Holiness to excuse him, that he
had driven him away from his Presence, and that the
faithful Service he had payed him did not deserve such
Vsage; and that therefore his Holiness might provide
himself of some other Artist in his room, for he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to Serve him no longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he was no sooner arrived in <hi>Florence,</hi>
but there came Letters from the Pope to the
Government of <hi>Florence,</hi> commanding them to
send him back <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> which
perseverance of the Pope in his Design, so
frighted <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> that to avoid his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment,
he began to hearken to some <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan
Fryars,</hi> who had Commission from the
<hi>Great Turk</hi> to entertain him in his Service, he
having at that time thoughts of making a
Bridge over the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43902:169"/>
               <hi>Pera:</hi> but at last being over perswaded by the
<hi>Gonfaloniero Soderini,</hi> he resolved to go to the
Pope, who was then at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and to ask his
Pardon; the Cardinal <hi>Soderini</hi> undertook to
present him; but being Indispos'd, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
him to a Bishop of his Friends, who
brought him to the Pope. <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> fell
upon his Knees; but the Pope looking scurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
upon him, said, <hi>Instead of coming to Vs at</hi>
Rome, <hi>We have been fain to meet you here at</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna.
To which <hi>Michal Angelo</hi> replied, that
he did humbly beg his Pardon, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his Errour: the Bishop interposing,
told his Holiness, that such Fellows as he
were not much to be minded, being ignorant
in every thing of the World but their own
Art, and therefore might the sooner be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The Pope grew angry at such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Intercession, and with a Switch he
had in his hand, touch'd the Bishop scornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and told him, he was more Ignorant, and
had less Manners than <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> since
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:43902:169"/>
he said that to him which he, the Pope had
not said: upon which the poor Bishop was
turned out of the Room by the Officers; and
the <hi>Pope</hi> having passed his anger upon the
Bishop, gave <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> his Blessing, and
bid him attend the <hi>Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a little while the <hi>Pope</hi> commanded
him to make a Statue of himself, of about five
Palms high, of <hi>Bronze;</hi> while he was doing
it, the <hi>Pope</hi> came one day as it was almost Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and considering the posture; which
was, with one hand up in a Commanding
Manner, the <hi>Pope</hi> asked him whether he was
Blessing, or Cursing in that posture? And
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> answered, that he was intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the people of <hi>Bologna,</hi> that they should
persist in their Duty: then he asked the
<hi>Pope,</hi> whether he would have a Book in his
Left Hand? To which he answered, put a
Sword there, for I understand but little of
Books. The <hi>Pope</hi> left a thousand Crowns
behind him for the Finishing of it; which
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> did in about sixteen Months;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:43902:170"/>
and it was set up over the Frontispiece of the
Church of <hi>San Petronio;</hi> but not long after,
the City revolting to the <hi>Bentevoglio</hi>'s, they
sold this Statue to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who
Cast it into a great Gun, &amp; called it <hi>La Giulia;</hi>
only the Head was saved, and kept in that
Duke's Wardrobe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> after this, being returned to
<hi>Rome,</hi> found that the <hi>Pope</hi> by the perswasion
of <hi>Bramante,</hi> had laid aside the thoughts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
his Sepulchral-Monument, as a thing
of ill <hi>Omen;</hi> and was perswaded to have the
Vault of the Chappel painted by <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo;</hi>
which <hi>Bramante</hi> did maliciously, as
knowing that it would prove a Work of great
difficulty, and that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well practised in the way of painting in
<hi>Fresco;</hi> indeed, he used all means possible to
avoid the thing, and to ingage <hi>Raphael del Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi>
in it; but the <hi>Pope</hi> would take no Excuse:
So he was fain to undertake it, and agreed for
the price of fiveteen thousand Crowns to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it all; he sent to <hi>Florence</hi> for several
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43902:170"/>
Workmen who were well practised in the
Manner of <hi>Fresco;</hi> and having made the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons,</hi>
they began to paint them upon his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
but their Work not answering his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
one day he shut the Door upon
himself, he put out all they had done, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to let them in, and likewise keeping so
close at home, that he could not be spoke with
by them; whereupon finding themselves abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
they returned to <hi>Florence.</hi> He being thus
alone, took infinite pains, and with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and labour, brought about half of it
to perfection, taking great care that none
should see what he was doing; then it was,
that the <hi>Pope,</hi> who was naturally impatient,
commanded it to be uncovered, and all <hi>Rome</hi>
flocked to see it; amongst the rest, <hi>Raphael del
Vrbin,</hi> admiring the Greatness of <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>'s
Manner, changed his own upon the sight
of it, and being an admirable Imitator of any
thing he saw, drew those <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Sybils</hi>
in the Church of <hi>La Pace;</hi> which are the best
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43902:171"/>
things he ever did; <hi>Bramante</hi> upon that would
fain have had the <hi>Pope</hi> have given the other
half of the Work to <hi>Raphael</hi> to finish; but the
<hi>Pope</hi> would not injure <hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> who
therefore went on, and in about twenty
Months brought the whole to perfection, not
having had any help of any kind, not so much
as of a Boy to grind his Colours for him.</p>
            <p>There are in it many Stories, beginning
from the Creation of the World to the Flood;
and then following on to most of the remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
Stories of the Old Testament, adorned
besides with <hi>Sybils</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> according to
the Compartments of the Vault. The Work
in general is the extreamest perfection of the
Art for <hi>Shortnings,</hi> diversity of <hi>Dresses, Airs</hi> of
the Heads, and noble <hi>Invention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giulio</hi> being dead, the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> was intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
though by his WILL he had ordered
his Executors to see it finished: However
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> went on working upon some of
the Statues at <hi>Florence;</hi> where he retired, and
lived during all the <hi>Pontificates</hi> of <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth,</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:43902:171"/>
and <hi>Adrian</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> till <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi>
was made <hi>Pope,</hi> who being desirous to leave as
much Fame behind him as any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
sent for <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
there contracted with him for finishing the
<hi>Library</hi> of <hi>San Lorenzo</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> together with
the <hi>Sacristy</hi> of that <hi>Convent;</hi> it being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Foundation of the Family of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and
their <hi>Burying-place. Philippo Brundleschi</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made the old <hi>Sacristy;</hi> therefore <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Angelo</hi> made his of a new Composite Order,
full of Novelty and Variety, such as neither
Antient nor Modern <hi>Architects</hi> never saw the
like; for till then, they had gone on in a
slavish Manner of observing exactly Set <hi>Rules,</hi>
which <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> broke through; for which
the Artists are beholding to him, he having,
as it were, broke their Chains though: Some
have abused that Liberty, and too much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their own <hi>Capricio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He made likewise in the same place, four
<hi>Sepultures</hi> for four of the Family of <hi>Medicis;</hi>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:43902:172"/>
two of which were the first Dukes, to wit,
<hi>Giuliano</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> about their <hi>Sepulture</hi> he
made four Statues, representing the <hi>Night,</hi> the
<hi>Day, Aurora</hi> and <hi>Crepusculum;</hi> which are such
in their Aptitudes, and the Artifice of their
Centers, that if the Art of <hi>Sculpture</hi> were lost,
it might be restored by the sight of them; the
<hi>Aurora</hi> particularly is the softest thing in the
World.</p>
            <p>The terrible Accident of the taking of <hi>Rome</hi>
by <hi>Bourbon</hi>'s Army, having come to pass in
<hi>Pope Clement</hi>'s Time, the <hi>Florentines</hi> took that
Occasion to Revolt from the <hi>Medici's</hi> again, and
drive them out of the City; whereupon a War
ensuing, the Government oblig'd <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>
to Fortifie a place called <hi>Mount Saint Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ato,</hi>
which Commanded the whole Town; but
the Armies of the Pope and Emperour having
at last close Beleagured it, and no hopes of
Succours appearing, <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> began to
consider of his Danger, and without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay, stole out <hi>incognito</hi> by the way of
that <hi>Mount San Miniato,</hi> accompanyed with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:43902:172"/>
Mini</hi> his Schollar, and <hi>Il Piloto</hi> a Gold-Smith,
an Intimate Friend of his, and what
ready Money he had, and so got to <hi>Ferrara</hi> in
order to go to <hi>Venice.</hi> Being there, he made
for the Doge <hi>Andrea Griti,</hi> the Design of the
great Bridge called, <hi>The Rialto,</hi> which passes
over the great <hi>Canal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had not stayed long at <hi>Venice,</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
most importunate and kind Letters
from his Friends at <hi>Florence,</hi> lamenting his
absence, and begging of him, if he had any
Tenderness for his dear Countrey, to return,
and help to defend it. Which Letters so touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, that with great danger of his Life, he
returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> and there by the help of
his Art in defending the Place, made it hold
out some Months longer: But the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Surrendred, he was in greater danger than
before; for by the Pope's Order, he was
sought for among the Enemies of the House
of <hi>Medicis.</hi> But having been concealed by a
very good Friend of his for several days, the
Pope's Anger being over, he commanded that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:43902:173"/>
no hurt should be done to him; but on the
contrary, took him into his Service, and gave
him the usual Salary and Appointments he
had before.</p>
            <p>About this time the Pope having resolved
to paint the sides of the <hi>Chappel</hi> of <hi>Sixtus;</hi> of
which <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> had already painted the
<hi>Vault,</hi> he sent for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ordered
him to paint the Representation of the Last
Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that he might show in so
great a Subject, all that it was possible for him
to do in the Excellency of <hi>Design.</hi> In Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Pope's Commands, he began the
<hi>Cartoon</hi> of the <hi>Judgment,</hi> but was much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Agents of the Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi>
who charged him with sixteen thousand
Crowns received for the finishing of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> whose Nephew
the Duke of <hi>Vrbin</hi> was; and this business was
a mighty trouble to <hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> for the
Duke, who was a high Spirited Prince, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
no less than Death, if he failed to perform
his Contract. At last, by the Pope's Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:43902:173"/>
the thing was made up, and a new Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Signed; by which it was required of
<hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> to make only one of the four
Sides which at first were to have Composed
this Monument, and that in it he should place
six Statues of his own hand; giving him leave
withal, to work four Months in the Year for
the Pope, either at <hi>Florence</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> according
as he should please to employ him.</p>
            <p>About this time died Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
the <hi>Third,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Farneses,</hi> was
chosen to Succeed him; and then it was that
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> conceived hopes of being more
Master of his Time, and resolved to finish the
Statues of the Monument of <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi>
But the Pope had no sooner taken possession of
his new Dignity, but he Courted <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>
both with good Words and Presents, to be
his Servant, as he had been under the former
<hi>Pontificates.</hi> It was with great Reluctancy
that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> yielded to these Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and not till he had angred the Pope, by
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:43902:174"/>
telling him, that he was by Contract obliged
to the Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> and could not attend
any other Work till he had finished that; the
Pope told him again, that for the Contract, he
would break it by his Authority; adding,
that he had had above thirty years a longing
to have <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in his Service, and that
now that he was Pope, he was resolved not to
loose it; and accordingly, he prevailed with
the Duke, to submit to a new Agreement
with <hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> by which he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to finish only three Statues with his own
Hand, which were those of <hi>Rachel, Lea,</hi> and
<hi>Moses,</hi> and the others were to be made upon
his Models by the best <hi>Sculptors</hi> of the Age.
This Agreement was performed on all sides;
and <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> ingaged himself volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to pay for the three Statues, consigning
to that purpose 1580. Crowns to the Bank of
the <hi>Strozzi</hi> in <hi>Florence:</hi> and thus ended that
troublesome Affair. The Monument is to be
seen in <hi>San Pietro</hi> in <hi>Vincola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:43902:174"/>
After this, he applyed himself to the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Chappel,</hi> according to the <hi>Cartoons</hi>
made in Pope <hi>Clement</hi>'s Time. It will not be
necessary to describe here the <hi>Invention</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
of this Story, because there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Cutts,</hi> both great and small, of it in the
World; but it will suffice to say, that he
chose that Subject as the hardest to succeed in,
since it consists most in showing the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of the hardest of Subjects; which is,
the Humane Body Naked, and that in the
most difficult Aptitudes, with the strongest
affections and passions in the World, full of
the greatest variety imaginable. In all which
he has showed himself to be the greatest Master
in the World, and the true Inventer of that
Great Manner; he has indeed, not so much
minded the beauty of the Colours, and other
little Ornaments, but has kept to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundness
of the Art: to which none since
have ever been able to arrive.</p>
            <p>'Tis said, that when he had almost finished this
Work, that Pope, <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> came one day
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43902:175"/>
to see it, and in his Company was, <hi>Messer Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agio
di Cesena,</hi> his Master of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> whose
Opinion the <hi>Pope</hi> having asked about the thing,
he being a <hi>Bigot,</hi> answered, that it was a most
shameful thing, that in so Sacred a place as a
Chappel, there should be exposed to view
such a number of Naked Figures, some of
them in most undecent postures; showing in
both Sexes those parts that ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed;
and in a word, that it was a Work
fitter for a <hi>Bawdy-House</hi> than for a <hi>Pope's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
This displeased <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly;
and being resolved to be revenged
as soon as ever the <hi>Pope</hi> was gone, he fell to
work, and drew this <hi>Messer Biagio</hi> by Memory,
placing him in Hell Naked, with a great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
fastened to his Natural Parts, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with a Troop of Devils: The Picture
was so like, that the Master of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
complained to the <hi>Pope;</hi> and finding there
but small Redress, applyed himself to <hi>Michael
Angelo,</hi> intreating him to reform that part of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:43902:175"/>
his Piece: but all would not do, for he there
remains to this day. This Piece being finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was the Admiration of all <hi>Rome,</hi> and is to
this day the great Master-piece of the Art of
<hi>Painting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> having built a <hi>Chappel</hi>
which was called by his Name, <hi>La Paulina,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to do the painting there:
He painted two Stories, one of the Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> and another, of the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion
of Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> In both which his chief
Intention was, to show the perfection of the
Art, there being neither <hi>Landskip, Trees,</hi> nor
<hi>Houses,</hi> nor any other of those Additional Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
which he seemed to contemn, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them for meaner Genius's than his
own.</p>
            <p>These two Works were the last he performed
in <hi>Painting,</hi> being now seventy five years old,
and complaining extreamly of the <hi>Fatigue</hi> he
had indured in doing them; owning withal,
that <hi>Painting,</hi> and particularly, in <hi>Fresco,</hi> was
not an Art for Old Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:43902:176"/>
About this time <hi>Antonio di San Gallo,</hi> who
was the <hi>Architect</hi> for the Church of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
being dead, those that had the Care of that
Fabrick, resolved to put it into the Hands of
<hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> who having considered <hi>San
Gallo</hi>'s Model, said, that there might be made
one of greater Majesty, Order, and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
and yet the Execution of it should cost
three hundred thousand Crowns less, and be
done fifty years sooner; and accordingly, in
a Fortnight, he caused a New Model to be
made, which cost but twenty five Crowns;
whereas <hi>San Gallo</hi>'s had cost four thousand;
whereby it appeared, that what he said, was
very true.</p>
            <p>But it was not without great Opposition
and Contradiction that he went through with
his Design; for having discharged all the
Workmen concerned in <hi>San Gallo</hi>'s Time, they
were continually finding fault with all that
he did: Insomuch, that at last he obtained an
Order called a <hi>Motu Proprio</hi> from the Pope; by
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43902:176"/>
which he was constituted absolute Master of
that Fabrick, with power to do and undo as
he thought fit, and commanded all Inferiour
Workmen and Officers to obey him in every
thing; and he, not to be behind hand with
the <hi>Pope,</hi> had it inserted in the Order, that he
Served the <hi>Fabrick</hi> for God's Sake, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Temporal Advantage or Profit to
himself, often refusing Money that the <hi>Pope</hi>
sent him upon that Account.</p>
            <p>His chief aim in carrying on that Noble
Pile, was to secure it from the Designs of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Architects,</hi> that his own might not by
envy or Presumption be destroyed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was more careful to carry on the
Foundations to a certain height and length,
such as could not well afterwards, without
vast Charge and Danger to the whole Fabrike,
be altered, than to finish exactly what he
might have done in his Time, if he could have
been content to leave the rest to the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those who were to come after him:
Which has been a great Happiness for that
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:43902:177"/>
Fabrick; which else would hardly ever have
been finished, the one still pulling down what
the others had Erected; therefore he Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
as it were, the rest of his Life to this
Work, doing nothing in <hi>Painting,</hi> and but
very little in <hi>Sculpture</hi> for ever after.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Architect San Gallo</hi> had begun, and far
advanced the Work of a Pallace for the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Farneses;</hi> after his Death <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi>
took care of it, and made that Noble <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niche</hi>
without, so beautiful and various, that
nothing, either <hi>Antient</hi> or <hi>Modern</hi> can out-do
it: the rest of the Pallace he enlarged and
beautified both within and without, to that
degree, that it now passes for the most Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
piece of <hi>Architecture</hi> that is in
that kind.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> being dead, he was Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> who continued
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> in the Business of Saint <hi>Peters:</hi>
but his Enemies thinking that now, in a
New <hi>Pontificate</hi> they might better Injure him,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:43902:177"/>
had possessed the whole Congregation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
concerned to Manage that <hi>Fabrick,</hi> that
the Church would be so dark, that it would
be useless: among these, the Chief were the
<hi>Cardinal Salviati,</hi> and <hi>Marcello Cervino,</hi> who was
afterwards <hi>Pope,</hi> though but a few days;
the <hi>Pope</hi> himself being something possessed
against him, was present at a great Meeting,
in which he was ordered to appear; and
there his Holiness told him, that the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Deputies was, that the Church was
likely to be very Dark, and without suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Light. <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> said, he should
be glad to hear the Deputies themselves upon
that Subject; upon which Cardinal <hi>Marcello</hi>
spoke, and said, we are the Deputies, and are
all of Opinion, that by what appears of the
Fabrick, the Church must be obscure: My
Lord, said <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> there are three
Windows more contrived in the Vault of the
Church, which will make it light enough:
You never told us that before, replyed the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43902:178"/>
Cardinal: I confess I did not, said <hi>Michael
Angelo,</hi> neither do I intend, for the future,
to acquaint your Lordship, or any of the
Deputies with any designs; 'tis enough, that
I am trusted with the Fabrick, as your
Lordships are with the Management of
the Money; which is your Business to
provide, and mine to employ: then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he said, Holy Father, you
see what I get by all my Care: if the
pains I take do not help me in the other
World, I do but loose my Time in this.
The <hi>Pope</hi> was well pleased to see that he
had baffled all his Adversaries, layed his
hand upon his Shoulder, and said, make
no doubt but that you work for your
SOUL and BODY too, and pray go
on.</p>
            <p>The next day he sent for him and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orgio
Vasari,</hi> who was his Schollar, and then
in that Pope's Service, to his Retirement,
called, the <hi>Vigna Julia;</hi> where he found the
Pope sitting in the midst of twelve Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43902:178"/>
and was by him, though much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Will, forced to sit down amongst
them, and talk with them about his <hi>Vigna;</hi>
the Care of which he also undertook, and
brought it to that Perfection it now
has.</p>
            <p>After this, being very old, and not able
to stir much abroad, he did little but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Fabrick of <hi>San Peters,</hi> of which he
took care almost to his dying day, for seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years together; having been employed
by seven <hi>Popes,</hi> and Courted by all the
Great Princes of <hi>Christendom,</hi> for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and rare Skill in those three Noble
Arts of <hi>Painting, Sculpture,</hi> and <hi>Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year 1563,
having been for some time before without
stirring abroad, he payed the Tribute to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
being very sensible to the last. His <hi>Will</hi>
contained but three Lines, leaving his Soul
to God, his Body to the Earth, and all
that he had to his nearest Relations. He
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43902:179"/>
was ninety years of Age when he dyed,
and preserved his Judgment and Memory
to the last.</p>
            <p>Few have Censured his Works with any
success; but some more malicious, have
endeavoured to blemish his Memory by the
Imputation of <hi>Ill Nature,</hi> and <hi>Covetuousness.</hi>
Of both which it is easie to clear him. For
the first, it must be owned, he gave some
Grounds for it by his Morosness to other
Artists, his Contemporaries, and to such
whom he found impertinently pretending
to Judge of his Works: But I think,
that might be very excusable in one of such
extraordinary Abilities, that he saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that could contend with him, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
in any of the things he excell'd
in: And yet there are Infinite <hi>Designs</hi> of
his which he freely gave away, and made
for several Artists, at the very first Request
they made to him.</p>
            <p>And as for his <hi>Covetuousness,</hi> the very
things he gave away in his Life time, of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43902:179"/>
his Working, might have been sold for
thousands of Crowns; which, considering
what pains he took to acquire what he
had, may be sufficient to clear him of that
Imputation: But he was, besides, very
<hi>Charitable,</hi> relieving many poor people, and
Marrying privately some poor Maids.
But here we must not omit his Generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to <hi>Vrbino</hi> his Schollar and Servant; to
whom one day he said, If I die, <hi>Vrbino,</hi>
what will become of thee? And <hi>Vrbino</hi>
answered him, That he would Serve some
other Master. Alas! poor Wretch, said
<hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> that shall not be as long
as I can help thee out, and immediately gave
him two thousand Crowns. Which was
a Liberality more becoming a Great Prince
than a private Man, who got his Estate by
the Sweat of his Brows.</p>
            <p>He was pleasant enough in Conversation
where he was free: and there are some of
his Sayings that deserve to be remembred.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43902:180"/>
One day at <hi>Florence,</hi> some body having asked
his Opinion of the Statue of Saint <hi>Mary,</hi>
made by <hi>Donatello;</hi> he said, That if Saint
<hi>Mary</hi> were like that Figure, he would easily
have believed all he said, for he never saw
any Figure that had a more honest Look.
Being asked also, what he thought of the
<hi>Brass Gates</hi> in <hi>Sculpture,</hi> made by <hi>Lorenzo
Ghiberti,</hi> at Saint <hi>Jean</hi>'s Church; he said,
They deserved to be the Gates of Heaven.
Going one day by <hi>Modena,</hi> and seeing some
Statues of Earth Coloured like Marble,
made by <hi>Antonio Bigarino,</hi> a <hi>Modenese Sculptor,</hi>
he was charmed with the Beauty of them,
and said, If this Earth should become Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
wo be to all the Antient Statues of <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Graece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was carried to <hi>Florence</hi> after his Death,
and there Buryed in <hi>San Piero Maggiore,</hi> with
a great Concourse of People; though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any precedent Preparation, being Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the very next day after the Body came
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43902:180"/>
to Town; but all the Artists of the City
waited upon him to his Grave: Some
Months after he had most Magnificent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies
performed for him in the Church
of <hi>San Lorenzo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had for Schollars <hi>Jacobo Sansovino,
Il Rosso, Il Puntormo, Daniel di Volterra,</hi>
and <hi>Giorgio Vasari,</hi> of <hi>Arezzo.</hi> He had no
luck with those who lived with him as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks;</hi>
for <hi>Piero Vrbano</hi> of <hi>Pistoia,</hi> would
never take any pains, though he had a good
Disposition towards the Art: And <hi>Antonio
Mini</hi> took pains, but had no Genius.</p>

Humour, being always merry and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
without Offence, that <hi>Raphael</hi> loved him
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43902:181"/>
as if he had been his own Son, and employed
him above all his other Schollars in his Works
of greatest Importance; as, in the Pope's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments;

by the River-side; in which there is a most
admirable <hi>Landskip</hi> of <hi>Giulio</hi>'s own Invention:
he finished likewise good part of the Stories
that are painted in the Pallace of <hi>Agostin Chigi;</hi>
as likewise he drew all but the Head of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

Raphael</hi> being an admirable <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,</hi>
as well as <hi>Painter, Giulio</hi> took such delight
in drawing many of his Plots for Pallaces and
Churches, and other Buildings, that he at last
became a great Master that way: and <hi>Raphael</hi>

very honourably performed his <hi>Will,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the best part of them.</p>
            <p>After this Cardinal <hi>Giulian Medicis,</hi> who was
afterwards Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi> having
pitched upon a Spot of Ground in <hi>Rome,</hi> under
the <hi>Monte Mario;</hi> where, besides a dilicate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
there were Fountains and Wood, and a
Plain, which reaching all along the <hi>Tyber</hi> as
far as <hi>Ponte Molle,</hi> had on both sides an extent
of Meadows almost as far as the Gate of Saint

of this Ground, and to adorn it with most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Gardens, Woods, Fountains, Statues,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And gave <hi>Giulio Romano</hi> the Direction of

            <p>
               <hi>Adrian</hi> Succeeded <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth,</hi> who valuing
neither <hi>Pictures, Statues,</hi> nor <hi>Architecture,</hi> all
the Artists of <hi>Rome</hi> were at their wits-end how
to dispose of themselves; but his Pontificate
proved but short; and in his room, the same
Cardinal <hi>Giulian</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> was chosen, and
took the Name of <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Seventh: Giulio

be the Exaltation of all the fine Arts: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
by this Pope's Order, they fell to
work with Joy, to finish the Hall of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi>
in one of the sides <hi>Giulio</hi> drew <hi>Constantine,</hi>
making a Speech to his Souldiers; and in the
Air there appears the Sign of the Cross, with
these words, <hi>In hoc Signo vinces.</hi> In the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
side of the Room is a Battle fought near
<hi>Ponte Molle,</hi> where <hi>Constantine</hi> Routed <hi>Maxenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
Which Work, by reason of the Dying
and Wounded, and of the various and strange
Aptitudes of the Horse and Foot, who fight
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43902:183"/>
all in a Troop, is wonderful for <hi>Design,</hi> but
the <hi>Colouring</hi> is somewhat Faded, by reason of
the Black; which <hi>Giulio</hi> used much in his way
of painting, and which has taken away the
Beauty of many of his Pieces. In the same
Piece he chose for <hi>Landskip</hi> all that Countrey
that is under <hi>Monte Mario;</hi> and drew <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi>
drowning in the <hi>Tyber</hi> upon a dilicate
Horse. In a word, this Battle has been as
it were the Model for most Works of that
kind, and have been done since; and in
it <hi>Giulio</hi> showed how well he had studied <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>
and <hi>Antonius</hi>'s Pillars in <hi>Rome;</hi> for out of
them he took the Habits, Arms, Ensigns,
and other things of War proper to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</p>
            <p>The other side of the Room was adorned
with the Story of Saint <hi>Sylvester's</hi> Baptizing
<hi>Constantine;</hi> and under the Figure of Pope <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester,</hi>
he drew <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Seventh;</hi> as also, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Assistants he drew <hi>Il Cavalierino,</hi> who
was then his Favourite; and also <hi>Nicolo Vespuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi>
Knight of <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:43902:183"/>
Over the Chimney he drew the Church of
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in prospective, and the Pope sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
high Mass <hi>Pontifically;</hi> that is, with the
Assistants of all the Cardinals and Prelates
of the Court. At the Pope's Feet is figured
<hi>Constantine</hi> upon his Knees, presenting of the
City of <hi>Rome:</hi> Showing thereby, that <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
gave that City to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
In this piece there are several Women upon
their Knees, that look upon the Ceremony:
which are admirable Figures; he drew also
in this piece his own picture, and Count <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasar
Castiglione</hi>'s, the Author of <hi>Il perfecto Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigiano,</hi>
who was an Intimate Friend of <hi>Giulio's:</hi>
And it happening at that time, that the
said Count was Ambassadour from <hi>Frederick,</hi>
Marquess of <hi>Mantoua;</hi> he received Orders from
the Marquess his Master to provide him the
best <hi>Architect</hi> he could for his New <hi>Pallace;</hi>
and particularly, recommended to him to get
<hi>Giulio Romano,</hi> if possible; the Count so plyed
<hi>Giulio</hi> with promises and entreaties, that at
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:43902:184"/>
last he consented to go, if he might have the
<hi>Pope</hi>'s leave; which being obtained, they set
out together, and <hi>Giulio</hi> was presented to the
Marquess by the Count himself; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with all demonstrations of Favour,
and had immediately a House provided for
him, and a Table for himself, and <hi>Benedetto
Pagni</hi> his Schollar, as also for a Servant; the
Marquess besides sent him several Ells of <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
Damask,</hi> and fine <hi>Cloth,</hi> to make himself
Cloaths to his mind.</p>
            <p>A little after, hearing that <hi>Giulio</hi> had no
Horses, he presented him with a Favourite
Horse of his, and bid him get up upon him,
took him out of Town with him to a certain
place called <hi>Il Te,</hi> where he had some Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Stables in the middle of a fine Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
where he bred his best Horses; there he
showed him the place, and told him that he
would willingly have an Addition made to
the Building without spoiling the old Walls,
intending it only for a place of Recreation, to
go now and then and Supp in. <hi>Giulio</hi> having
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43902:184"/>
heard the Marquess's Design, fell immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to work; and making use of the old Walls,
he made the great Hall which we see now at
the Entrance, and the Chambers on each side
of it; all which he adorned with <hi>Pillars</hi> and
<hi>Capitals</hi> of a Rustick Order: which so pleased
the Marquess, that he resolved to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
of one Model; which <hi>Giulio</hi> did in this
Form. The <hi>Pallace</hi> is square, and has within
it a great green Court, in which are four En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
cross-wise: the Appartments within
are all variously painted; the <hi>Ceiling</hi> of the
great Hall is done in <hi>Fresco,</hi> with several Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and on the Walls are drawn all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses
best Horses, and his Dogs of the same
colour, and the marks as the Horses; all which
were Designed after the Life by <hi>Giulio,</hi> but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
by <hi>Benedetto Pagni</hi> his Schollar, and
<hi>Rinaldo Mantonano</hi> a painter; and indeed
they are so well done, that they seem
alive. From this you come into a Room on
one side of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> the <hi>Ceiling</hi> of which is
divided into Compartments of <hi>Stucco</hi>-work,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43902:185"/>
guilded in some places, which make a square
place; in which <hi>Giulio</hi> has drawn <hi>Cupid</hi> espousing
<hi>Psyche</hi> in the presence of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and all the other
Gods; and in this piece he has showed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Skill, the Shortnings being all <hi>di
Sorto intu,</hi> or from below, so exquisite, that a
Figure that is not a foot long, seems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three in looking upon it from the ground.
In the Octangles which inviron the <hi>Ceiling,</hi>
are drawn Stories of <hi>Psyche</hi>'s Adversity while
she was persecuted by <hi>Venus:</hi> the <hi>Colouring</hi> is all
of the same Hands, and in Oyl.</p>
            <p>Below on the sides of the Room, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stories of <hi>Psyche</hi> are in <hi>Fresco:</hi> and are, <hi>Psy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi>
in a Bath Bathed, and tended by little <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids,</hi>
who with most proper Gestures wash her
and wipe her dry. On the other Wall is a
Banquet prepared by <hi>Mercury,</hi> where the <hi>Graces</hi>
adorn the Table with Flowers, while <hi>Bacchus
Silenus</hi> and the <hi>Bacchantes</hi> are by, singing and
playing upon Instruments; there is a Side-Board
covered with <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoons,</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:43902:185"/>
and on it three rows of drinking-Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of all sorts, so bright and shining that
they seem perfect Gold and Silver; not far
from this Table is seen <hi>Psyche</hi> her self waited
upon by Women of great Beauty; while at a
distance, <hi>Phaebus</hi> in his Charr drawn by four
Horses, comes to enlighten the Day; and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrus</hi>
naked upon certain Clouds, blows in a
Horn to make the Air sweet and pleasant
round about <hi>Psyche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another Corner of the Pallace which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to the Room where the Stories of <hi>Psyche</hi>
are painted, <hi>Giulio</hi> resolved to build an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that should correspond with the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he designed for it; and to that purpose,
having layed a very strong Foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the place was Marshy, and made Walls
capable of bearing a double Vault; he made
the In-side of gross <hi>Rustick</hi> Work, the Stones
whereof seemed to be put together by chance,
and ready to fall out of their places; and then
he painted it with one of the oddest Fancies
that it was possible to imagine; and that is,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:43902:186"/>
the Story of <hi>Jupiter</hi> destroying the Giants with
Thunder and Lightning: In the middle of the
Vault he drew Heaven, and in it <hi>Jupiter</hi> in
his Throne above the Clouds.</p>
            <p>A little below he drew <hi>Jupiter</hi> again, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of the Gyants, assisted by <hi>Juno;</hi> the
other Gods in various Aptitudes, most of them
astonished, seem to fly away, to avoid the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and Disorder which is threatned from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
on the sides of the Room are the Gyants,
some of which have whole Mountains and
Rocks whelmed over them, others seem to fly
at a distance through a Grotto that is made
hollow, and others are struck down with the
Ruines of Temples and Pillars that fall upon
them, making a great Slaughter of them;
and upon the Chimney, which is near these
Walls that seem to hang as if they would fall,
he drew <hi>Pluto,</hi> with his Char drawn by fiery
Horses, accompanied by Infernal Furies, and
seeming to fly to the Center of the Earth. By
which Invention <hi>Giulio</hi> did not depart from
his Subject, and yet alluded to Fire; which
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:43902:186"/>
was the properest Ornament for the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
'Tis impossible to see a Story, either
more boldly Designed, or more capriciously
Invented, the whole Composition hanging all
together without either Beginning or End;
and being adorned with variety of odd Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips
to such an Advantage, that the Room,
which is not fifteen yards in length, seems to
be a vast <hi>Compass.</hi> All which shews the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Judgment of <hi>Giulio;</hi> the <hi>Colouring</hi> is
all of <hi>Rinaldo Montouano,</hi> and admirable; for
in this Piece he attained to a great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
insomuch, that had he lived, and not dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Young, he would have proved a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Painter.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Giulio</hi> was thus employing his Talent
for the Marquess's Service, the River <hi>Po</hi> one
year broke its Banks, and overflowed a good
part of the City; whereupon <hi>Giulio</hi> by the
Command of the Marquess, caused all that
low part of the Town to be pulled down, and
upon those Ruines be raised New Buildings,
vvhose Foundations vvere higher than the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:43902:187"/>
Water: But in so doing, he could not but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
some Owners of Houses; who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Revenge: which coming to the Prince's
Ear, he declared, that whatsoever should be
done to <hi>Giulio,</hi> he would take as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and punish it accordingly. And indeed
the Duke was so in Love with the Vertues of
<hi>Giulio,</hi> that he could hardly live without him;
which made him likewise love the place so
well, that he built himself a House, which he
adorned with <hi>Stucco</hi> Work, and Antiquities he
had brought from <hi>Rome:</hi> And before he died,
he had almost built the whole City a new,
having inlarged the Streets, and given the
Design of most of the best Houses and Pallaces,
as also of the Churches and other publick
Aedifices.</p>
            <p>In the Duke's Pallace within the City he
made two noble <hi>Stair-Cases,</hi> a <hi>Lumaca;</hi> and
built nevv Appartments; in vvhich he paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the History of the <hi>Wars of Troy:</hi> and
in another Room, under the hands of the
Tvvelve <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, painted by <hi>Titian,</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:43902:187"/>
he made twelve Stories in Oyl; he built like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
another Pallace for the Duke about five
Miles from <hi>Mantua,</hi> called <hi>Marmirolo;</hi> which
was most commodiously contrived, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Paintings, not inferiour to those of
the Pallaces above mentioned.</p>
            <p>Several of his best things have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in prints by <hi>Giovan Baptista Mantouano:</hi>
the chief of which are these; A <hi>Chirurgion</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Cupping-Glasses</hi> upon a Woman's Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
a <hi>Madonna</hi> Travailing to Aegypt, where
<hi>Joseph</hi> has the <hi>Ass</hi> by the <hi>Halter,</hi> and some An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
pull down the Bows of a <hi>Date-Tree,</hi> that
Christ may gather the Fruit: a <hi>She-Wolf</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Suck to <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus:</hi> Four Stories
of <hi>Pluto, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> dividing Heaven,
Earth, and the Sea; a great Design of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
in which a number of Prisoners are put
to the Rack in several manners: The Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> had in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of both their Armies upon the Banks
of a River; and the Nativity of Saint <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:43902:188"/>
Graved by <hi>Sebastiano da Reggio.</hi> Several other
of his <hi>Designs</hi> have been Graved in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Flanders</hi> by good hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giulio</hi> was so great a <hi>Designer,</hi> and did it with
so much Ease, that none ever Designed so
much; he having made Horse-loads of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs</hi>
of one sort or other; for being a most
Universal <hi>Painter,</hi> and an Admirable <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,</hi>
no sort of <hi>Design,</hi> came amiss to
him; but he was particularly Learned in
Antiquity, understanding <hi>Medals</hi> most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
and having a rare Collection of
them.</p>
            <p>After the Death of the Marquess <hi>Frederick,</hi>
who had been made Duke by the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth: Giulio</hi> was so concerned for
the loss of so good a Master, that he would
have left <hi>Mantoua,</hi> if the Cardinal, Brother to
the late Duke, and who by reason of the
young Age of his Nephews, had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that State, had not used all sorts of
courteous ways to perswade him to stay; and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:43902:188"/>
considering besides, that he was Married there,
and had Houses, and all sorts of Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
both in the Town and Country, fit for a
Gentleman to live in, resolved to yield to the
Cardinals intreaties, and was by him imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Re-building the <hi>Duomo</hi> of the Great
Church, which he carried on a great way.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> published his
Judgment at <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Vasari</hi> sent to <hi>Giulio</hi>
three Designs of the seven Mortal Sins, taken
out of that Story of the <hi>Judgment:</hi> which he
receiving, it revived in him a desire of doing
something that should be as strong as that
way of <hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> and for that reason he
chose the Story of our Saviour's calling <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>Andrew,</hi> and bidding them leave their
Nets, and turn <hi>Fishers of Men:</hi> Which <hi>Cartoon</hi>
he finished with so much diligence and force,
that it was absolutely the best of all the things
he ever did; it was placed in a <hi>Chappel</hi> in the
Pallace, and painted by the Hand of <hi>Ferino Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soni,</hi>
an excellent Painter, and one of <hi>Giulio</hi>'s
best Schollars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:43902:189"/>
About this time <hi>Antonio Sangallo,</hi> the chief
<hi>Architect</hi> of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> being
dead, and the Super-Intendants of that Work
being much puzzled to find out a Man fit to
carry it on according to the Order already
begun; at last they pitched upon <hi>Giulio
Romano,</hi> and sent some of his Friends to him
to tempt him with great Offers; but all in
vain: for though he of himself could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have accepted such an Opportunity of
returning so gloriously to his own Countrey,
yet two things hindred him; first, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Cardinal of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> who was no
ways willing to let him go: and then the
Consideration of his Wife and Family, who
were much against it: and yet 'tis thought
he would have struggled with these two Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
if at the same time he had not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
sick; of which Distemper, what with
the Anxiety of seeing his desire of returning
to <hi>Rome</hi> frustrated, and the Strength of his
Disease together, he dyed in few days, being
just fifty four years old, and leaving a Son
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43902:189"/>
and a Daughter, and a good Estate to his Son,
whom in honour of his Master he had named,
<hi>Raphael.</hi> He was Buryed in the Church of
Saint <hi>Barnabe,</hi> without any Monument at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but a Resolution to have one made for
him; but his Son dying not long after, and
his Wife not being careful of the thing, it
was never begun. His Onely Daughter and
Heir <hi>Virginia,</hi> was Married in <hi>Mantoua</hi> to <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
Hercole Malatesta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giulio</hi> was of a middle Stature, black Hair,
an open jovial Countenance, with black Eyes,
Amorous in his Complexion, very well bred,
Sober in his <hi>Dyet,</hi> but Sumptuous in his <hi>Cloaths</hi>
and way of Living. This Epitaph is upon

            <head>The LIFE of
PERINO
DEL VAGA,
A
Florentine Painter.</head>
            <p>THere was in the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> one
<hi>Giovanni Buonacorsi,</hi> who in the Wars
of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi>
engaged in his Service in <hi>Italy,</hi> and not only
spent his Fortune, but his Life in his Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with that <hi>Court.</hi> He had had by a first
Wife a Son; whose Mother dying of the Plague
when the Child was not above two Months
Old, it was brought up for a while by a She-Goat;
till the Father going to <hi>Bologna,</hi> there
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43902:190"/>
Married a second Wife, who had lost her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Children by the Plague too; this
Mother-in-Law took compassion of this little
Creature, and having Milk of her own, made
an end of bringing it up. It was called <hi>Piero,</hi>
and by Diminutive, <hi>Pierino;</hi> and was by the
Father, who went into <hi>France</hi> to sollicite some
Reward for his Services, left in the Hands of
some Relations of his; who being weary of
keeping it, did, after some years, put it to
serve an <hi>Apothecary;</hi> but the Child not liking
that Trade, he was taken for Apprentice by a
certain ordinary Painter called <hi>Andrea de Ceri,</hi>
from his way of painting the <hi>Wax-Candles</hi> and
<hi>Torches</hi> that used to be carried in Procession up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certain days: But at last knowing that he
was not able to instruct the Child, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ingenious in any good Method of Painting,
he put him to <hi>Ridolfe,</hi> the Son of <hi>Domenico Ghir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landaio,</hi>
one of the best Painters in <hi>Italy;</hi> and
there he so improved himself, that he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stripped
all the Young Men, his Fellow-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:43902:191"/>
About that time there came to <hi>Florence</hi> a
<hi>Countrey-Painter</hi> called <hi>Il Vaga,</hi> and having seen
the Manner of <hi>Perino,</hi> who was already well
founded in <hi>Design,</hi> which he himself wanted,
he began to tempt him to go along with him
into the Countrey; promising him, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little working there, he would carry him
to <hi>Rome:</hi> at the mentioning of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Young
Man opened his Ears, knowing that place to
be the true School of all Artists; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
told <hi>Il Vaga,</hi> that if his two Masters
would give him leave, he would go along with
him; they both consented, and <hi>Il Vaga</hi> with
his new Companion went together to <hi>Tusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella,</hi>
where <hi>Il Vaga</hi> had a great deal of Work
to do; which he not only finished to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of those that employed him, but was still
going on upon new work, till <hi>Perino</hi> began to
complain of Breach of Promise from him, for
his not earrying him to <hi>Rome: Il Vaga,</hi> though
loath to leave his Business, which by the
means of <hi>Perino,</hi> grew considerable; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43902:191"/>
that <hi>Perino</hi> might go without him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be as good as his word; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
they both arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Il
Vaga</hi> very honestly recommended him to all
the Friends he had, and so returned to <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perino,</hi> who from this time forward, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
no otherwise than <hi>Perino del Vaga,</hi> found
himself nevertheless at no small loss how to
prosecute his Studies; for seeing every day
the Works of the Antients in <hi>Sculpture,</hi> and of
those famous Moderns, <hi>Raphael</hi> and <hi>Michael
Angelo</hi> in Painting, he was inflamed with an
incredible desire of imitating them: but
withal, considering his own Poverty and
mean condition, and how that to get Bread,
he must work for the Shops of ordinary Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
sometimes for one, and sometimes for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according as they would imploy him;
he saw that would be a great hinderance to
his desires of growing. Eminent in his Art:
but at last he found out the Expedient of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:43902:192"/>
his Week, and working three days for
Bread, and three others for Improvement, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these last the Holy-days and Sundays;
all which he spent in Designing all Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
things of both <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Modern Artists:</hi>
His chief Study amongst the <hi>Modern,</hi> was the
Chappel of Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> done by <hi>Michael Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo;</hi>
and in a short time he grew the boldest
<hi>Designer</hi> of all <hi>Rome,</hi> understanding the <hi>Muscles</hi>
and the difficulty of the Art in <hi>Naked Figures,</hi>
better than any of his <hi>Contemporaries.</hi> This
made him be taken notice of by <hi>Giulio Romano</hi>
and <hi>Giovan Francesco,</hi> called <hi>Il Fattore,</hi> and both
together commended him to <hi>Raphael</hi> their
Master, who having seen his <hi>Designing,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
that he would one day be excellent
in the Art: and as <hi>Raphael</hi> never let slip the
Occasion of retaining and helping forward any
ingenious young <hi>Artist;</hi> particularly when his
<hi>humour</hi> &amp; <hi>behaviour</hi> was <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>modest,</hi> as <hi>Perino
del Vaga</hi>'s was, he presently imployed him in
the Appartments of the Pope's Pallace, which
he was then adorning for <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth:</hi> He
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43902:192"/>
had constituted Master of the <hi>Stucco-Work</hi> and
<hi>Grottesks</hi> one <hi>Giovanni da Vdine,</hi> the rarest in
that kind of any that hath been either before
or since, particular in Animals, Fruits, &amp; such
like small Ornaments; and under him he
employed several Young Men, and according
as they excell'd and grew able, they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to greater Salaries; which proved a
mighty School for <hi>Artists</hi> of all kinds: Among
these he placed <hi>Perino del Vaga,</hi> recommending
him to <hi>Giovanni da Vdine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perino</hi> seeing himself Master of that Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
he had so long sought, fell to work
with such <hi>diligence,</hi> that in a few Months he
was reputed clearly the best of all those <hi>Young
Men</hi> who worked under <hi>Giovanni da Vdine,</hi> and
may easily this day be distinguished from the
others at first <hi>Sight;</hi> for though the <hi>Designs</hi>
were all <hi>Raphael</hi>'s, yet the manner of putting
them in execution was very different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Genius and Skill of each <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;</hi>
and besides <hi>Perino</hi> has a Beauty of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:43902:193"/>
which distinguishes him from all
the rest.</p>
            <p>What he did in the Pope's Pallace, gave him
great Reputation; but that was so far from
laying him asleep, and making him presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
rely upon the Skill he had acquired,
that on the contrary, he grew thereby more
ardent and desirous to attain to the great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he saw before his Eyes in his Master
<hi>Raphael;</hi> to whom he carried himself so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively
and respectfully, that <hi>Raphael,</hi> won
by his Behaviour, loved him as if he had been
his own Child.</p>
            <p>The Great Hall called <hi>La Sala de Pontifici</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ordered to be painted and adorned with
<hi>Stucco-Work,</hi> the doing of the <hi>Vault</hi> and <hi>Celing</hi>
was committed equally to <hi>Giovanni da Vdine,</hi>
and <hi>Perino del Vaga;</hi> they divided the <hi>Ceiling</hi>
into seven Ovals, in which they painted the
Seven Planets, drawn each of them by the
Animal that is appropriated to them by the
Poets; as, <hi>Jupiter</hi> by his <hi>Eagle, Venus</hi> by her
<hi>Doves,</hi> &amp;c. To which they added the <hi>Signs</hi> of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:43902:193"/>
the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> with several others of the
Heavenly <hi>Constellations;</hi> the most of which <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
are of the hand of <hi>Perino.</hi> In the middle
of the <hi>Vault</hi> or <hi>Ceiling</hi> is a Round, in which are
four <hi>Figures</hi> like four Victories, which hold
the Pope's Crown and Keys; which <hi>Figures</hi>
being shortned most Masterly, are besides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with a most beautiful, light <hi>Drapery,</hi>
which discovers most gracefully so much of
their Naked Arms and Legs as is decent. This
work was extreamly liked by the Pope, and
the Contrivers of it rewarded according to
the Magnificent Humour of that Prince:
But his Successour <hi>Adrian</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi> being
shortly after come to <hi>Rome,</hi> all the <hi>Artists</hi> found
themselves not only neglected and laid aside,
but despised and scorned; for he being a <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi>
and a Man of Severity, and pedantick
Learning, thought those more Refined Arts
little better than Mortal Sins: whereupon
<hi>Raphael</hi> being dead, and all the other <hi>Artists</hi>
dispersed, <hi>Perino</hi> went to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he did
several things, till the Plague drove him from
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:43902:194"/>
thence, and forced him to wander from place
to place, and shift as well as he could. But
in the Year 1523, <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Seventh,</hi> of the
House of <hi>Medicis,</hi> being Created Pope, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
all the Artists that were left to <hi>Rome;</hi>
and amongst the first, <hi>Perino del Vaga;</hi> whose
Reputation was so great, that the Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cast his Eye on <hi>Giulio Romano</hi> and <hi>Giovan
Francesco Il Fattore,</hi> as Heirs of <hi>Raphael's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
and Skill, to make them the chief Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
of all that he should think fit to have
done; they wisely foreseeing that <hi>Perino</hi>
would prove a shroad Competitor in their
Art and Business, resolved to take him in;
and to that end they gave him <hi>Catherine,</hi> the
Sister of <hi>Giovan Francesco</hi> for Wife; tying him
by this Bond of Affinity, to pursue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Interest the better. But they had not
long work'd together, when that great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
of the Sack of <hi>Rome</hi> confounded all
their Designs afresh. In that Mis-fortune
<hi>Perino</hi> was fain to run up and down with his
Wife and a Child, carrying them from place
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:43902:194"/>
to place to save them from the Fury and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
of the Souldiers; and at last,
he himself was taken Prisoner, and forced to
pay a Ransom, with such ill usage into the
bargain, that he had like to have run mad; at
last the fury of the Sack being a little over,
he fell to working some odd little things;
which he sold as well as he could to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Commanders and Souldiers, living but
poorly: but it happening luckily, that <hi>Il Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viera,</hi>
who had the managing of the Prints of
<hi>Raphael,</hi> escaped pritty well, and lost but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in the Storm; he out of his Friendship to
<hi>Perino,</hi> set him to work, to <hi>Design</hi> a good part
of the Stories, where the Gods transform
themselves into other shapes to obtain the
end of their Amours: and these were Graved
in <hi>Copper</hi> by <hi>Jacobo Caralgio,</hi> an excellent Graver
of that time, and one who has admirably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the beauty of the <hi>Contours</hi> of <hi>Perino</hi>'s Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
            <p>But all this did but just keep <hi>Perino</hi> from <hi>star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:43902:195"/>
with little hopes of better Times, the Pope
and most of the Inhabitants of <hi>Rome</hi> being
fled; when Providence sent thither <hi>Nicolo Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiano,</hi>
a Servant of Prince <hi>Dorias,</hi> and a rare
Workman in <hi>Tapestry-work,</hi> who being an old
Acquaintance of <hi>Perino</hi>'s, and seeing him in
that misery, perswaded him to go with him
to <hi>Genoa,</hi> promising him to endeavour to bring
him into Employment for his Master; who,
he said, had a design to have his whole Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
altered, and painted by some good hand.
It was not difficult for him to prevail with
<hi>Perino,</hi> who having placed his Wife with her
Relations in <hi>Rome,</hi> set forward for <hi>Genoa</hi> with
his Friend <hi>Nicolo.</hi> At his Arrival he was
most kindly entertained by the Prince, who
thought himself beholding to <hi>Fortune</hi> for dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such an Artist into his Arms. After
some Discourses had together about the
Prince's Design, they resolved to make a New
Pallace, which should be adorned with <hi>Stucco-Work</hi>
paintings in <hi>Fresco,</hi> and Oyl-paintings of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:43902:195"/>
all kinds; and because it was the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of <hi>Perino del Vaga,</hi> I will here describe the
whole thing.</p>
            <p>The Entrance into the Prince's <hi>Pallace</hi> is a
Marble Gate of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, having on
each side the Figures of two Women in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
who hold up the Arms of the <hi>Dorias;</hi> the
Figures are done by <hi>Sylvio</hi> of <hi>Fiesole,</hi> a bold and
excellent <hi>Sculptor;</hi> but the <hi>Gate</hi> and <hi>Pallace</hi> are
according to the Design and Models of <hi>Perino
del Vaga.</hi> Having passed the Entrance, you
come into a kind of Hall, or Landing-place,
the Vault or Ceiling of which is adorned with
<hi>Stucco-work,</hi> mingled with paintings that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
several Men fighting in different po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures;
all wrought with great Art and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
On the Left-hand is the <hi>Stair-Case;</hi>
than the which, nothing can be more Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for <hi>Grottesks, Antiques,</hi> little Figures of
<hi>Boys, Animals,</hi> and other things; all made with
that Richness of Invention and Judgment that
his things used to be. On the top of the
<hi>Stair-Case</hi> you land in a dilicate Room, which
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:43902:196"/>
has on each side a Marble Door, and over the
Door on each hand, two Figures of a Man
and Woman turn'd differently, to show the
Fore and hind parts; the <hi>Vault</hi> divided into
five Arches, is wrought with <hi>Stucco-Work,</hi>
mingled with Ovals of paintings; the sides
of the Room are painted down to the very
ground with the pictures of the famous Men
of the House of <hi>Doria,</hi> some after the Antique,
some after the Modern Dress, all Armed, and
over them is written in Letters of Gold these
words;
<q>Magni Viri, Maximi Duces, Optima fecere
pro Patria.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the first Room, which answers to one
of the Marble Doors on the Left-Hand, the
Ceiling is painted with the Story of the
Storm that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was in at Sea, in which
there are Naked Figures, both dead and alive
in various Aptitudes, great numbers of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and Vessels broken and over-set, the Sea
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:43902:196"/>
most terribly raging, in high billows, the
Heavens obscured, and in a word, all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of a Storm. This was the first Story
that <hi>Perino</hi> did for the Prince; and 'tis said,
that while he was making his <hi>Cartoon,</hi> which
he did at leisure, viewing <hi>Genoa</hi> in the mean
while, and diverting himself sometimes with
his Friends, a painter of <hi>Bologna,</hi> called <hi>Girolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
da Frevisi,</hi> who worked likewise in the
Prince's Pallace, used to laugh at <hi>Perino</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
and making of <hi>Cartoons,</hi> saying, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all that ado, he had the perfection of the
Art at his Pencil's end: This being told <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi>
he all of a sudden clap'd his <hi>Cartoon</hi> to the
<hi>Ceiling,</hi> and opened the Room, that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
might come to see it; which all <hi>Genoa</hi> did,
and among the rest, this painter, who having
view'd it, and seen the strength of <hi>Design</hi> and
greatness of the Manner, was so surprized,
that without saying a word, next day, he
packed up all he had, and retired to <hi>Bologna,</hi>
leaving <hi>Perino</hi> to serve the Prince by himself.</p>
            <p>In the other Room on the Right Hand, he
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:43902:197"/>
made also pictures in <hi>Fresco</hi> in the Ceiling, and
in <hi>Stucco-Work</hi> he Represented the Story of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s
destroying the Giants by Thunder;
where there are many fine Figures Naked,
and bigger than the Life; he made four Rooms
more, all the Ceilings of which are adorned
with <hi>Stucco-Work,</hi> and mingled with paintings
in <hi>Fresco,</hi> expressing the finest of <hi>Ovids</hi> Fables;
and indeed, one cannot imagine any thing
better invented, nor better Coloured; for
<hi>Perino</hi> was a great Master of Colouring in
<hi>Fresco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The four Rooms that answer to these on
the other side the Pallace, are likewise adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and painted in the same Manner, but done
by his Men upon the Designs he gave them,
where many good painters have wrought;
and particularly, one <hi>Lucio Romano,</hi> who excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in <hi>Grottesks</hi> and <hi>Stucco-Work.</hi> In a word,
the whole Pallace, to the very Closets, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
adorned by his hand and <hi>Designs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having finished this Pallace, the Prince was
so extreamly pleased with him, that he made
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:43902:197"/>
him make <hi>Designs</hi> for his Hangings, in which
were represented the Loves of <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
and the best part of the Stories of the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides</hi>
of <hi>Virgil;</hi> likewise the Ornaments for the
<hi>Poops</hi> of his Gallies, his Standards, or Flags,
his Cloths of State which he adorned his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
withal, were all Designed by the same
Hand. And now <hi>Perino</hi> might have reckoned
upon being settled in <hi>Genoa,</hi> if a Fancy had
not taken him to choose <hi>Pisa</hi> rather for the
place to spend his Old Age in, that City plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him better; he therefore took a House
there, and sent for his Wife from <hi>Rome;</hi> but
he had not been long there, and begun some
Work for the <hi>Duomo,</hi> which he was to have
painted all with new Designs; when on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
the Remembrance of some Amours he
had left at <hi>Genoa,</hi> coming into his head, he
left all, and returned thither: Prince <hi>Doria</hi>
entertained him with the same good Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had found before, and set him to work;
as many others of the Chief Citizens of <hi>Genoa</hi>
did also; but the Capricio to which <hi>Perino,</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:43902:198"/>
as most great painters, was now and then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
took him again, and having some propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
made to him of returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Memory of that place under the Glorious
Pontificate of <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Tenth,</hi> running likewise
in his head, he accepted the proposal of his
Friends, and went thither; but he had soon
reason to repent of his Folly; for he was not
only neglected by the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neze</hi>
his Nephew, for many Months, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
he had like to have lost his Arm by a
Humour that fell upon it, and which cost
him many hundreds of Crowns before it was
Cured.</p>
            <p>At last, <hi>Signior Pietro Massioni,</hi> having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
a Chappel in the Church of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
the Ceiling of which, and the chief-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
piece were already done by <hi>Giulio Romano;</hi>
he agreed with <hi>Perino</hi> to paint the rest of the
Chappel. Having contrived an Ornament
part of <hi>Grottesks,</hi> part painted, and part in
<hi>Basso Relievo:</hi> He drew two Stories; the one
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:43902:198"/>
of the <hi>Piscina Probatica,</hi> with good prospective
in it; and the other, of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of
<hi>Lazarus;</hi> to these he added the Stories of our
Saviour's Curing the <hi>Centurion's</hi> Daughter;
his driving the <hi>Changers</hi> out of the <hi>Temple;</hi> his
<hi>Transfiguration,</hi> and another Story; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pilasters, he drew four Figures of
the four Prophets; which really are as
beautiful as 'tis possible for Figures to be;
being most admirably proportioned, and
thorowly finished; for he did all this
Work with his own Hand. After this, he
did little in <hi>Rome:</hi> but the Pope took such
notice of this Work, that he ordered him a
Pension of about six or seven pound a
Month, only to look after the Pallace of
the Pope, and that of the <hi>Casa Farneze:</hi>
He being now much subject to a <hi>Catarrhe,</hi>
or <hi>Fluxion</hi> upon his <hi>Lungs,</hi> was forced to
employ others to carry on his <hi>Designs;</hi>
which has very much injured them;
as appears by what he did in <hi>CAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEL</hi>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:43902:199"/>
Saint <hi>ANGELO,</hi> and other
places.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Perino del Vaga</hi>'s Misfortune, to have
dissipated in Women and good Chear, the best
part of what should have maintained him in
his Old Age; of which Errour being now
grown sensible, he to repair it, fell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which was, to make himself cheap, by
undertaking any little piece of Work for a
small Summ of ready Money; nay, often do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a world of things for the Pope's Officers,
only that they might not molest him in the
little payments he now and then got from
Court; and they having found out his blind
side, never let him want Employment;
besides which, his Time being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
taken up by <hi>Sculptors, Gravers,
Joyners, Embroiderers, Guilders,</hi> and such like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists;
all which he was to oversee, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
besides Infirm, he had no other Comfort,
but as often as he could, to get to the Tavern
with a good Companion, and there drown his
Sorrows in a Glass of good Wine, that being
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:43902:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a place he had much frequented all his Life
time; which, with some Disorders of <hi>Venus,</hi>
brought him to his end, at the <hi>Age</hi> of forty
seven years: He was Buried in the <hi>Rotonda</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi> in the Chappel of Saint <hi>Joseph;</hi> where
<hi>Josepho Lincio</hi> a Physitian, and his Intimate
Friend and Son in Law, caused this Epitaph
to be Graved.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of
TITIANO
DA LADORE,
A
PAINTER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>TItian</hi> was Born at <hi>Ladore,</hi> a little Town
upon the River <hi>Piave,</hi> in the Year
1480; the Name of his Family was
<hi>Vecelli,</hi> of the best of the place; about ten
years old, he was sent to an Uncle he had at
<hi>Venice;</hi> who seeing him much inclined to
painting, placed him with <hi>Gian Bellino,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
painter of those days: The painters of
<hi>Lombardy</hi> and those parts, had not any Statues
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:43902:200"/>
or Works of the Antients to draw by; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to help themselves, they used to Design
after the Life, but in a Manner so flat and
stiff, that their Works had little or no Grace;
and <hi>Titian</hi> learned this Manner first, and was
a great Proficient in it. But about the Year
1507, <hi>Giorgione</hi> being come to <hi>Venice, Titian</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
his Manner, full of Strength, left his
old Master's way, and imitated this new one
with so much success, that his pictures were
often taken for <hi>Giorgione</hi>'s; which caused no
small Emulation between them; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when <hi>Giorgione</hi> having undertaken one
Front of the <hi>Fondaco di Tedeschi,</hi> the other was
given to <hi>Titian;</hi> for there he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so admirably, that one day, some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen
of <hi>Venice</hi> meeting with <hi>Giorgione,</hi> and not
knowing that any but himself was employed
in that work, they gave him joy of his good
success, particularly on that side towards the
<hi>Merceria,</hi> telling him, that he had out-done
that which was towards the <hi>Canal Grande:</hi>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:43902:201"/>
which so vexed <hi>Giorgione,</hi> that before the work
was quite finished, he hid himself for several
days in his House, and from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
renounced all Friendship and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with <hi>Titian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such beginnings could promise no less than
an extraordinary Success in the Art; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
if <hi>Titian</hi> had added that great Skill of
managing <hi>Colours,</hi> the Study of <hi>Designing</hi> after
the <hi>Antique;</hi> for want of which, his Works
are often defective in Correctness of <hi>Design:</hi>
but however, the beauty of his <hi>Colouring</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable,
no Painter having ever been so rare
a Colourer of the Beauties of Nature in all
kinds.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Gian Bellino, Titian</hi>'s Master,
being dead, and having left a Story unfinished
in the <hi>Sala del gran Concilio;</hi> which is that,
where the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbarossa</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Knees before Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> who puts
his Foot upon his Neck: <hi>Titian</hi> undertook to
finish it; and having changed a great deal of
his Master's <hi>Design,</hi> he drew there by the Life
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43902:201"/>
many <hi>Senators,</hi> and others of his Friends then
living, using in that the Liberty of a <hi>Lombard
Painter;</hi> for it was not probable those Persons
there drawn, could be present at the passage
of the Story there represented. This piece was
so well liked, that the Senate for a Reward,
bestowed upon him an Office called <hi>La Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
of about three hundred Crowns a year:
which Office they always used to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the best <hi>Painter</hi> of their City, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he shall make the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Picture for
the price of eight Crowns, to be payed by the
<hi>Doge</hi> himself: Which Picture is to be placed
afterwards in the Pallace of St. <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the year 1514, <hi>Alphonso,</hi> Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
sent for <hi>Titian</hi> to finish likewise a Room
which had been begun, and pritty well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
by <hi>Gian Bellino:</hi> there remained two
pieces to be done; which <hi>Titian</hi> showed all
the Skill he could in: the one was a kind of
<hi>Baccanat,</hi> or Dance, of Men and Women drunk
and singing, amongst which is one naked Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
asleep, of such exquisite Beauty, that she
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43902:202"/>
seems to be alive: and in this piece <hi>Titian</hi>
wrote his Name: the other contains a great
many <hi>Cupids</hi> and <hi>Boys</hi> in different Aptitudes,
about an Altar that has the Statue of <hi>Venus</hi>
upon it.</p>
            <p>Upon the Door of an Armory <hi>Titian</hi> drew
likewise the picture of our Saviour, to whom
a <hi>Jew</hi> is showing the piece of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Coyn;
which Head, and the pictures mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are reputed by all Artists the best things
that ever <hi>Titian</hi> did; and he was accordingly,
most liberally rewarded by the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being returned to <hi>Venice,</hi> he drew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
piece of Saint <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in the Church
of <hi>S. Giovanni Epolo;</hi> there you may see the
Saint something bigger than the Life, fallen
upon the Ground in a Wood, and attacked by
a Souldier, who has so wounded him in the
Head, that the horrour of Death is painted
upon his Face; while his Companion flying,
shows as much Apprehension in his; in the
Air are two Angels invironed with sudden
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43902:202"/>
Glory, which enlightens the Landskip; which
is most admirable: and indeed, this piece is
the most Celebrated of any he ever did,
as being the best understood of all his
Works.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1530, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Germany,</hi> being come to <hi>Bologna, Titian</hi>
by the means of <hi>Pietro Aretino,</hi> his good Friend,
was sent far to draw the Emperour; of whom
he made an Admirable picture, all in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and was rewarded with a present of
a thousand Crowns: and not long after, being
returned to <hi>Venice,</hi> and having made there a
most excellen piece of the <hi>Annuntiation;</hi> for
which <hi>Titian</hi> demanded five hundred Crowns;
they for whom it was made, refusing to come
up to his price, he, by the advice of <hi>Aretin,</hi>
sent it as a Present to the Emperour, who
sent him two thousand Crowns in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the same Emperour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Hungary,</hi> met Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the
<hi>Seventh</hi> at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and there he again sent for
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:43902:203"/>
               <hi>Titian,</hi> who again made his picture, and that
of Cardinal <hi>Hyppolito</hi> of <hi>Medicis:</hi> both which
are preserved among the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his
Rarities. He drew likewise at the same time,
<hi>Alphonso Davalo</hi>'s, Marquess <hi>Del Guasto,</hi> and his
Friend <hi>Pietro Aretino:</hi> and here he was brought
to the presence of <hi>Frederick Gonzaga,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Mantoua,</hi> whose picture, and his Brother the
<hi>Cardinal</hi>'s he likewise made; the Duke carried
him to <hi>Mantoua;</hi> where he made the Heads of
the Twelve <hi>Caesars;</hi> under every one of which
<hi>Giulio Romano</hi> made afterwards a Story.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1546, he was invited to <hi>Rome</hi> by
Cardinal <hi>Farnese;</hi> whose picture and the
Pope's, with that of Duke <hi>Octavio</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> he
drew at length; and they are admirable pieces.
While he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> being one day visited
by <hi>Michaeel Angelo</hi> and <hi>Vassari,</hi> he showed them
a <hi>Danae,</hi> a most dilicate Naked Figure for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring
and Tenderness, but not perfectly
well Designed; which made <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> say
afterwards, that if <hi>Titian</hi> had had his Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the School of <hi>Rome,</hi> he would have
proved the greatest <hi>Painter</hi> of his Age; having
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:43902:203"/>
a great <hi>Genius,</hi> and much Spirit and Vivacity,
but he wanted <hi>Correctness.</hi> He was highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by the Pope for his pains, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well satisfied to <hi>Venice;</hi> but something
astonished at the Works he had seen of the
<hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Florentine Painters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was now called upon once more to
draw the Emperour, who was grown Old;
and he did it admirably, insomuch that the
Emperour Knighted him, and assigned him a
Pension of two hundred Crowns a Year upon
the Chamber of <hi>Naples.</hi> He made some alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in his Manner about this time, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very different from what he did when he
was Young; for his first pictures are done
with most incredible diligence, so as they will
bear being looked upon near, and yet show
well at a distance too; but the Works he did
about this time, are so full of Strokes and
Spots, after a certain bold Manner, that they
seem nothing near, but look very well at a
distance. Which Manner of his several <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
endeavouring to imitate, have made very
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:43902:204"/>
gross, course pieces. This way, though it
seems easie, is the most laborious of all; but
it is made to hide the pains of the Artist.</p>
            <p>To enumerate here all his Works, were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
for there was hardly a person of any
Eminence in <hi>Italy,</hi> whose picture he did not
do: he also made many pieces for the King of
<hi>Spain, Philip</hi> the <hi>Second:</hi> the chief of which is a
<hi>Cena Domini</hi> with the twelve Apostles, being
a great piece of seven yards long, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Beauty.</p>
            <p>He worked with Vigour and Spirit till he
was about threescore and six years Old: but
it is to be wished that he had given over then;
for what he did afterwards was far short of
those done before. He was of a most admirable
Constitution, having never been sick in all
his Life time, and he never knew any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
of Fortune, but was always healthy,
pleasant, and happy: his House was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
of all the Ingenious, and of the people of
the best Quality, he himself being extreamly
well Bred, and Courteous. His pictures were
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:43902:204"/>
payed at what Rates he pleased; so that he
lived Easie and Rich: he has adorned all <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and many other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> with his
Works, which are innumerable; and which
was more singular, never had any Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in <hi>Venice,</hi> either to give him Jealousie or
Disturbance; and those few that pretended
to it, he easily overcame, having all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Wits on his side; to some of whom
he taught his Art; as particularly, to a very
fine Gentleman called <hi>Gian Maria Verde Zotti,</hi>
who had learned to do Landskips admirably
under him; and he has two of the best pieces
of <hi>Titian's</hi> doing, <hi>to wit,</hi> an <hi>Apollo</hi> and a
<hi>Danae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though a great many did work under <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
yet there were but few that attained to
any great Perfection: he that best imitated
his Manner, was one <hi>Paris Bondone,</hi> whom <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
was most afraid of, and turned him out of
Doors when he was but eighteen years Old,
seeing how likely he was to Supplant him:
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:43902:205"/>
He nevertheless continued in <hi>Venice,</hi> and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
not ot only <hi>Titian</hi>'s, but <hi>Giorgione</hi>'s way
perfectly. The best piece of his doing,
is a Story in the School of Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> at
St. <hi>Gian y Polos:</hi> it is, when a Fisherman
presents the Signoria of <hi>Venice</hi> with Saint
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Ring; there are very fine Buildings
in Prospective, round about which sits the
whole Senate, with the <hi>Doge;</hi> and among the
Senators, there are a great many of them done
by the Life, of extraordinary Beauty: the
piece is in <hi>Fresco,</hi> and got <hi>Paris Bondone</hi> great
Reputation.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of
DONATO,
A
Florentine Sculptor.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>DOnato,</hi> who was likewise called <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello,</hi>
and subscribed himself so in
some of his Works, was Born at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
in the Year 1303, and applying himself
to the Art of <hi>Designing,</hi> proved, not only a
most excellent <hi>Sculptor</hi> and <hi>Statuary,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
was very intelligent in <hi>Perspective, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi>
and all manner of <hi>Stucco-Work:</hi> His
Works have so much Design, Truth, and
Grace in them, that they seem with reason,
to be liker the best things of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43902:206"/>
               <hi>Romans,</hi> than of any others: Which without
difficuly, gives him the first Rank among the
<hi>Sculptors;</hi> he was the first that understood how
to put Story in Use in <hi>Basso Relievos;</hi> in
which he showed so much Ease and Mastery,
that he may be said to have had the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of that part of <hi>Sculpture.</hi> So that
not only in his Life time, but even in our
Age, none have come near him in that
kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donato</hi> was brought up from a Child in the
House of <hi>Ruberto Martelli,</hi> and for the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Temper, and the excellency of his
Genius, was not only always beloved by him,
but also, by all that Noble Family.</p>
            <p>He wrought many things while he was
Young; but that vvhich first made him
knovvn, vvas the Annuntiation of the Angel
to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> all of Grey Stone; vvhich
is upon the Altar in the Chappel of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcanti</hi>
in <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> in <hi>Florence.</hi> This he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
vvith a Border of <hi>Grottesk-Work,</hi> adding
to it six boys, vvho hold <hi>Festoons</hi> of Flovvers,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43902:206"/>
and seem to hang together out of fear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from so high a place; but particularly,
he shovved great Art in the Figure of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
vvho something frighted vvith the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
apparition of the Angel, turns herself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards
him vvith a fearful Modesty, and in
her Countenance is all that Humility and
Gratitude vvhich so great a Favour must needs
fill her vvith. The Drapery both of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and the Angel, is made in Masterly Fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
in vvhich <hi>Donato</hi> vvas already aiming at
the great Art of the Antients, vvhose Fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are so Skilful, that though they are made
to hide the Naked, yet they seem to discover
it.</p>
            <p>In the same Church; near the Story paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Taddeo Gaddi,</hi> he made a <hi>Crucifix</hi> of Wood,
in vvhich having taken an infinite deal of
pains, and being pleased vvith it as a rare
thing, he shovved it to <hi>Philippo Bruneleschi,</hi> an
<hi>Architect,</hi> his Intimate Friend, desiring his
Opinion of it; <hi>Philippo,</hi> vvhose Expectation
had been raised by the vvords of <hi>Donato,</hi> smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43902:207"/>
a little at the sight of it, finding it much
below the Excellency <hi>Donato</hi> had given it;
which being observed by <hi>Donato,</hi> he begg'd of
him, that he would, according to the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that was between them, tell him truly
his Opinion of it: to which <hi>Philip,</hi> who was
very frank in his Nature, answered, that his
Opinion was, that he had put upon the Cross
the Body of some Peasant, and not one like
our Saviours, who 'tis probable, was the most
perfect, and finest shaped and proportioned of
any that ever was Born. <hi>Donato</hi> seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
smartly touched instead of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which he expected, could not forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
that it was not so easie to make a <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix</hi>
as to Judge of one; and that if <hi>Philippo</hi> had
tryed, he would then think his <hi>Christ</hi> a <hi>Christ,</hi>
and not a <hi>Peasant;</hi> therefore, said he, take a
piece of Wood, <hi>Philip,</hi> and try. <hi>Philip,</hi> vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
replying, let the Discourse fall; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come home, betook himself secretly to
vvork a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and in some Months finished
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43902:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, having strove to surpass <hi>Donato,</hi> that he
might justifie the Judgment he had made of
his. This done, one Morning he invited <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato</hi>
to Dine with him, who accepted the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation;
and as they were going together,
being come to the old <hi>Market-place, Philip</hi>
bought some little things for Dinner, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to <hi>Donato,</hi> desired him to go before,
and he would follow as soon as had dispatched
a little Business, which would be presently
done: <hi>Donato</hi> did so, and being come into the
House, the first thing he saw in a low Room,
was a <hi>Crucifix</hi> placed in a very good Light;
having considered it a while, he found it so
well finished, and perfect in all kinds, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seized with Astonishment, he opened his
hand, and let fall the Apron where were the
Eggs and Fruit, continuing still his Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without minding them: upon which
<hi>Philip</hi> coming in, said smiling, What do you
mean, <hi>Donato!</hi> What shall we have for Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to day, now you have let it all fall upon
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43902:208"/>
the Ground? I for my part, said <hi>Donato,</hi> have
had my share already, but no more words; I
must own that it is thy Gift to make a Christ,
mine to make a Peasant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donato</hi> made likewise in Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Church
in the same City, the Sepulture of Pope <hi>John
Coscia,</hi> who was Deposed from the Popedom by
the Council at <hi>Constance: Cosimo</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> in
whose House this Pope lived and died, caused
<hi>Donato</hi> to make this <hi>Tomb.</hi> He made the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the dead Pope in <hi>Bronze,</hi> and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> in <hi>Marble;</hi> and <hi>Miche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lozzo</hi>
his Schollar made that of <hi>Faith.</hi> Over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Work in the same Church, is a
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> of Wood, so admirably well
done, as being consumed with her Pennance
and Hardship, that she appears nothing but
Skin and Bone; and is a Master-piece of <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s.
He worked as much with his Brain as
with his Hands; for he made his Figures so to
the Place and Light where they were to stand,
that out of it they did not seem half to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful;
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43902:208"/>
whereas on the contrary, we see many
other <hi>Artists,</hi> who make things very fine
in their Working-Rooms, which being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from thence, appear worse a great
deal.</p>
            <p>He made for the COMPANY of
<hi>WEAVERS</hi> the Statue of Saint <hi>Mark</hi>
the Evangelist, and it was at first undertaken
by him and <hi>Bruneleschi</hi> together; but at last,
by the consent of <hi>Bruneleschi,</hi> he finished it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
this Figure was wrought with so much
Judgment, that being upon the Ground, and
not placed where it was to stand, it had like
to have been refused by the Masters of the
Company, for want of Skill to understand its
true Beauty: but <hi>Donato</hi> perswaded them at
last, to let him set it up, telling them, that he
would take some more pains with it when it
was up, and did not doubt but to please them;
accordingly, he made a Scaffold, and covered
the Figure for a Fortnight, as if he had been
at work about it; at the end of which time
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43902:209"/>
he opened it, and filled every body with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
at the Excellency of it.</p>
            <p>He made likewise in the Front of <hi>Sancta
Maria del Fiore,</hi> four Figures of about five
Palms high: two of which, made after the
Life, are in the middle; and one is <hi>Francesco So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derini,</hi>
who was then a Young Man; and the
other, <hi>Giovanni di Barduccio Cherichini,</hi> Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Il Zuccone:</hi> and it being as fine a thing
as any <hi>Donato</hi> ever made, he was likewise so
much pleased with it, that when he had a
mind to be believed in any thing he said, he
would, instead of affirming it by an Oath, say
only, <hi>By the Love I bear to my</hi> Zuccone: and
while he was working of it, being often plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with his success in that Statue, he would
stand and look upon it, and then say these
words in <hi>Italian, Favella or su Favella, O ti venga
il caca sangue:</hi> Which is in English, <hi>Speak, a
Plague take thee, speak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Lords of the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> he
made in Cast-Mettal, the Story of <hi>Judith</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off <hi>Holofernes</hi>'s Head: and in the Looks of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43902:209"/>
               <hi>Judith</hi> it was easie to see the greatness of her
Mind, and the Assistance from above; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the Air of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> oppressed with
Wine, Sleep, and Death, the spreading of a
<hi>Faintness</hi> all over upon the decay of his Spirits,
which made his Members look weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd:
The Basis likewise is a <hi>Balusted</hi> of
<hi>Granite-Stone,</hi> of a plain Order, but very grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<hi>Donato</hi> was so pleased with this piece,
that he wrote his Name under it in these
words, <hi>Donatelli Opus:</hi> Which he had not done
yet to any other piece of his.</p>
            <p>He made many things for the Family of
<hi>Medicis: Cosimo</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who was then the
Head of that Family, employing him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.
'Tis reported, that by the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of <hi>Cosimo,</hi> he made a very fine head
of <hi>Bronze</hi> for a <hi>Genouese</hi>-Merchant, and made it
very thin, and polished it, because it was to
be carried a good way: when it was finished,
<hi>Donato</hi> and the Merchant not agreeing about
the Price, the thing was referred to <hi>Cosimo,</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:43902:210"/>
who the better to view the Head, placed it in
his Court upon a <hi>Marble Balustead</hi> that looked
down into the Street; and desiring to make
up the difference between them, he found the
<hi>Genouese</hi> far from Reason on his side; and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that what he offered already, would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to above half a <hi>Florin</hi> a day for the time
that <hi>Donato</hi> had been about it; which he <hi>thought</hi>
was enough for a man of his Sort. <hi>Donato</hi> at
this was transported with Anger, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Merchant, told him, that in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
he could spoil the work of a whole year;
and thereupon struck the Head so, as it fell
over into the Street, and broke in twenty
pieces. The Merchant then repenting of his
foolish Parcimony, offered him twice as much
to make another: but <hi>Donato</hi> obstinately refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, telling him that Statues were not to be
bought by the Days-work, nor by the Pound,
as other Merchandize. And though <hi>Cosimo</hi>
himself joyn'd his Intreaties to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's,
yet he could not prevail with him to
make another Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:43902:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In the Family of the <hi>Martelli</hi> there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Stories of <hi>Marble</hi> and <hi>Bronze</hi> of his doing;
but particularly, a Saint <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Marble,</hi> of
three Palms high, and perfectly finished by
him: it was reputed by them so rare a piece,
that it was made a <hi>Fidei Commissum:</hi> so as it can
never be Sold or Mortgaged by any of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
And this they did to perpetuate the
Memory of the mutual Kindness that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Donato</hi> and that Family, under whose
Roof he had been Bred, and learned his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Much about this time, the City of <hi>Venice</hi>
having heard of the Fame of <hi>Donato,</hi> sent for
him to make something in the Honour of
<hi>Guatema Lata,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Padoua:</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
he made the Horse and the Figure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it which is in the place of Saint <hi>Antonio;</hi>
where he equally Succeeded in expressing the
Courage and Boldness of the <hi>Rider,</hi> with the
Fierceness and Mettle of the Horse. And
though the <hi>Figure</hi> be of Cast-Mettal, and large,
yet in <hi>Motion, Design, Art, Proportion,</hi> and <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:43902:211"/>
he appears equal to any of the Antient
Artificers, and far surpassing all those of his
Time, who were astonished at the greatness
of his Genius: the City of <hi>Padoua</hi> used all their
Endeavours to make him their Citizen, and
oblige him to settle amongst them; which to
obtain, they agreed with him to make the
Story of the Life of Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> of <hi>Basso Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo,</hi>
upon the Border of the great
Altar: which he performed with such
variety of Composition, and such an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Perspectives,</hi> that the
Masters of the ART do this day admire
them.</p>
            <p>While he was at <hi>Padoua,</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Priest,
who was Chaplain to a <hi>Nunnery,</hi> desired him to
make a Saint <hi>Sebastian</hi> of Wood for their
Church; and at the same time brought him
an old, ill favoured, mishapen thing, desiring
him to make it like that: which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to do, to humour them, could not
help nevertheless, the showing some Mastery
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:43902:211"/>
in it, though it were as like the old one as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
Many other Works he did at <hi>Padoua,</hi>
where he was continually admired and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded;
which made him resolve to return
to <hi>Florence,</hi> saying, That if he should stay any
longer in a place where he heard nothing but
high Commendations of himself, he should
forget all that he had ever learn't; therefore
he would go home, that he might hear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
blamed sometimes; that being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Spur an Artist could have to Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Being returned to <hi>Florence,</hi> he wrought an
Infinity of excellent things in all kinds, both
in <hi>Marble, Wood, Stone,</hi> and <hi>Bronze:</hi> the chief of
which are in the House of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and those
of other of the Nobility. It may truly be
said of him, that he was the Father of <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
being the first that brought the Works
of the <hi>Antients</hi> in Repute, and sought them out
where they lay neglected, taking the pains to
mend them and set them in order, as he did
with his own hand all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:43902:212"/>
In a word, <hi>Donato</hi> was so excellent in all the
parts of a great <hi>Sculptor,</hi> that he deserves the
highest Commendations; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in his time there were very few <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
discovered. He was, as to his own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
the most Obliging and Generous
that could be, not valuing Money in the
least; for he used to put that which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into a little Basket, which hung fix'd
to the <hi>Ceiling</hi> by a Pully; and there any of his
Friends and Schollars used to take what they
wanted, without so much as acquainting him
with it: therefore when he grew Old, and
not able to work, he was fain to accept of the
Generosity of <hi>Cosimo</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> and other
Friends. 'Tis said, that <hi>Cosimo</hi> dying, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him to his Son <hi>Piero;</hi> who being very
careful to execute his Father's <hi>Will,</hi> bestowed
a little <hi>Countrey Farm</hi> upon him, which he
might very well live out of: and <hi>Donato</hi> was
overjoyed at it, thinking that now he was
provided for, and needed not to fear Starving:
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:43902:212"/>
Starving; but for all that, he did not keep
it above a Year before he gave it back again to
<hi>Piero</hi> by a publick Contract, saying, he would
not loose his Quiet; which he must do if he
kept it; for every two or three days, the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
was at him for some Dammage or Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
sometimes the Wind had untiled the
House, sometimes his Cattle was pounded or
died: To all which <hi>Donato</hi> not being used, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be rid of him and the Land together.
<hi>Piero</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> laughed heartily at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and taking the Land again, assigned
him a <hi>Rent-Charge</hi> of the same value upon his
<hi>Bank</hi> at <hi>Florence;</hi> which was paid him every
Week to his great Content: and so he made
an end quietly of his Old-Age, in the eighty
third year of his Life, and in the Year
1466.</p>
            <p>He was Buried in <hi>San Lorenzo,</hi> next to the
Body of <hi>Cosimo di Medicis,</hi> being very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
Interred, and Accompanied to his Grave
by all the <hi>Artists,</hi> and the best part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the City.</p>
            <p>

One thing I must not forget to tell of him
in his last Sickness; which was, that some of
his Relations came about him, to perswade
him to leave them a little Countrey House
and Land, of a very small Value, which he
had near <hi>Prato,</hi> telling him, he ought in that
to gratifie them, as being next a Kin to him:
<hi>Donato</hi> hearing them out, told them, that he
was sorry he could not oblige them in their
Request, being resolved to bestow it upon the
poor Countrey-Man who had always looked
to it, and endured pains enough about it:
Thinking that a more reasonable Disposition,
than to give it them for a Visit which they
now made him when he was a dying, to no
other end than to get what they could out of
him.</p>
            <p>As for all the things belonging to his Art,
he distributed them among his Schollars; the
famousest of which were, <hi>Bertoldo,</hi> a <hi>Florentine
Sculptor, Il Rosellino Desideio,</hi> and <hi>Vellano di Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua.</hi>
And indeed, since his Death, who ever
has aimed at excelling in <hi>Relievo,</hi> must have
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:43902:213"/>
studied his Works; the number of which is
so great, that no Artist ever wrought so much
as he did; which was a great happiness for
<hi>Sculpture;</hi> the great variety of his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
being so many Lessons of all kinds
in that Profession; in which he showed both
Invention, Design, Practice, Judgment,
Strength, Sweetness; and in a word, all the
parts of a Divine and Wonderful Artist.</p>
