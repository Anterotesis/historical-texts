            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When we obserue the infinitenes of our sinnes, and compare them with the mercies of the Lorde, then with contrition of heart, and humilitie of spirit may we say; Sure the Lord hath done great things for vs, hée hath hardened the heart of <hi>Pharao,</hi> but drowned his multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the Sea: he cut off <hi>Achitophell</hi> in his pride, and preserued <hi>Dauid</hi> in his prosperitie: he hath vnto our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies laide out a punishment, by the frowning of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, by the barrennesse of the earth, and emptines of the sea: but vnto vs hath he raigned plentie, and <hi>Manna,</hi> euen in the wildernes of our wickednes: Euerie winde blowes home into our houses, the good and fortunate successe of our frendes, euerie sunne shineth to our comforts, euerie riuer floweth with increase, and euerie day brings new tidings of <hi>Englands</hi> happines, <hi>which God in mercie long and euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</hi> But if we compare other Realmes with this, and withall search the memorable histories that registers the liues of our forefathers, we then may in agonie of heart burst out &amp; say: <hi>Our vnthankfulnes doth threaten punishment, and there is no way to withstand the wrath of the iust God.</hi> Run ouer the liues of a few <hi>Romaines,</hi> and obserue their care of their common wealth, (and as thou readest, let not the life of this Englishman be forgotten which occasioneth my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.)

                  <p>Fiue great Biskeis fired, foure of them, lading &amp; taking in of victual for the kings prouision for <hi>Lishborne,</hi> the fifth a ship of 1000. tunne bound for <hi>Lishborne,</hi> hauing in her great store of Pipes, much yron, nailes spikes, yron hoopes, and such like, fired.</p>
                  <p>One shattey laden with wines, of 200. and 50. tunnes for the kings prouision, which we brought to sea with vs, and discharged at sea part of her wines for the prouision of the fléete, and then fired her.</p>
                  <p>Thrée flie botes of about 400. tunne laden with bisket, whereof the one being of 200. tunne and vpwardes, wée halfe vnladed in the harbor and fired her, the other two are yet with vs in companie.</p>
                  <p>Some ten Barkes more laden with wines, reasons, figges, oyle, wheate, and such like fired.</p>
                  <p>By supposition xxxviij. ships and barkes fired, sunke and brought away with vs, amounting in iudgement 13000. tunne of shipping.</p>
                  <p>There rid in sight of vs at porte royall by estimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 40. sailes besides those that fledde from <hi>Cales</hi> rode.</p>
                  <p>They gaue vs little ease during our abode there, with their shot from the Gallies, as also from the fortresses and
<pb facs="tcp:12878:5"/>
from the shore, where continually they planted newe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at all places conuenient to offend, notwithstanding their ships we continually fired as the flud came thereby, to be cleared of them, which terrible fiers were pleasaunt vnto vs to behold, and mittigated the continuall burthen of trauell which lay vpon vs day and night in discharging, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and vnlading such prouisions, with obseruations for good and gardable defence for the enimie.</p>
                  <p>It pleased God by the Generall his great care and paines day and night to fynish this happye action in her Maiesties seruice in one day and two nightes, and came forth againe the fryday in the morning, with verye little losse thankes be to God.</p>
                  <p>Of xij. Gallies and those that came from port royall and S. <hi>Marie</hi> port, ten of them came forth after vs as it were to make some pastime with their great ordinance, at length the wind scanting, we cast about againe and stoode in for the shore, and came to an ankor within a league of <hi>Cales,</hi> where their Gallies suffered vs to ride quietly.</p>
                  <p>There were also three Fliebotes more at <hi>Mallegoe</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Bisket bounde for <hi>Cales,</hi> and soe for <hi>Lish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> we vnderstand of great prouisions and forces proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the straights, we doubt not but as God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne this worke in great happines, to the daunting of the enymye, so God will blesse this Armye in cutting daylye their forces shorter, to the great annoyance of the enimye, and to the honour of our prince and countrie.</p>
                  <p>We now haue had the experience of Galley fights, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I can assure you, that these onely foure of her Maiesties shippes, will make no account of xx. gallies, so as they were alone and not driuen to gard others.</p>
                  <p>There were neuer gallies had place fitter for their adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in fight vpon shot, they had present succour to grounde vnder the towne, which they sundry times did, we riding in a narrowe gutte the yeelding no better, in that wee were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to maintaine the same vntil we had discharged
<pb facs="tcp:12878:6"/>
and fyred the ships which could not conueniently be done but vpon the floud, therby that they might driue cleare of vs.</p>
                  <p>We rest now victualed with bread and drinke for sixe moneths in our shippes, and bread besides in ij. Fliebotes to maintaine a good armie thrée monethes.</p>
                  <p>It may séeme straunge or rather miraculous that so great an exploit, should be performed with so small losse, considering the place so conuenient, and their force so great as well appeared, from whom were shot at the least at vs ij.C. Culuering and Cannon shot, but in this, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our actions heretofore (although dangerously attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet most fortunately performed) our God wil, and hath alwaies made his infinite power to all papists apparant, and his name by vs his seruants vnder our blessed prince (whose life the Lord prolong) to be continually glorified.</p>

            <p>And thus hauing set downe our full action hetherunto performed as a beginning or entrance into greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, although this being wayed, considering the quantitie of victuall prouided, the disapointment of the same, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite losse in goods (besides his shippings) I can by no meanes rate it at lesse then one hundred thousand pounds in spoile, this I say considered, may be thought an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble péece of seruice, the honour whereof we attribute to the giuer of all victories, whose name be praysed, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to our generall, whose trauel and paines being so great cannot be rewarded with too much praise: his due I wish him, <hi>nam operarius mercedem meruit.</hi>

And to come yet née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: we haue now some liuing who for their honorable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice against the enimie, are called rash &amp; fortunate: others forward, but vnluckie: others hot and terrible: and infinite honors are ascribed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, drawn forciblie by their valours out of the mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduersarie.

I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. king of <hi>England,</hi> and in the <hi>French</hi> expedition, that <hi>Edward</hi> the blacke prince (so surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the blacke battails he fought in <hi>Fraunce</hi>) séeing his honorable subiect &amp; friend the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> wounded to the death in the forefront of the seruice, of his bountie gaue to him and his heires yearely for euer 4000. crownes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he euer or neuer recouered. The languishing noble man accepting the gift, and learning of his Lord &amp; general (as well as taught by nature) to bee honorable, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Prince, gaue the same annual summe for euer to his foure Esquiers that attended on his bodie: whereof béeing reproued by the giuer, he aunswered, that in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice he had shown, those foure were no lesse forward to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, and offend the foemen, then himselfe: and béeing now robd by the enimie of a maister, he knewe it was his honour to leaue them maintenance: and wished withall, that he were as able to enrich his whole company of follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers seuerally, as he did these willingly. Herewith (though lamenting his death) the Prince consented to his gift, &amp; so will we burie him with our discourse of him. Yet héere out I obserue this, that Generals in actions of expedition, are bound by honor to reward the wel deseruing, yet is it not in the power of anie subiect to excéede the limits of his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but to reward where he is led by honour, &amp; to content the rest as he is commanded or allowed of those that excéed him in authoritie. If we do but looke warily into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds estate, we may then conclude with our Diuines: <hi>Mischiefe hath sheathed deceit, &amp; hipocrisie draws it.</hi> And wisely was the estate of <hi>Fraunce</hi> compared to a set at <hi>Primero</hi>: &amp; properlie

olde, counsaile others to honour souldiers when they serue not, and to serue for honour when they enter armes. This made the wolues Nursery <hi>Romulus</hi> become both the first king and builder of <hi>Rome</hi>: This made the abiect <hi>Cirus</hi> weare the first Crowne in <hi>Persia, Iustinus</hi> the swineheard Emperour in <hi>Constantinople, Valentinus</hi> the husbandman Emperour in <hi>Rome, Telephanes</hi> the souldier king of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>: and this made <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> a stranger borne in <hi>Corinth,</hi> the sonne of one <hi>Demaratus</hi> a banished marchant from his Country, become a king in <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea, and by this in his life he became so famous, that he enlarged the confines of <hi>Italie,</hi> amplified the wealth and state of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, augmented the number of Senators, increased the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Knighthood, and left <hi>Rome</hi> so happie at his death, that the Citizens thereof would haue trauailed so farre as <hi>Corinth</hi> to spéede of so noble a Prince. Then must euerie man prease in seruice for preferment to honour, which springs of desert, and such as are not fortunate, must learn to follow and hope to finde, must leaue to enuie and grieue to slaunder, euer carrying the vpright mind of a religious subiect, that in hearing euill spoken of the good, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to consideration straight of the man and the matter, and so shall he sift him out, either an enimie to the Estate or the Religion, that by rumors withdraw the willing and abuse the best, to bring them in hatred of the worst, because hée knowes the common multitude is like a manie headed beast. But studie euerie man rather to looke into the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of such seruices (I meane in respect of their bodies that performes it) and to thanke God for the victories, to pray for their prosperitie in their enterprises, and to incourage others to their supplies, so shal God be glorified, Nobilitie be honoured and animated, the peace of the Land maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all men pleased.</p>
