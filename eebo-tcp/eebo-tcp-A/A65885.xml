            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
RECTOR
EXAMINED,
About his Book, Scandalously stiled,
<hi>An Antidote against the Venom of Quakerism.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHAT <hi>John Meriton</hi> calls <hi>The Venom of Quakerism,</hi> is
not what's contain'd in our <hi>Paper,</hi> entituled,
<hi>The Christianity of the People commonly called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>;
for he grants <hi>our Profession throughout the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part thereof, (as well as some others) would seem
Orthodox,</hi> page 5. But what he quotes out of other Books, as he
thinks in <hi>Opposition</hi> thereto, wherein he shews his own <hi>Enmity</hi> and
<hi>Perversions,</hi> and not our Contradiction to what's <hi>Orthodox</hi> in our
said <hi>Profession</hi>; and the greatest part, of what he hath quoted for
that end, being <hi>Answered</hi> in the other <hi>Examination,</hi> entituled, <hi>Truth
and Innocency vindicated</hi>; and but <hi>Repetitions,</hi> and no <hi>Refutations</hi> of
his and his <hi>Abettors.</hi> I need not much repeat or insist upon them,
but take notice of some other <hi>Abuses</hi> intermix'd in his <hi>Observations,</hi>
and by the way to shew his <hi>Learning</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> how he <hi>defines
Christianity</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi>; first <hi>Negatively,</hi> then <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>1st. <hi>What is understood by the Term</hi> Christianity, <hi>or what is necessary
(in a strict and proper Sense) to entitle a Man to be a</hi> Christian? <hi>For
making up this good Composition</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is not enough for a Man,
to know and acknowledge God, as the one only true God, Creator of all
things, to depend upon and be subject to him, to love him, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as our selves; to walk soberly and honestly, and to practise all those
other Duties, which by the Light and Law of Nature he may be convinced
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58915:3"/>
of; for then a Man may believe and be conformable thereunto, and yet be
no Christian,</hi> page 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Whereupon we may observe, and hence inferr, That a Man may
be <hi>Godly,</hi> and so live to God, and yet <hi>no Christian</hi>; i. e. a Man may
be <hi>born</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (as he that loveth is) and yet without Christ; as if
a Man could come to God without Christ (Oh! Lamentable, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Doctrine) contrary to his own Doctrine! <hi>No Man cometh to
the Father, but by me</hi>; and, <hi>If God were your Father, ye would love me.</hi>
And if <hi>without Christ we can do nothing,</hi> How should any Man either
know God, depend upon him, be subject to him, or love him
without Christ? And 'tis by his Divine <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> that Men
are taught these Duties, to <hi>live Godly,</hi> and to <hi>walk Soberly</hi> and
<hi>Honestly,</hi> and not by a <hi>Light</hi> or Law of Humane <hi>Nature.</hi> So that a
Man <hi>born</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who loves and obeys him, and is subject to him, is
truly and lovingly a Partaker of Christ, and of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi>
But if to <hi>know God,</hi> to <hi>depend upon him,</hi> to <hi>be subject to him,</hi> to
<hi>love him, our Neighbour as our selves,</hi> to <hi>walk soberly and honestly,</hi> &amp;c.
will not entitle a Man to <hi>Christianity,</hi> to be a <hi>Christian</hi>; then 'tis not
the <hi>Jew inward,</hi> nor the <hi>Christian inward,</hi> nor the <hi>New Creature,</hi> nor the
<hi>New Birth,</hi> that will avail; but the outward Profession of Christianity;
though many have that, who neither love God, nor are subject to him,
nor love their Neighbours, consequently are no New Creatures, nor
born of God. And if to know, love and obey God, and to live
Soberly and Honestly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not such a Good <hi>Composition,</hi> as will
make up a true <hi>Christian</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> What will this <hi>Composition</hi>
make up? May we take, what our <hi>Opposer</hi> here adds, for Answer?
viz. <hi>For who doubts, but that some of the Heathens thus far believed and
practised, who were not only altogether Ignorant of Christ, but also vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
opposed him and the Christian-Name,</hi> page 4.</p>
            <p>This I cannot receive for sufficient <hi>Answer,</hi> or for Truth: And
'tis said, (but not proved) that any of those <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi>
who knew and loved God (depended upon him, and were subject
to him, and loved their Neighbours as themselves, and walked so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
and honestly) yet that these <hi>Gentiles</hi> thus qualified, vehemently
opposed Christ and the Christian Name. We want proof for this
Assertion, How could they love God, and be subject to him, and
depend upon him, and hate or oppose his dear Son and Servants?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God were your Father, ye would love me,</hi> saith Christ: <hi>for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
forth, and came from God,</hi> John 8. 42. for those that hated him
were of their Father the Devil, ver. 44. Where did ever any honest
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58915:3"/>
sober Gentiles or Heathen, who truly loved God, so vehemently
oppose Christ, as this Man accuseth them? We find the contrary in
Scripture, that many Gentiles believed and received the Gospel of
Christ, who is <hi>the Light of the Gentiles</hi>; and even in the Case of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
the Apostle brings those Gentiles for a proof, who <hi>not having
the Law, were a Law to themselves,</hi> when they performed those things
contained in the Law, and shewed the <hi>Work of the Law</hi> that was
written in their Hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. But the mistake of
this our Opposer and his Adherents, is, they'll have <hi>the Light which
enlightens every Man that cometh into the World, not to be Christ, but
Man's Conscience, a Light and Law of Nature, and so but natural as of
Man, and not Divine</hi>; deeming it <hi>Blasphemy</hi> to assert the Light that
doth enlighten every Man that cometh into the World is <hi>not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>;
and that it was before any thing was made, or <hi>Conscience</hi>
named, as in their first and great Charge against us, in their <hi>Brief
Discovery,</hi> page 3. whereby they have consequently charged <hi>John</hi>
the Evangelist's Testimony of <hi>Christ</hi> (who is that true Light, <hi>John</hi> 1.)
with Blasphemy: Thus have they brought the <hi>Blasphemy</hi> upon their
own ignorant Opposition to this Evangelical Doctrine of the true
Light, which <hi>Christ</hi> the Word is the Fountain of, which is a Divine,
Supernatural Light, and therefore <hi>increated,</hi> consequently not Man's
natural Conscience, but a superiour Reformer and Guide of Man's
whole Soul, with all the Parts and Faculties thereof: He that made
all things, was not made; but he that was the true Light made all
things; by him all things were made, <hi>John</hi> 1. He that made Man,
was before Man was, before his Soul or Spirit, or any Faculties or
Intellectuals were made or formed within Man: Consequently this
Light was <hi>not Conscience,</hi> but that which enlightens Man's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and Conscience, and the Eyes of his Understanding. How
Blasphemous then are these Men, who deem this Doctrine of the
Light Blasphemy!</p>
            <p>And 'tis not safe to conclude, <hi>That those Jews who were God's chosen
People, and obedient to the Legal Dispensation, had no Faith in the Messiah,</hi>
or no Title to Christianity, or were in no Christian State, as implied,
page 4. seeing they had the Word of Faith in them, as well as the
Law without them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 12, 14. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8.
<hi>And all</hi> Israel <hi>drank of the same Spiritual Rock which followed them</hi> (or
went with them) and that <hi>Rock was Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 4. How could
they drink thereof, if they had no Faith therein?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58915:4"/>
2. Now how this Reason describes a Christian in the Affirmative;
He tells us, To entitle a Man to be a Christian, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He must necessarily believe Christ to be already come; nay, that particular
and numerical Man Christ Jesus, who was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and
was of the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>according to the Flesh, to be the Christ of
God, that was promised to come in due time; That this very Man was
Crucified, died, and rose again from the Dead, and is ascended,</hi> &amp;c. (citing <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16.) <hi>This Christ God-man, as come and Crucified, was that
main Foundation of the Gospel and Christianity; These were new Articles
founded upon a new Dispensation, without the Belief of which (not to name
some others, which may be thought by some also necessary, such as Baptism
by Water, and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper by Bread and Wine) a
Man cannot be called a Christian,</hi> page 4, 5.</p>
            <p>If this Belief of the Blessed Man Christ Jesus his Birth, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
and Ascension into Glory, as the Great Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
God manifest in the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. be necessary to
entitle a Man to be a Christian, then we the People called Quakers,
sincerely believe all this of Christ the true and promised Messiah;
we really have all this Faith of and concerning him, consequently
we must have a true Title and right Claim to Christianity by the
same Proposition; we really believe both of Christ and in him, even
in his Name and Power, wherein we hold the main Foundation of
the Gospel and Christianity, and the Doctrine thereof. But this
Rector has omitted a <hi>Living Faith in Christ,</hi> unto Repentance, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Regeneration, the New Birth, Newness of Life, Purity and
Holiness, without which no Man shall see God, or be a Christian in
Nature. The more uncharitable and inconsistent then is this Rector;
in charging us with <hi>Venom,</hi> giving our Doctrine the Character of
<hi>The Venom of Quakerism</hi>; and the Quakers indefinitely, that <hi>of Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Workers, Transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ, cannot be
looked upon any otherwise at best, than good moral Heathens, and many of
them short of that,</hi> page 5.</p>
            <p>Hence observe how uncharitable and furious this Rector is, and
how he had need to be corrected for his Rashness herein, though
<hi>our Profession</hi> (taking the words thereof in their common Acceptation)
<hi>must be granted</hi> (at least) <hi>to seem Orthodox</hi>; as he grants both of our
Paper observed by him (i. e. <hi>The Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. W. P'<hi>s Key,</hi> John
Crook'<hi>s Principles,</hi> &amp;c.) But still in his uncharitable and sower Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
he will presume to be Judge over our Sincerity, from my
seeing cause to construe my Friend's words and Intentions, as if we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58915:4"/>
were hence to be mistrusted in our Orthodox Confessions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he presently passes Judgment against the Quakers, viz. <hi>That
they have a nauseous Pill to give you, but that it may not be distastful, they
gild it over, as the Writers of Popery in the late K. <hi>J</hi>'s Reign the other day
did</hi>; with more such bitter envious Stuff, and false Judgment, to
which we shall never submit, nor give away our Sincerity or Holy
Profession of Christ and Christianity, which he cannot deny to be
Orthodox in it self: Nor extinguish our Sincerity therein, but only
strive to cloud by Reproaches, groundless Jealousies, and Miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and Perversions, which is not as he would be done by to
be sure: But if a Belief of Christ already come, born of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> being of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that he was Crucified, died,
rose again, and ascended, (as the Scriptures declare) be sufficient to
entitle a Man to be a Christian, How many do believe and confess
thus much of Christ, and yet Unsanctified, Unregenerate, Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Ungodly and Unchristian, in Spirit and Conversation? So that
they are not in the true living Faith in Christ Jesus, though they
have an Historical and Traditional one, and perhaps may be <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
or Sprinkled with Water too.</hi> But of that the Rector here writes
somewhat faintly and dubiously, <hi>as thought by some also necessary</hi> (i. e.
to make a Man a Christian) page 9. But afterward he is more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
in this Point, That 'tis <hi>necessary, as the Sacred Ordinance of Christ
and Saving,</hi> p. 27. <hi>Necessary to enter Men into the Kingdom of God,</hi> from
<hi>John</hi> 3. 5. p. 28. <hi>for Remission and doing away Sins, cleansing of our
Souls</hi>; that the Spirit doth <hi>Sanctifie the Waters in Baptism, to the mystical
Washing away of Sin,</hi> p. 29, 31, 32. But as for Infants partaking
thereof, he evades proof, <hi>It is not his business here to prove,</hi> he saith,
p. 27. So that he both evades defending their own Practice, and
leaves People at an uncertainty of the Subjects of this ignorantly
supposed <hi>Saving, Soul cleansing, and mystical washing Ordinance,</hi> (making
use of the Anabaptists Arguments for Baptizing Believers with Water,
which is no proof for <hi>Rantism</hi> (or Sprinkling) upon Infants.) Thus
he attempts to shew People the way or means of Regeneration, and
entering into the Kingdom of God, and he lays the stress thereof upon
the <hi>outward Baptism by Water,</hi> and not upon the <hi>inward Baptism of the
Spirit</hi>; he has found out an easie way to make Christians, and to get
to Heaven at this rate. His business here being to prove, <hi>Whether
outward Baptism by Water, is the Sacred Ordinance of Christ, as necessary
to be believed and <hi>Saving</hi>; <hi>or</hi> Inward Baptism,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Washing or
Cleansing of the Heart, or an Inward Conversion to God,</hi> p. 27. So that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58915:5"/>
by this the Saving Baptism must be the one or the other; he places
it upon the outward Waters of Baptism, as necessary to the <hi>cleansing
of our Souls, mystical Washing away of Sin,</hi> p. 31, 32. therefore not
upon the <hi>Inward Baptism of the Spirit,</hi> for <hi>that was not sufficient,</hi> he
saith, p. 29. No: What was it good for then? He tells us, <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Baptism was but a necessary Qualification for the Reception of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Baptism by Water,</hi> p. 29. So that the Water is exalted above
the Spirit, or the Spirit's Baptism. But how many Infants (who are
Sprinkled) can they prove, are thus first qualified by the Inward
Baptism of the Spirit? What confused and bewildred work do we
meet withal from some angry Opposers? Upon the whole, the Man's
Definition of a Christian, is summed up in this, viz. <hi>That the Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of <hi>Regeneration</hi> by the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> the <hi>Inward and Spiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
is not <hi>Saving, or sufficient to make a true Christian,</hi> but <hi>Water-Baptism</hi>;
and whether that must be of Infants or Believers, we are
left at uncertainty by this Rector; 'tis enough with him to cry, It
must be with <hi>Water, Water</hi>; But who, who, must come under it?
Men or Babes? Here we are at a loss. What an easie way it is to
make Christians, and to get to Heaven, if this be it, viz. <hi>Learn and
believe your Creed, and that you are inwardly washed, regenerated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into God's Kingdom by your Water-Baptism</hi>; Whether as Infants, or
grown up, is still the Question?</p>
            <p>This Rector boldly tells us, <hi>Nay further it appears, That before our
Saviour Baptized those in</hi> Judea, <hi>he represented the Solemnity of Baptism,
as a thing necessary to enter Men into that Kingdom of God, to which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
them; our Saviour not only telling</hi> Nicodemus, <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a Man be born again, he could not see the Kingdom of God: But yet
more plainly, That except he was born again of Water,</hi> p. 5. <hi>and of the Spirit,
he could not enter into it,</hi> p. 28.</p>
            <p>In this Interpretation of <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. to outward Water, the Rector
exactly agrees with the Popish Notion and Interpretation thereof, <q>
                  <hi>That no Man can enter into the Kingdom of God, nor into the Fellowship
of Holy Church, without Water-Baptism</hi>; as held by the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> see
their Annotations upon <hi>John</hi> 3. 5.</q>And therein opposed by the
Protestants, as appears in Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi>'s Answer, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>It is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in this place <hi>By Water,</hi> to understand <hi>material Water,</hi> but rather the <hi>Purifying Grace of Christ.</hi> As in Chap. 4. ver. 11, 14. where 'tis called Living Water; whereof (he saith) Washing with
Water in Baptism, is an outward Sign.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58915:5"/>
So that the Reform'd Protestants did place Salvation, the New
Birth, and entering into the Kingdom of God, upon the Inward
Baptism by the Purifying Grace of Christ, and not upon the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Element of Water, they esteem'd that but an outward Sign of
the Inward. For the <hi>outward Baptism by Water,</hi> the Rector urges
our Saviour's Example and Practice from <hi>John</hi> 3. 22, 26. p. 28. as if
practised or ministred by Christ <hi>himself.</hi> But that's a Mistake, for in
<hi>John</hi> 4. 2. 'tis expresly said, <hi>Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his
Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have run the farther into this Point in this place, to shew what
a Composition the Rector has run Christianity into. But to return
to some of his invidious Abuses and Perversions; For the Credit of
his Charge of <hi>Venom and Blasphemous Opinions relating to Christianity</hi>
(as well as to the Government) against us, he saith, <hi>And to this end
and purpose, in the Month of</hi> March <hi>last past, there were two Books pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to both Houses of Parliament, the one Entitled, A Brief Discovery of
some of the Blasphemies and Seditious Principles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The other Entitled,
Some few of the Quakers many horrid Blasphemies, Heresies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And also
a Sheet Entitled, Some Reasons humbly offered, why the Quakers should be
examined,</hi> p. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Here we may observe this Rector has owned these same Books, as
well as presenting them to the Parliament: Now one of them that is
a Libel, stiled, <hi>Some Few,</hi> has an Owner with the rest. Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(<hi>John Meriton,</hi> Rector, so called) art accountable for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Abuses, Perversions, Calumnies and Traducings, which are in
those Books, and detected in my <hi>Truth and Innocency vindicated,</hi> which
I doubt not but will turn to your great Shame and Disgrace who
promoted them; as will also your strenuous Endeavours to Insence
the Government against us, but that they had more Discretion and
Prudence than to be influenced by two or three Invidious Persons
against a Peaceable and Serviceable People.</p>
            <p>Now concerning our Christian Profession, on which the Rector
makes his Observations, to evince the <hi>Venom of Quakerism,</hi> as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
defames us.</p>
            <p>He accuseth us with <hi>dubious and equivocal Terms, agreeable to those of
the Oracles of the Heathen,</hi> p. 7. for our confessing, <q>That our Belief
is, That in the Unity of the God-head, there is Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, those Three Divine Witnesses, that beare Record in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58915:6"/>
Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and that
these Three are One, according to Holy Scripture Testimony.</q>These the <hi>Rector</hi> has judged as <hi>dubious equivocal Terms,</hi> though they
are Scripture Terms, see <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>1 John</hi> 5. 7. <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. &amp; Chap. 15. 26. But not being content with this our Confession, he
begs this Question, i. e. <hi>But if not Three Persons, what Three are they?</hi>
page 8. Let him prove these Terms by plain Scripture, as we have
done ours, and then we shall be resolved, so as not to charge him
with dubious Terms. He might have spared his bitter Insinuations
against us, as <hi>virulent Poison, grossest Errors, equivocal Reserves, wherein
they</hi> (meaning the Quakers) <hi>may be thought to exceed their Brethren the
Jesuits,</hi> page 8. It had been more Prudence for him to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
or reserved these bitter Aspersions, than to impose them upon
the Reader; which shews a great Enmity and bitterness of Spirit in
the Man.</p>
            <p>His repeated and partial Citations and Charge against <hi>G. F. W. P.</hi>
and <hi>G. W.</hi> in page 8, 9, 10. are answered and detected in the second
part of the other Examination (i. e. <hi>Truth and Innocency,</hi> &amp;c.) under
the first Head and Title <hi>Concerning the Holy Trinity.</hi> What is alledged
against <hi>G. W.</hi> out of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> &amp;c. page 10. about the Three Persons,
(though wrongly cited by the Rector, p. 9, 10.) I have positively
disowned that passage twice already (both as 'tis in it self, and as it
is none of mine) and do now a third time disown the same, which
none therefore but the Implacable will repeat against me.</p>
            <p>About a <hi>Heaven within,</hi> and <hi>the Locality of Heaven,</hi> p. 10. I do
not find either <hi>G. F.</hi> or <hi>W. P.</hi> truly quoted or cited upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Matter as it concerns <hi>G. F.</hi> is answered in the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
aforesaid.</p>
            <p>To the Rector's thus construing our Confession, i. e. <hi>When they
speak of Three Divine Witnesses bearing Record in Heaven, that is to say</hi>
(quoth he) <hi>the Heaven within them,</hi> p. 10.</p>
            <p>Thus he imposes his meaning upon us, as if we confined the
<hi>Divine Three bearing Witness in Heaven,</hi> only to a Heaven within us,
and not as being in that Heaven without us also; which is a mistaken
Construction, for the Heaven wherein the Divine Three bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is above, and distinct from the Earth, <hi>1 John</hi> 5. 7, 8. and yet
the same Holy Spirit (which is God) bears witness in Earth too,
even in Mens Hearts and Consciences. His Spirit bears witness with
our Spirits, <hi>&amp;c. And he that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in himself,</hi> 1 John 5. 10. And he that inhabiteth Eternity, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58915:6"/>
dwells in the highest Heavens, dwells also in the lowest Hearts, even
with them that are poor and of contrite Spirits, and tremble at his
word, how despised soever they are in the Eyes of the Proud and
Envious whom God will debase. And it was no lessening of the
Blessed Record of the <hi>Divine Three</hi> in Heaven, for the Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in Christ Jesus, to be promoted to the Honour and Priviledge
of sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5, 6. and
their continuing in the Son and in the Father, if the Word (which
they had heard from the Beginning) remained in them, <hi>1 John</hi> 2. 24.
As there is a Plurality of Heavens without us, so there are degrees
of heavenly States in Christ Jesus within us, if our Conversation be
in Heaven.</p>
            <p>I charge the Rector with a false Quotation and Abuse of me in
particular, in his Observation on our Confession to the <hi>Divinity and
Humanity</hi> (or Manhood) <hi>of Jesus Christ.</hi> Where he quotes <hi>Truth
defending the Quakers,</hi> p. 22. and against me saith, <hi>Where he affirms
Christ's coming in the Flesh to be</hi> but <hi>a Figure or Example,</hi> (answered in
the other Examination, part 1. p. 24, 25. which are not my words,
but in the Priest's 35th Question, wrongly accusing <hi>R. Hubberthorn</hi>
therewith.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> also wrongs <hi>R. H.</hi> and me, in what he adds, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <hi>Which is also the Saying of</hi> R. Hubberthorn, <hi>and justified by</hi> G. W. <hi>in his
Judgment Fixed,</hi> p. 336. <hi>who tells you plainly, what Man Christ the
Quakers own,</hi> i. e. <hi>their Light within only,</hi> p. 11.</p>
            <p>He wrongs me again in both: For <hi>1st,</hi> I never understood, that
'twas <hi>R. H</hi>'s Saying, that <hi>Christ's coming in the Flesh, was <hi>But</hi> a Figure,</hi>
nor saw it ever so affirmed under his hand, but by his <hi>Adversaries.</hi>
2. Neither have I justified that Saying in <hi>Judgment Fixed.</hi> 3. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I there <hi>tell you plainly,</hi> that <hi>the Man Christ the Quakers own, is
their Light within only.</hi> I do not confine the <hi>Christ</hi> to within <hi>only,</hi>
though he be our <hi>Light within,</hi> as well as he is our <hi>Mediator,</hi> the
Man <hi>Christ without.</hi> But the <hi>Rector,</hi> to fasten his Charge upon me,
adds, viz. <hi>His words</hi> (i. e. <hi>G. W</hi>'s) <hi>are these, Therefore the Man Christ
Jesus was, before he came in the Body of Flesh,</hi> p. 11. Here the <hi>Rector</hi>
cites a Consequence of a <hi>Proposition</hi> against me, but not the <hi>Proposition</hi>
it self; wherein he is unfair: Yet the <hi>Consequence</hi> proves not, that I
either affirm or justifie <hi>Christ's coming in the Flesh</hi> to be <hi>but</hi> a <hi>Figure</hi>:
'Tis fully answered in the <hi>Examination</hi> before; and my <hi>Proposition,</hi>
from which the said <hi>Consequence</hi> is drawn, is, <q>
                  <hi>John</hi> bore witness of
that Man Christ, saying, <hi>He that cometh after me, is preferred before
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58915:7"/>
me, for he was before me,</hi> John 1. 15. Again ver. 30. <hi>After me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Man, which is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Man Christ Jesus was, before he came in the Body or
Flesh; he was that Spiritual <hi>Rock,</hi> which all <hi>Israel</hi> drank of; his
<hi>Life</hi> was the <hi>Light</hi> of Men from the Beginning, and all the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
of the <hi>Righteous</hi> did Spiritually partake of the Benefit of
Christ, as <hi>Mediator</hi>; both before and after his coming in the
Flesh, they virtually partook of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> p. 336.</q>Now could this be to deny either the
<hi>Divinity</hi> or <hi>Manhood</hi> of Christ? No sure; but rather a Confession to
both. Neither doth it prove our <hi>Confession</hi> thereunto, only a <hi>Paint
or Varnish to deceive the Hearts of the Simple,</hi> as this <hi>Rector</hi> would insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
though very frowardly and unjustly: And, <hi>That Christ existeth
outwardly, Bodily without us, at God's right hand</hi>; my Enquiry for
Scripture-proof for these words, (<hi>Nature of Christianity,</hi> page 41.
<hi>Anno</hi> 1671.) proves no Insincerity in our Belief of Jesus Christ, as
he is truly <hi>God and Man,</hi> according as Holy Scripture testifies of him;
and questioning those Terms, was not to deny Christ's real Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Glory, as he is at the right Hand of the Majesty in the
Heavens.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Rector</hi> quotes against <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>W. P. about Christ, that
was Crucified, and his outward Person,</hi> &amp;c. p. 12, 13. is answered and
explained in the <hi>Examination</hi> aforesaid.</p>
            <p>What he quotes against <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Primmer, p. 8. printed 1668,
<hi>i. e.</hi> They that are False (Ministers) preach Christ without. Here
wants the word <hi>Only,</hi> viz. they preach Christ without <hi>Only</hi> (in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to his being within) for it was so corrected in the last Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Works. What carping and picking work do these Men
make against us, to make us Offenders for a word?</p>
            <p>We also sincerely confess, <q>We believe and expect Salvation and
Justification by Jesus Christ his Righteousness, Merits and Works,
(here they leave out [<hi>and not by our own,</hi>] God is not indebted to
us for our Deservings, but we to him for his Free Grace in Christ
Jesus, whereby we are Saved through Faith in him (not of our
selves) and by his Grace enabled truly and acceptably to serve and
follow him, as he requires; He is our <hi>All</hi> in all, who worketh
all in us that is well pleasing to God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To render us <hi>Insincere</hi> or <hi>Contradictory</hi> herein, the <hi>Rector</hi> begins with
G. W's <hi>Light and Life,</hi> thus quoting him, p. 38. viz. <hi>The Quakers see
no need of directing Men to Jesus Christ or his Blood, as it was outwardly
shed at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>for Justification,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58915:7"/>
Herein he has falsly quoted me, and misrepresented my words,
which if he read them, 'twas the more wickedly done; If it was
upon the Credit of another's Information, 'twas presumptuously
foolish, so injuriously to cite them. My words in the place quoted
are these; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The Quakers see no need of directing Men to the
Type for the Antitype, <hi>viz.</hi> neither to the outward Temple, nor
yet to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to Jesus Christ or his Blood;</q>It should be <hi>for</hi>
Jesus Christ there, knowing that neither the Righteousness of Faith,
nor the Word of it, doth so direct, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. which is not to disswade
People from Jesus Christ where he is to be found, but from going
to seek him in the Type before mentioned. The Matter is answer'd
before, this <hi>Rector</hi> had need to be rectified himself.</p>
            <p>Again, He quotes <hi>G. W.</hi> thus, p. 55. <hi>ibid. Where doth the Scripture
say, That the <hi>shedding</hi> of Christ's Blood outwardly, was the meritorious
cause of (Man's) Salvation?</hi> And p. 64. <hi>It is False Doctrine to lay the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
cause or stress of Justification, upon the <hi>shedding</hi> that Blood let
out by the Spear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has here quoted me partially in both these passages, especially
in the last.</p>
            <p>1. My Question to the Baptist in the place was this: Where do
the Scriptures use those Expressions, and so much vary about the
Blood of Christ, as one while to say, that the <hi>shedding</hi> that Blood
outwardly, was the meritorious cause of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 55.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas the Baptist accused us <hi>with denying the <hi>shedding</hi> of the
Blood upon the Cross, that was let out by vertue of the Spear being thrust
into his side, to be the meritorious cause of Man's Justification</hi> (as held in
the Affirmative by the Baptist.) My answer was, <q>The <hi>shedding</hi> of
that Blood let out by the Spear, was an Act of a wicked Man,
and the Spear an Instrument of Cruelty, which to lay the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
cause or stress of Justification upon, is false Doctrine; for
there is a great difference between Christ's offering up himself by
the Eternal Spirit, a Lamb without Spot, to God, and the Acts of
wicked Men inflicted upon him; as 'tis said, by wicked hands they
put him to death.</q> The <hi>Merit, Deserving, Dignity</hi> or <hi>Worth,</hi> is placed
upon Christ's Obedience, in offering up himself, and humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Death of the Cross for Man's Redemption, as intimated in
the consequence, <hi>Wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> Phil. 2. 9.
Therefore the <hi>Merit,</hi> or <hi>Deserving,</hi> was not placed upon the Soldier's
Act, of <hi>thrusting the Spear into his side, and letting out his Blood</hi> thereby,
after he had given up the Ghost, <hi>John</hi> 19. 33, 34. But upon the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58915:8"/>
               <hi>Obedience</hi> of the Son of God, even unto the <hi>Death</hi> of the Cross, as
that most acceptable Sacrifice for the Sins of the World. Christ's
deserving such high Exaltation into Dominion and Glory through
his Obedience in Suffering, was for the bringing many Sons to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. consequently That in following him we might be
received into Glory; as they who Suffer with him shall be glorified
together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and this no ways interferes with (nor varies
from) Our Sincere Belief of Salvation and Justification by Jesus
Christ, his Righteousness, Merits and Works, and not by our own;
Christ as our Mediator and the one Offering, has obtained Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Remission and Pardon of Sins, and Eternal Redemption for
us, which he makes us partakers of, by his Work of Righteousness
and Sanctification <hi>
                  <hi>in</hi> us,</hi> so that both Christ's <hi>Obedience, Deservings</hi> and
<hi>Dignity,</hi> without us, and his works within us are concerned in our
Salvation and Justification, which his Light and Spirit Leads us to
the living Knowledge and Experience of, as We sincerely obey and
follow the same; for the Apostle describes both the washing Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Justification of true Converts, to be in the name of the
Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 6. 11. Therefore
I hope it will be no reproach to <hi>W. P.</hi> or any else to be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with <hi>G. W.</hi> in this point as he is accused, p. 14. namely,
<hi>That our Justification and Salvation is not Effected <hi>wholly without
us</hi>,</hi> as if there were no need of the Spirit's work <hi>within</hi> us for our
Regeneration and Sanctification, all which is Christ's work, being
done by his Spirit and Power, which consequently does no ways
lessen his Dignity, Glory and Honour, wherewith he was crowned
through the Suffering of Death, that he might bring many Sons (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him) unto Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>Again, the Rector quotes <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in <hi>Counterfeit Convert,</hi>
printed 1694. p. 17, 18.<hi> That it is the Light and Life within, in which,
is the Immediate and Efficient cause of Man's Salvation; And as for the
Sufferings and Death of Christ in the Flesh,</hi> they do <hi>
                  <hi>but</hi> instrumentally
contribute thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rector to abuse me, Partially cites me in this place, as if I
ascribed Salvation to a Light and Life within, without Christ, or
not to Christ; for what else could he design in bringing this Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to confront, or oppose, our Confession (before cited) to
Salvation by Jesus Christ? And where do I say <hi>in which</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> in
the Light and Life <hi>within</hi>) is the <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>Efficient</hi> cause of
Man's Salvation, as if I should say something in the Light and Life
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58915:8"/>
of Christ were the <hi>Immediate</hi> cause of <hi>Man's Salvation,</hi> and not the
Light and Life of Christ it self; this Rector would fain make me
speak Non-sence as well as Blasphemy. But by our confessing to
the Light and Life of Christ within, as the <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>Efficient</hi> cause
of Man's Salvation from Sin and <hi>Condemnation</hi>; we do neither divide
Christ nor make two Christs, nor yet by confessing his Suffering and
Death in the Flesh as a <hi>means</hi> of God's appointment instrumentally to
contribute thereunto; He being <hi>The Mediator of the New Covenant, that
by <hi>means</hi> of Death for the Redemption of the Transgressions that were under
the first Testament</hi> (or Covenant) <hi>they which are called might receive the
Promise of Eternal Inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. and as it was by <hi>means</hi> of
Christ that true Christians believe in God, who raised him up from
the Dead, and gave him Glory and Honour, that their Faith and
Hope might be in God, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. So if Christ our Mediator
be the Means, the Cause, and Great Instrument, of our Faith and
Salvation, and his Death the <hi>Means</hi> of our Redemption and Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sins in his Blood; It can be no dishonour to him to confess
his Sufferings and Death in the Flesh, instrumentally to contribute
to our Salvation, and that Christ himself by his Light and Life in
us, is the Immediate and Efficient cause thereof, thereby fulfilling and
confirming in us the blessed and holy Design and Ends of his Sufferings
and Death for us.</p>
            <p>I am not ashamed of my Testimony for Christ in this matter,
and give it here more truly than my Adversary has done out of the
place quoted, out of <hi>Counterfeit Convert,</hi> p. 18. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Christ, the Promised Seed, through Death was to bruise
under, and destroy, him that had the Power of Death, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Devil, yet he effectually doth it by his divine Power, Light and
Life, as the Immediate and Efficient cause of Man's Salvation;
wherein we still confess his Sufferings and Death in the Flesh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally
to contribute thereunto. Christ Jesus, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Seed, who came of a Woman, made under the Law, bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Serpent's Head both without us and within us; <hi>without us</hi>
through his Sufferings and Death (by his divine Testimony, Word
and Power) <hi>within us</hi> by his Divine Life, Light, Word (or
Seed) Spirit and Power, which is all but one Christ himself, not
two Christs nor to be divided: Else how could we be born again
of Incorruptible Seed? Or how doth that <hi>Seed</hi> remain in him
that's born again? And is not that Seed Christ? And is not
the Word of Faith, Christ in Spirit? See <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>1 John</hi> 3. 9.

            <p>To what he quotes against <hi>Tho. Lawson</hi> his <hi>Untaught Teacher,</hi> print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
1655. p. 4, 5. Against <hi>looking for Salvation from a means without,
and seeking a way to Salvation without,</hi> p. 15.</p>
            <p>I have not the Book quoted, but am apt to think <hi>T. L</hi>'s unfairly,
or not fully cited in this place, let the <hi>Rector</hi> produce a fair and full
Recitation. However I really believe (upon our Principle) that
<hi>T. L.</hi> meant no other than that, as Salvation from Sin is an Inward
and Spiritual Work of Christ, Men must expect and wait for it to
be wrought within them by the Spirit and Power of Christ, who is
the great means and cause thereof; so that if any seek the way and
means of Salvation only without them, and neglect Christ's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and Light in them, they miss their way, though He
who is the Great means, obtained Eternal Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without them, and alone did tread the Wine-press, which
we believe, and therefore the <hi>Rector</hi>'s conclusions are false against us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That They</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>undervalue the Righteousness and
Merits of Jesus Christ, purchasing Salvation for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That they Extol and Magnifie their own Righteousness and Works,
like to their Brethren in the Church of</hi> Rome, p. 15.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That they exceed all the meritorious Boasts of those their Kindred, in
affirming that their Sufferings are Greater, and more unjust, than the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the days of Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I positively deny and Testifie against these Accusations, as Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Calumnies to traduce and abuse the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
contrary to our Principle and Profession of Jesus Christ, and
that Glory, Dignity and Preheminence we sincerely ascribe to him,
his Righteousness, Merits, Works and Sufferings. And that 'tis by
his Grace through Faith we are saved, not of our selves; 'tis the Gift
of God, not of Works, lest any Man should Boast, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.</p>

               <q>Our Confession of Remission of Sin, and Redemption thro' the

            </p>
            <p>Which is false, 'twas none of the Question or Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and our former Opposers (the <hi>Imputarians</hi>) for what the
<hi>Rector</hi> observes out of <hi>F. B</hi>'s Works, p. 33. (already answered in the

to disbelieve or deny Remission of Sins, or Redemption thro'
the Sufferings or Righteousness of Christ Jesus; But to refuse a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification

according to <hi>W. P</hi>'s Title of that part of the Controversie, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

the Just, which they that do, are Abomination to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi>

of Christ's Righteousness to them that are Sanctified, and by
Faith have a true Interest in Christ, as partakers of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Holiness. His Imputations or Reckonings, being all
True and Righteous; if he reckons or esteems a Man <hi>Just,</hi> he is
really so.</p>
            <p>I do not see that <hi>W. P.</hi> contradicts this Doctrine of Justification in
his <hi>Primitive Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. by his former opposing Justification
of Impure, Unsanctified or Impenitent Persons, by an undue Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of anothers Righteousness which (in that State) they have
no share in. Who is that Blessed Man to whom God imputeth
Righteousness, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? Rom. 4. 6, 7, 8. but the Man in whose Spirit is
no Guile, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 6.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> doubtless thinks he has put a learned and binding Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
upon us, <hi>viz. Why indeed should they believe Remission of Sins, and
Redemption through Christ's Sufferings, and Justification by his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when as they believe themselves to be perfect as God, and free from
Sin?</hi> p. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer 1st,</hi> Where do we say all this of our selves, as that we
believe our selves to be perfect as God? I would have the <hi>Rector</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
plain Proof that we say this of our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:58915:10"/>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> That Perfection of Freedom from Sin, which we believe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
in Christ; it is not of our selves, nor by our selves, attain'd.
We do not pretend to make our selves Perfect or Free from Sin,
but by the Power and Work of Christ, and his Righteousness, by a
true Faith in him, who is manifest to take away and destroy Sin,
the work of the Devil, and to save us from Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> Now suppose any true Believers in Christ Jesus, his Name
and Power, should call to others, and say, Come and I'll tell you
what the Lord hath done for my Soul; he hath redeemed my
Soul, he has taken away my Sins, and blotted out my Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and received me Graciously. And thereupon such a learned
<hi>Rector</hi> as this should Gainsay his Christian Experience by such a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
as this, Why indeed should you believe your Soul is redeemed,
and your Sins are taken away and blotted out, through Christ his
Righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when you thus believe your self to be free
from Sin? To which he might easily Answer, I did not make my
self so: I magnifie the Grace of God in Christ Jesus towards me,
what I am, I am by the Grace of God. The rest against preaching
for Sin, to continue term of Life, p. 18. is opened in the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Rector</hi> is sadly out and wants Rectifying, in his affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>This Doctrine of Sinless Perfection being the approved Doctrine of the</hi>
Quakers, <hi>to be in Opposition to all Professors of the Christian Faith,</hi>
p. 18.</p>
            <p>The Man's Egregiously out and mistaken in this last part, The
Doctrine of <hi>Sinless Perfection</hi> in Christ, is a true Christian Doctrine,
and approved of by all true Believers who are in the Faith of Christ,
and Professers of the same; such Perfection was both commanded
and Promised of God, and Preached by Christ and his faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and effected by Christ in his true Believers and Followers,
who abide in him; He that abideth in him Sinneth not.</p>
            <p>I may here give a full recital of the Question and our Answer,
upon which the <hi>Rector</hi> has made his said Observations, to prove the
same still but <hi>Paint and Deceit,</hi> which is proved to be but his own false
Judgment.</p>
            <q>Quest. <hi>Do you believe Remission of Sin, and Redemption through the
Sufferings, Death and Blood of Christ?</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, through Faith in Him as he suffered and dyed for
all Men, gave himself a Ransom for all, and his Blood so Shed
for the Remission of Sins, so all they who sincerely believe and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58915:10"/>
obey him, receive the Benefits, blessed Effects and Fruits of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and Dying for them; They by Faith in his Name, receive
and partake of that Eternal Redemption which he hath obtained
for us, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from
All Iniquity: He died for our Sins, and rose again for our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
And if we walk in the Light, as he (<hi>i. e.</hi> God) is in the
Light, we have Fellowship one with another; And the Blood of
Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all Sin, <hi>1 John</hi> 1. 7.</q>
            </p>
            <q>Quest. <hi>Do you believe and own the Divine Offices of Jesus Christ in his
Church?</hi>
            </q>
            <q>Our Answer is, Yes verily we believe and own Christ, not only
as he is the Light of the World, enlightning every Man coming into
it, but also that he is given for a Leader and for a Commander;
And that he is both King, Priest and Prophet, to and over his
Church and People. He is the Minister of the Sanctuary which the
Lord Pitched and not Man; and we are to hear him in all things.</q>
            <p>On this the <hi>Rector</hi> observes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Profession of theirs, if Sincere, would indeed comprehend a great part
of the Christian Religion; but if the above Quotations be true, they will give
you just cause to suspect them even in this,</hi> p. 19.</p>
            <p>By this our Profession is granted as comprehensive of a great part
of Christian Religion, and our Sincerity therein is known to God
who judgeth Righteously, and we may not submit it to this Person's
Prejudice or unjust Judgment, and Quotations wherein his Falseness
and Partiality are in a great measure already detected: And what he
now quotes against our said Profession, out of <hi>Tyranny and Hypocrisie
detected,</hi> p. 19. of <hi>S. E</hi>'s <hi>declaring</hi> G. F. <hi>Blessed be the Man that came
out of the North,</hi> &amp;c. And a Letter said to be writ by <hi>Josiah Coale</hi>
from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> to <hi>G. F.</hi> in 1658. which this Person saith, is <hi>Justified
by</hi> W. Penn <hi>in his</hi> Judas<hi> and the</hi> Jews, p. 44, 45, 46.</p>
            <p>We have heard often of this Letter of <hi>J. C</hi>'s, and of <hi>W. P</hi>'s Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
thereof, but I find no Reply from this <hi>Rector,</hi> to Refute <hi>W. P.</hi>
therein; nor yet any Proof therefrom, of our Insincerity in what we
profess as aforesaid, for our believing the Divine Offices of Jesus
Christ, in and over his Church; for though <hi>G. F.</hi> was truly esteemed
among us, as a Faithful Minister of Christ, and a Father in him unto
many in the Faith, and an Heir of Christ's Kingdom, yet this was
never to <hi>Wrest the Scepter out of Christ's Hand,</hi> as is falsly insinuated
by this <hi>Rector,</hi> and his Author <hi>Edward Pay</hi> a Teacher of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
whose Authority is quoted against us, p. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58915:11"/>
See what hard Shifts this Man is put to for Authority against us,
for all his Learning, I may refer him in this Case, to my Answer to
<hi>Edward Pay,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Contemned Quaker and his Christian Religion
defended,</hi> p. 81, 82. <q>Wherein I tell him, that his Charge is very
high against two Persons deceased, who I believe ended their Days
in Peace; and that I have cause to question, whether the said Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be truly and intirely copied or cited from the Original; and
what Persons, that are no Parties nor Adversaries to us, will attest
thine to be a true and intire Copy, according to <hi>Josiah Coale</hi>'s ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Letter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>I doubt not but I can clear that Honest Man
<hi>Josiah Coale,</hi> from giving any Blasphemous Titles (as charged) and
that from his own printed Testimonies; and <hi>G. F.</hi> also from receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such, by his known publick Christian Profession and Confession
unto Christ Jesus, both as God and Man, according to the Holy
Scriptures. And concerning the other Pamphlet, <hi>Tyranny and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi>
also quoted by this <hi>Rector</hi> against us, it is a Malicious Libel
without the Author's Name; yet so far given credit unto against us,
to asperse and traduce us, though fully answered long ago by <hi>W. P.</hi> &amp;c
Thus hard put to it is this <hi>Rector,</hi> to find and rake up Matter against
our Christian Profession of Christ, his Divine Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>1st,</hi> His calling G. F. <hi>the King of the Quakers,</hi> p. 20, 21.
is a Scornful Falshood, that's none of our Profession, but that Jesus
Christ is our King, Priest and Prophet, who is the King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords.</p>
            <p>2. As also his accusing <hi>G. F.</hi> with <hi>depriving Christ of his Kingly Office,
and assuming it to himself,</hi> p. 21. is another notorious Falshood and
Calumny, for he was a Minister or Servant of Jesus Christ, and so he
owned himself to be, consequently unjustly charg'd with <hi>depriving
Christ of his Kingly Office, and assuming it to himself</hi>: Neither did I
ever say, or intend any such thing of <hi>G. F.</hi> though I am here quoted
in <hi>Innocency against Envy,</hi> p. 18. <hi>as plainly intimating, It is not</hi> G. F.
<hi>but the Light or Christ within him, that assumes this Kingly Power,</hi> p. 21.
I do not know that I used these words, or plainly intimated this in
behalf of <hi>G. F.</hi> nor needed I so excuse him from that which he was
never justly chargeable with, as <hi>depriving Christ of his Kingly Office, or
assuming the same to himself.</hi> Neither was it proper or pertinent for
me to say, <hi>That the Light; or Christ within, assumes this Kingly Power,</hi>
p. 21. 'Tis Christ's Right to Rule and Reign, both as King and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver;
and his being <hi>in</hi> us by his Light and Spirit, does not lessen his
Power, Dignity or Glory, he hath in himself. And it follows not,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58915:11"/>
that because Christ, who is King, is in us, <hi>That every Quaker is a King,
because every Quaker has the Light within, as this Priest argues,</hi> p. 21.
I wish he would speak more Reverently of the Light within, and of
Christ within, which if he obeys not, will be his Condemnation;
it's they that obey Christ, the Light, and suffer with him, that shall
Reign with him, and not every one in whom Christ or his Light
appears, for too many Rebel against the Light, and will not that
Christ should Reign over them.</p>
            <p>What he quotes against <hi>G. F.</hi> Jun. p. 50. speaking in the <hi>Name of
the Light,</hi> is answered in the other Examination, and no disowning,
but a real owning of Christ's Kingly Office, as he is the Light and
Judge of the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> insinuating against us, <hi>A Denial of the Priestly Office of
Christ, and also his Humanity,</hi> p. 22. is as false as the rest of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies:
Where did ever we deny Christ as the one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and Man, even the Man Christ Jesus? <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 2. 5. How
often have we confess'd him as such?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His saying the Quakers tells you that Christ was never seen with Carnal
Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. quoting <hi>H. Woolrich</hi>'s <hi>Declaration to the Baptists,</hi> p. 13. I
have not that Declaration, but it has been answered, that he meant
the True Christ is not seen Savingly with Carnal Eyes; nor though
the <hi>Jews</hi> saw his Body or Person outwardly, they did not see him
Spiritually and Savingly, as his Disciples did, who saw his Glory as
of the only Begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth: Christ
saith, <hi>He that seeth me, seeth my Father also</hi>; in which sence of seeing,
he was never so seen with Carnal Eyes, no more than the Father was.</p>
            <p>Again 'tis objected against us, That we teach that <hi>Christ has no Body
but his Church,</hi> quoting <hi>Jos. Coale</hi>'s Works, p. 332. This is falsly
charged both against us, and falsly cited against <hi>Josiah Coale,</hi> for
first, We do not so Teach. 2. Though <hi>J. C.</hi> confesseth the Church
to be the Body of Christ in the place quoted, he also confesseth
Christ's glorious Body, like unto which his Body the Church shall
be fashioned, saying, <q>That Affliction did still attend these Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ's Body, and that this Body <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Church, though
not free as yet from suffering Afflictions, yet shall be fashioned like
to his <hi>glorious Body,</hi> J. C'<hi>s</hi> p. 332.</q>So that he owned Christ to have
a glorious Body above that of his Members: Therefore it appears
neither from hence, nor yet from this <hi>Rector</hi>'s unjust Charge or false
Quotation, that the Quakers deny the Mediator, the Man Christ
Jesus, as he falsly saith; much less that they do <hi>Scornfully Contemn the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58915:12"/>
Blood of Christ,</hi> p. 23. as they are grosly Calumniated and Slandered.</p>
            <p>What he cites against <hi>E. B.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> p. 23, 24. is answered in the
foregoing Examination.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>Christ's Prophetick Office,</hi> we are satisfied that we own it
more than these our Adversaries, in that we believe we ought to hear
him in all things, by his Light, Word and Spirit, in our Hearts; for
which they so much slight and contemn us; opposing his Immediate
Revelation, Teaching and Ministry in these days, and confining his
present Ministry to the Scriptures, in opposition to his Light and
Immediate Teaching in Man; for though <hi>Christ did frequently preach
from Scriptures,</hi> yet his Preaching was with Power and Efficacy, he
had power both to open the Scriptures, and the Understandings of
them that heard him in opening them; and also so to touch their
Hearts, that they said, Did not our Hearts burn within us, while he
spoke unto us? Which Mens meer literal Preaching cannot do, nor
work those Effects: We are to hear Christ in all things, him that
speaketh from Heaven; but saith the <hi>Rector, they</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers)
<hi>neither do nor will hear him, no their Christ within, which they are obliged
to, tells them other things than our outward Christ or Prophet does,</hi> p. 24.</p>
            <p>What an Ignorant and Scornful Reflection and Abuse is this, as if
either we owned another Christ within than the true Christ and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
whom we are to hear (which is a false Insinuation) or else that
Christ as <hi>within,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> as without, is not one and the same
Christ, which is false also; neither is Christ divided, though he be
both without and within.</p>
            <p>And where proves this <hi>Rector,</hi> that <hi>the Scripture is the Touch-stone to
try Spirits withal</hi>; wherein he takes part with <hi>Mat. Caffin</hi> (the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist
Preacher, his affirming the same) against the Quakers, p. 25.
Christ said, Have Salt in your selves, and discerning of Spirits was
the Gift of the Spirit, without which none can truly understand or
make use of the Scripture. If <hi>Tho. Lawson</hi> said, <hi>The Scripture is not the
Tryer of Spirits,</hi> as 'tis alledged against us, p. 25. I find no Scripture
produced to prove this Erroneous; Christ is the Great Judge and
Tryer of Spirits, who searches and tryes the Heart and the Reines;
and it is by his Light and Spirit that Spirits must be tryed and judged,
not by the Carnal, but by the Spiritual Man. And what the <hi>Rector</hi>
again cites, out of p. 7. against <hi>studying to raise a living thing out of a
dead, and the Spirit out of the Letter,</hi> &amp;c. was never intended to oppose
the <hi>Teaching of Christ's Prophetick Office,</hi> for his Office never allowed
any such Study: Neither do the Quakers deny <hi>Christ's Gospel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58915:12"/>
which are really such, and by him perpetuated. Here the
<hi>Rector</hi> imposes upon us, and his Allegations fall short of proof. And
our not continuing under a Literal and Shadowy Dispensation of
Types and Figures, carnal Ordinances, and outward Element, but
under a Spiritual Ministry, is rather an Indication of our owning
Christ's Offices, his Gospel, his Ministry or Dispensation, than any
refusing to hear him, who speaketh from Heaven by his Holy Spirit,
Light and Grace in Mens Hearts.</p>
            <p>What seems most materially objected hitherto in the <hi>Rector's Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,</hi>
being answered, I may take notice of some Passages hereafter,
farther to shew what he falsly deems <hi>Venom of Quakerism,</hi> according
to his Title and Observations against our Profession.</p>
            <q>Quest. <hi>Do you believe or own</hi> Baptism, <hi>as Essential to Christianity,
or necessary to Salvation; and for the ingrafting us into Christ and his
Church?</hi>
            </q>
            <q>(Our answer is,) We believe and are fully perswaded, That
<hi>Baptism,</hi> which is Essential to Christianity, and the <hi>Saving Baptism,</hi>
or the Cause, without which none can be true Christians, or Saved,
is the <hi>Inward</hi> or Spiritual Washing of <hi>Regeneration</hi> by the <hi>Word</hi> of
<hi>Life.</hi> This is the Saving <hi>Baptism</hi> into Christ and his Church, which
produceth the <hi>Answer of a good Conscience towards God,</hi> of which
the outward was a <hi>Figure, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21. This is that <hi>One Baptism</hi>
of Christ, by <hi>One Spirit</hi> into that <hi>One Body,</hi> whereof Christ is the
Head.</q>
            <q>As to <hi>Dipping</hi> or <hi>Sprinkling Infants</hi> or young Children, we find
no <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>President</hi> in Holy Scripture for the Practice thereof;
and therefore we cannot think, our not-believing it, Essential (or
necessary) to Salvation; or <hi>making Christians,</hi> a sufficient Argument
to prove us <hi>no Christians</hi>; unless it can be proved, that none are
Saved without it, and that all are Saved, that have it. Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

On the first part of this Profession, the <hi>Rector</hi> makes this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against us, viz. <hi>By this their Answer, they</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>do
not Insinuate to, but plainly tell the World, what Baptism it is that is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
necessary to Salvation, or making Christians that is the Inward or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Washing of Regeneration by the Word of Life, the Washing or Cleansing
of the Heart, or an Inward Conversion to God,</hi> p. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>And herein we plainly tell the World the plain Truth, according
to Holy Scripture, And what <hi>Venom</hi> is in this pray? Had not this
<hi>Rector</hi> need to be severely corrected for opposing this Doctrine, as
Venomous, and making the outward Baptism by Water the Saving
Baptism, and not the Inward and Spiritual; As if all the World of
Mankind were in a State of Damnation, who are not so outwardly
Baptized with Water; or could be no Christians, nor Saved, if they
be not so Baptized or Rantized, as he would have them; this is like
<hi>Dip</hi> or <hi>Damn</hi>: Oh! uncharitable and unchristian Doctrine. Has Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Grace been preached so long among us, and must it now
be placed on Works; or on such a superficial Work, as that of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Baptism, Sprinkling, Dipping or Plunging Persons in Water?
But that the Inward Spiritual Baptism, washing of Regeneration by
the Word of Life, the Spirit of Life, the Power of Christ, is the Saving
Baptism, the truly Regenerating Baptism, the Baptism essentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation, and making Christians, and not the outward,
nor the Sign, Type or Shadow thereof, is no venomous Doctrine,
but agreeable to Holy Scripture Testimony, is evident, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.
<hi>Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine
Eyes,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this was an Inward and Spiritual Washing.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. O Jerusalem, <hi>wash thine Heart from thy wickedness, that thou
mayest be saved</hi>: This was a Heart-washing, an Inward and Spiritual
Washing, whereby they might be Saved. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>The Fountain
opened to the House of</hi> David, <hi>and to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>for Sin,
and for Uncleanness</hi>; was a Spiritual Fountain: The Lord God was the
Fountain of Living Water, which when they had forsaken, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a great Evil therein, as well as in hewing to themselves broken
Cisterns which could hold no Water, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13. And the clean
Water the Lord promised to Sprinkle upon his People, to make them
clean from all their Filthiness, and to cleanse them from all their
Idols, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25. was a Spiritual Sprinkling with Spiritual Water,
and the Lord's doing. <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Except a Man be born again of Water,
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> This was
Spiritual Living Water, Inward and Sanctifying Grace, as the True
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58915:13"/>
Primitive Christians experienced, and best of Reformed Protestants
believed; and not the outward Element of Water, as <hi>Papists</hi> and
this <hi>Rector</hi> believe and hold. As in his page 28 (before more fully
observed) yea he holds, <hi>This poor Element</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>of Water, as
necessary to do away Sins, and to work upon our Souls, as the Waters of</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
<hi>were to the Cleansing of</hi> Naaman, 2 Kings 5. 13. <hi>so necessary</hi> (quoth
he) <hi>are the Waters of Baptism to the Cleansing our Souls,</hi> p. 31. Such
Vertue he ascribes to this Element, thus idolizing it, even as highly
as the <hi>Rhemists</hi> against the <hi>Protestants,</hi> but contrary to Christ's own
Testimony also, <hi>If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me,</hi> saith our
Lord Jesus, <hi>John</hi> 13. 8. who also required first to make clean the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
that the out-side might be clean also. Therefore 'twas the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Spiritual Washing of Regeneration, the Washing or Cleansing
of the Heart, by the Word of Life, the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which was the Soul's Saving Baptism, and not that of the
outward Element, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 4, 5. After that the Kindness of God our
Saviour toward Man appeared, not by Works of Righteousness which
we have done, but according to his Mercy he <hi>Saved</hi> us by the
<hi>Washing of Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Renewing</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Baptism</hi> which doth now save us, be <hi>not the Putting
away of the filth of the Flesh, but the Answer of a good Conscience towards
God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,</hi> according to that of <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 3. 23.
What can be more clear than that the <hi>Saving Baptism</hi> is that of the
Spirit, (which is the One Baptism, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5.) whereby the Saints
were all Baptized into One Body, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 12. 13. and not that of
the outward Element, which can neither cleanse the Soul, nor wash
away the Sin or Guilt thereof. The Inward and Spiritual Grace Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Soul from Sin and Condemnation, and ought to be preferred
to all outward and <hi>visible Signs,</hi> which can neither Save, nor Sustain or
Relieve the Soul, 'tis Life and Substance, which is divine can do
that. The <hi>One</hi> Spiritual Baptism, and that <hi>One</hi> Bread, that Spiritual
Meat and Drink which cometh down from Heaven, is that which
both saves and nourisheth the Soul unto Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 6.
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>That Disciples and Apostles of Christ did Baptize with Water, is
not denied, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36, 38. &amp; ch. 10. 48. &amp; ch. 19. 3, 4, 5. but that
they did Practice, or enjoin it as an act of necessity, pursuant to
Christ's Commission in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. is to impose upon us, or beg
the Question; but that it was rather permissively practised in con
discention, than by that Commission. For <hi>1st, Water</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58915:14"/>
in that Text. <hi>2dly,</hi> When they Baptized with Water, they
did not use the terms of the Commission in it. We do not read in
all the Acts of the Apostles, that any of them Baptized with Water,
in the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or
that they used those expressions or terms, in their Baptizing with
Water, but in the name of the Lord, or in the name of the Lord
Jesus. If <hi>Water</hi> had been intended in that Commission of Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> must be concerned in it, it must be
as much binding to him as any other Minister, but he declares the
contrary, <hi>that Christ sent him not to Baptize but to Preach the Gospel,</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 17. he does not say Christ sent me not <hi>only</hi> to Baptize,
but positively, for <hi>Christ sent me not to Baptize, but to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
which was part of the Reason he gave why he thanked God
that he had baptized no more than those he mentions, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 1. 14, 15, 16.
as well as, Lest they should have said, he had baptized in his own
name; for 'tis not to be supposed he would thank God for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
part of his Commission, if it had been to Baptize with
Water, as well as to Preach the Gospel; but that positive and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reason, <hi>for Christ sent me <hi>not</hi> to Baptize, but to preach the Gospel,</hi>
leaves no room for him to say Christ sent me to Minister Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
(in his Commission in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.) for Water-Baptism was
properly <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism and Ministry, to make way for Christ's
higher Dispensation and Spiritual Ministry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 8.
<hi>Luke</hi> 3. 16. <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 5. &amp; 10. 16. compare with <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2, 3, 4.
But I need not enlarge on this subject, to answer the <hi>Anabaptists</hi>
Argument for Plunging, or dipping Believers in Water, unless this
<hi>Rector</hi> were in the Practice thereof, and renounced his <hi>Rantism,</hi> as
they do as a <hi>Scriptureless Thing,</hi> as they term <hi>Sprinkling Infants.</hi> But
referr him to a Treatise of one that was of his Coat, <hi>i. e. William

            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Rector</hi>'s <hi>Referring the Reader to that Excellent Piece of Water-Baptism</hi>
(as he terms it) <hi>writ by that worthy and Ingenious Author</hi> (as
he applauds him) <hi>of</hi> The Snake in the Grass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> printed 1697.
p. 29.</p>
            <p>Thus highly has he commended the Author of that Great Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and Reproaching Libel, <hi>i. e. The Snake in the Grass</hi>; but it
would be too difficult a Task for him to defend the manifold Gross
and Abominable Lies and Calumnies contain'd therein, against the
manifest detection and discovery made of them, not only in my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
against the Venom of the said Snake,</hi> &amp;c. but more fully, in a

Or, a Switch for the Snake.</hi> By <hi>Joseph Wyeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this <hi>Rector</hi> can demonstrate a <hi>Probatum est,</hi> of such vertue in
that <hi>Poor Element</hi> (as he calls it) of <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> as to cleanse
and cure polluted and distempered Souls from Sin, Spiritual Leprosie
and Diseases, as <hi>Naaman</hi> the Assyrian was cured of his Leprosie by
washing seven times in the River of <hi>Jordan, 2 Kings</hi> 5. 13. or as
the Blind Man found in washing in the Pool of <hi>Siloam</hi> that he receiv'd
Sight and came seeing, <hi>John</hi> 9.â€”11. unto both which the <hi>Rector</hi>
alludes in's comparison for <hi>Water-Baptism</hi>; Then I say if he can evince
a <hi>Probatum</hi> of such vertue therein, according to his own compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
It will be a most pregnant Argument to induce People to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
'tis required of them, to be dipt or baptized in the Element of
Water, and to hasten into it, especially if they can believe it can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
such a Miracle, as an Inward and Spiritual Cure upon their
Souls, as to Cleanse and Cure them from Sin and the Leprosie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as well as from Spiritual Blindness, which answers the Allusions
before; and the more necessity thereof, if they may not be so cured
without it, as this <hi>Rector</hi> saith of <hi>Naaman, If he had neglected it, he
had not otherwise been cured, How much more then</hi> (quoth he) <hi>when
God has appointed the means of Baptism by his Son, if we neglect it, shall
we be saved without it?</hi> p. 31.</p>
            <p>This is like <hi>Dipp</hi> or <hi>Damn</hi> still, and yet all this while he may mean
<hi>Rantism,</hi> which is not properly <hi>Baptism</hi>; but I deny either (<hi>i. e.</hi>
with the Element of Water) <hi>to be the means of Salvation,</hi> or that as
such, God has so appointed them, and that Men shall not be Saved
without them; (<hi>i. e.</hi> without <hi>Sprinkling</hi> or <hi>Dipping</hi> in Water) the
<hi>Rector</hi> still imposes and begs the Question in all these, without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
proof. I would not be understood to own or allow any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
to Water-Baptism, or <hi>inventing contemptible</hi> Names for it (as the
<hi>Rector</hi> insinuates) as it was once a Dispensation from Heaven to <hi>John</hi>
Baptist; nor do I either condemn, despise or contemn any who are
tenderly Conscientious in the Belief and Practise thereof, but desire
they may see and come further, so as to receive that <hi>Inward Spiritual
Baptism,</hi> the <hi>Washing of Regeneration,</hi> by which Christ effectually
Saveth the True Believers in him; I desire none may Idolize the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Element of Water which cannot Save, to hinder them of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which can Save.</p>
            <p>And it being generally granted, that the outward Baptism is an
<hi>outward and visible Sign of an Inward and Spiritual Grace, and Type or Figure</hi>
of the <hi>Inward Baptism.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58915:15"/>
I wish Men would be so considerate, as to examine what Necessity
there can be of the continuance of the <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Type,</hi> when they do
not hear Christ the Great Prophet directing thereto; nor does it
effect the end proposed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Washing away of Sin, seeing the
Substance and Mystery thereof is made manifest, and a Spiritual Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
or Ministry from Heaven given immediately, directing to
the Life, Substance, the end of all Shadows, which really end in
Christ the Substance, whose Evangelical Ministry is a Dispensation
of the Grace of God, of Substance and not of Shadow.</p>
            <q>Quest.<hi> Do you believe or own the Lord's Supper, either as a Sign of
the Love that Christians ought to have among themselves, or as a Seal of
the Saints Communion, and Commemoration of Christ's Death for us, or
as Figurative of Christ's Body and Blood, Spiritually received by Faith?</hi>
            </q>
            <q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> we own, and tenderly consider in
a <hi>Two-fold</hi> Sense, 1. In the <hi>Figure</hi>; 2. In the <hi>Substance.</hi>
            </q>
            <q>1. That our Lord Jesus Christ, at his <hi>Supper</hi> with his Disciples,
did eat the <hi>Passover</hi> (which was for the fulfilling and Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Feasts under the Law, see <hi>Luke</hi> 22.) and at this <hi>Supper</hi>
he did take and minister <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> to his Disciples (for
there was no <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>) saying, <hi>This do in remembrance of
me.</hi> And (saith the Apostle) <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink
this Cup, ye shew the Lord's Death, till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. After
this they did more clearly know his <hi>Coming,</hi> and Christ after the
Spirit; <hi>Jesus Christ in them,</hi> 2 Cor. 13, 5. &amp; 5. 16.</q>
            <q>2. And Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>I will not drink henceforth
of this Fruit of the Vine, until that day I drink it new with you in my
Father's Kingdom,</hi> Matt. 26. 29. And likewise of the <hi>Passover, I will
not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God,</hi>
Luke 22. 16. And he further said, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as
my Father hath appointed to me, that ye may eat and drink at my Table
in my Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 29, 30. In these things we believe he
spoke <hi>Mysteriously,</hi> and that every Member of his Spiritual Church,
doth daily Spiritually partake of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> by Faith; as,
<hi>The Cup of Blessing, which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood
of Christ? And the Bread, which we break, Is it not the Communion of
the Body of Christ? For we being many, are one Bread, and one Body, for
we are all Partakers of that one Bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 15, 16, 17. The
Son of God saith, <hi>Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any Man
hear my voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will <hi>Sup</hi>
with him, and he with me,</hi> Rev. 3. 20. And Wisdom calleth to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58915:15"/>
Simple, <hi>Come eat of my Bread, and drink of my Wine,</hi> Prov. 9. 4, 5.
And, saith Christ, <hi>The Bread of God is he, that cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and giveth Life unto the World. I am that Bread of Life; my
Flesh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed; He that eateth my
Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> John 6.
We believe, that all who thus do truly partake of Christ by Faith,
are in true <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> among themselves; which they do
want, who are only in the outward Observation of <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Upon which the <hi>Rector</hi> makes this <hi>Observation,</hi> viz. <hi>The Reader may
here discern, how by their deceivable Words, and manifold Corruptions of the
Scriptures, these horrid Impostors set themselves at work, to evade and make
null the Holy Ordinance of the</hi> Lord's Supper, <hi>as instituted and administred
in</hi> Bread <hi>and</hi> Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> He passes severe Judgment before either <hi>Proof</hi> or <hi>Trial,</hi> as
one more expert in Railing and Reviling, than in Demonstration.
For our considering the <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> in a <hi>Two-fold</hi> Sence: 1. In
the <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure.</hi> 2. In the <hi>Substance</hi>; Is neither <hi>Deceivable,</hi> nor <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> consequently; 'tis a horrid Calumny to brand us
as <hi>Horrid Impostors</hi> for such Consideration. We know none but <hi>Papists,</hi>
that will deny the outward <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be <hi>Typical,</hi> though
Consecrated; We are sure, no real <hi>Protestants</hi> do deny them to be
<hi>Typical,</hi> or <hi>Figurative,</hi> but have affirm'd them so to be. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> or Christ's Last Supper (in the <hi>Type</hi>)
<hi>Luke</hi> 22. was made up only of the <hi>Bread broken,</hi> and the <hi>Cup,</hi> is a
Question to be considered by them who assert it; or whether the
<hi>Passover</hi> was not principally concern'd in the <hi>Supper,</hi> seeing, that also
after <hi>Supper</hi> Christ took the <hi>Cup,</hi> and gave them: I deny, that the
<hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> only, as now ministred by <hi>Priests,</hi> is either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a <hi>Supper,</hi> or a <hi>Dinner</hi>; How then come they to call it <hi>The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord</hi>? Or deny it to be a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> by deeming us
<hi>Horrid Impostors,</hi> for asserting, the outward <hi>Supper</hi> to be <hi>Typical</hi>? 'Tis
true, it's said, <hi>As oft as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew
the Lord's Death, till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26. I hope our Adversary
will not make <hi>As oft,</hi> to import a <hi>Command,</hi> and that <hi>perpetual</hi> too,
unless <hi>till he (Christ) come,</hi> can import a perpetual <hi>Delay</hi> of his <hi>Coming.</hi>
And though Christ's Last <hi>Supper,</hi> wherein he eat the <hi>Passover</hi> with
his Disciples, was then <hi>(pro tempore)</hi> commanded by him; yet this
does not prove it his <hi>Institution</hi>: For it was a <hi>Legal Institution,</hi> fulfilled
by him, as other <hi>Legal Rites</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> were, before he was offer'd up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58915:16"/>
That <hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> from Heaven, and his Divine Virtue,
Grace and Spirit, as the Fruit of him, the heavenly <hi>Vine</hi> (which
gives <hi>Life, Nourishment</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> unto the Soul) was really the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
and <hi>Mystery</hi> typified by the outward <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cup,</hi> I hope, no
Spiritual Believer or Christian will deny. And to suppose, they shall
not partake thereof, until Christ's Coming at the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> is to
suppose, their <hi>Souls</hi> must starve and famish in the mean time; which
can be no <hi>glad Tidings</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> falsly charges us with saying, <hi>The Resurrection is past al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi>
(as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 18.) p. 34. 'Tis none of
our saying; we deny that the <hi>Resurrection</hi> (there spoken of) is <hi>past</hi>
(or <hi>made</hi>) <hi>already</hi>; or that we overthrow the Faith of any believing
therein, as it is <hi>to come</hi> by Christ Jesus, who is the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and the
<hi>Life,</hi> and by whom comes the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Dead, 1. Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>And I would ask this <hi>Rector,</hi> where we say or use these Expressions,
<hi>That the Institution of the</hi> Lord's Supper <hi>was only to continue, till that, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Coming, or forming of Christ in our Hearts,</hi> and for that Reason
<hi>throw off the outward Supper</hi>? p. 34, 35. Where have we so said, or
argued? For our not using the <hi>Type,</hi> is rather, because we do not
believe it of Force or Necessity under an higher Dispensation,
namely, that of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> established by the Death of <hi>Christ</hi>
the <hi>Testator,</hi> who blotted out and nailed the hand-writing of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
to his <hi>Cross</hi>; the Dispensation of the Gospel and <hi>New Covenant,</hi>
being a Dispensation of <hi>Substance,</hi> and not of <hi>Shadows</hi>; although they
were in some things condescended unto in a State of <hi>Infancy,</hi> when
not impos'd as things Essential to <hi>Christianity</hi> or <hi>Salvation.</hi> It's true,
that they who <hi>gladly received the Word, continued stedfastly in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi>
Acts 2. 42. And Verse 46. <hi>And they continuing daily with one Accord
in the Temple, and breaking Bread from House to House, did eat their Meat
with Gladness and singleness of Heart.</hi> No doubt they were very Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in this Practice, <hi>Praising God,</hi> &amp;c. v. 47. And this we have often
done, and believe, it is the Duty of all true <hi>Christians,</hi> to <hi>eat</hi> their
<hi>Meat with Singleness of Heart</hi>; and whether they <hi>eat</hi> or <hi>drink,</hi> to <hi>do all
to the Glory of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. And what greater San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
can this Man suppose or place, upon what he calls the <hi>Lord's
Supper</hi>? Ought we not to praise God for all his Benefits, and use
them to his Glory daily; and not only in a daily Remembrance of
Christ and his Love to us, but also in a true sense thereof, and of
his Sanctifying Word. In <hi>Acts</hi> the second quoted, it's also said
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58915:16"/>
(Verse 44, 45.) <hi>And all that believed were together, and had all things
common, and sold their Possessions and Goods, and parted them <hi>to all</hi> Men,

and <hi>Practices</hi> binding, then why do they not follow this, of
<hi>having all things common, and selling their Possessions</hi>? &amp;c. I do not think
the Priests now a-days will imitate them, or deem themselves bound
thereby. And where do they so much as imitate those Primitive
Believers, in <hi>breaking Bread from House to House</hi>? And how will they
prove this <hi>Breaking of Bread</hi> only to be the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>? I deny
that to be made up only of <hi>Bread</hi>; and I cannot suppose this Man
will esteem it a sufficient <hi>Supper.</hi> Nor do I find, that the Apostles
call Believers, <hi>only breaking Bread from House to House,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.) or the
Disciples <hi>coming together to break Bread</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7.) the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>;
where they neither mention <hi>Wine,</hi> nor the <hi>Passover</hi>: Nor would it
be of good report, to say they drank Wine <hi>from House to House</hi>: And
if it should be asserted, That <hi>the Lord's Supper was made up only of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bread,</hi> would not this gratifie the Popish Priests, in giving their
Sacrament but in one kind? However, the outward <hi>Bread,</hi> as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and the outward <hi>Cup,</hi> as ministred by our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
were not only <hi>Figurative</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as offer'd upon the
<hi>Cross</hi>; but also did <hi>Typifie</hi> the Saints <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> and
<hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> Spiritually, who saith, <hi>My Flesh is Meat indeed, and my
Blood is Drink indeed</hi>; And <hi>he that eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood,
dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> John 6. And <hi>I'll raise him up at the last
day,</hi> saith <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore it's no <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi>
to consider the <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> in the <hi>Figure,</hi> and in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>

               <hi>And as to these other Texts, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.
4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 29. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 16, 29, 30. <hi>They</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers)
<hi>offer to the view of the World, I cannot discern or imagine</hi> (quoth the
<hi>Rector</hi>) <hi>to what End and Purpose this is done, unless it be to amuse the Reader,
abuse the Scriptures, or confute themselves,</hi> Page 36, 37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It was to none of those <hi>Ends</hi> these Texts are offer'd, but to
shew our Consideration of the Lord's Supper, in the Substance and
Mystery thereof, as Typified by the outward, that there is a Spiritual
Bread and Wine, Spiritual Meat and Drink in <hi>Christ's</hi> Kingdom, for
the enlivened Soul to eat and drink of, and live by, which the Visible
and Elementary did Typifie and Figure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 5. Wisdom saith,
<hi>Come eat of my Bread, and drink of the Wine which I have mingled</hi>: That
this was Spiritual Bread and Wine which Christ the Wisdom of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58915:17"/>
God hath in his House for his Family; I hope will not be denied.</p>
            <p>Matth. 26. 29. <hi>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this
Fruit of the Vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's
Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Luke 22. 16. <hi>For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof</hi> (i. e.
of the Passover) <hi>until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.</hi> And vers. 18.
<hi>I will not drink of the Fruit of the Vine, until the Kingdom of God shall
come.</hi> And vers. 29. <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom as my Father hath
appointed unto me.</hi> Vers. 30. <hi>That ye may Eat and Drink at my Table in
my Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would ask our Opposers if they think This was meant
Litterally of Eating and Drinking outward Bread and Wine in
the Kingdom of God, and of Christ, and at an outward Table
therein? If not Litterally meant, then it must be Spiritually, as
Christ's Kingdom is a Spiritual Kingdom. God's Kingdom stands
in Power, in Righteousness, Joy and Peace in the Holy Ghost, and
not in outward Forms and Shadows; and in this Kingdom is the
Substance and End of all the Outward Shadows and Types thereof,
which being expressed under the same names the Types are, is the
more evidently to shew the End and Anti-type thereof, in Christ the
Life and Substance.</p>
            <p>John 6. 51. <hi>I am the Living Bread which came down from Heaven,
if any Man eat of this Bread, he shall live for ever</hi> (saith Christ.) And
vers. 54. <hi>Whoso eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal Life,
and I will raise him up at the Last Day.</hi> See also vers. 53, 55, 56,
57, 58.</p>
            <p>Did Christ mean Litterally herein? No sure, This <hi>Bread</hi> which
came down from Heaven, was not the outward Sign, Type or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
but the Spiritual Living <hi>Bread,</hi> which giveth Life to the Soul,
and is Meat indeed unto it, as his Blood is Drink indeed, to all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Believers in him, who are come to Eat and Drink of the
same Spiritual Meat and Drink, which <hi>Israel</hi> did Eat and Drink of,
as testified, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 10. 3, 4. <hi>That they Did all Eat the same Spiritual
Meat; and did all Drink the same Spiritual Drink: For they drank of
that Spiritual Rock that followed them</hi> (or went them) <hi>and that
Rock was Christ.</hi> And of these things the Apostle would not have
his Brethren at <hi>Corinth</hi> Ignorant, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.â€”and <hi>vers.</hi> 15. <hi>I speak
as to wise Men, Judge ye what I say.</hi> Vers. 16. <hi>The Cup of Blessing,
which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The Bread
which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?</hi> Vers. 17.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58915:17"/>
               <hi>For we being many, are</hi> one Bread, <hi>and</hi> one Body: <hi>For we are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of that one Bread.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>Behold</hi> Israel <hi>after the Flesh:
Are not they which eat of the Sacrifices partakers of the Altar?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which it is Evident, the Apostles chief Aim and End
was, to bring those Believers to <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> beyond and
above the <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Types,</hi> that they might not be Inferiour to
<hi>Israel</hi> after the Flesh, in their eating and drinking of the same <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Meat and Drink,</hi> even of that <hi>Spiritual Rock,</hi> which was Christ,
and be true partakers of him, as the one Offering and Passover,
who was sacrificed for us; see also <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Rev. 3. 20. <hi>Behold, I stand at the Door and knock, if any Man hear my
Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will</hi> Sup <hi>with him,
and he with me.</hi> This Christ the Faithful and true Witness declareth,
for the encouragement of all to open the Door of their Hearts to
him, that they may come into spiritual <hi>Communion</hi> with him, and
therein partake with him of his spiritual <hi>Supper</hi>; unto which this
<hi>Rector</hi> partly ascents, in saying, <hi>I make no doubt, but all good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
own Christ to be the Bread of Life, and of Spiritual Communion with
him in his holy Ordinances,</hi> p. 37.</p>
            <p>And I say, there's no doubt, but true Christians have Spiritual
<hi>Communion</hi> with Christ, in truly hearing, and sincerely obeying him
in those things, which may be truly called his holy <hi>Ordinances</hi> and
<hi>Institutions</hi> perpetuated by himself, and attended by his divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for the Sanction thereof; but then Men should have a <hi>Care</hi>
they do not impose <hi>humane Institutions</hi> and <hi>Traditions</hi> for Christ's,
and say, they are <hi>His,</hi> tho' without any express Warrant from him
either <hi>Mediate</hi> or <hi>Immediate.</hi> We know none among us, that either
<hi>slights, vilifies</hi> or <hi>contemns</hi> any holy <hi>Institutions</hi> or <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Christ,
or any thing which God or Christ ever commanded, whether now
in force or not; neither do I condemn any one, who believe 'tis
their Duty to observe <hi>Baptism,</hi> or that which is termed the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
whilst they do it with a sincere Intention, as Conscientious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God therein; they seeing no further, nor yet designing to
oppose the Discovery of an <hi>higher Dispensation</hi> and <hi>Ministry.</hi> Altho'
I heartily with (as I hope) that all such may see more clearly, and
beyond the <hi>Shadows</hi> to the <hi>Substance</hi> and Mystery of Christ revealed;
that the one saving <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the one living <hi>Bread</hi> from Heaven,
they may all experience, and truly partake of.</p>
            <p>One thing (by the way) I would note, what Construction our
Adversary makes of <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>As often as ye Eat this Bread, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58915:18"/>
Drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> This <hi>[till he
come]</hi> is construed, <hi>Till Christ's Outward, Personal Coming, visible in
his Body of Flesh and Bones at the Resurrection, to make our vile Bodies
like his own Glorious Body,</hi> p. 34, 36. According to which <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
if we should read, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>As oft as ye eat this Bread,
and drink this Cup, ye shew the Lord's Death till he come</hi> Personally and
Visibly at the <hi>Resurrection</hi>: It would import as if the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
were to stay, and live upon Earth in the Observation of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cup,</hi> Eating and Drinking thereof until then,
<hi>i. e.</hi> until Christ's <hi>Last Coming</hi> at the <hi>Resurrection</hi>; But how could
that be?</p>
            <p>But seeing Christ's <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> at his <hi>Supper</hi> with his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
was Spiritually to be fulfilled in his Father's Kingdom,
and at his Table in his Kingdom (as he promised) according to
<hi>Luke</hi> 22. 16, 18, 29, 30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 29. some may inquire when this
should be fulfilled, and when this Kingdom should come to Saints
and true Believers in Christ? Whither in this Life, or in the last
Day, when Christ shall come in the Glory of his Father, with his
Angels, to reward every Man according to his Works? <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. 27.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer, Christ saith in the very next <hi>verse, Verily I
say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not tast of Death,
till they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 16. 28.
And the like in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Verily I say unto you, that there be some of
them that stand here, which shall not tast of Death, till they have seen the
Kingdom of God come with Power.</hi> The like in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 27. All which
shew the <hi>Kingdom</hi> Then near to come, even in their days; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the Saints partaking of the Blessing thereof, was, and is in
their Life time, wherein they partook even of the Spiritual <hi>Supper</hi>
of the Lord, the Spiritual <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> at Christ's Table in his
Kingdom, wherein the Substance and Fulness of all <hi>Types</hi> and
<hi>Shadows</hi> consists, and whereof every true Spiritual Christian is
partaker.</p>
            <p>By all which 'tis Evident, that there is just Cause to consider the
<hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in the Substance and <hi>Mystery</hi> of Christ, and that his
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> wherein the same is Spiritually received, ought not to be
put afar off, nor true Believers excluded out of it, until Christ's
<hi>Last Coming</hi> at the End of the World, and the <hi>Resurrection</hi> in the Great
and <hi>Last Day.</hi> Neither ought poor Souls to be left starving and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing
under <hi>Shadows,</hi> and a barren Ministry, until then; for that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58915:18"/>
can be no <hi>Glad Tidings,</hi> or true Gospel to them, therefore all had
need to be careful, and take heed, that they don't famish their poor
Souls, by neglecting the <hi>Substance,</hi> and feeding upon <hi>Shadows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup,</hi> which Christ gave at his <hi>Supper,</hi>
were a <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Typical,</hi> was confessed by divers Eminent <hi>Martyrs,</hi>
as <hi>John Frith</hi> in his <hi>Reasons</hi> upon the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> treating of Christ the
<hi>Promised Seed,</hi> saith,</p>
            <q>Likewise the same <hi>Promise</hi> was made unto <hi>Moses,</hi> the most meek
and gentle Captain of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> which did not only himself
believe upon Christ, which was so often <hi>promised</hi>; but also did
<hi>prefigurate</hi> him by divers Means, both by the <hi>Manna</hi> which came
down from Heaven, and also by the <hi>Water</hi> wich issued out of the
<hi>Rock,</hi> for the refreshing the Bodies of his People.</q>
            <q>Neither is it to be doubted, but that both <hi>Manna,</hi> and this
<hi>Water,</hi> had a <hi>Prophetical Mystery</hi> in them, declareing the very self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
thing, which the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> do now declare unto
us in the <hi>Sacrament</hi>: For, thus saith St. <hi>Augustine, Wbosoever did
understand Christ in the Manna, did eat the same Spiritual Food, that we
do; but they which by that</hi> Manna <hi>sought only to fill their Bellies, did
eat thereof and are Dead.</hi> On the Margent it is, <hi>Manna, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Rock, a Figure of Christ's Body: Bread and Wine a Figure
likewise of Christ's Body,</hi> 1 Cor 10. See 2 Vol. Martyrs, p. 305.

            <q>And Dr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> confesseth, <hi>Christ's
Speech,</hi> i. e. [<hi>This is my Body</hi>] to be <hi>Figurative</hi>; and quoting <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
in <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 11. he calleth the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup Signs,</hi> a

The rest of the <hi>Rector's Observation,</hi> relating to <hi>Baptism, Bread</hi> and
<hi>Wine</hi> (pag. 37, 38.) is answered in the <hi>Just Examination</hi> of the <hi>Two
Books</hi> of the Three <hi>Norfolk-Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Do you believe and own the Holy Scriptures, contained in the Books
of the Old and New Testament, to be given by Divine Inspiration, and to
contain all Matters of Doctrine and Testimony, necessary to be believed and
practis'd, in order to Salvation, and Peace with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Our Answer is, <hi>Yes,</hi> we do; and by the assistance of the
<hi>Grace</hi> and good <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which gives the true Understanding
of the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> we always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to live in the <hi>Faith, Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of them in all things,
appertaining to <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Godliness</hi>; Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> being given by
Divine Inspiration, is profitable for <hi>Doctrine, Correction</hi> and <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Man of God may be perfect, thorowly furnished unto every
good Work,</hi> able to make the Man of God <hi>Wise</hi> unto <hi>Salvation,</hi> through
<hi>Faith</hi> which is in Christ Jesus.</q>
            <p>In the <hi>Observation</hi> made upon this our <hi>Profession,</hi> the <hi>Rector</hi> is pleas'd
<hi>to question the Sincerity thereof, which he leaves to the World, and the Reader
to judge,</hi> p. 39, 42. But our <hi>Sincerity</hi> is known to the Lord, to whom
we commit our Cause. And being prejudg'd by this pretended <hi>Rector,</hi>
we shall not leave it to him to be <hi>Judge</hi> over our <hi>Sincerity,</hi> or <hi>Conscience</hi>
towards God. For being all along <hi>Prejudicate</hi> in his <hi>Observations,</hi> he
had need to be corrected for his <hi>Vncharitableness</hi> and <hi>Censoriousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first Instance</hi> he gives to disprove our <hi>Sincerity,</hi> is a Quotation of
some <hi>Quakers</hi> out of the <hi>Quakers Refuge,</hi> p. 17. against <hi>John Whitehead</hi>
and <hi>Robert Ruckhill, Whether the first Penman of the Scriptures was</hi> Moses
<hi>or</hi> Hermes? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With other <hi>Questions,</hi> which are answered over and
over in divers of our Books, and particularly in my late <hi>Examination,</hi>
entituled, <hi>Truth and Innocency</hi> (p. 57.) wherein 'tis made evident, that
those <hi>Questions</hi> did not arise from any Doubts or Scruples in the said
<hi>John Whitehead</hi> or <hi>R. R.</hi> but in some others; and therefore waved, as
not the Subject of <hi>R. R</hi>'s Argument, who recited them in the said
<hi>Quakers Refuge.</hi> Consequently very unjustly quoted against the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
to render them <hi>Insincere,</hi> in the same <hi>Confession,</hi> to the Truth of
the Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> as given by <hi>Divine Inspiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the <hi>Rector</hi> quotes against <hi>E. Burrough, G. F. W. P. G. W.</hi> &amp;c.
in p. 40, 41, 42. concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c.
is also answered in the said <hi>Examination,</hi> p. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, and p. 58.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58915:19"/>
I cannot but take notice how Credulous (as well as Envious) this
<hi>Rector</hi> appears, in repeating <hi>Fra. Bugg</hi>'s <hi>Old Lie,</hi> to defame us, bidding
the <hi>Reader, See</hi> Lawson's <hi>Threefold Estate of Anti-christ,</hi> p. 9. <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is Dust and Death, Beastly Wares,</hi> &amp;c. p. 41.</p>
            <p>I would ask this <hi>Rector,</hi> whether he has seen these very Words in
the place quoted? Or if he has ever read the said <hi>Lawson</hi>'s <hi>Threefold
State of Anti-christ</hi>? If he says, he has, I'm sure, he is guilty of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<hi>Lie</hi> in this Quotation, for there is not a word of calling the
Scripture <hi>Beastly Ware,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Babylon's Merchants selling Beastly Ware
for a large Price,</hi> &amp;c. p. 9. And if he received this Quotation upon
<hi>Credit</hi> from <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> he is very <hi>Vnjust</hi> and <hi>Immoral</hi> therein, in receiving
and promoting such a <hi>Reproach</hi> against his <hi>Neighbours</hi> to defame them;
which Offence is justly Condemn'd by the righteous <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another apparent Abuse I find against <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi> his <hi>Appendix,</hi>
p. 752. Printed 1679. by a <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>unjust Citation,</hi> in curtailing
and perverting his Words, to make them look, as if writ in <hi>Contempt</hi>
of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> where the <hi>Rector</hi> saith, <hi>Samuel Fisher has these Words
(speaking of the Text of Scripture)</hi> Which <hi>Transcriptions</hi> and <hi>Translations,</hi>
were they neve so certain, and entirely answering to the <hi>first Original
Copies,</hi> yet are not capable to be <hi>(to all Men)</hi> any other than a <hi>Lesbyan

of</hi> Luke Howard, H. Fisher, <hi>and</hi> W. Penn, p. 40.</p>
            <p>Thus this <hi>Adversary</hi> has injuriously dealt by <hi>Samuel Fisher,</hi> rendering
him to speak these words of the Text of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are spoken
in reference to the various <hi>Transcriptions, Translations, Interpretations,</hi>
               <hi>Expositions, Senses</hi> and <hi>Meanings, Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Conceits</hi> of Men, who

The <hi>Rector</hi> having left out both the foregoing and subsequent
Reasons of <hi>Sam. Fisher</hi>'s words, which clear his intention, both from
his Calumny of the <hi>Venom of Quakerism,</hi> and from his insinuating <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity</hi>
against our said <hi>Profession.</hi> I may therefore recite part of them
in <hi>S. F</hi>'s behalf, he not being here to vindicate himself, and the <hi>Truth</hi>
profess'd by him; which in his Life-time he largely vindicated, to the
great Confusion of his <hi>Opposers,</hi> where he saith, <q>Moreover, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

some of which that are most ancient, and of most account among most

Priests (as the <hi>Septuagint</hi>) are gone off (quoth <hi>J. O.</hi>) from the Original

and <hi>Translations</hi> of their Text, which they take to be their <hi>Rule</hi>;

even where Men have them (as half the World has not) they are liable to
be wrested, and actually twisted twenty ways by Interpreters, whose Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

            <p>Now to clear <hi>S. Fisher,</hi> from esteeming the Text of Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi>
in it self, either a <hi>Lesbyan</hi> (or <hi>Leaden</hi>) <hi>Rule,</hi> or a <hi>Nose</hi> of <hi>Wax,</hi> but
only the Corrupters and Perverters thereof, making them such, that
it may appear, how well he esteemed of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> he in the
same Book with the said <hi>Appendix,</hi> quoted against him (i. e. <hi>Rusticus
ad Academicus,</hi> Printed in Quarto, 1660. in his <hi>Second Apologetical and

of those things that were believed, and of the Word of Faith, that
was preached,</hi> a writing <hi>Holy Scriptures, Scriptures of Truth,</hi> Books of

in the Spirit, the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> may be said to be <hi>Homogeneous

written of therein, they are <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) a Body or Bulk of
as <hi>various Writings,</hi> as any extant in the World besides them. And
in p. 48, 49. he condemns Mens Mis-renderings, corrupt Copyings,
and Commentings, and making the Scripture to stand, which way
any Critick pleases. And farther saith, As 'tis my continual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
in Works to do it (<hi>i. e.</hi> to condemn such their Corruptions
and Perversions) so do I here, in plain Words, exalt the Scripture,
which they so debase; and state it over all their Trash and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
even on the very top of all their long Train of Traditions,
and over the Archest Title of the <hi>Tripple-Crown,</hi> the proudest Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of <hi>Peter</hi>'s (now Un-<hi>Peter</hi>-like) painted Temple, the highest
Point of that Pompous, Pious, Pitteous Pillar and Ground of Truth,
the choicest <hi>Chapter</hi> of that Holy Church, and infallibly <hi>Erring</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible

                  <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>impartial Pleader</hi> for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and a doer of Right to
those <hi>Holy Writings,</hi> which are egregiously wronged by both Papists
and Protestants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And p. <hi>Ibid.</hi> he argues for many (<hi>i. e.</hi> who
are falsly suppos'd to be slighters and disowners of Scripture)
who, to give it its due and no more, (as indeed it is) do <hi>own,

            <p>Thus <hi>S. Fisher</hi> has cleared the Point, of his great Value and Esteem
of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> considered in its highest, primitive, best and
purest Aspect, as at first given forth; quite contrary to his being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

            <p>In the Observation upon this Profession <q>(On our sincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
and confessing the Doctrine of the Resurrection from the
Dead, according to Holy Scripture.)</q> The <hi>Rector</hi> thus reflects, <hi>That
is according to their Sence and Interpretation of Holy Scripture, which is no ways
agreeable to the Sence and Interpretations of any Orthodox Christians,</hi> p. 43.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58915:21"/>
Which is as undue a Reflection, as 'tis uncharitably Censorious. And
what he quotes against our Sence, out of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Arguments, against
such a <hi>Carnal Resurrection of Man's Carnal</hi> (or Natural) <hi>Body</hi> (as some
imagine) out of his <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> p. 134. is no proof at all,
<hi>That our Sence of Holy Scripture</hi> (in this case) <hi>is no ways agreeable to the
Sence and Interpretation of any Orthodox Christians</hi>; unless he can either
prove the same Natural, Carnal and Numerical Body that now is, to
be the <hi>Resurrection Body,</hi> or the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> Heterodox in asserting it
<hi>a Spiritual Body</hi>; for a Natural Body is sown, a Spiritual Body is raised,
<hi>and that was not first which is Spiritual, but that which is Natural, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that which is Spiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 46. &amp; ver. 37. and our Sence
clearly agrees with this.</p>
            <p>His other Instance to disprove our Sence herein (if rightly cited)
is out of <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi>'s Answer to <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s First Narrative, p. 149.
printed 1696. In <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 15. 37. he makes the Apostle thus speak
(saith he) <hi>The Body that shall arise, is not the same Carnal Body that dies.</hi>
No, the Body that is sown is a <hi>Natural Body,</hi> but the Body that is
<hi>raised</hi> is <hi>a Spiritual Body</hi>; it is sown a Natural Body, it is raised a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Body, ver. 44. <hi>And that none might think this Spiritual Body was
the same with the Natural Body, he adds</hi> (quoth the Priest) <hi>there is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Body, and there is a Spiritual Body. He does not say</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the
Natural Body is made a Spiritual Body, or the Natural Body and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Body is but one and the same Body, but he sets them in opposition as two
distinct Bodies; and</hi> (again) <hi>that none might think this Spiritual Body was
the same,</hi> he adds, <hi>There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body,</hi>
p. 27. Thus far the <hi>Rector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Addition,</hi> as he counts it, and repeats twice over against <hi>Tho.
Ellwood,</hi> to make him an Offender, is the express words of the Apostle
<hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 44. <hi>There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body.</hi>
Thus the Apostle uses the same distinction between the Natural Body
and the Spiritual Body, Where does he say, <hi>They are both one and the
same Body</hi>? And farther to evince the distinction, <hi>Paul</hi> adds, <hi>And so
it is written, The first Man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living Soul, the last</hi> Adam
<hi>was made a quickning Spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is Spiritual,
but that which is Natural, and afterward that which is Spiritual,</hi> ver. 45, 46.
Now I ask these Men, 1st, If the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and the last <hi>Adam,</hi> were
one and the same <hi>Adam</hi>? 2. If the Spiritual Body, and the Natural
Body, be one and the same Numerical Body? And 3. If the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Bodies, and the Bodies Terrestrial, be one and the same Bodies?
see ver. 40. and ver. 37. <hi>And thou sowest <hi>not</hi> that Body that shall be</hi>:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58915:21"/>
Whom shall we believe in this case, the Apostle or this Priest? for
they differ herein; the one says, Thou sowest <hi>not <hi>that Body</hi>
               </hi> that shall
be; and the other, 'Tis the <hi>same Body</hi> that shall be: The one says,
<hi>Flesh and Blood cannot Inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50. The
other I presume (upon his Principle) says, <hi>The same Carnal Body</hi>
(i. e. <hi>of Flesh and Blood</hi>) can and shall <hi>Inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> But
then how agrees his Notion herein with his Beloved Friend (their
Assistant) <hi>Geo. Keith,</hi> his affirming, <hi>The Husk or drossy part, that is no
more the true Body, than dross in a lump of Rich Ore of Gold is Gold</hi>; as
in his <hi>Gross Error and Hypocrisie detected,</hi> p. 13. And what he means
by the <hi>Husk or drossy part,</hi> may be gathered from his affirming (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> that was <hi>Crucified</hi>) that <hi>It is so wonderfully
changed, as to the Mode and Manner of its being, that it is <hi>no more</hi> a
Body of Flesh, Blood and Bones, but a pure, Ethereal, or heavenly Body,
like unto which the Bodies of the Saints are to be at the Resurrection.</hi> See
<hi>G. Keith</hi>'s <hi>Way Cast up,</hi> p. 131, 132. 1676. So that <hi>the Flesh, Blood and
Bones,</hi> the Saints now have, must be the <hi>Husk</hi> or <hi>drossy</hi> part, which
they shall not have in the Resurrection, but <hi>pure Ethereal</hi> or <hi>heavenly
Bodies,</hi> like Christ's glorious Body: And if so, 1st, How shall they
remain <hi>one and the same in Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> they now are? 2. How
shall they be the same in Substance, without <hi>Flesh, Blood</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi>?
3. What shall be their Substance or Essence, when they shall be <hi>no
more</hi> Bodies of <hi>Flesh, Blood</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi>? 4. How will this Priest and
<hi>G. K.</hi> reconcile themselves in this Point, of the <hi>Sameness</hi> of Bodies?
If one affirm the <hi>Resurrection Bodies</hi> shall be the <hi>same Flesh, Blood and
Bones,</hi> (or at least the <hi>same Flesh</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi>) they now are, and the
other, they shall be the <hi>same in Substance,</hi> but <hi>no more Bodies of Flesh,
Blood and Bones</hi>? Let them reconcile and demonstrate the same, we
are satisfied with the Appointment and good Pleasure of God in this
weighty Matter, and to wait upon him in the hope of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Just unto Eternal Life and Glory, sincerely believing <hi>that
God will give a Body as it pleaseth him, and to every Seed his own proper
Body,</hi> 1 Cor 15. 38. And do not think it necessary to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to be too curious or inquisitive, as to the very <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi>
of the <hi>Resurrection Bodies,</hi> and How God will manifest his Pleasure
therein, Let's live well here, and it shall be well with us hereafter;
say to the <hi>Righteous, it shall be well with them; but Woe to the Wicked, it
shall be ill with them,</hi> Isa. 30. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>I refer the Ingenuous Reader to several further Answers in this
Great Point of the Resurrection, (i. e. My <hi>Antidote against the Venom
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58915:22"/>
of the Snake in the Grass,</hi> p. 102 to 111. And to the <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi>
printed 1674. Part II. p. 316 to 167. &amp; p. 168 to 173. where also
Dr. <hi>H. Moor</hi> is largely cited on the same subject, in his <hi>Modest Enquiry
into the Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Search into the Nature of a Glorified Body.</hi>
And as to what's objected against <hi>R. Hubberthorn</hi> (who was both a
very <hi>Innocent, Gifted</hi> and <hi>Knowing</hi> Man, if rightly quoted) his owning
the <hi>Glorified Saints in Heaven</hi> to be in a State of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and as having
received the <hi>Redemption of the Body</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> from the <hi>Bondage</hi> of <hi>Corruption</hi>
and <hi>Sin,</hi> even before they came thither.) This no ways contradicts
our sincere Belief and Confession <hi>Of the Doctrine of the Resurrection from
the Dead,</hi> according to Holy Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>As to what is objected against <hi>G. W</hi>'s Questions; Is it (<hi>i. e.</hi> the
Glory of God) visible to the Carnal Eye? And of Christ's coming
therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 46. I would ask this Rector, Doest thou expect to
see this Glorious coming of <hi>Christ</hi> from Heaven, with thy carnal Eyes
thou now hast? 2. If thou neglectest his Inward and Spiritual Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Work, mayest thou not neglect thy own Salvation thereby?
3. Seeing our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
only hath Immortality, dwelling in the Light which no Man can approach
unto, whom no Man hath seen, nor can see,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 6. 15, 16. How
canst thou expect to see him with thy Carnal or Fleshly Eye? Hast
thou better, clearer, and more lasting Eyes of Flesh than all other
Men? When I have thus questioned any, it was in Opposition to their
neglect of Christ's <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Appearance and Work, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to save them from Sin and Condemnation. This Point is more
fully answered in our Books, and particularly in my <hi>Examination,</hi>
Entituled, <hi>Truth and Innocency vindicated,</hi> p. 61, 62. And my thus
questioning the Carnal Expectations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of some Persons, I affirm, as
'twas never intended to oppose or contradict our sincere Belief or
Profession, <q>That God will Judge the World in Righteousness (by
his Son Jesus Christ in the Day appointed, even in the Great Day
of Judgment, and that Harvest which is the End of the World.)</q>
So neither does what's quoted against the same Profession, contradict
it, unless it can be proved, that Men may see the Power and great
Glory of God, with their Carnal Eyes they now have; or that with
the very same they shall see Christ at his last coming to Judgment in
the Glory of the Father, and all his Angels with him, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 27.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Rector</hi> objects against that Man of God <hi>William Dewsbery,</hi>
to prove us <hi>Insincere</hi> in our said Profession (that God will Judge the
World in Righteousness by Jesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and him (the said <hi>W. D.</hi>)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58915:22"/>
               <hi>guilty of gross Perversion.</hi> Herein our Accuser has shewn himself as
Ignorant as Envious, and as void of Christianity. He quotes the said
<hi>W. Dewsbery</hi>'s <hi>Discovery of Man's Return,</hi> printed 1654. upon a Passage
where <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12, 13. &amp; <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 5. 10. are only quoted, with other
Scriptures in the Margent of the said <hi>Discovery,</hi> which the <hi>Rector</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
at large, and then makes his Observation against <hi>W. D.</hi> viz.
<hi>Observe here his Gross Perversion, he applying all this to the Light within,
and the Judgment within; so that the outward Judgment at the Last Day,
which is here so plainly described, is not by him professed as a thing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,</hi>
p. 46.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I cannot but observe the Ignorance and Enmity of this Person,
what he objects against the said <hi>W. D.</hi> is no proof at all that he did
not profess or own <hi>Eternal Judgment,</hi> or the final Judgment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
at the <hi>Great and Last Day.</hi> His words cited are these, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Every one arise out of your Earthly Wisdom, and mind the Light
in thy Conscience, and wait on the Power of the Lord in it, and
it will bring thee to Judgment before the Throne of the Lamb (viz.
<hi>within thee</hi> added) where the Righteous Law will be opened in thy
Heart, that will cry through thy Earthly Heart for Righteousness
and Judgment, and the Book will be opened <hi>in thee,</hi> where thou
shalt see all written, that thou hast done in the Body, and shalt give
an Account for every idle Word, (i. e. <hi>to the Light within</hi> added also)
and receive thy Reward for what thou hast done; and thy Reward
is Wrath and Condemnation, which will pass upon thee from the
presence of the Lamb (<hi>within thee,</hi> again added) for thy Disobedience
and breaking of the Righteous Law.</q>
            <p>Where is the Insincerity or gross Perversion in all these words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by the <hi>Rector</hi>? Or any Opposition to our Profession before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?
Surely, to mind the Light of Christ in the Conscience, to
know his Power in it to bring Man to Judgment, according to the
Righteous Law in the Heart, and thereby to see the Record that is
made in Man, of all the Evils done and committed by him: This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be to oppose or contradict our Profession, that God will Judge the
World in Righteousness by his Son Jesus Christ in the day appointed,
but in order to bring Man to Repentance, that he may escape the
Judgment and Wrath to come, upon the Impenitent World of the
Ungodly. And therefore our Adversaries bringing this Citation out
of <hi>W. Dewsbery</hi>'s said <hi>Discovery of Man's Return,</hi> either to evince the
<hi>Venom of Quakerism</hi> (falsly charged) or our Insincerity or Opposition to
the Doctrine of <hi>Eternal Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. This shews our Adversaries
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58915:23"/>
Insincerity and great Ignorance of the Work of Repentance: The
<hi>Rector</hi> has need to be corrected in this as in many other weighty
Points, his Enmity appearing chiefly against the <hi>Light within,</hi> which
both manifests and Judges those things that are reproved in God's
sight; For can any be truly humbled unto Repentance, before they
are convicted, and know what Sins and Evils they are guilty of, and
chargeable for, in the sight of God, and of the Lamb Christ Jesus,
who is Judge both of the Living and of the Dead? Surely no: He
who is the Heart-searcher and Tryer of the Reines, and the very
Inward Affections; who sheweth unto Man what his Thoughts are,
will bring every Work to Judgment, with every secret thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Good or Evil; and if his Judgments do not take effect
upon Men in this Life, to humble them unto Repentance, his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judgment will be heavy upon them in that which is to come.
'Tis by the Spirit of <hi>Judgment and Burning</hi> that the Lord Purgeth his
People; and it is through Judgment that <hi>Sion</hi> is <hi>redeemed,</hi> and her
<hi>Converts,</hi> with <hi>Righteousness.</hi> And how plain is it, that <hi>W. Dewsbery</hi>'s
Testimony in this case, even as 'tis recited, respects the present <hi>Law,</hi>
               <hi>Light, Judgment</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of <hi>Christ in Man</hi>; and also cautions
Men of (and points at) the future <hi>Judgment, Wrath and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as that which <hi>will</hi> pass (in the future) upon the Rebellious, for
Disobedience, and breaking the Righteous Law: And both the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that comes upon Man here, and that which will come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
upon Man, for Disobedience and Rebellion against the Light
and Law of Christ in Man, it all proceeds from the presence of the
Lamb Christ Jesus, to whom all Judgment is committed, and Power
given to execute it.</p>
            <p>Awake, awake to Judgment, therefore, all you that are a-sleep in
Sin, that <hi>Mercy and Judgment may meet, and Righteousness and Peace
embrace each other</hi>; that being Judged as Men in the Flesh, you may
live according to God in the Spirit, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 4. 6. And all who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
desire after God, and to remember him in his ways, must
wait for him in the way of his Judgments, as his Servants of old did,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 8.</p>
            <p>And though this Adversary has added in the Citation <hi>[within thee]</hi>
after, <hi>the Throne of the Lamb</hi>; and after, <hi>the presence of the Lamb,</hi> he
adds <hi>[within thee]</hi>: And after, <hi>shalt give an Account for every idle Word,</hi>
he adds [i. e. <hi>to the Light within.</hi>] And, <hi>the Book will be opened in
thee,</hi> he puts, <hi>[IN THEE]</hi> in <hi>Capital Characters,</hi> as if it were a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58915:23"/>
Crime or Error to own the <hi>Lamb</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to have a <hi>Throne</hi> or Dominion
<hi>in Man,</hi> or the <hi>Light within</hi> to be Judge of every idle Word. Which
still bespeaks a secret <hi>Enmity</hi> against the <hi>Light,</hi> and as if the <hi>Light</hi>
were neither to Judge nor to Record Mens Actions in the Book of
Mens own Consciences; whereas the contrary is evident, if they
will search and examine their own Consciences, and be willing to
bring their Deeds to the Light <hi>in them</hi> that they may be manifest,
proved and Judged. For every one that doeth Truth, cometh to
the Light, and bringeth his Deeds to the Light, that They may
be manifest, that they are wrought in God, <hi>John</hi> 3. And 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that there is a <hi>Record</hi> made of Mens Iniquities, even in their
Hearts and Consciences by the true <hi>Light</hi>; as <hi>the Sin of</hi> Judah <hi>was
graven upon the Table of their Heart,</hi> Jer. 17. 1. And without true
<hi>Repentance</hi> it will not be blotted out of that <hi>Record,</hi> but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unto the Great Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and final Recompence of
Rewards, when the <hi>Books shall all be opened, and the Dead Judged
out of those things written in the Books, every Man according to their
Works,</hi> Rev. 20. So that the <hi>Judgment</hi> given, and the <hi>Record</hi> made
in Mens Consciences, by the true <hi>Light</hi> even in this Life, will not
wear out, nor be made void, but remain unto the <hi>Last Judgment</hi>
of the <hi>Great Day</hi> to come, to the great Joy of the Righteous, and
Shame, Contempt and Misery of the Wicked, and finally Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
who live and die in their <hi>Sins.</hi> As it is testified in <hi>Job</hi> 21. 30. That <hi>the Wicked is reserved to the Day of Destruction;
they shall be brought forth to the Day of Wrath.</hi> And Christ spoke
of such as would not receive his <hi>Ministers,</hi> nor hear their Words, <hi>Verily, I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah <hi>in the Day of Judgment, than for that City,</hi> Matt. 10. 15.
compare with Chap. 11. 22, 24. and <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 11. and <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 12, 14. All which signifie a <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> to come, <hi>And as
it is appointed unto Men once to die, but after this the Judgment,</hi>
Heb. 9. 27. As also the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Perdition</hi> of <hi>Ungodly Men,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 7. And also <hi>2 Pet.</hi>
2. 9. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of Temptations,
and to reserve the Unjust to the Day of Judgment to be punished.</hi> And
<hi>Jude</hi> v. 6. <hi>And the Angels, which kept not their first Estate (or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality)
but left their own Habitation, he hath reserved in Everlasting
Chains under Darkness, unto the Judgment of the Great Day</hi>: In which
<hi>Great Day</hi> it will fully appear, that the <hi>Judgment</hi> given, and the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58915:24"/>
               <hi>Record</hi> made in Mens Consciences by the <hi>Light,</hi> is true, and will
stand for ever against the Wicked, the willful Unbelievers and
finally Impenitent. And that there is no Opposition nor Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between the present Judgment of Christ in Mens Hearts and
Consciences, and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Soul of Man, though created, is Immortal, and never dies</hi>:
This we still believe and confess, and what the <hi>Rector</hi> quotes (as
he supposes) against it, out of <hi>G. F.</hi> his <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s
<hi>Brief Answer,</hi> p. 47. (if rightly considered and compared) will
not make void our <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Profession,</hi> which I have answered
and explained over and over; and so has <hi>W. P.</hi> by his Distinction
between the <hi>Breath</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> which God breathed into
Man, and <hi>Man</hi> himself, who thereby became a <hi>Living Soul</hi>: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is created, as well as <hi>Man</hi>; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the <hi>Being</hi> of Man, as the more Noble and Spiritual part,
<hi>inspired</hi> by the <hi>Divine Breath</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> whereby Man became
a <hi>Living Soul.</hi> And this <hi>Distinction</hi> is clearly implied in <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Great
Mystery,</hi> though unfairly quoted; What's more Explanatory, being
left out by this <hi>Adversary,</hi> and more fully answered in my afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Examination,</hi> Entituled, <hi>Truth and Innocency vindicated,</hi> &amp;c. against
the three <hi>Norfolk Priests,</hi> and <hi>Bugg,</hi> p. 7, 8, 9, 60.</p>
            <p>That we are <hi>Sincere</hi> in our <hi>Profession</hi> of Christianity, in what is
contained in our said <hi>little Pamphlet</hi> (as he calls it) entituled, <hi>The
Christianity of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> Asserted,</hi> we are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to our selves of the contrary, nor Convicted of any <hi>Insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi>
therein, by this <hi>Rector's,</hi> or any others Invidious Essays or
Attempts, nor from any <hi>Instances</hi> which either he or his Brethren,
or <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> have produced against us. Nor are we Conscious to
our selves of holding <hi>Tenets</hi> or <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which are either directly
opposite, or contradictory to these he calls <hi>New Creeds,</hi> if impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
cited, and truly explained, which they have not done in
their Invidious Endeavours against us, consequently we find no
cause to <hi>Retract, Censure</hi> or <hi>Condemn,</hi> the <hi>Tenets</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> which
we hold; and therefore his Charge of <hi>Horrid Blasphemies</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as an odious <hi>Calumny,</hi> proceeding from a Proud, Envious,
Persecuting Spirit, which the Lord will Rebuke! Neither has
he shewn from those <hi>Instances</hi> against us, any such <hi>Horrid Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:58915:24"/>
as he tells of; but rather his own <hi>Perversions, Ignorance</hi> and
<hi>Envy</hi>: The Lord deliver poor Souls from such <hi>Blind Guides,</hi> that
they may not fall into the <hi>Ditch</hi> with them! For some of their
<hi>Leaders,</hi> the <hi>Priests,</hi> especially those of them, that are of an <hi>Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
               <hi>Persecuting Spirit,</hi> are the most Blind and Ignorant of the <hi>Mystery</hi>
of Christ, and of those things which pertain to his Kingdom.</p>
