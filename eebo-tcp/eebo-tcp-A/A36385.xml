         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

but Gods <hi>Miniſters,</hi> his peculiar ſubſtitutes.</p>
            <p>All power is from God, I willingly acknowledge, by

               </gap>. The King (ſaith he) is
the trueſt and livelieſt reflex or image of God upon
earth that may be; <hi>Humani Ioves,</hi> as the Latine Comoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
ſpeaking of ſuch perſons in a ſtraine beyond
them both. And ſurely for this reaſon particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other (in my poore fancie) is that very title
above mentioned of being called Gods beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, to wit in regard of their dominion and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignetie
over the reſt, which they ſtill retaine as a
maine Relique as it were of that Gods image at firſt
ſtampt, and engraven upon the ſoule of man. Now as' I
ſaid, againſt this Soveraigne power nevertheleſſe be
theſe armes lifted up: a power ſo ſacred, it ſeemes, as
not to be touched or but roughly medled with; ſince
<hi>Touch not mine annointed</hi> (not the chiefe then be ſure)
is the interdictive expreſſe caution of the Almightie;
<hi>David</hi> thus did but touch <hi>Saul</hi> by cutting off the skirt
of his garment, and we ſee how his heart ſmote him
ſtreight; in as much, as, <hi>who can ſtretch forth his hand</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>againſt the Lords annointed, and be guiltleſſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For however to colour and diſguiſe the buſineſſe,
the King hath been all along pretended to theſe harſh
unuſuall proceedings of late, as if what were done,
were not againſt him but for him, yet is this in truth
ſuch a ſtrange peece of ſtate-Sophiſtry, that men,
though of meane capacitie cannot I ſuppoſe at laſt but
diſcerne eaſily and ſee through it; <hi>Nuga &amp; quiſquiliae,</hi>
unleſſe they can poſſibly ſhew <hi>pro &amp; con: with and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,</hi>
termes ſo widely oppoſite to be one and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94185:4"/>
ſame, which yet will neither good Logick admit in
the former, nor ſcripture phraſe acknowledge in the
latter: That ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matrimoniall union, <hi>Quos Deus iunxit nemo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>
is in a good ſenſe if read backwards appliable to
the preſent divisions, <hi>Q. D. S. N. jung:</hi> whom God in his
ſecret diſpleaſure, as here, hath a while really divided
&amp; ſet at diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, let none go about in purſuance of their
cloſe unjuſtifiable deſignes by bare and emptie termes
to ioyne together. You ſay you are for the King, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
him to every act, the King ſaith no, diſclaimes it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,

may we in reaſon rather beleeve? eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thoſe groſſe &amp; monſtrous inconſequences which
follow hereupon, as that thereby he is made to ſet
forth Edicts, levie monies, wage war, and all againſt
himſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is true (<hi>I</hi> confeſſe) in ſome caſes, as where the
Prince is a Minor and under age; or where he is not
<hi>compos ſui</hi> through weakneſſe of his intellectualls, this
may well hold, and the ſeeming contradiction be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloſed up: The reaſon is, for that there the party is
not Maſter of his own actions, nor can he, in a legall
conſideration be reckoned amongſt thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
whether in Art, or Nature, which move of themſelves,
but as one rather who is moved from without. There
both law and equitie juſtly commit ſuch a one to the
tuition and guidance of another. But where there rules
a iudicious and diſcerning Prince, able to ſteere by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94185:4"/>
the conduct of his own reaſon, there to plead your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him, and yet goe croſſe to his commands, is
ſuch a fine peece of artifice, as may ſerve perchance to
enſnare the ſimple, but withall occaſion the wiſe to
ſmile.</p>
            <p>If it be here replied (as ſome have done) that this
<hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of theirs is meerely againſt the King his
<hi>Private,</hi> not his <hi>Publique,</hi> his <hi>Perſonall,</hi> not his <hi>Royall</hi>
commands (for as ſo, ſay they, he muſt be ſuppoſed
alwaies to ſpeak in the voice of his Parliament, or elſe
that of the law.) A poore ſhift, when as they are faine
to ſhape on this manner their evaſions at the Romiſh
forge; for thus deale they, labouring by a like art of
Sophiſtrie to ſet up Monarchicall government in the
Church, as theſe endeavour to pull it downe in the
Commonwealth. To this end have they divided (who
knowes not?) the Pope even from himſelf, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
him as he is a Man, &amp; as he is Pope; As hee is a
private man, ſay they, he may erre, but as he is Pope
and ſitting in the chaire, he is infallible. Such cob-web
thin-ſpun diſtinctions as theſe, I have ever thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for ſpeculative diſputes, then at any hand to bee
drawne into outward practiſe. They carry ſomewhat
with them, the ſound, but are altogether void of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
Otherwiſe by the ſame rule I might ſlay my
brother, not apprehending him as one of <hi>Adams</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie,
as my ſelfe am, but under the common notion
of ſome ſenſitive kinde of creature, or ſay Ile rob him
of his ſubſtance, not conceiving of him as my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but as of ſome profeſſed enemie: And yet againe
when or where will they be able, I mervaile, to finde
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94185:5"/>
the King on this wiſe diveſted of a Royall influence
into all commands of ſtate, not repugnant to the lawes
already being? Or moreover not alike ſtil, whether pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in his Throne or out of it, repreſentative of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
perſon: Theſe are nicities that require a ray or
two of further illuſtration from them.</p>
            <p>Be it further urged, that notwithſtanding this their
reſiſtance to his commands, yet they love and honour
his perſon, as in duty they are bound to doe. Not ſo
certainely neither; I am ſure our Saviour, <hi>Io.</hi> 5. 15. tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
another doctrine, <hi>If yee love me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>keep my
Commandements.</hi> Mark the conſequence: and <hi>Iehu,</hi>
2. <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 30. about to deſtroy wicked <hi>Iezabel who is
on my ſide,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who?</hi> and immediatly wee finde his
commands fulfilled, <hi>V.</hi> 13. True love towards our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
ever begets an inward obedience or ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſoule, &amp; obedience ſtraight breaks forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
outward performances. <hi>Obedientia</hi> according to the
Etymologie quaſi <hi>Obaudientia:</hi> The word imports a
willingneſſe of hearkning and ready ſubmitting our
ſelves to the commands of our Superiours. In briefe
it is our duty not over haſtily to diſpute, but obey
their Mandates: otherwiſe of ſubjects wee become
Iudges both of them and their actions.</p>
            <p>Being thus driven from either of thoſe two former
holds, they betake themſelves for refuge to a third,
and that indeed the weakeſt. We have not taken up
armes plead they, againſt the King, but againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
and evill Councell which is about him. Here
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94185:5"/>
I cannot but remember the manner of certaine Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
or Swaſh-bucklers in <hi>Rome,</hi> anciently called the
<hi>Retiarti,</hi> whoſe faſhion it was in fight, when as preſſing
eagerly upon the adverſary, and endeavouring to caſt
their net (wherewith they were fitted for the purpoſe)
upon him, that ſo they might entangle him, to crie <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcem
peto, non tepeto,</hi> I make at the fiſh (a fiſh it ſeemes
there being engraven on the others helmet) and not at
thee. So theſe men, they pretend a war againſt the
<hi>Malignants,</hi> but they purſue the King; yet doth not the
King write them friends whom they terme Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants?
Doth he not owne and uphold them in their
proceedings? So as their being againſt them, argues
manifeſtly their being againſt him. It is a Goſpell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 40. <hi>For in as much as yee have done it

            <p>This was the firſt conſideration I made chice of to

to his crowne by virtue of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> a King,
as <hi>I</hi> may ſay, <hi>natus, non factus,</hi> borne ſo, not made; what
the difference in this eaſe may be, as touching the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie
of intereſt or right to their dominions, between
an <hi>Elective</hi> and <hi>Hereditary</hi> King, (this for certaine

only as willing upon all true juſt grounds, to improve
that dutie and loyall reſpect in the mindes of reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſomewhat ſurely (at leaſtwiſe the Poet thought it ſo)
that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> doth ſo boaſt of the antiquitie and

            <p>Thrice happy we of this nation, if we rightly knew

thus much, that men ſhould purſue and haſten
after it, like as they doe for the prize in ſome race
or game of contention, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in ſome ſuch
ſenſe ofttimes in <hi>Homer.</hi> Now hath not the King
been thus zealous for the peace of our <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi>
Hath not he likewiſe (though in vaine) thus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
and haſted after it? Witneſſe the manie over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or rather entreaties for peace made by him:
And all this really, unfainedly; not diſſemblingly,
or under a vizard, as thoſe of <hi>Davids</hi> enemies, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
therefore he deſervedly complained of, that <hi>whilst

7. Had others been as forward as he, to imbrace
termes of peace, to tread in that <hi>viâ lacteâ,</hi> wee had
ere this (my conſcience gives me) all cloſed in a
peacefull end: yet no mervaile in it, for a peacefull
ſonne to proceed out of the loynes of a peacefull
father; His <hi>Motto</hi> was <hi>Pacificus;</hi> neither doth our
Soveraigne (I confidently beleeve it) deſire rather
to have his browes encircled about with the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
of victory, then of peace and concord with his
people.</p>
            <p>The fifth conſideration ſhall be, whether theſe
armes ſo taken up, be <hi>Offenſive,</hi> or <hi>Defenſive,</hi> Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
(ſay they) and will not be perſwaded to the
contrary; There is the maine <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the buſineſſe
with them, a ſpeciall point indeed; let us a litle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94185:8"/>
it; Civilians teach us that a <hi>Defenſive</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is, when as the Defendant is no way the
cauſe or occaſion of the conflict, by ſome kinde of
former provocation, and then afterwards in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Act, he doth but <hi>propulſare injuriam,</hi> ſtands
meerly upon his guard as <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>twere, ayming rather at
his own ſafetie, then the others ruine; In a word
neither provokes, nor purſues his enemie. This is
the nature of a true defenſive reſiſtance, Otherwiſe
ſuppoſe I kill a man, to ſay I did it in mine owne
defence, having yet provoked, purſued, and then
aſſaulted him, would prove, I feare me, but a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
kinde of plea, even at the barre of <hi>Common ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
The caſe comes neerly home to our purpoſe,
for be it examined on Gods name with an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
judgement, and let not <hi>Actions</hi> ſo apparently
done in the face and eye of the world be either
groſſely denied, or cunningly ſhifted off. Who firſt
miniſtred the occaſion of this unnaturall war, by
<hi>tumults and ſeditious riots,</hi> in the open ſtreets? Next,
who firſt drew ſword, &amp; gave the <hi>onſet,</hi> as it were,
thus putting fire to the fuell now prepared and
laid together? Who laſtly hath ever ſince moſt
hotly <hi>Purſued</hi> and followed the buſineſſe at firſt ſo
unfortunately begun? The King all this while al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
ſueing and intreating for peace, if ſo peace
might have been obtained upon faire and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
termes conſiſtent with Majeſtie: what town
or ſort at the beginning did, or at leaſt needed to
have feared his entrance? Nay, what Towne or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94185:8"/>
fort may yet juſtly feare it, if as they have unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
taken up armes, ſo in acknowledgment of
their error; they ſhall ſubmit, &amp; peaceably lay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
down—<hi>Civilia bella—Vna acies patitur gerit Altera,</hi>
All the <hi>offenſiveneſſe</hi> I can deſcry in the King
as touching the whole matter is, that being at
length enforced thereto, he would not ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and his good ſubjects to be overborne with a
tempeſt, and not make head againſt it: If this be it
he is cenſured for, it calls to minde that ſtory of
him, who having firſt ſmitten his neighbour with
his fiſt, afterwards ſueth him, becauſe his head was
hard and hurt his hand: Paſſion, ſay Philoſophers,
in any ſubject is not without ſome manner of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi>
joyned to it: nor can we defend our ſelves
but it is moſt likely we ſhall in ſome ſort or other
offend the aſſaylant. But the nature (as I ſaid) of a
ſimply <hi>Defenſive reſistance,</hi> is to be tried at the teſt
of the premiſed circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, it will be worth our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to examine upon what <hi>Grounds</hi> theſe armes
be lifted up; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is an axiome in ſtate policie, and
ever hath been, that better to connive at and ſuffer
ſome inconveniences in a Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
then to expoſe either to the manifold dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Alteration. And one of their own outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
Doctors in a Tract of his upon the like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(though pleading for <hi>Reſiſtance</hi>) yet layes it
downe for a principle or ſure Maxime without all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94185:9"/>
peradventure: I muſt confeſſe mine owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as not having <hi>Lynceus</hi> his eyes about mee;
and therefore deſire to be informed by others,
whereupon this ſo urgent neceſſitie of a civill war
may be thought to have been grounded; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
I ſhall eaſily be induced to beleeve, that with
him in the hiſtory, they doe but purſue their owne
<hi>Shadowes,</hi> or ſhoot at a mark which themſelves
through the errour of their weake fancies have ſet
up. Is it for matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> as it was maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the beſt and pureſt times of a Reformation.
The King hath promiſed it, himſelfe doth practiſe
it, and I heartily wiſh the beſt of his ill-affected
ſubjects were but herein followers of his good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Is it for the <hi>Libertie</hi> and freedome of our
perſons? The King hath likewiſe paſſed his word
upon it; Is it for a <hi>Property</hi> in our goods and eſtates
to be enjoyed by us according to the eſtabliſhed
wholſome lawes of the kingdome? I muſt returne
the ſame anſwer. For what then? <hi>Davus ſum, non

would be pleaſed to help me out; where there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres

nor yet of our <hi>Eſtates</hi> to be invaded or tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
upon (as neither can the Maſter Architects
of theſe miſerable diſtractions, I ſuppoſe, though
having artificially perſwaded others, fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

armes, you may if you pleaſe, ſtile it a juſt <hi>Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94185:9"/>
but what terme it deſerves of right, let the
world judge.</p>
            <p>Beſides then the groundles <hi>ſurmiſes, feares</hi> &amp; <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies</hi>
of certaine Melancholy overworking heads,
as may be well imagined, ſince, <hi>Prona eſt timori ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in pejus fides.</hi> And thoſe too many of them, it is
to be thought, like falſe fires, raiſed of purpoſe, by
the induſtry of cunning projectors, only to amuze
the ſimpler people: no other ground or reaſon can
I finde of theſe publique commotions, unleſſe
what remaineth, it may be the <hi>diſtemper'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ambition</hi> of ſome particular perſon; I bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
none with this heavie charge; But ſo it is in
the generall, that men of diſcontented humours, or
otherwiſe ambitiouſly diſpoſed had at all times
rather hazard the common peace and ſafetie of the
whole, then fayle of their propoſed private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes;
<hi>Publicis incendiis patriae clareſcere,</hi> as he ſpeaks
hath alwaies been more for encouragement then a
ſtop to the proceedings of ſuch kinde of ſpirits;
chiefly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>need &amp; a decayednes</hi> of fortune, help to
ſharpen and whet on this froward ambitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of theirs; And as there; ſo likewiſe is it
where men have caſually <hi>embarqued themſelves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
into great affaires, then that they are able with
ſafety to come off; There they ſtagger and faulter
up and downe, as much uncertain what courſe to
take, yet ſtill make onwards, and rather then periſh
alone, deſperately put all into a generall confuſion:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94185:10"/>
with <hi>Sampſon</hi> taking his laſt Revenge againſt the
<hi>Philiſtines,</hi> they pull down the houſe, though neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
it fall upon their own heads, cauſing thus the
guiltleſſe ruine of a whole Nation oftimes to wait
upon the Herſe of their deſerved overthrow.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this the King, ſay they, for
certaine, hath formerly tran<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

by declining from the manifeſt and knowne
<hi>Rules</hi> of the Law. I will not here argue the juſt <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi>
of Kings, what they may happily chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to themſelves, either <hi>praeter</hi> or <hi>ſup<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>a,</hi> beſides
or above the law. This would be cenſured ſtreight
(ſuch is the malitious wit of jealouſie) as a plea
made for the eſtabliſhment of an <hi>Arbitrary Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
yet ſo Machiavell may teach, or his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
perchance, but not I: Thus much only then I
ſhall ſay in this matter; What ere priviledges the
Prince is poſſeſſed of, whether derived unto him
by cuſtome, or as grounded upon the law it ſelf, <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vore
amplianda ſunt,</hi> is an authentique ſaying bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from Canoniſts; They ought of right rather
to bee improved, then any way diminiſhed by us;
without any curb or bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds at all impoſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law
to regulate them by, did Kings (we find) anciently
and in thoſe heroick purer times of the world
(thence rightly termed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with
the like) governe the people ſubjected to them.
But and this farther: There can be no ſtate ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
framed &amp; compoſed according to the rule of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94185:10"/>
law, but that it will require ſome kinde of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
diſpenſative power left in the hands of the
ſupreame Magiſtrate; Since the law is generall,
nor can it therefore poſſibly extend to a through
determination of all particulars: And in ſuch a
caſe I had rather (if I needs muſt) be under the
power &amp; governance of one, then of many. Eaſier
was it for <hi>Athens</hi> to ſuffer the Arbitrarie dominion
of one Tyrant, then as they did a while, of Thirty:
and for <hi>Rome</hi> upon emergent occaſions the <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip,</hi>
or abſolute government of a ſingle Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
then that of the <hi>Decemviri.</hi> It is confeſt that
where the way is plaine and open, no obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or difficulties to hinder, there for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratet
o walk <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Philoſopher preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
is the ſafeſt courſe: But this cannot alwaies
be, I preſume, in the beſt Commonwealth, though
never ſo well ordered by the ſquare and advice of
the wiſeſt Lawgiver.</p>
            <p>And now for their objection more particularly.
Grant the King hath heretofore ſomewhat ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the knowne <hi>Dictates</hi> of the law (yet not
to that height, neither will themſelves ſay, as either
of Tyrannie, or groſſe Idolatry, howbeit the onely
juſt cauſes of <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> doubtleſſe, were there any
juſt) what? finde we not <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the
beſt and wiſeſt of Kings to have digreſſed oftimes
into ſundry by-paths of ſin, and errour from the
law of God, even to the higheſt pitch? Take in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94185:11"/>
               <hi>Ahab, Manaſſes,</hi> with others of the worſer ſort (nor
yet queſtioned thereupon by their ſubjects ſtreight
for their fowle and truly inſufferable miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in point of Regall government; yet were they
as ſtrictly bound by ſolemne covenant, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and Man, entred into at their ſeverall
inaugurations, to a performance of certaine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as Kings at preſent be; nor doe we general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
finde Gods Prieſts and Prophets then, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſole interpreters of his hidden pleaſure, upon
any termes what ere freeing the people in the leaſt
degree from that indiſſoluble tye of their duty and
ſubjection to their lawfull Soveraigne: unleſſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally,
by virtue of ſome particular <hi>Expreſſe,</hi> or
other from the very mouth of the Almightie, as it
happened in <hi>Jehues</hi> caſe riſing up againſt <hi>Ioram.</hi>
2. <hi>Kings</hi> 9. or in that of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> doing the like by
his Liege Lord, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 11. which with the like
extraordinary and immediate commands from
God (unuſuall for theſe times) our <hi>Enthuſiaſtis</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
will not, I hope, in modeſty offer to pretend
to in their preſent undertakings.</p>
            <p>And ſay, muſt Princes then be brought upon
the ſtage, and ſubjected to the danger of being <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisted</hi>
by the people, upon a ſuppoſall of every ſlip
or petty errour committed by them? Princes (they
may be pleaſed to know) as they are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or
<hi>Patres familiarum,</hi> as was ſaid before, ſo have they
a large family to governe and ſuperviſe. Adde
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94185:11"/>
hereto the many intricate and perplext myſteries,
thoſe <hi>Arcana imperii,</hi> which they have to deale
with in the management of the Sate; ſo as they ſee
not alwaies what they doe (neither can they) but
by other mens eyes, nor heare they, but by the
eares of others, but are forced to uſe the ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
help and aſſiſtance of their Miniſters. Can

and that the old pernicious ſtratagem of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

It hath already thus befallen the <hi>Miniſtry</hi>
in their kind, moſt of the conformable worthyer
ſort of them in all places, being thereupon, and for
no other reaſon commonly, ſtrangely Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phized,
through a wrong interpretation, into a new

know in what? why thus, as farre as my weake ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
will carry me. The King is not pleaſed
to grant whatſoever is demanded of him though
never ſo unreaſonable, <hi>ergo</hi> he is <hi>miſled;</hi> Becauſe
His Majeſty will not yield to an hockſing and

predeceſſours: To a new moulding of the ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Venetian platforme:</hi> To a new building of

breife to the creating of a new <hi>Heaven and a new
Earth</hi> here amongſt us, that is a new Church and
a new Commonwealth, he is miſled, he is ſeduced
by wicked Counſell.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme and <hi>totall</hi> of the buſineſſe, as
farre as I can underſtand, or if there be more in it,
I wiſh it may be made appeare, and the mindes of
the moderater ſort of people thereby better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
Neither yet would I be ſo underſtood in
theſe laſt paſſages, as if I deſired that matters whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Church or Common wealth ſhould altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtand as they have done, unmoved, unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
Not ſo perchance, (albeit this be a poynt
without the retch of my deciſion,) ſince what
Church or State was ever knowne to have long
continued free from the creeping in of ſundry
pernicious and deſtructive abuſes. Like as ſome
garden or other, we ſee how it becomes overgrown
with weeds ſtreight, if not carefully and often
looked to or as the body which quickly ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with noxious humors, unleſſe now &amp; then
it be cleanſed by wholſome phyſick. But there is,
I conceive, a wide difference to be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a
<hi>reforming</hi> of what is amiſſe in either, and
the abſolute <hi>transforming</hi> the whole into a new
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94185:14"/>
ſhape; betwixt pruneing or lopping off the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcencies
of ſome over luxuriant vine, and a quite
digging of it up by the rootes; This is deſtructive,
that uſefull, the former may well be tolerated, nay
is ſome times very requiſite. But it is this latter
which ſober underſtanding men do ſo abominate,
whereby not only the <hi>old and ſoure leavin</hi> is to be
purged forth,, as Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell is, but both
batch and <hi>laevin,</hi> are in danger to be done away
together;</p>
            <p>And now a little to recollect in one thoſe ſhort
imperfect conſiderations, which have hitherto
beene deliverd upon this argument, as 'twere ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together the diſperſed handfulls, and
making them up into one entire bundle. Here is
you ſee a <hi>Warre</hi> continued, a cruell bloudy Warre,
this too againſt the <hi>King</hi> without queſtion; yet
this King an <hi>hareditary,</hi> a <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>peacefull</hi> King;
withall the armes taken up and uſed in this warre,
they are not, as it is pretended <hi>defenſive,</hi> but <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
plainely; then laſtly upon what occaſion or

to the full: and as for the future there's
none imaginable, unleſſe the <hi>bare furmiſes</hi> and <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies</hi>

            <p>I have done with the firſt branch of my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

I ſhall not ſay much of them: I love

things above us deſerve rather to be reverenced

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94185:15"/>
I may ſafely ſay, and without offence, I Imagine,
that the wiſeſt <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in this kind that may be,
cannot amongſt the reſt of their priviledges what
ere challenge to themſelves a priviledge of being
altogether free from errors and miſtakes. It hath
beene ſo in the graveſt Councells of the Church
as hitherto; (<hi>true Councells indeed,</hi> and thoſe truely
and legally ſummoned together) one ſolely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and that the firſt, wherein the holy Ghoſt
after a more immediate manner did ſit at ſterne,
moderateing and directing their preſent conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
To pretend either here or there to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
infallibility would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

arrogancy: yet a blemiſh which neither the Lay
nor Eccleſiaſticke part of this Kingdome will be
willing I hope, in any conſiderable number to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
themſelues much guilty of.</p>
            <p>Againe we find in Councells how there hath
ſwayed oftimes a <hi>prevailing faction or party:</hi> ſo as
they deſerved not ſo much to have beene termed
<hi>Concilia,</hi> as <hi>Conciliabula,</hi> rather Conventicles then
lawfull aſſemblies, and accordingly the reſult of
their conſultations hath uſually taſted ſtrong of
the prevailing ſide: nay, we have heard of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
or Synods, that for a great part there ſitting,
in the firſt choice or conſtitution of them, have
not alwayes beene, 'twas thought, ſo <hi>impartially</hi>
aſſigned to the place, as not conſiſting of the beſt,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94185:16"/>
the ableſt, and every way fitteſt for the worke that
might be found: witneſſe the many examples of
Councells both ancient and <hi>moderne</hi> too, which
might be called upon in atteſtation of theſe truths;
I apply not the one, nor the other: but this I may
perhaps inoffenſively ſay: what hath often happen
ed to a <hi>Councell,</hi> may at ſome time be fall a <hi>Senate:</hi>
thoſe of the ſhort robe are not more exempted
then thoſe of the long; Howbeit I wave the point,
with a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there, wiſhing, though no wayes
hoping, all to be well.</p>
            <p>Yet one thing more, which I had almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
&amp; it is this; what power ſoever the <hi>repreſentative</hi>
body hath at beſt, queſtionleſſe it hath it from the
body at large, the people; As the ſunbeames con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into the narrow concave of ſome burning
glaſſe, they are the ſame with the beames in open
aire, though ſome what more vigorous and active
by reaſon of this contraction; not boundleſſe or
uncontrouleable can ſuch a power then be, for
that were more then the people have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under any capacity, as being Subjects ſtill.
And <hi>nihill dat quod non habet,</hi> is a maxime in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
as true, as common; ſhould the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the bequeathing of ſuch an unlimited
power, as our Saviour beſpake the two bretheren

the ſcope it was intended for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I gave my

1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 15. To talke of a <hi>coordination</hi> hereof the
three eſtates (as ſome have wiſely done) making
the King one of them, (who yet indeed is none, but
properly and truly (will the learned in Law ſoone
tell us) head of thoſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lords ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
temporell,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> of this land, according
to the ancient uſage and contrivance heretofore of
Parliaments.) But grant it were as they would have
it, to talke I ſay, of a <hi>coordination</hi> of the 3 eſtates in
this caſe, were in effect, beſides other abſurdities
following thereupon, (if the reſult be throughly
lookt into) to conſtitute a ſupreame without infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
a King for the time not having Subjects; the
people all of them (as it muſt needes follow) being
implicitly involved under the other two; How
much better would a ſoft complyable motion do
betwixt the <hi>three,</hi> and forward the diſpatch of
buſineſſes moſt effectually: It ſhould be like that
motion in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion <hi>rota in rota;</hi>
or as of the ſphaeres above, which move one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94185:17"/>
another. That croſſe contrariant motion of the
neather ſphaeres to the firſt <hi>moveable,</hi> we know how
it begets a ſlowneſſe or tardity in them of their
proper and naturall proceſſion; and we ſee by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
experience what a ſtop, if not a <hi>retrograde</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of civill affaires, the claſhing or banding
of one power againſt the other hath wrought of
late in this miſerably diſtracted Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>But falling downe, as I was about, to a lower
pin, let us next conſider the people in a diſgrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſence or notion: thoſe who hitherto upon all
occaſions have ſo firmely every where (whether
voluntarily or <hi>invited</hi> to it, I meddle not) adhaered
as a ſtrong ſupport to the <hi>higher powers;</hi> I meane
not here to enter the liſts of a particular compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
by poyſing man with man, perſon with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
on either ſide; but as we may find divers of
good note (be it confeſſed) on that part, ſo are
there many more, let me ſay it, on this: If <hi>Saul
hath ſlaine his thouſands, David</hi> can boaſt of his <hi>ten
thouſands:</hi> The muſter <hi>rolle</hi> if lookt over would
better determine this Quaere, then I can; well may
they confide and reſt themſelves upon the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the vulgar ſort who (beſides their naturall
proneneſſe towards Innovations ever) as moſt an
end they underſtand but little, ſo are they eaſilieſt
ſeduced, and engaged in prepoſterous undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
But for thoſe of better ranke, ſuch as be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94185:17"/>
knowing, or otherwiſe of more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
qualitie, here they muſt needs acknowledge
themſelves to be upon termes of diſadvantage;
Some hereupon I have heard to terme this warre
with reference to the oppoſite ſide, as that of old,
<hi>Bellum Ruſticum,</hi> the Helio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s or the Peſants warre.
And queſtionleſſe it is ſome encouragement when
as it chanceth thus, we excel not only in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the cauſe, but likewiſe in the worthineſſe
of the abettors. But paſſing by what ere other ſorts
of Men in their ſeverall ranks and ſtations as they
might be ſummoned up, let us in our paſſage touch
at the <hi>Divine.</hi> Can they ſhew mee any of their
chiefe Scribes or Teachers (take him forth of the
higheſt claſſis with them) that may be thought in
point of ſound and deep knowledge an equall
March for divers but of the ſecond or third here:
Yet is <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> (the center namely whereunto
this whole diſcourſe doth bend it ſelfe) not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a point of State-policie, but of <hi>Conſcience</hi> alſo, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the higheſt degree: and being ſo, who
ſo fit to direct the conſcience, as is the <hi>Divine,</hi> and
of Divines the learnedſt, the beſt able?</p>
            <p>Next take but into conſideration the zeale, or
rather the <hi>fury</hi> of many of their chiefe <hi>Miniſters</hi> or
<hi>Agents</hi> in theſe affaires; Religion is pretended, but
certainly Malice acts the buſineſſe: or if it be zeale,
it is a zeale I feare <hi>ſet on fire</hi> by a coale from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94185:18"/>
Thoſe who have felt their ſcourge can beſt
judge of it, and had rather, I beleeve, fall into the
hands (if they needs muſt) of ſome unbeleeving
Iſmaelite, then of a too too beleeving Zelot: No
ſpleene or bitterneſſe of ſpirit like that of your hot
<hi>Profeſſour;</hi> none more cruell, becauſe he perſecutes
&amp; wrongs his neighbour, yet thinks he does God
good ſervicein doing ſo; <hi>Paul</hi> was not more <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in the waies of truth &amp; ſinceritie, then he
was <hi>Saul</hi> before, a fierce &amp; eager perſecuter of the
Church; Such was the bitter rage or fury of the
<hi>Circumcelliones</hi> or preciſer ſort of <hi>Donatiſts</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
againſt their diſſenting, yet orthodoxe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the <hi>African</hi> Church, as ſundry of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
make mention, not without their deſerved
cenſures thereupon: Although they be not all
<hi>Saints</hi> neither I conceive, who appeare on that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.

Fourthly, obſerve their manner of proceeding
in furthe: ance of the publique cauſe, what by <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
by falſifying,</hi> &amp; then impoſing their falſhoods
upon the world; The preſſe with them of late hath
been ſo inured to this <hi>Cretian</hi> Dialect; that there is
queſtion, when or whether happily it may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
recover its ancient guiſe of ſpeaking truth:
Newes of <hi>Plots</hi> and dangerous <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> one
while (thoſe too moſt an end ſtrained to a very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
height of <hi>Panick</hi> affrightments) which
yet as hitherto, God be thanked, neither wee nor
they have felt, nor had at firſt, it may be, much
cauſe to feare; Newes of ſome <hi>Notable victorie,</hi> or
other atchieved every day. yet as it hath proved
afterwards got ofttimes (if not by <hi>Treachery</hi>) then
in a dreame, without a battle. <hi>Lying wonders,</hi> I have
often read of, but not of Lying Victories till now.
Newes of <hi>Popery and Popiſh Ceremonies</hi> begun of
late to be ſet up, and countenanced in ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
A fiction, in truth, well befitting the Popiſh
<hi>Legend,</hi> and thither I commend it; what may wee
thinke of theſe men, with their <hi>Mountebansk-like</hi>
devices, who under a maſque of pretended zeale,
thus ſhamefully trade in falſhoods (all to cheere
up their poore deluded followers, and keepe them
ſtill in heart) but that even their <hi>profeſſion</hi> it ſelfe is
but a kinde of lye or grand impoſture. Nor can
they therefore, if they marke it well, ſo ſafely taxe
their adverſaries, as they doe, with thoſe haynous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94185:19"/>
crimes of <hi>ſwearing</hi> &amp; <hi>prophaneſſe,</hi> ſince <hi>Lying</hi> &amp; <hi>Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
are ſinnes ſurely neere allyed, and yet lying
too (it may ſeem) carries a more immediate relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Satan</hi> the author of all ſinne, who for this, is
expreſſely entitled the <hi>Father of lyes. Io.</hi> 15. 44.</p>
            <p>Vnto this moreover note in the fifth place their
bitter <hi>Raylings and invectives</hi> uſually againſt
Church and State, which is another by-path they
uſe to tread in, thereby labouring to ſtick an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leble
character of diſgrace upon the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in either; Ere while the <hi>Biſhops Miter</hi>
ſhrewdly troubled them, and now the neerer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt

new <hi>State Pilots.</hi> (Not the faults of either, it may
be giving ſo much offence, as the eminency of
their places.) Now the <hi>Prelates,</hi> then the <hi>Statists.</hi>
What can I ſay more or leſſe concerning this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
barking humour of theirs, but this, the <hi>Lord
rebuke them?</hi> Eſpecially for ſome among them, and
thoſe of the <hi>Leviticall Tribe</hi> too, the <hi>Firebrands</hi> and
chiefe Incendiaries, to ſpeake truth, in theſe bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
diſturbances. Thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

them on by their powerfully deluſive perſwaſions,
like ſillie <hi>Sheep</hi> as they are (almoſt without the help
of a Metaphor) into daily ſlaughters, and unleſſe
God of his mercy ſhall pleaſe to intercede, certaine
deſtruction at once) (I feare) both of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
If then what Philoſophie hath taught us, the
end may be gueſſed at by the <hi>Meanes</hi> conducent
thereunto, for that the meanes and end be wonted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Inter ſe commenſurabilia,</hi> as they ſay, and do each
anſwer one another I know not how I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or hope well of the end in this caſe, where I
ſee the meanes to be ſo foule and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, let it be laid to heart the many <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
Miſeries,</hi> which theſe unhappie differences
inſteed of a redreſſe of ſome former ſufferings
have brought upon us; Quite contrary, as it were
<hi>ex Profeſſo,</hi> to what we had reaſon to expect: the
Remedy as hitherto proving much worſe, then the
diſeaſe was. Loſſe in the <hi>Libertie of our Perſons.</hi> For
as now what man can be ſecurely ſafe in any place?
And which is the trueſt Symptome (as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
ſome where tells us) of a people or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
running further into ſlavery, wee groane and
complaine under the burthen, as ſenſible of it, and
yet <hi>Contend</hi> not againſt it with an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94185:20"/>
as it were benummed in our Reſolutions.
Loſſe in the <hi>property of our goods.</hi> For as times are,
<hi>Ius omne in ferro eſt,</hi> not the Law but the Sword is
made the Maſter of our eſtates. To ſpeak nothing
of the new <hi>Aegyptian</hi> burdens or taxes beyond all
ſufferance daily encreaſing upon us. Loſſe in the
<hi>purity of our Religion.</hi> So many brainleſſe impious
poſitions are crept in, which like that <hi>Abomination
of Deſolation</hi> ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi>
9. 27. have greatly polluted the houſe of God.
Great care of late hath there beene taken for the
ſuppreſſion and avoidance of <hi>Poperie,</hi> and 'tis well,
if ſo it end not (which yet may be feared) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

fancy, will needs be a rule unto it ſelfe. And
how far this irregularity may chance to proceed is
hard to determine, ſince <hi>Conſcience</hi> not ballanced
with a ſound judgement is commonly boundleſſe,
and never ceaſeth till it ſhut up its progreſſe in a
plaine phrenſie; I remember to this effect a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
paſſage in that ſtorie of thoſe mad <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
of Munſter</hi> in <hi>Germanie.</hi> They began at firſt
upon pretence of reforming ſomewhat amiſſe in
<hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, about certaine few Articles

of the then preſent <hi>Liturgie.</hi> That would not ſerve

<hi>Bibel, Bubel, Babel;</hi> A Scheme much like to that in
the old Poet, <hi>Titi, Tute, Tati, Tibi, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now againe, as before, let us put the premiſes
together; The <hi>Infallibilitie,</hi> as hath been argued of
the greateſt aſſemblies, The <hi>Partialitie</hi> ofttimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
in ſome, the bounded and circumſcribed
<hi>Limitedneſſe</hi> of all, the fuller concurrence of <hi>able
Perſonages</hi> on this ſide; the <hi>prepoſterous indirect waies
of proceeding</hi> by the fomenters, and other Agents
on that; the <hi>inexpreſſible calamities,</hi> which have and
are like to fall upon us in liew of an hoped for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Joyne hereto as a cloſe of the reſt, that
which yet indeed fills up the <hi>Ephath</hi> of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
full, the bringing in of a <hi>forraigne power:</hi> As
if the fire of diſſention our ſelves had kindled,
were not ſpeedy enough to conſume a State, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<hi>Others</hi> from abroad be ſolemnly invited, and
drawne in, under pretence of quenching the
flames, to pull downe the <hi>Houſe.</hi> And the ſcale me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
ſeemes ſtill and ſtill to weigh downe lower:
the Kings cauſe more cleared, and the peoples
more liable to juſt miſpriſion.</p>
            <p>Thus have I in ſhort drawne forth, as 'twere, a
true <hi>Coppy</hi> of the buſineſſe, as it ſtands <hi>de facto</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94185:21"/>
the King, and ſome of his people. Should I now
put from ſhore a litle, and goe on further from the
<hi>Theſis</hi> to the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> from the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a probleme, as whether ſuppoſing the King
were <hi>truly miſled,</hi> and that he did notably <hi>fayle</hi> the
truſt repoſed in him, whether in ſuch a caſe hee
might be lawfully <hi>reſiſted,</hi> would be a point as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argued, and <hi>Polemically</hi> concluded on the Kings
part, as it hath been hitherto treated of in a plaine
and <hi>poſitive</hi> diſcourſe; For at a word, take but away
that grand <hi>Phenomenon</hi> of theirs, that Regall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is <hi>originally</hi> from the people, and therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occaſion may be reaſſumed by them (which
yet both in the <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Consequent</hi> is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falſe.) This principle too as it is further backed
with certaine generall Maxims, as <hi>Quicquid efficit
tale eſt majus tale,</hi> and, <hi>Totum eſt majus ſuis partibus;</hi>
Againe, <hi>Salus populi ſuprema Lex,</hi> with the like.
Axiomes, as it is evident of large extent or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,
ſubject to divers and ſundry <hi>Limitations,</hi> and
accordingly as ſo, fitter for young Sophiſters to
wrangle out their diſputes with, then as meet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
to overturne Monarchicall Government;
Take away, I ſay, but theſe and the like <hi>ſuppoſita</hi>
laid downe as an unſhaken foundation by them
(which yet hath been a taske already ſufficiently
performed, by the lernd induſtry of divers worthy
undertakers in that kinde) and the whole frame of
their weak built diſcourſes quickly fals to ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94185:21"/>
What they urge concerning the <hi>fundamentall
Lawes</hi> of the Kingdome; what likewiſe touching
the <hi>uſage</hi> and cuſtomary manner of <hi>proceeding</hi> by
generall aſſemblies in ſuch like caſes heretofore,
both at home and abroad, truſting to theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, as forts of ſafe retirement; Breifly
for the former (if ſo it be not a meere <hi>Chimera</hi> of
Imagination barely) it is to be wondred at that
lawes of ſo high concernement in the preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſhould lie hid ſo low under ground, as not
to be found out &amp; produced all this while; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the contrary, I underſtand, have beene and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be ſtill exhibited, without any ſuch labour or
paines of diſquiſition; or grant ſuch lawes might
be produced and made appeare, yet ſurely with
me the law of <hi>man</hi> ſhall evermore ſubmit to the
<hi>law of God;</hi> This is, or ſhould be, I am ſure, the
<hi>Touch-ſtone</hi> for all lawes; where the divine law and
humane chance to croſſe &amp; thwart each other, my
conſcience directs me the ſafer way; and tells me
I had beſt keepe cloſe to the former: It is ſo in the
<hi>Diſcipline</hi> or outward forme of <hi>Church-governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
I appeale to themſelves for a teſtimony;
There they cry up to a tittle <hi>verbum Domini:</hi> ſtill
the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Word.</hi> And why not ſo according
to ſome proportion, at leaſt, if occaſion require it,
in the rectifying of ſecular and <hi>ſtate affaires,</hi> I ſee
not the leaſt ſhew of reaſon, that can be yeilded to
the contrary; yet now for the word of God they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94185:22"/>
have ſo little comfort thence, ſuch ſmall hopes of
any expreſſe warrant for their proceedings (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
over ſtrongly of <hi>Jeſuitiſh principles</hi>) to be
found there, as that they ſcarcely meddle with it,
unleſſe as they be caſually drawne thereto, in their
<hi>replyes</hi> and unſatisfactory anſwers, Nothing to be
heard of there, more then <hi>prayers and patience</hi> in
ſuch caſes; God as then muſt be intreated to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline</hi>
the heart of the Soveraigne, not the people
incouraged to <hi>inforce</hi> him; little mention made of
<hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> except it be againſt the <hi>Devill,</hi> or ſo; but
ſtill of obedience and Chriſtian-like ſubjection;
For the latter, that of practiſe and example, it is an
Anthenticke claſſicall ſaying, <hi>Exempla paucorum
non ſunt trahenda in Leges vniverſorum:</hi> we muſt if
we do well, not ſuffer our ſelves to be governed
altogether ſo much by <hi>Preſidents</hi> or <hi>Examples,</hi> as by
reaſon. And it is cheifely true of the examples of
latter times, where they recede from the fountaine,
the purity of ancienter and better ages, and ſo
grow more ſuſpiciouſly corrupt: If ſome before
us have done amiſſe, we muſt not ſtraight make
their example the <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>patterne</hi> for us to erre by.</p>
            <p>By <hi>reſiſtance</hi> ſo often forementioned (to goe no
further at preſent) I meane an <hi>active reſiſtance</hi> firſt
undertaken, and then purſued in an hoſtile <hi>offenſive</hi>
way: for and ſuch a <hi>reſiſtance</hi> is this, ſay they what
they pleaſe, both deluding themſelves and others.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94185:22"/>
And yet ſuch a <hi>reſiſtance</hi> none of them of the later
hach (as farre as I have ſeene yet) dare in their
writings offer to maintaine with open face. Juſt in
the method of thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> (whom they ſo
much abhorre) their <hi>practiſe</hi> here no way keepes
pace with their <hi>doctrine:</hi> For why? neither <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
nor <hi>reaſon,</hi> nor yet any <hi>Preſident</hi> of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or better times, they know could be brought
with the leaſt ſemblance to ſpeake for them: They
are for the King too (if we may beleeve them) as
well as we, and meerly ſtand upon their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
nor this neither againſt the King in his owne

in rectifying the <hi>praecipitate diſloyall</hi> inclinations
of a ſtill <hi>miſguided</hi> ſort of people; Certainly it hath
beene want of a ſerious animadverſion on this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
which hath hitherto blindly led them on: A
ſtrong though groundleſſe conceit with manie of
the <hi>juſtice,</hi> nay <hi>neceſſarineſſe</hi> of the cauſe, ſwaying
them aſide from the courſe of their bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
As if their <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi>
lay all at ſtake, (true for certaine, it is to be feared
the <hi>Contrary</hi> ſide) which yet as here, God knowes
is nothing ſo: When <hi>Abſolon</hi> roſe up in Armes
againſt his Lord and Father <hi>David.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. no
queſtion but the <hi>Heads</hi> of the then deviſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie
made good uſe (the text inſinuates as
much) of ſome ſuch ſpecious pretences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to cozen the weake and ignorant people; ſo,
for that cauſeleſſe inſurrection of <hi>Corah</hi> with his
complices againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> together, <hi>Num.</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:94185:25"/>
16. thereby at once diſcovering their rancorous
diſaffection towards the eſtabliſhed government
both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State; Yee take too much upon you,</hi>
cry theſe diſcontented <hi>Reformers,</hi> ye intrench too
cloſe upon our pretended <hi>Priviledges,</hi> our <hi>Liberties,</hi>
our <hi>Conſciences;</hi> Never any Rebellion wanted a
cloake or cover of this kind of making. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men ſhould have done well, carefully to
have pondered aforehand, by debating over and
againe, a buſineſſe of ſo high conſequence (as that
whereon depends the hazard of eternall <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Rom.</hi> 13. 2.) before they had raſhly ingaged
themſelves in a blinde and obſtinate defence of
the ſame; Or if it hath been duely perpended, as it
ought, yet without effect: then naught to bee ſaid
but this, <hi>Quis furor O Cives,</hi> God, I feare, as his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
way of proceeding is in ſuch like caſes, hath
ſtrangely <hi>beſotted</hi> and <hi>infatuated</hi> the underſtandings
of this ſinfull Nation, meaning to ſcourge us ſtill
after a moſt ſevere manner, with the rodde of our
own fury; like as it befell the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abites,</hi>
in fight againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who helped
thus to <hi>deſtroy one another,</hi> as we finde it recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 23.</p>

            </q>
            <p>I conclude the whole with that ſage advice of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94185:25"/>
the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> of men next to Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.
21. worthy of a deliberate poiſing by all, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe of the <hi>diſaffected partie. Feare God and
the King, and meddle not with them that are given to
change: for their calamitie ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who
knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> where it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
how you have <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> ſet a breſt
as 'twere, the <hi>obedience</hi> we owe to the King joyned
with that <hi>Duty</hi> which we owe unto God: &amp; ſutably
a neglect of our performance in the one, threatned
with certaine deſtruction alike, as in the other.
And the reaſon for both holds parallell ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as by the former we offend God in his owne
<hi>perſon,</hi> ſo by the later we injure him in the <hi>Perſon</hi>
of his <hi>ſubſtitute</hi> or immediate Vicegerent here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
