            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>First of all you must have a deep bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bason of Brass or Latin, with two ears of Iron to hang it with two Cords, over some hot coals.</p>
                     <p>You must also have a broad Pan to put Ashes in, and hot Coals upon them.</p>
                     <p>You must have a Brass Ladle to let run the Sugar upon the Seeds.</p>
                     <p>You must have a Slice of Brass to scrape away the Sugar from the fides of the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bason if need be.</p>
                     <p>Having all these things in readiness, do as followeth;</p>
                     <p>Take fine white Sugar beaten, and let your seeds and Spice be dry then dry them again in your hanging Bason:</p>
                     <p>Take to every two pounds of Sugar one quarter of a pound of Spices or Seeds, or such like.</p>
                     <p>If it be Aniseeds, two pounds of Sugar
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37008:88"/>
to half a pound of Aniseeds, will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p>Melt your Sugar in this manner; put in three Pounds of sugar into the Bason, and one Pint of water, stir it well till it be wet, then melt it very well and boil it very softly until it will stream from the Ladle like Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and not drop, then let it seeth no more, but keep it upon warm Embers, that it may run from the Ladle upon the seeds.</p>
                     <p>Move the seeds in the hanging Bason so fast as you can or may, and with one hand, east on half a Ladle full at a time of the hot sugar, and rub the seeds with your other hand a pretty while, for that will make them take the sugar the better; and dry them well after every Coat.</p>
                     <p>Do thus at every Coat, not only in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bason, but also with stirring of the Comfits with the one hand, and drying the same, in evrey hour you may make three pounds of Comfits; as the Comfits do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in bigness, so you may take more Sugar in your Ladle to cast on:</p>
                     <p>But for plain Comfits, let your sugar be of a light decoction last, and of a high deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction first, and not too hot.</p>
                     <p>For crisp and ragged Comfets, make your decoction so high, as that it may run from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37008:88"/>
the Ladle, and let it fall a foot high or more from the Ladle, and the hotter you cast on your sugar, the more ragged will your Comfits be; also the Comfits will not take so much of the sugar, as upon a light decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they will keep their raggedness long; this high decoction must serve for eight or ten Coats, and put on at every time but one Ladle full.</p>
                     <p>A quarter of a pound of Coriander seeds, and three pounds of sugar, will serve for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grear Comfits.</p>
                     <p>See that you keep your Sugar in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son always in good temper, that it burn not in Lumps, and if at any time it be too high boiled, put in a spoonful or two of water, and keep it warily with your Ladle, and let your fire be always very clear, when your Comfits be made, set them in Dishes upon Papers in the Sun or before the Fire, or in the Oven after Bread is drawn, for the space of one hour or two, and that will make them look very white.</p>

                     <p>If you will not fry it, then Butter a Dish, and poure it therein, and set it upon a Pot of boiling water till it be enough; this is the better and easier way.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may make Tansies of any other things, as Cowslips, Rasberries, Violets, Marigolds, Gilliflowers, or any such like, and colour them with their Iuice; you may use green Wheat instead of Spinage.</p>

                     <p>First take a flat broad voiding Basket, then have in readiness a good thick Plum Cake, then cut your Cake fit to the bottom of the Basket, and cut a hole in the middle of it, that the Foot of your Glass may go in, which must be a Fountain-Glass, let it be as high a one as you can get; put the foot of it into the Hole of the Cake edgling that it may stand the faster, then tie the Cake fast with a Tape to the Basket, first cross one way and then another, then tie the foot of the Glass in that manner too, that it may stand steady, then cut some odd holes in your Cake carelessly, then take some Gum Dragon steeped in Rosewater, and mix it with some fine Sugar, not too thick, and with that you must fasten all your Rock to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; in these holes which you cut in your Cake you must fasten some sort of Biskets, as Naples Biskets, and other common Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket made long, and some ragged, and some coloured, that they may look like great ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured Stones, and some handsom, some long, some short, some bigger, and some lesser, as you know Nature doth afford and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:37008:182"/>
so me of one colour and some of another, let some stand upright and some a slaunt, and some quite a long, and fasten them all with your Gum, then put in some better Sweet-meats, as Mackeroons and March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panes, carelesly made as to the shape, and not put on the Rock in a set form, also some rough Almond Cakes made with the long slices of Almonds (as I have directed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;) so build it up in this manner, and fasten it with the Gum and Sugar, till it be very high, then in some places you must put whole Quinces Candied, both red and white, whole Orange Pills and Limon Pills Candied, dryed Apricocks, Pears and Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins Candied, whole Peaches Candied, then set up here and there great lumps of brown and white Sugar-candy upon the stick, which much resembles some clusters of fine Stones growing on a Rock; for Sand which lies sometimes among the little Stones, strew some brown Sugar; for Moss, take Herbs of a Rock Candy; then you must make the likeness of Snakes and Snails and Worms, and of any venomous Creature you can think of; make them in Sugar Plate and colour them to their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and put them in the holes that they may seem to lurk, and some Snails creeping
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:37008:182"/>
one way and some another; then take all manner of Comfits, both rough and smooth, both great and small, and colour many of them, some of one colour and some of another, let some be white and some speck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then when you have coloured them, and that they are dry, mix them together and throw them into the Clefts, but not too many in one place, for that will hide the shape of your Work, then throw in some Chips of all sorts of Fruit Candied, as Orange, Limon, Citron, Quince, Pear, and Apples, for of all these you may make Chips; then all manner of dryed Plumbs, and Cherries, Cornelions dryed, Rasps and Currans; and in some places throw a few Prunelles, Pistacho Nuts, blanched Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Pine Kernels, or any such like and a pound of the great round perfumed Comfits; then take the lid of the top of the Glass and fill it with Preserved Grapes, and fill another with some Harts-horn Ielly, place these two far from one another, and if you set some kind of Fowl, made in Marchpanes, as a Peacock, or such like, and some right Feathers gummed on with Gum Arabick; let this Fowl stand as though it did go to drink at the Glass of Harts-horn Ielly,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:37008:183"/>
and then they will know who see it, that those two liquid Glasses serve for resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of several Waters in the Rock:</p>
                     <p>Then make good store of Oister shells &amp; Cockle shells of Sugar Plate, let some be pure white as though the Sea water had washed them, some brown on the outside, and some green, some as it were dirty, and others worn away in some Places, some of them broke, and some whole, so set them here and there about the Rock, some edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and some flat, some the hollow side upward, and some the other, then stick the Moss, some upon the shells, and some upon the stones, and also little Branches of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Fruits, as Barberries, Plums, and the like, then when all is done, sprinkle it over with Rosewater, with a Grain or two of Musk or Ambergreece in it; your Glass must be made with a reasonable proportion of bigness to hold the Wine, and from that, in the middle of it, there must be a Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to fall into a Glass below it, which must have Spouts for the Wine to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or downward, then from thence in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Glass below, with Spou's also, and from thence it hath a Conveyance into a Glass below that, somewhat in form like a Sillibub Pot, where the Wine may be drunk
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:37008:183"/>
out at the Spout; you may put some Eringo Roots, and being coloured, they will shew very well among the other Sweet-Meats, tie your Basket about with several sorts of small Ribbons: Do not take this for a simple Fancy, for I assure you, it is the very same that I taught to a young Gentlewoman to give for a Present to a Person of Quality.</p>

                     <p>PErhaps you do already know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to serving in fine Cream Cheeses, Iellies, Leaches or Sweet-meats, or to set forth Banquets as well as I do; but (pardon me) I speak not to any knowing Person, but to the ignorant, because they may not remain so; besides really there are new Modes come up now adays for eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, as well as for Cloaths, and the most knowing of you all may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find somewhat here which you have not already seen; and for the ignorant, I am sure they may ground themselves very well from hence in many Accomplishments, and truly I have taken this pains to impart these things for the general good of my Country, as well as my own, and have done it with the more willingness, since I find so many Gentlewomen forced to serve, whose Parents
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:37008:198"/>
and Friends have been impoverished by the lare Calamities, <hi>viz.</hi> the Late Wars, Plague, and Fire, and to see what mean Places they are forced to be in, because they want Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments for better.</p>
                     <p>I am blamed by many for divulging these Secrets, and again commended by others for my Love and Charity for so doing; but however I am better satisfied with imparting them, than to let them die with me; and if I do not live to have the Comfort of your Thanks, yet I hope it will cause you to speak well of me when I am dead: The Books which before this I have caused to be put in Print, found so good an acceptance, as that I shall still go on in imparting what I yet have, so fast as I can.</p>
                     <p>Now to begin with the Ordering those things named to you:</p>
                     <p>If it be but a private Dinner or Supper in a Noble House, where there they have none to honour above themselves, I presume it may be thus;</p>
                     <p>In Summer time, when the Meat is all taken away, you may present your several sorts of Cream Cheeses; One Meal one Dish of Cream of one sort, the next, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:37008:199"/>
one or two Scollop Dishes with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Eruit, which if it be small fruit, as Raspes or Strawberries, they must be first washed in Wine in a Dish or Bason, and taken up between two Spoons, that you touch them not.</p>
                     <p>With them you may serve three or four small Dishes also with sweet meats, such as are most in season, with Vine Leaves and Flowers between the Dishes and the Plates, two wet Sweet meats, and two dry, two of one colour, and two of another, or all of several colours.</p>
                     <p>Also a Dish of Iellies of several colours in one Dish, if such be required.</p>
                     <p>If any be left, you may melt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and put them into lesser Glasses, and they will be for another time:</p>
                     <p>If any dry ones be left, they are soon put into the Boxes again.</p>
                     <p>If any persons come in the Afternoon, if no greater, or so great as the Person who entertains them, then you may present one or two Dishes of Cream only, and a whipt Sillibub, or other, with about four Dishes of Sweet-meats served in, in like manner as at Dinner, with Dishes of Fruit, and some
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:37008:199"/>
kind of Wine of your own making; at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings, especially on Fasting Daies at Night, it is fit to present some pretty kind of Creams, contrary from those at Dinner, or instead of them some Possets, or other fine Spoon Meats, which may be pleasaut to the taste, with some wet and dry Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, and some of your fine Drinks, what may be most pleasing.</p>
                     <p>At a Feast, you may present these things ollowing.</p>
                     <p>So soon as the Meat is quite taken away, have in readiness your Cream Cheeses of several sorts and of several Colours upon a Salver, then some fresh Cheese with Wine and Sugar, another Dish of Cloured Cream, and a Noch with Cabbage Cream of several Colours, like a Cabbage; then all sorts of Fruits in season, set forth as followeth:</p>
                     <p>First, You must have a large Salver made of light kind of Wood, that it may not be too heavy for the Servitor to carry, it must be painted over, and large enough to hold six Plates round about and one larger one in the middle, there must be places
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:37008:200"/>
made in it to set the Plates in, that they may be very fast and sure from sliding, and that in the middle the seat must be much higher than all the rest, because that is most grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; your Plates must not be so broad as the Trencher Plates at Meat, and should be either of Silver or <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Set your Plates fast, then fill every one with several sorts of Fruits, and the biggest sort in the middle, you must lay them in very good order, and pile them up till one more will not lie; then stick them with little green Sprigs and fine Flowers, such as you fancy best; then serve in another such Salver, with Plates piled up with all manner of Sweet-meats, the wet Sweet-meats round about and the dry in the middle, your wet Sweet-meats must be in little glasses that you may set the more on, and between every two glasses another above the first of all, and one on the top of them all; you must put of all sorts of dryed Sweet-meats in the middle Plate, first your biggest and then your lesser, till you can lay no more; then stick them all with Flowers, and serve them: And in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Water you send in to wash the Hands or Fingers of Noble Persons, you must
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:37008:200"/>
put in some Orange Flower Water, which is very rare and very pleasant.</p>
                     <p>In Winter you must alter, as to the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but serve all in this manner; and then dryed Fruits will also be very acceptable, as dryed Pears and Pippins, Candied Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Limons, Citrons and Eringoes, Blanched Almonds, Prunelles, Figs, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins, Pistachoes and Blanched Walnuts.</p>
