         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

your Grace hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by a constant, and

            <p>Custome, which hath the
power to make, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
Laws, hath obliged
me to comply in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of writing to thee.
Otherwise I was resolved
to suffer this ensuing Discourse to appear na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and without an Advocate, [as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Subjects ought to do:] that so the
minds of the studious, being free from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posession,
might be the better able to judge of
the truth of the Matter in hand, and of the
validity of the Arguments I produce to
evince it.</p>
            <p>This, I say, I would have done, could I
have been assur'd, that this Book should
have fallen under the censure of none but
<pb facs="tcp:98859:5"/>
Philosophical, and knowing Men, to whom I
should have thought my self happy to have
submitted my labours in this kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To
which sort of inquisitive, and industrious
Men, I pretend not to have done any further
service in these Lucubrations; then by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
laid together those Arguments, and
Experiments, which did readily occurr to my
mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which I thought might conduce
to prove the Matter in hand, a Subject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it
to be seriously look'd into; and though I seem
in some places to be determinate, yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
[once for all] I have not the vanity
to think I have put such a Ne plus ultra
to the inquiries into this Subject, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
further discoveries are to be made; nothing
less. For though the Subject be rough, and
hard, yet it is far from being unfruitful.
And if by my endeavours I shall prove
Instrumental, [by giving of hints, &amp;c.]
to put other industrious Philosophers, who
are fitted with better parts, and more time,
to digg deeper in these Quarries, I shall
think it glory sufficient, to have been thus far
serviceable to the Common-wealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and if by the endeavours of such
W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rthy Men, I shall find my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in my Opinion, I shall rely upon it
with the greater security. But if by their
inquirius, other, and truer causes shall
<pb facs="tcp:98859:5"/>
appear; I shall not scruple to a knowledge,
that I will willingly become a Proselyte to
Truth, though at the same time it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
it convince me of having been er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
in my Opinion.</p>
            <p>But at present, thinking I defend a verity,
I shall not easily recede from my Opinion,
without my Iudgment be convinc'd, by
the same means I make use of, to Proselyte
others: that is, both by reason, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.
And likewise let me add this,
that I shall expect the same Candid, and
civil dealing from such who intend to
confute me, which I have shew'd to those
whose Opinions I reject. For otherwise
I shall conclude a railing Adversary fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for my slight, than reply; I knowing
a better use of my time, then to spend it so
unfruitfully.</p>
            <p>As I court not applause, which is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
anbefitting a Philosopher; So, having
[as I suppose] appear'd in a good Cause,
that is, the defence of a philosophical truth,
[viz. that the Matter of Stones, and all
other Bodies, is Water, and their Efficient
Seed] I shall not fear Censure, though I
must be exposed to that of any Man, which
shall take the pains to peruse my Book; I
am not ignorant of the Proverb, <hi>So many
Men, so many Minds:</hi> Nor of that
<pb facs="tcp:98859:6"/>
other, <hi>Haben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

therefore cannot expect that impossibility
of pleasing every body; but that I
may be as useful as I can to those Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which though they may have large
Souls, have yet been little Conversant
with things of this Nature; I say, that
I may be as Instructive as I can, and that
my meaning may not be mistaken, I shall
therefore inform them of these things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>First, that there are many Men, of
great Natural parts, which yet want the
advantage of understanding the <hi>Greek,</hi>
and <hi>Latin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s; for whose sakes, I
have [that I might be the more useful]
Translated into the <hi>English,</hi> all those
quotations which I make use of, from
Authors which have writ in those Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Languages, and that [for the most
part] Verbatim, [though sometimes I only
deliver their sense.] And to satisfie the
scrupulous, yet Learned sort of Readers]
of my integrity, I have almost constantly
given them the very words, and in the
same Language they are delivered by
those I qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with the Book,
and for the most part, Page, where the
<pb facs="tcp:98859:6"/>
Original words may be found, [marked in
the Margin.]</p>
            <p>Secondly, If it shall be objected, that
I am very frequent in quotations, [a
thing much out of fashion;] and that
therefore it may be supposed, I have said
little but what will be found expressed by
others; I shall acknowledge I have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
done so, because I had a desire to
get my self strongly Seconded in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
by the determinations of Learned
Men; [And of the Testimony of such only
have I made use] For I verily believes
that if an Angel himself should avouch
any thing singly, and as his own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he would not be believed by some
Men. But however the Reader will
have these Advantages by it, First,
those things are here contracted, and
brought under their proper heads, which
are dispersed in many Voluminous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
which will save him time in
searching many Books. Secondly, He
may find the Pith, and Substance of
what others have written in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
delivered in his own. And
thirdly, here are, besides, many Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Observations of my own,
very conducible [I suppose,] to clear,
<pb facs="tcp:98859:7"/>
and explicate those Philosophical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
I have undertook to defend in this
Discourse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If any Man shall be so much
a <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi> as to repine at the j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
I often give to <hi>Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Boyl;</hi> I must needs
say, that I think his ill Nature proceeds
from his want of throughly knowing these
Authors: for if he had taken the pains
to search the depth of these two, as I
have done, I doubt not but he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
I have fall'n short of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them their deserved praise, [they
having merited so much from all inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
and Learned Men.]</p>
            <p>Lastly, I think it necessary to tell thee,
how I would have to be understood those two
words of <hi>Seed,</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
upon which I have built this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>First then, by <hi>Seed</hi> I understand a
fine, subtile Substance, [imperciptible by
our gros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doth perform by putting the parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into such a peculiar motion as is
requisite to produce the intended Effect.
And this we may illustrate thus.</p>
            <p>A Woman with Child, by a strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
forms in her Spirits an <hi>Idea</hi> of
some Fruit she longs for; and by the
powerfull motion of that <hi>Idea</hi> working on
the Child, she forms a real E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>igies of
the said Fruit upon that Member of
the Child which corresponds to that of
her own Body she touched with her hand;
which, as Experience teacheth us, will
Vegetate, grow Ripe, and Wither, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several mutations the
Fruit it resembles undergoes. And we
are told by <hi>Esdras,</hi> that God, before he
made the World, did consider the things
he intended to make; and then produced
them. By which Expression, I think may
well be understood, the Creation of all
those Spiritual, and Seminal Beings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in them, not only an <hi>Idea</hi> of
the thing to be made; but also a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to move the Matter after a peculiar
manner, by which means it reduceth it
to a form like it self. And as a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth first conceive in his mind a
Spirituall <hi>Idea</hi> of the Picture he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:98859:8"/>
to draw; and afterwards by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultar
Motions of his hand, which
are guided by the said <hi>Idea,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
a perfect Picture Corresponding with
that in his mind: So likewise, by putting
Matter into peculiar Motions, the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Idea</hi> makes it self visible.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Water,</hi> the Material Principle of
all Concrets, I understand, a fluid Body,
consisting of very minute parts, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
figur'd <hi>Atoms,</hi> or <hi>Corpuscules,</hi> the
Mass of it being full of pores, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
subject to be contracted into less room:
and upon the same account it doth easily,
and readily submit to those motions it is
put into by Seminal Beings: from which
moving of Matter all the visible, and Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Bodies of the World, have their result.
And therefore I have, all along this ensuing
Discourse, took care to explicate the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
of the Origin of Bodies, by the <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi>
Principles: That is, by the Motion,
Shape, Size, Scituation, and Connexion
of the parts of Matter.</p>
            <p>But though this be a way commonly used,
in explicating things, by the Philosophers
of our Age, yet most of them leave out
the first principle of Natural Motion; viz.
the Seminal principle, which I have taken
in, to compleate my Hypothesis.</p>

Rock,<note place="margin">In Lib. Hydrogr. Spagyr Cap. 14.</note> and in its very coming forth it
produces Rocks, and white stones; and
the Inhabitants of this City, when they
would make a Bridge to go over any
of the small Rivulets, which are made by
this Fountain, that so they may visit
their Fields and Gardens, do thus:
They cause the Water of this Fountain
to glide over certain planks, made Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and within twenty four hours they
have a solid stone Bridge; by the help of
which they can pass dry-foot over the
Rivers. The water of this Fountain is
visibly changed into stone, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it alwayes flows as other Springs do:
This water is exceeding clear, nor doth
it differ in colour, or clearness from other
Springs; Beasts will drink of it if they
be not hinder'd; but if they do, it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulates
in their stomacks into stone,
from whence Death follows, by reason
of a Collick caused from thence, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98859:12"/>
kills with cruel torments all the Beasts
that have drunk this water. Wherefore
the Inhabitants take care to drive their
Cattel far enough from this Fountain;
for it is a present poyson to all sorts of
living Creatures that drink of it. When
it is taken from the Spring, it is quickly
turned into stone; the truth of which the
Inhabitants do make manifest [to all that
doubt thereof] by many experiments;
they fill a glass with this water, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
it is converted into stone, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the shape of the glass: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if Earthen Vessels be filled with this
water, it is suddenly congealed into
stone, which keeps the form and figure
of the Vessel that contained it. This
wonder of Nature <hi>[sayes he]</hi> every
body admires, but I believe hardly any
body will be found, that shall be able to
render the Natural reason of this thing.

which was intorduced by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and hath since pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed

have hitherto received but an unsatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
account, not only of the Origine of
all concretes, but more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
stones; and that not only in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> For, they seem to think it sufficient,
to have crudely told us, that Stones [and
all other Minerals, and Metals] are
made of Earth, with a slight mixture of
the other three Elements, as the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
and by the assistance of Heat, Cold,
Moisture, and Driness, as the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and efficient Cause. For perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the weight of Minerals, and Stones,
to exceed the weight of water, they
therefore assign the matter of Minerals,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98859:15"/>
and Stones, to be chiefly Earth; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further Controversie, or search
after the matter, they are content to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and would have us do so too, that
all sorts of stones are nothing but Earth,
from which the other three Elements
are forced by heat; by which means it
becomes baked into a stone. And this
they [viz. the <hi>Aristotelians</hi>] think they
prove by alleadging the Example of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Earth, which being burnt gains a
stone-like hardness. And because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stones nor Earth do commonly
melt in the fire, they therefore conclude
stones are made of Earth. But there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on such heat in the Superficies of the

hath their labour been in vain: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can drought, heat, or cold, be here

not deny, that they may concur as a

concretion;] neither could it hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
be demonstrated by any body,
how heat of it self could be able to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
such a disposition of compaction;
and that it could produce a Lapidescent
juice: Nay, this is performed where all
heat is wanting, and that in cold and
Membranous places; as also in Infants,
who are not allow'd to have any excess
of heat, but are rather found to have
manifest crudity, the stone is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Biadder: and how, I pray, is
the stonisying juice produced in cold
Fountains, into which wood being cast
is changed into stone? Then, as to cold,
stones do grow in the Head, in the
lungs, about the basis of the great artery,
in the Arteries of the Heart; nay, they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98859:16"/>
are in the Heart it self. Also there grows
in hot Baths, as experience sheweth,
sandy stones, &amp; stony Isicles, where cold
can by no means be admitted.</q> Thus far
he: by which you see he is clearly of
opinion, that neither heat, nor cold can
be the primary, or chief cause of Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Let us then inquire what the Chymical
Philosopher's opinion is in this point:
(and the rather because it is constantly
affirmed by most of them, that the Art
of Pyrotechny is the only true means of
informing the mind with Truth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
it with realities; and we shall
find, that they hold Salt to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of solidity, and the genuine cause of
coagulation, in all bodies; [as also of
stonification:] For, say they, if you
consult experience, all those things that
are compact, or solid, do contain Salt;
and where there is no Salt, there can be
no hardness. And for this reason they
esteem Salt to be the <gap reason="foreign">

Solidity: which they that deny [say
they] are obliged to shew some other
cause; from which Salts have that aptitude
to coagulate themselves, and become solid
bodies.</p>
            <p>For, it is manifest, that the Salts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/>
Vegetables, as Crystals of Tartar, &amp;c.
also Nitre, Allom, Vitriol, Salt Gemm,
[and divers other of this Nature] do
coagulate themselves, not only into hard,
but even brittle bodies, in the bosome of
the water; and to this end they alleadge,
that if the Salt be washed from ashes, no
heat of fire will make them hard; but if
the Salt be left in them, [and they be
mixt with a little water] the fire will
not only quickly make them become hard;
but if they be strongly press'd with it,
turn them into Glass.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine, though much more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/>
rational than the former, and seeming to
be confirmed by experiment, and to be
verified by the account our senses give us
of it, cannot yet gain my full assent to
it, so far as to allow Salt to be the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
either Matter, or Efficient of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
in bodies, or the cause from whence
stones are produced. For it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vabe,
that Salts are reducible into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
[and do seem to lose their soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity]
either by being mixed with water,
or exposed to the Air, in which many of
them run <hi>per deliquium.</hi> But, to let this
pass; what Salt can be supposed to be
communicated to Quick-silver, when it
is coagulated by the fumes of melted
Lead, by which it becomes so solid, that
it may be cast into Moulds, and Images
formed of it; and when cold, is not
only hard, but somewhat brittle, like
<hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony?.</hi> What access of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98859:18"/>
Salt can be fancied is added to the white
of an Egg, [from whence the whole
Chick is formed] which is a Liquor so
near water, that by beating it with a
whisk it is reduced into so fluid a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that it will easily mix with water,
and is hardly distinguishable from it?
And yet this white of the Egg, by the
assistance of a gentle heat, to stir up its
seminal Principle, and enable it to turn,
and new shuffle the parts of that liquid
substance, [by the means of which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
divers of its parts are broken into
shapes and sizes fit to adhere one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther]
is all of it turned into solid bodies,
some of them very tough, as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
and Nerves; and some of them
hard and brittle, as the Beak, Bones,
Claws, &amp;c. [of the Chick;] and all
this without any new addition of salt.</p>
            <p>'Tis likewise remarkable, that very
credible witnesses assure us,<note place="margin">Gassendus, Lib. 4.</note> that Corral
[though it grow in salt water,<note place="margin">Anno Dom. 1624.</note> at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

[and juicy also:] neither will the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

that the powder of Plaster of <hi>Paris,</hi> or
burnt Alabaster, if it be mixed with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98859:19"/>
water, without any sort of salt, will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
into an entire stony lump, or
Mass.</p>
            <p>I do not deny but that salt may very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/>
much conduce towards the coagulation
of some bodies, as we see in the curdling
of Milk with Runner, Spirit of salt, Oyl
of Vitriol, juice of Limmons, and the
like; but then this happens but to some
bodies, and is caused from the shape and
motion of its small parts, which entring
the pores of some bodies that are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
fitted to be wrought upon by it, it
fills up many of the cavities of such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and also affixing it self to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of them, it causeth them, not only
to stick to it self, but also adhere closely
one to another.</p>
            <p>I say, salts do this to some bodies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/>
[not to all,] for to some other bodies,
instead of being an Instrument, either to
cause, or confirm their solidity, it by
dissociating the parts, of which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and putting them into motion, doth
reduce them into the appearance of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;
as we see in the action of corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
saline spirits, both upon Metals, and
stones.</p>
            <p>Now, for that Argument, that salts do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/>
shoot even in the water into hard, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98859:19"/>
brittle Crystals, if I should say they do
so upon the account of a seminal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I should not, perhaps, be thought
to have much mistaken the cause, by
those that have well consider'd the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and regular Figures [yet constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinct from each other,] which their
Crystals shoot into: which certainly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
proceed from chance; for they do
as constantly keep their own figure [as
for Example, that of Nitre alwayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Philosophers hold, there are two sorts

The other cause they call <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> THe Doctrine I am now about to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
is no Novel conceit; but so
Ancient, that we shall find that it was
held, [and by them transmitted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity]
not only by <hi>Plato, Timaeus Locrus,
Parmenides, Pythagoras, &amp;c.</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of the Academick, and Italick
Sect; but also by <hi>Orpheus, Thales</hi> the

Philosophers; nay, by that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> I urge this point of the Antiquity of
the Doctrine I am now going to affirm,
because I know it is the custom of some
Men, to disgust any Philosophical truth,
that cannot shew it self to be as ancient
as <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s time; but to please such,
let them consider, that the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> we
intend to make use of in this ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
beareth an equal Date with the
World, and was at first deliver'd to Man
by the <hi>Ancient of Dayes</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine then [which hath of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98859:21"/>
late years been revived, and assumed by
the Noble <hi>Helmont,</hi> and other great wits,]
I now am come to lay down, and explain;
and in the next place shall endeavour to
prove, and confirm it; first, by rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on,
then by experiment, and lastly, by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
stones, and all other sublunary bodies,
are made of water, condensed by the
power of seeds, which with the assistance
of their fermentive Odours, perform
these Transmutations upon Matter.</p>
            <p>That is, that the matter of all Bodies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/>
is originally meer water; which by the
power of proper seeds is coagulated,
condensed, and brought into various
forms, and that these seeds of things do
work upon the particles of water, and
alter both their texture, and figure; as
also, that this action ceaseth not, till the
seed hath formed it self a Body, exactly
corresponding with the proper Idea, or
Picture contained in it. And that the
true seeds of all things are invisible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
[though not incorporial;] this I
affirm, and shall endeavour to
prove.</p>
            <p>But to make this the better to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> I shall praemise some generals,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98859:21"/>
and then descend to particular proofs of
what I assert.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> First then, nothing is produced by
chance, or accident. And therefore in
every Generation, or Production, there
must necessarily be presupposed some
kind of seed which hath a power, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
to alter the Matter, and dispose it
to such a Being, and Form, as God and
Nature have design'd to produce.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> Secondly, all seeds (in some degree)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
are endow'd with Life, and a power of
acting: for nothing that is not Vital can
promote it self to perfection. And if
Bodies are distinguishable from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Efficients, and are specificated by
them, then must they be allowed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a seed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> These positions will not [p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rhaps]
be denyed to Animals, nor Vegetables;
because their supposed feed is visible.
For the seed [or rather, sperm] of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Animals, is an efflorescence of the
best parts of the blood [elaborated in
the Testicles] and impregnated with
Spirits from all parts of the Body; in
which resideth the <hi>vis Plastica,</hi> or <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;</hi>
[and this indeed is the real seed,
or geniture, though it be invisible] which
containeth in it self the Image, or Type
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98859:22"/>
of the thing to be made; which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
by a Fermental <hi>Odor,</hi> or <hi>Aura,</hi> and
by breathing upon those proper juices it
finds in a Female Womb; it first coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
them, and then by degrees expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
it self, working this Female Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a Body exactly corresponding
with its own pre-conceived Figure: the
grosse body of the Male-seed all this
while being but a vehicle, to convey with
safety this subtile fermentative breath to
its proper place of action; which being
done, the body of the sperm is ejected
from the Womb, as useless to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>That this is so, hath been proved by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/>
the industrious and curious dissection of
divers sorts of Beasts, made at several
seasons after their Conceptions; and
continued till the formation of the <hi>foetus;</hi>
and yet no <hi>Vestigiae,</hi> or foot-steps of the
Male-sperm could be found in the womb.
This is asserted by that incomparable
Man,<note place="margin">

            <p>The sperm of Man, if but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/>
it be exposed to the touch of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Air, becomes dead, and unproli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick;
and that by reason of the subtilty
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98859:22"/>
of the spermatick ferment, [it being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apt to desert the body of the seed.]
This is a truth so generally known, that
the Virtue of that Lady is justly suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all rational Men, who pretended
to have Conceived with Child, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
the seed of a Man which floated
in a Bath, wherein she Bathed her
self.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> As to Vegetables; They also take their
beginnings, are propagated, and do fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,
from the like invisible cause; <hi>viz.</hi>
a fermentative Odor, [or Aura] which
also contains the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Plant to be
produced.</p>
            <p>The body of the Seed, or Grain [which
is the Casket that contains this invisible
Workman] being committed to the
Earth [its proper Womb] is softened
by the Nitrosulphurous juice of the soyl;
that the <hi>Vis Plastica</hi> [which is the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of the Plant] may, being loosened
from its body, be at Liberty to act.
Which being done, the body of the seed,
or Grain, is destroyed; according to the
sacred Writ: [<hi>Except Seed, committed
to the ground, dye, it produceth no fruit:</hi>]
But the Architectonick Spirit being now
at Liberty, ferments, by its Odor, the
Liquors it finds in the Earth, converting
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98859:23"/>
them into a juice, fit to work the Plant
out of it, which it by degrees performs.
[This Liquor in the Earth, is by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus,</hi>
and <hi>Helmont,</hi> by a Barbarous name,
call'd <hi>Leffas Terrae;</hi> and is the proximate
matter of all Vegetables.] For proof
of what I seem to have with some
boldness asserted in this place; Let any
sort of Grain be put for a small time in an
Oven, [or any analogous hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,] that the
external warmth may suscitate and excite
this ferment of the Seed to take wing,
and desert its body; This Grain, though
entire to sight, if it be committed to the
Earth, shall never by any Art be brought
to produce its like.</p>
            <p>As Vegetables, and Animals have their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/>
Original from an invisible Seminal Spirit,
or breath; so also have Minerals, Metals,
and Stones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this purpose Dr.</hi> Iordan <hi>tells us,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
There is a Seminal Spirit of all Minerals
in the Bowels of the Earth,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Iordan</hi> of Natural Bathes. Cap. 2. p. 58, 59.</note> which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with convenient Matter, <hi>[what that
is, we shall shew in its place]</hi> and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juvant
Causes, is not idle, but doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to produce Minerals, according to
the Nature of it, and the Matter which
it meets withal; which matter it works
upon as a Ferment, and by its motion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98859:23"/>
procureth an actual heat, as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to further its work; which actual
heat is increased by the fermentation of the
Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> The like we see in making of Malt,
where the Grains of Barley being moyst'ned
with water, the Generative Spirit in
them is dilated, and put in Action; and
the superfluity of the water being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
[which might choak it] and the
Barley laid up in heaps, the Seeds gather
heat, which is increased by the contigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of many Grains lying one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In this work Natures intent is to
produce more individuals, according to
the Nature of the Seed; and therefore it
shoots forth in spires; but the Artist
abuses the intention of Nature, and converts
it to his ends, that is, to increase the Spirit
of his Malt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> The like we find in Mineral Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where this Spirit, or Ferment, is
resident, as in Allom, and Copperas-Mines;
which being broken, exposed,
and Moystned, will gather an actual heat,
and produce much more of these Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
than else the Mine would yield; as
<hi>Agricola,</hi> and <hi>Thurniser</hi> do affirm, and
is proved by common experience. The
like is generally observed in Mines, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98859:24"/>
               <hi>Agricola, Erastus, Libavius,</hi> &amp;c. do
avouch out of the daily experience of
Mineral Men; who affirm, that in most
places they find their Mines so hot, as
they can hardly touch them; although
it is likely, that where they work for
perfect Minerals, the heat, which was in
fermentation whilst they were yet in
breeding, is now much abated, the
Minerals being now grown to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
And for this heat we need not
call for the help of the Sun, which a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Cloud will take away from us; much
more the body of the Earth, and Rocks;
nor for subterranean fires. This imbred
heat is sufficient, as may appear: also by
the Mines of Tinglass, which being dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and laid in the moyst Air, will become
very hot; so Antimony and Sublimate
being mixed together, will grow so hot
as that they are not to be touched. If this
be so in little quantities, it is likely to
be much more in great quantities, and
huge Rocks. Heat of it self differs not
in kind, but only in degree, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is inclined no more to one Species,
than to another; but as it doth attend,
and serve a more worthy Superiour, such
as this Generative Spirit is. <hi>Thus far

               <hi>Moreover, that Minerals, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
have their proper Seeds, hear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> what a Mystical Chymist, (but a

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wels
of the Earth; therefore it is not believed,
that there is such a Seed in Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is invisible.</q> 
               <hi>And the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
again, thus:</hi> Et quam praerogativam
vegetabilia prae Metallis habent, ut Deus
illis semen inderet, &amp; haec immeritò exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret?
Nonne ejusdem dignitatis Metalla
apud Deum, cujus &amp; arbores? Hoc pro
certo statuatur, nihil sine semine crescere;
ubi enim nullum est semen, res est Mortua;
<hi>that is,</hi> 
               <q>And what prerogative have Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
above Metals, that God should
put Seed into them, and undeservedly
exclude these? Are not Metals of the
same dignity with God that Trees are?
This may be held for certain, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doth increase without Seed: for
where there is no Seed, that thing is
Dead.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is plain, you see, by the
afore-cited Authorities, that Minerals,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98859:25"/>
and Metals have Seed, &amp; that this Seed is
invisible; and that it works by the help
of its ferment, or as a ferment. That
stones grow, common experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us; as also the tenth History al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged,
in the first Section of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Essay; and consequently must be
endowed with seed, and ferment; so
that here is, at least, an analogous way
of production to that of Animals, and
Vegetables (which we have declared
above) and was the thing we intended
here to prove.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed, that I may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/>
the more clearly understood, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what I understand by the Ferment
of the seed. The word <hi>Fermentum,</hi>
which signifieth Leaven, is by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> some
esteem'd to be <hi>quasi fervimentum,</hi> or a
thing made hot; and generally is used to
denote, not only a turgescence, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation
of the parts of Matter, (as in
Leavened Bread, &amp;c.) but also signifieth
the working of any sort of Liquor, till
it become Maturated, and exalted into
a generous, and sprightly Drink. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
is thus defined by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Dr. <hi>Willis: Fermentatio est motus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testinus
particularum, seu principiorum
cujusvis corporis, cum tendentia ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98859:25"/>
ejusdem Corporis, vel propter mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem
in aliud; <q>Fermentation is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine
[or intire] motion of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
or particles, of which day Body
consists, with an intent to perfect the said
Body, or change it into another.</q>
               </hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
then are subtile, tenuous Bodies,
[which we generally call Spirits; for as
to Leaven, Yeast, &amp;c. they are but
the cloathings of these Spiritual, and
finer Substances; as we before shewed
the Grains of Vegetables, and the
Sperm of Animals were:] which fine
subtile breath (the Ferment) hath an
expansive power; by which, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed
in any Matter, or Substance, it
desiring to dilate it self, variously agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
the small particles of that matter it
is joyned to, and making Excursions
through all parts of the Subject it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
in, it adhering intimately to every
small part of the Matter, doth first by
the peculiar motion it hath put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
alter and break the particles into
new shapes, and sizes; and then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneing
together with them, constitute
a new texture of that Matter; and thus
a new Concrete is made by the power of
the Ferment.</p>
            <p>So that, in truth, the Ferment of a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98859:26"/>
Seed, [I mean Natural Ferment] is not
any Substance distinct, or separable from
the Seed it self; since it is connatural <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/>
with it, and intimately the same, [and
is indemonstrable <hi>à priore,</hi> as well as the
Seed, and may be thus defined.</p>
            <p>A Ferment is an Expansive, Elastick,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/>
or Springy power of the Seed of any
thing; by which motion of its self it
also moveth the smallest particles of that
Matter in which it is immersed: by
which motion also [which is of divers
kinds, according to the variety of Seeds]
the particles of Matter acquire new
shapes, sizes, and postures amongst
themselves; and so a new texture of the
whole is produced, agreeable to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Nature of the Seed, and corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
to its Idea; [which Idea we
shall explain in its place.]</p>
            <p>We have likewise declared often, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/>
seeds do operate by Odors, or scents;
which we think is not said without cause:
for if it be well observed, it will be
found, that no seeds do generate; but in
the time of their acting upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there are specifick Odors produced;
that is, while they are in Fermentation,
and the work incompleat: for, when
the Concrete is perfected, the Odor is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98859:26"/>
much abated: [as, not to instance in
artificial things, making of Malt, the
fermenting of Beer, and Wine, in the
Barrel, and the leavening of Dough,
&amp;c.] for 'tis observable, that the Grains
of Wheat, or other Vegetables, sown
in the ground, when their invisible seed
begins to ferment, do send forth Odors;
so also the Eggs of Birds, on which the
Hen hath sat. And that Minerals, and
Metals, whilst in their making they do
send forth such plenty of stinking Odors,
that many times the workmen in Mines
are suffocated therewith, no body can
be ignorant. Now these Odors are fine
and subtile <hi>Effluviums,</hi> [or small parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Matter now put into motion
by the power of the seed, Ferment:
which having extricated themselves from
their Companions, and roving in the
Air, do at last strike against those parts
of our Noses that are fitted by Nature
to be sensible of the touch of such very
small Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/> Odors then are a sign of Fermentation
begun, and are nothing but small parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Matter got loose from their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
begun to be alter'd, and specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by the seed; and therefore are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
various, according to the diversity of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98859:27"/>
seeds, and their Ferments, from whence
they proceed.</p>
            <p>Having before declared, that all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/>
proceed, and are made from Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Beings; and that the real seeds, and
Ferments of things are invisible; and
having declared, what I would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by a seedy Fermen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and Odor;
and also having hinted above, that all
Bodies are Materially [and Primarily]
nothing but water; I shall now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to prove the same more fully, and
clearly; the which I shall do by three
sorts of Arguments. The first is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Philosophical Axiom; <hi>viz.
Quaesunt prima in Compositione, sunt ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
in resolutione: Et quae sunt ultima in
resolutione, sunt prima in Compositione.
<q>That which is first in the Composition, is
last in the resolution: And those things
which are last in the resolution, the same are
first in the Composition.</q>
               </hi> The second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is grounded upon another axiom
commonly received. That is, <hi>Nutrimur
iisdem quibus constamus. <q>We are Nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by those things of which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
or made.</q>
               </hi> The third argument
shall be to shew, and prove a necessity
of all Bodies being formed out of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
because neither the four Elements
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98859:27"/>
of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> nor the <hi>Tria Prima,</hi>
or three Principles of the Chymists, can
possibly concur to the constituting of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as either the Efficient, or Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Matter; they being themselves but
great disguised Schemes of one and the
same Catholick Matter, <hi>Water,</hi> from
whence they were made, and into which
they are ultimately to be resolved, and
uniformly to be reduced, either by Art,
or Nature. All which assertions I hope
to prove, both by Experiment, and
Reason, and shall likewise endeavour to
strengthen by good and sufficient Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>

Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury to be
the first Principles of all Bodies. And
the last sort, the modern Chymists,
hold Spirit, Oyl, Salt, Water, and

Sealed, which being kept in a

turned into a couple of Diaphanous Liquors,
of different colours, which swam upon each
other; which being distilled together [in
Sand] by a heat of the second degree, it
left the bottom of the glass as clear, as if it
had never been used. The two Liquors of
the Coal might be distilled with the heat of
a Bath, but the dissolving Liquor, [or

remain at the bottom of the Glass, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired

that the aforesaid two Liquors of the Coal,

[which you have heard] in reducing

after all this stress I lay upon these Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
of <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by some, That they not being possessors of
this Liquor, may be allowed to doubt of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98859:30"/>
the truth of what he hath deliver'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it. To which I answer, first,
that I think it no cogent Argument, to
conclude there is no such thing, because
many men are not possessors of it; and
if this should be admitted, all other
Arts and things, that are possessed by any
Man [and not known to the common
people] would be liable to the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
and every Cobler, or Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would conclude the impossibility of
the effects produced by most Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Auromatons, or Engines, because
he either knoweth not, or hath not seen
the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rivance of the thing, or else is
not able to conceive the reason of its
Operation: And if every Man [that
knoweth more than the Vulgar] would
make it his own case, they would, I
suppose, think it an unreasonable and hard
way of judging of things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Man is so consentaneous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="66"/>
to himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his Experiments, that that
very thing to me appeareth an Argument
of his Truth. And as to his veracity in
those things he delivers as matter of fact,
[and upon his own knowledge,] I do
not find that even his Enemies have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
him of Falshood; and I am sure,
I have hitherto found him most true, in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98859:30"/>
whatsoever he hath delivered us as his
own Experience [though possibly many
of those things do not at first sight seem
over-probable.] But lest I may seem
over-partial, I will give you a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of him [that may be <hi>instar omnium]</hi>
and that shall be from a Man, of whom
the World is fully satisfied, not only as
to his candid Temper, but also of his
ability to judge, both of Men, and things;

there is to be found in Nature another Agent,

I have found <hi>Helmont</hi> so faithful a Writer,

that I think it somewhat harsh to
give him the lye, especially to what he delivers
upon his own proper Tryal. And I have

things, and seen some others my self, which
argue so strongly, that a Circulated salt [or
a <hi>menstruum,</hi> such as it may be] may by
being abstracted from compound Bodies,
whether Minerals, Animals, or Vegetables,
leave them more unlocked than a wary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalist
would easily believe; that I dare

               <hi>thus:</hi> Therefore
it is to be Noted, that Nature hath her
passages and Veins in the Earth, which doth
distill waters, either Salt and Clear, or else
turbid. For it is alwayes observable by
sight, that in the Pitts, or Groves of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
sharp, and salt Waters distill down;
therefore while these waters do fall down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
[for all heavy things are carried
downwards] there doth ascend from the
Centre of the Earth, Sulphurous Vapours,
which do meet them. Wherefore if so
be, the waters be saltish, pure, and clear,
and the Sulphurous Vapours pure also, and
both of them do strictly embrace each other
in their meeting, then a pure Metal is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
but in defect of such purity, <hi>[that
is, of the Water, and Vapour]</hi> then
an impure Metal is generated: in Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating

to perfection; and this happeneth either by
reason of the impurity of the Salt, Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Waters, or the impure Sulphurous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.
When these two do embrace each

            <p>

and then put into an Earthen Pot, in the
which he set the seed of a Squash, which
grew very fast, [though planted too late,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Moneth of <hi>May]</hi> it being
watered only with Spring, or Rain-water:
in <hi>October</hi> [by reason of the approaching
Winter] he caused it to be taken up,
and the weight of it, with its stalk, and
leaves, was found to be two pounds,
twelve Ounces; and the Earth [in
which it grew] being baked as before,
it was found to be exactly the same
weight.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="98"/>
               <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Relation is this: He took,<note place="margin">Complex. &amp; Mist. fig. p. 88. ss. 30.</note>
he saith, two hundred pounds weight of
Earth, which was dryed in an Oven, and
putting it into an Earthen Pot, he
moystened it with Rain-water, and in it
he Planted the trunck of a Willow-Tree,
which weighed five pounds, [covering
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98859:39"/>
the Pot with an Iron cover, which had a
hole for the Tree to grow out at,] and
at the end of five years, he took up the
Tree, and found it to weigh one hundred
sixty nine pound, three Ounces; and the
Earth being dryed, was of the same
weight as at first.</p>
            <p>Now if this be throughly consider'd,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="99"/>
from what can we possibly suppose, the
bulk of the Swash, and this great additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of 164. pounds weight to the Tree,
did proceed but from meer water; there
being nothing else added to either of
them? and no doubt, Nature observeth
the same course in producing all other
Vegetables; whether springing up from
their innate Seeds, or transplanted into
other soyls: for the Earth is only a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle

[and to sustain the weight of Minerals,

Bodies are nourished by them, do proceed
only from water: for the Fisher-man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found any food in the stomack of a
Salmon; if therefore the Salmon be made
of water only, [even that of Rivers.]
he is also nourished by it. So the Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
wants a mouth, and appeareth only
with a little hole below in his Throat,
whereby the whole fish draweth nothing
besides water. Therefore every Fish is
nourished, and made of water, if not
immediately, yet at least by Seeds, and
Ferments, if the water be impregnat
therewith. From the Salt Sea every fresh
Fish is drawn; therefore the Ferment
[of the Fish] turneth Salt into. Lastly,
Shell-fish do form to themselves stony
shells of water, in stead of Bones; even
as also all kind of snails do; and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Salt,
which scarce yieldeth to the force of
a very strong fire, groweth sweet by the
Ferment in Fishes; and their flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
volatile: for, at the time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing
the nourishment, it is wholly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98859:46"/>
dissipated, without a residence, or dreg.
So also Salt passeth over into its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Element of water; and the Sea,
though it receive salt Streams, yet is
not every day increased in saltness. So
the most unmixed, and most purest water,
under the Equinoctial Line becometh ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and stinketh: strait-way it getteth
the colour of a half burnt brick, then it
is greenish, then red, and quakesh very
remarkably, which afterwards of its own
accord returns to it self again: truly
this cometh to pass by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Ferment of that place, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consumed, all these appearances cease.
So the most pure Fountain-water grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
filthy, through the musty Ferment
of the Vessel; it conceiveth worms,
breedeth Gnats, and is covered with
a skin. Fenns putrifie from the bottom,
and hence arise Frogs, Shell-fish, Snails,
Horse-Ieaches, Herbs, &amp;c. also swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Herbs do cover the water, being
contented with drinking only of this
putrid water. And even as stones are
from Fountains wherein a stony Seed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists;
So the Earth stinking with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick
Ferments, doth make out of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

a Metalline, or Mineral <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the water being in other places shut
up in the Earth, if it be nigh the Air,
and stirred up with a little heat, it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifieth
by continuance, and is no longer
water, but the juice Leffas of Plants;
by the force of which hory Ferment, a
Fower is conferred on the Earth of bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
forth Herbs. For that putrifying
juice by the prick of a little heat doth
ascend in smoak, becomes spungy, and is
compassed with a skin, because the ferments
therein hid require it. Therefore that
putrefaction hath the office of a Ferment,
and the Virtue of a Seed, and by degrees
it obtaineth some measure of Life, and
hasteneth by the Virtue of its Seeds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Nature of Archeuss. Therefore
this putrid juice of the Earth, is <hi>Leffas:</hi>
from whence springs every Plant not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
visible seed, which nevertheless
bring forth seeds, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinations.
Therefore there are as many
rank, putrid, musty smells, as there are
proper savours of things. For Odors are
not only the Messengers of Savours, but
also their promiscuous Parents. The
smoak <hi>Leffas</hi> being now comprest toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98859:47"/>
doth first grow pale, then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
yellowish, and presently after is of
a whitish green colour, and at last fully
green. And the power of the several
species being unfolded, it gains divers
marks, and different colours: in which
course it imitates the Example of the
water under the Equinoctial Line. Yet
in this it differs, that those waters
have borrowed too Spiritual and volatile
a Ferment from the Stars, and place,
without a Corporal hory putrefaction; and
therefore through their too frail Seed they
presently return into themselves. But
<hi>Leffas</hi> is constrained to finish the Act,
[and obey the Power] of the Conceived
Seed. Therefore Rain Conceiving a hory
Ferment, is made <hi>Leffas,</hi> and is s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

produced by the Ferment which
is Tenant there; by and by it is brought
from thence to the Bark [which is as it
were the Liver of the Plant,] where it
is inriched with a new Ferment of that
part, and is made a Herby, or Woody

            <p>Therefore it is now evident, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="121"/>
is no mixture of Elements, and that
all Bodies primitively, and materially
are made of water, by the help of Seeds,
and their Ferments; and that the Seeds
being worn out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and exhausted by Acting,
all Bodies do at length return into their
Ancient principle of water: yea, that
Ferments do sometimes work more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than fire, because that fire can turn
great stones into Lime, and burn wood
into ashes, but there it stops; but
notwithstanding, if they shall assume a
Ferment in the Earth, they return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

they are all of them of one of these two

            <p>

inflamable Bodies, and therefore to be
Ranked under the Classis of <hi>Sulphurs;</hi>
and may be reduced to water, as I have
shewed you above: Other <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> and
Spirit of Wine it self may.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="130"/> The other sort of Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
are nothing but Volatlle Salts, diluted

with Phlegme or water; and therefore
by repeated distillations, and careful recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
will be brought to constitute
<hi>a Lump</hi> or <hi>Mass</hi> of dry Salt: Wherefore
it is not an other Principle, distinct from

pretend to be the principles of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes,

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="132"/> Besides, it is very much questioned by

<hi>adequate</hi> and fit instrument to Anatomise
Bodies? And whether or no those distinct
Schemes, into which the common Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
resolve the matter of Bodies by
Fire, [and which they call their three

And it may easily be imagined,
that the Fire acting upon a Body that it
can master, [for some it cannot] doth
not only put the small parts, of which that
Body consisted, and which were before
[in some measure] at rest amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
into a tumultuous motion; by
means of which, they are sent hastily off
into the Receiver; but doth also break
by forcing them asunder, those small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

they do conyene together after new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and so the Fire may present us with
new Bodies, which were not prae-existent

which are brought by a very learned man,

Existence of the Chymical Principles in
Bodies, and to prove that they are not
products of the Fire. And I the rather
take notice of it here; First, because
they are not bare ratiocinations of this
Learned mans, but experiments; upon
which he hath built very much: And
Secondly, should I omit to examine these
Experiments, [which indeed do seem
weighty] they might perhaps be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98859:53"/>
rest? From which action of the Fire, the
new body of the Cole resulted: From
which Cole, if it be fluxed with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalizat-Salt,
may be obtained a perfect,
true, and totally inflamable Sulphur, no
way distinguishable from common Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
[as I have often proved:] Which
Brimstone is a body very different from
that of Salt, which the same Cole, if burnt
to Ashes, will yeild us in the room of this
Brimstone. And if it shall be objected,
that this Brimstone is the Oyl of the
Wood or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plant, which this Learned
man is pleased to call the Sulphury Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and which he afterwards tells us
may be obtained [together with an acid
Saline Liquor, upon which it swimmeth]
by distillation from <hi>Guajacum;</hi> if this be
objected, I desire it may be considered,
First, that the Oyl of the wood was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent off into the Receiver; and that
a much greater Stress of Fire is required
to burn the wood into a Cole, then is
needful to separate all its Oyl from it.
And Secondly, that after it hath afforded
all the Oyl which the Fire can make of it,
yet then at last this Brimstone may be
made out of it. And thirdly, that it be
taken notice of, that it is not a sufficient
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98859:54"/>
ground [nay, that it is a liberty not to be
allowed] to give different bodies the
same denomination, because they agree
in some one quality: as this Oyl, and the
Sulphur do in that of Inflammability,
when they differ in so many others, as is
obvious to every man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="137"/> And as to that part of the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alledged by this Learned man; in
the first place, <hi>viz.</hi> that these Concrets,
which yeild in distilling a sower Spirit,
which is [saith he] their Salt volatised,
and brought into the form of a Liquor; and
therefore, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, in vain to be sought
for in their Ashes, in which very little
will be sound: It proveth no more but
this, that according as Bodies are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
made up, so the Fire acts diversly
upon their Matter: As is to be seen in
Wax and Clay, the former of which
the fire melts, and the last it hardens.
Nor doth it appear, that this Saline Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
was such, whilst it recided in the
Concrete, and before the action of the
Fire upon it; any more than it doth, that
there is really, and actually residing in
the body of Wheat, or Barly, before
they be made into Mault, and afterwards
Brewed and Fermented, a vinous, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98859:54"/>
inebriating Spirit: Which when they are
so managed we find there is. But if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
these grains of Barly, or Wheat,
shall be ground into Flower, and made
into Bread, they then become wholesome
Food; of which a great quantity may be
eate without procuring drunkenness,
which their fermented liquors will cause.
And yet from this very substance of the
Grain, which affordeth two such bodies,
as Drink, and Bread; by a different
managing of it, may be made a liquor
which is so far a Corrosive, that it will
draw Tinctures, [which are solutions of
the small parts of bodies] from divers
Minerals, Mettals, and Stones, and that
many times without the help of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
heat. Nor can it with more Justice
be affirmed, that these Salts [whether
fixt, or volatile] were really and in that
form, existing in the wood, or other
Concrete; then it may be said, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that there is actually in Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,
the Flesh, Blood, Bones, Sinews,
Hair, Nailes, &amp;c. of a man; because
we see, that by the action of a humane
stomach, these things are made out of
Bread.</p>
            <p>And as to what is alledged concerning
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98859:55"/>
the Oyl of <hi>Guajacum,</hi> it yieldeth if it be
distilled <hi>per se,</hi> but if it be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>used in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine, it will impregnate it with a
certain <hi>Rozin,</hi> or <hi>Gum.</hi> And the wood
after this Extraction, if it be committed
to distillation, will not then afford the
same quantity of Oyl as before it would
have done: That I easily grant, but then
it will quite destroy the inference for
which this Learned man brings it; <hi>viz.</hi>
That Oyl was in that form a constituant
Principle of the mixt. For there is a
vast difference betwixt <hi>Rozin,</hi> and Oyl,
the one being a firm body that will admit
of pulverisation, the other a fluid, and
unctious body. And besides many other
specifical differences, [which, not to be
tedious, I purposely omit,] The <hi>Rozin</hi>
is a product of Nature, the Oyl, of the
Fire. For the <hi>Rozin</hi> or <hi>Gum,</hi> is to be
seen in the wood before distillation; and
is only taken up, and dissolyed in the
Spirit of Wine, which being evaporated,
it appears again in its own form. But the
Oyl is, I grant, substantially, and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
the same with the <hi>Rozin;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that being for the greatest part, or
totally taken away, the Fire produceth
either lesse, or no Oyl: Because if the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98859:55"/>
               <hi>Rozin</hi> be left in the wood, when it is
committed to the Fire, the Fire doth
spread abroad, break, and new alter the
texture of the <hi>Rozin,</hi> and elevating, and
making a new combination of its parts;
it constitutes that Body which we call
Oyl; which is in this case a real and new
product of the Fire, and was not before
formally Existing in that Body.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="138"/> And it is plain, besides the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before cited, that by a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of one and the same Concrete,
I will cause the Fire to Exhibite very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
substances from it; as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
take any herb, as Wormwood, Mint,
&amp;c. and having bruised them, add Yest
to them, or by any other means, procure
a fermentation in the Matter; and then
commit it to distillation, it will afford you
an Oyl, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inous Spirit [which recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
are both of them totally inflamable]
but if the same herb be bruised, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lie upon the Flore some dayes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fermenting, and if it be thus put to
distillation, instead of yielding a vinous
Spirit, and an Oyl, as the other did; it
will afford an urinous or Armoniack Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
which being carefully rectified, will
coagulate totally into a mass of Salt; and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98859:56"/>
that every man knows, is very different
both from an Oyl, and a vinous Spirit:
For this Salt is not only brittle, but also
absolutely uninflamable.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="139"/> And Lastly, as to what this Author
instances, concerning Vitriol, Saltpeter,
Tarter, and Alome, yeilding of Saline
Spirits, which being poured back upon
their <hi>Caput Mortuums,</hi> do redent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>grate;
and return to the same bodies as they
were before. The matter of Fact I allow
to be true; but withal, must be allowed
to say, that it proveth not what he
brings it for; nor doth evince, that Salt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Sulphur, are principles in all bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for 'tis the effect of their seeds, that forms
these bodies out of water: For Salts som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are the products of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eds; as I have
proved from the regular figures, into
which these Concrete juices do constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shoot; as in Section the Second of this
Discourse. So that it is not strange, that
the smaller parts of these Saline juices,
being by Fire divorced from the grosser,
upon their being put together, do hastily
run into, and lodge themselves in the
cavities of their own bodies, from
whence they were forced by the Fire.
And to conclude, there are many bodies
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98859:56"/>
which the Fire cannot force to confess
they are constituted so much as of two of
the five modern Chymical Principles; as
to instance in Gold, Talk, Silver, &amp;c.
and yet by the operation of the Alkahest,
even these are at last reducible to water,
of which they were made by the power of
seed; and the afore-said Oyls, Salts, and
Concrete juices, are to be all of them
returned to water by the means prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the Fourth Section of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="140"/> And here I must again take notice of
two things, First, that this Learned
Doctors Experiments are all made by
the Fire; which of it self alone I deny to
be a proper Agent, to Analize bodies,
and to discover to us the truth of those
principles of which they are constituted;
and that for these reasons, because it doth
not work uniformly upon all bodies expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to its action; for, as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it cannot of it self separate any one
of these supposed Principles, from Gold,
Talk, Sand, Silver, and many other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;
and yet of some other bodies it
will frame, not only Oyles, Salt, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Ashes, [or Earth, as he is pleased
to call it] but also a Cole, Brimstone,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98859:57"/>
and at last Glass: which three last, no
man I suppose will imagin, were really
existing, in those bodies of which they
are made; and yet are they made by the
same Agent, and from the same Subject,
of which the Fire produced Salts, Oyls,
Ashes, &amp;c. and therefore upon the same
ground, may as justly plead for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of being the constituent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="141"/> The Second thing I would have
considered is this: That those different
Shapes and Appearances, into which the
Fire hath put the matter of any Concrete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

into more simple parts; <hi>viz.</hi> into water,
which is indeed the only, and true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Principle [deservedly so called,]
for it is a primary, and simple body, into
which at last, all Concrets, [and even
the other Four supposed principles of this

and Nature; and of which they were
made. So that we may truly affirm with

of all Concretes: [which therefore are

they say of Fire, Air, Water, and
Earth, all sublunary Bodies are made,
and from the divers mixtures of these,
do arise all generations, corruptions,

to all sorts of Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="146"/> And first for the Element of Fire,
[placed by <hi>Aristotle</hi> under the Globe
of the <hi>Moon,</hi> but never yet seen by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man,] certainly it is nothing else
but Heat; and that we know is caused
by the violent and nimble agitation of
the very minute-parts of Matter: And
though there be Heat, [and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a kind of Fire] in the Bodies
of Animals, yet this is no radical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98859:58"/>
but a product of vital Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The like of which we see is
produced by the sermentation of Wines
in the Barrel, to whose Bung, if the
flame of a Candle be held, the subtil
vapours of the Wine take flame and
burn; which vapours, if they be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
debarred of all vent, they by their
brisk motion, cause an intense heat; and
sometimes burst the Vessels that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them. And this hapneth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Wines, but even to water it self;
for it hath been observed in long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
[which somewhere is also taken
notice of by Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi>] that our <hi>Thames</hi>
water, being kept close stopt, assisted
by the motion of the Ship, and its own
secret fermentation, a Candle being
brought near the vent, upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of it, hath set all the Cavity of
the Vessel into a flame. There is the
like reason for the bursting forth of
flame from wett and closely compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Hay; as also from the Action of
dissolvents upon Mettallin Bodies, &amp;c.
in which action, if the Glasses be stopt,
they break with great violence: From
the incoercible nature of which, we
may conclude, that Fire [if there were
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98859:59"/>
such an Element] can never enter, as
a constituant Principle, into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Bodies; but it is rather,
as <hi>Helmont</hi> stiles it, <hi>destructor seminum,</hi>
the destroyer of Seeds, and is a fitter
Instrument to Analize, and take Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in pieces, by not suffering their
parts to be at rest amongst themselves,
[to which purpose it is generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed]
than to constitute any. And
therefore in this particular, <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
was grosly mistaken, where he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>takes
to teach us a way to separate
the Element of Fire from Bodies, and
afterwards pretends to make a new
separation of Elements from them again.
For, if we will suppose an Element of
Fire, yet if that be further reducible,
it must of necessity lose both the name
and nature of an Element.</p>
            <p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="152"/> But before I take leave of this
subject, give me leave to take notice
of a great mistake in the <hi>Aristotelians;</hi>
who affirm, that Air may be Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted
into water; which change was
never yet performed, either by Nature
or Art. For, if it be to be done, by
their own confession it must be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the means of compression, or
condensation. But compression will not
do the feat, as is manifest by winde-Guns;
in which the Air is forcibly
compressed [into, somtimes the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyeth
part of the space it possessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;]
yet for all that, it is so far from
being Transmuted into water, that by
the help of this Compression, it hath
its Elastick or Springy faculty so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
that it will with as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity
and vigour throw forth a
Bullet, as Gunpowder set on fire would
do.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="153"/> Nor will condensation serve the
turn. For the moysture which we see
affix it self to the walls of Cellars, and
Caves, or any other subteranious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is not Air Transmuted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the
vapours of water lodged in the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Air; which being compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98859:61"/>
by the cold of those places, becoms
drops too bigg, and heavy for the Air to
keep up; and so falling down, they settle
in their pristin shape of water.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="154"/> And as Air is not Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
into water, neither is water into
Air. For it is manifest in distillations,
that though water be converted into
very subtile vapours, yet by the touch
of the cold Air, it returns again into
water as before, and so distils into the
Receiver. And I have shewed above,
that in natures Circulations, though wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be so distended as to become a
most subtile vapour, or <hi>Gas,</hi> it doth
yet constantly at last return, in its own
Shape, to its own fountainwater, from
whence it sprang.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="155"/> From what hath been said, it
will follow, that though we do allow
Air to be a very great Body, and a
considerable part of the Universe, and
also exceeding useful to all Bodies, we
cannot yet afford it to be a material
Principle, or Element, out of which
any sublunary body is Constituted or
Made.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="156"/> Lastly, let us examine whether
the <hi>Earth</hi> have any right to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98859:62"/>
an Element or Principle, of which
Bodies are constituted, For although
the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> [as well as the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>]
pretend to resolve all concretes
into their first Principles by Fire; which
they think they evince, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of burning wood. For, say they,
That which supplies the flame, is Fire.
That which sweats forth of the ends
of the wood, is water; and that which
ascends in smoak, is Air; but that which
remaines fixed [<hi>viz.</hi> the Ashes] after
the Fire hath disbanded the other parts,
is Earth. Yet if we examine this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of theirs, it will be found too
Gloss, to make out what they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Illustrate by it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="157"/> For first, the Phlegme of the
wood is not a simple water; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a sower Salt, and doth both need,
and will admit of a further division to
reduce it to Elementary water.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="158"/> Nor were those parts which are
converted into flame, Fire; but Roziny,
or [as the Chymists phrase it] Oyly,
or Sulphury parts: which I have before
shewed to be far from an Elementary
simplicity.</p>
            <p>Neither is the smoak, which is seen
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98859:62"/>
to arise in the conflagration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Air. For
it will affix it self to the funnel of the
Chimny in the form of Soot; after
which it may be divided into Water,
Oyl, Salt, and Earth, [as they call it.]</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="159"/> And the Ashes [which they are
pleased to take the liberty to call Earth]
every Wash-maid knows, are far enough
from being so; since they are yet so
compound a Body, that they contain
very much of a lixiviate and fixt Salt.
So that in reason it cannot be called
an Element: [For Elements ought to
be pure, and simple Bodies, not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a further reduction into different
parts.]</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="160"/> And here it is necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
my promise, and to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the modern Chymists, after
they have washed the Salt from these
Ashes, do not scruple to call it Earth,
and allow it the place of one of their
five Principles, of which they affirm all
Bodies are compounded, and framed.
But, as I declared before, so I do now
again affirm, that the separating of these
parts from Concrets by the force of
Fire, is not a true <hi>Analisis,</hi> or proper
way of taking Bodies to pieces; and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98859:63"/>
therefore is no Genuine reduction of
them; but a forcing of their parts
asunder by the Fire, by which
new combinations of the parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are made; and consequently the
products of the Fire, are not to be looked
upon as Principles, which were exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Bodies under that form, in which
the Fire presents them us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="161"/> Besides, were Fire an adequate
and proper Agent to dissolve the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Bodies, and to present us with
their real Principles, it would act uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
upon all Bodies, and exhibit
to us the same Schemes of matter, with
certainty from all alike; which it doth not
do. For [as for example] from Gold,
Silver, Talk, Diamonds, Rubies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Stones, Sand, and many other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
who ever separated? not to say
the four Elements, or the five Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Principles, but even any two of
them; and yet if we may credit that
worthy man <hi>Helmont,</hi> all these Bodies,
by the operation of his <hi>Alkahest,</hi> are
to be reduced into simple water, equal
to their own weight. So that this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luent,
must [from the uniformity of its
operation] be allowed to be a much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98859:63"/>
more fit instrument to discover what
Bodies are composed of, then Fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
can be supposed to be. And if we
strictly examine the business, we shall
find, that Earth doth not enter any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Body, as a constitutive Principal
thereof; but indeed Earth, or Ashes,
may help to compose Artificial Bodies,
such as Pots, and Glasses.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="162"/> For all sorts of Earths are but
various Coagulations of water, diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by different Seeds, and Ferments,
and are as much the products of water,
as I have shewed Mineral Salts, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Minerals, Stones, &amp;c. to be. All
which, as <hi>Helmont</hi> assureth us, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to water, by his great Solvent,
[the <hi>Alkahest</hi>] which possibly I have
somwhat more reason to affirm, than I
am willing to declare.</p>
            <p>Earth I confess, to me appeareth to
be the first product of the water, and
is designed by nature as a firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
[or Pedestal] to support the weight
of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals,
and to afford proper Wombs for the
water to deposite its seeds in. For the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="163"/> And that the Earth was the
first product of the water, is confirmed
by the Testimony of <hi>Moses,</hi> in the first
Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> at the <hi>9th.</hi> verse;
where describing the Creation of the
Earth, he says no more but this: <hi>God

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="164"/> From what hath been said, it is
I think, very clearly made out, that
Water, and Seeds, are the true and
only Principles, of which all Bodies
are made, and that neither the <hi>Tria

this general kind of motion doth

               </gap>ying Waters,
and Caves, I have mentioned in the
first Section of this Essay] are no real
Transmutations of those Bodies into
Stone, by the Operation of a Petrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Seed; but that they are nothing
else, but the opposition of certain small
Stony Particles, hid in the Water, to
those Bodies immersed in them; and that
by this means they become Crusted over
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98859:72"/>
with a stony Coat or Bark, and so they
become increased both in Bulk, and
Weight, by continual addition. But if
this were so, then indeed the Leaves,
Wood, &amp;c. cast into these Waters,
would not be really transchanged into
perfect Stony Nature; but only seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
so.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="187"/> Nevertheless, if we look wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the thing, we shall have Cause
to believe, that there is, not only an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of these small Stony particles,
and an incrustation upon the outside of
those things put into the Water; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that the smallest Atomes of the
Wood, Leather, &amp;c. are really Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syed;
in so much, that we can discern
them to be no other then Stones, not
only by our Eyes alone, but by them
assisted with the best Microscopes. Nor
if they be examined by the Fire, will
they make any other Confession: For
they will not burn like Wood, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
like Stones; and though great pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Wood, and Trees, will not be so
soon converted into Stone, as Twiggs,
Leaves, or Moss, are; yet by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Time, great bulkes of Wood
will be Stoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yed totally, both within,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98859:73"/>
and without; so that by these kind of
Waters, bodies are not only Crusted over
with stone, but the Wood, Leaves, &amp;c.
are really and truly changed into Stone.
I do not deny, but that there may be an
affixing of some stony Corpuscles La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in these Waters, which may increase
both the bulk and weight of those things
Changed by them; but that this is all,
that I deny.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="188"/> For, if so, then those Bodies
thus changed, would not be altered into
a true Stony Nature, <hi>per minima,</hi> and in
their smallest parts, internally, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
shews they are; and though
the Expl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cating, how this Change is
Wrought, is somewhat difficult, yet in all
probability it is thus.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="189"/> The Saxeous, or Rocky Seed,
contained in these Waters, [which is
so fine, and subtile a Vapour, that it
is Invisible; as I have before shewed
all true Seedes are,] doth penetrate
those Bodies which come within the
Sphere of its Activity; and by reason
of its Subtilty, passeth through the pores
of the Wood, or other Body, to be
changed: by which permeating those
Bodies, it doth these four things: First,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98859:73"/>
it Extruds the Globuli Aetherai [as the
Cartesians Phrase it] or the Airy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
Lodged in their pores: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it puts the Particles of those Bodies
into a new and different motion, from
that they were in before; by which
meanes they become broken into Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and Sizes, and obtain new and
convenient Situations. Thirdly it intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and Lodgeth it self intimately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the smallest parts of those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
by which meanes their parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawn closer together, they obtain
a greater Weight and Solidity: And
lastly, it Acts as a Ferment, and by
reason of its Contiguity, and Touch
with every small part of the matter it
doth, as Leaven useth to do, [though
mixed with a much greater quantity of
Dough, then it self] Convert the
whole into its own Nature. So also
this Stonifying Seed, by its operating
Ferment, doth transchange every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the matter it is joyned unto, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
perfect Stone; according to its Idea
or Image, Connatural with it self.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="190"/> As to those Conversions of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
into Stone, related in History,
the 13, 15, 16, and 17, of the first
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98859:74"/>
Section of this Essay; they also are
wrought by the same powerful Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a petressent Seed or vapour;
and by the same Circumstances, and
Contrivances: which sheweth, that the
strength and Power of a Petrifying
Seed is above, and beyond all other:
For, other sorts of Seeds do require,
that the subject matter be reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a sequatious juice, or obedient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
and Consequently doth require,
that the Figure, and Shape of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Concrete be destroyed, or else
they cannot Act. But the Petrifying
Seed, the Human, or other Living Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Figure being still intire, without
any intervening putrefaction, or disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the matter, doth transchange
[<hi>Totum per Totum</hi>] the whole,
throughout the whole; that is, as well
the Bones, as the Blood, and Skin: So
that here is not an incrustation of the
Stony matter upon the External parts,
[only] but a real change, intrinsically,
and throughout, of the Bony, Fleshy,
and Sinnewy parts of the Animal into
a stony Substance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="191"/> By the same operations Water
it self is converted into Stone, [<hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:98859:74"/>
by, the power of Petrifying Seeds] as
we may see by the 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
and Fourteenth History of the first
Section: As also doth appear by the
Relation of those that have seen those
Famous Grots in <hi>France,</hi> called, <hi>Les
Caves Goutieres,</hi> where the Drops fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from the top of the Cave, doth
[even in its falling] coagulate before
your eyes into little Stones. Now this
Transmutation of Water into Stone, by
a Petrescent Seed, is not only much
more usual, than the change of other
Substances is, but also much Easier:
For Water is a Primary, simple, liquid,
tremulous Body, consisting of very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
parts, already in Motion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
readily obeying the Command of
all sorts of Seedes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="192"/> Nature is uniforme in her
manner of produceing Bodies, and
therefore, as I have demonstrated in
the body of this Discourse, as she usually,
nay constantly produceth, both Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
Vegetables, and Mettals, from
liquid Principles, viz. Water, so doth
she most commonly Stones; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their becomming such hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
were at sometime in <hi>Principiis
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98859:75"/>
Solutis,</hi> that is, their matter was in a
loose, open, and fluid Forme: And,
as I have shewed, the Spiritual Seedes
of Vigetables, do assimilate, and change
Water, into Mint, Rosemary, &amp;c.
According to the diverse Ideas, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of their peculiar Kindes; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Stony Seedes, do form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Bodies out of Water; and these
of very different Figures, Compaction,
and Colours; and this is done some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
suddenly, sometimes slowly, and
by length of time: Now, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of compaction, and hardness,
that we find in Stones, as also their
sudden or slow Coagulation, depends
chiefely upon the plenty, or paucity of
the stony Seed, or Spirit, in respect to
the quantity of the matter to be wrought
upon, and changed by it. But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Figure, is chiefely to be
referred to the peculiar Nature of the
Seed, and its Idea; [as we see in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals,
and other Stones, which have a
determinate Figure:] and sometimes it
is to be referred to the vessel, or place,
containing the Water, or other Liquor,
before its conversion into Stone, And
for the Colour, that is also chiefely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98859:75"/>
by the operation of the peculiar sort
of stony Seed; which in its working
upon the Water, hath given it a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Texture, and superficies; by
which it reflects and modifies the Light,
after a peculiar manner. But sometimes
it is to be referred also to the Waters
being impregnated with the Tinctures
of some Mineral or Mettallin Bodies,
before its coagulation. As Granets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Tincture of Iron in them; and
therefore are drawn by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
            <p>But to put it out of all doubt, that
Stones were at first Water; [or at
least, some Liquid Matter] I will Cite
a passage or two out of the Works of
my often mentioned, Honourable Friend,
Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Boyl</hi> in his Essay of Ferm. p. 281.</note> His words are these: <hi>And here
I will Confess further, that I have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doubted, whether or no not only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
Bodyes, but some of the most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Ones in the World, may not have been
Fluid in the form, either of Steemes, or
Liquors, before their Coalition and their
Concretion either into Stones, or other
Mineral Bodies.</hi> And then speaking of
the Opinion of some Men, who will
have it, that Stones, and Mettals, [were
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98859:76"/>
indeed Created at the beginning of the
World by God, but that since they]
are neither Made, nor do Grow, and
increase: He further saies [viz. that
they were once in a fluid forme] thus:
<hi>Of this, besides what we elsewhere deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Concerning it, we shall anon have
Occasion to mention some Proofs; and
therefore we shall now only mention two
or three instances: the first whereof shall
be, that we saw, among the rarities of a
Person, exceedingly Curious of them, a
Stone flat on the outside, on one of whose
internal surfaces was most Lively Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Figure of a small Fish, with all
the Finns, Scales, &amp;c. which was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have been inclosed in the Body of
of that Stone, and to have been acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
discovered, when the Stone chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to receive a rude Knock upon its
Edge, split a sunder. I Remember also
that a while since a House-keeper of mine
in the Countrey informed me, that whilest
a little before, he Caused in my absence
one of my Walls to be repaired; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sou,
I was wont to imploy, Casually
breaking a Stone, to make use of it about
the Building, found in it [to his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der]
a peece of Wood, that seemed part
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98859:76"/>
of the branch of some Tree, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
was afterwards inclosed with that
solid Case wherein he found it. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
seemes to me a more cogent Proof
of the increase of Stones, then some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that Eminent Naturalists much
rely on, for reasons discoursed of in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="193"/> And again, he tells us in the
same place, that He hath seen several
large Stones, such as they make Statues
of, that when they were sawed, and
broken, had Caveties in them, which
contained Mettals, and other substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And I my self have observed peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
inclosed in great free Stones. And
it is commonly known, that Spiders
and Toads have been found upon the
breaking of great Stones, inclosed in
their innermost substance.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="194"/>
               <hi>And now I have shewed you,
how agreeable I am with this Learned
Person in this Doctrine concerning the
matter, and growth of Stones; I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
shew you his Opinion, as to their Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
for he says;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Essay of Ferm. P. 275.</note> I know that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profest Chymists, but other persons who
are deservedly ranked amongst the Modern
Philosophers, do with much Confidence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98859:77"/>
entirely aforibe the induration, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the Lapidescence of Bodies, to
a certaine secret internal principal, by
some of them called a Forme, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
a Petrifying Seed, lurking for the
most part in some Liquid Vehicle: And
for my part, having had the opportunity
to be in a place, where I could in a dry
Mould, and a very elevated peice of
Ground, cause to be digged out several Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline
Bodies, whose smooth sides, and
Angles, were as Exquisitly figured, as if
they had bin wrought by a skillful Artist
a cutting of precious Stones; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
also had the opportunity to consider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
exactly or regularly shaped Stones,
and other Minerals, some digged out of
the Earth by my Friends, and some yet
growing upon Stones, newly Torn from
the Rocks, I am very forward to grant
that [as I elsewhere intimate] it is a
Plastick Principal implanted by the most
wise Creator, in certain parcels of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that doth produce in such Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as well the hard Consistance, as the
determinate Figure. Thus far He; Then
which, what more consonant to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
I have asserted in this Discourse?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="195"/> Conclude we then [and I hope
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98859:77"/>
at last upon probable Grounds] since
we have not only the before cited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
both of the best Antient, and
Modern Philosophers; and also are
taught by the experiments, and Manual
Operations laid down in this Discourse,
which shew us the reduction of all bodies
ultimately into Water; and their Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
from thence; as also from
the inaptitude of at least two of the
four <hi>Aristotalian</hi> Elements [<hi>viz.</hi> Fire,
and Aire] to concur to the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Bodies; and likewise from the
Compound Nature, of two of the Old
Chymical Principles, viz. Sulphur and
Salt: and from the same compound Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of four of our moderne Chymists
Principles, viz. Oyle, Salt, Spirit, Earth,
which all of them are further reducible
into Water, and therefore not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for Principles; as I have before
demonstrated: Let us then, I say, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in, and acknowledge the truth of
the Moysaick, Platonick, and Helmontian
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="195"/> That is, that all Bodies consist
but of two Parts, or Priniciples, Matter,
and Seed; that their Universal Matter
is Water: That the Seedes of things do
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98859:78"/>
from this Matter, [by the help of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation]
alter, break, and new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Particles of which it Consists,
till they have formed a Body, Exactly
Corresponding to the Images, or Idea's
contained in themselves: Also that the
true Seedes, of all things, are of a very
subtle Nature, and Invisible, and are
secundary Idea's and Images; and that
they are Connexed to, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Primary Idea's, and Exemplars;
which are Inherent and resident in God
himself: And that for that reason they
Act with Designe, and to a purposed
End, which they constantly, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
Accomplish; and this is somewhat
Analogous to reason in them. Lastly,
that Nature, or the Law of Kind, is
uniforme in its productions thus far, that
it makes all Bodies out of Water, by
the power of invisible Seedes; so that
the Matter of all Bodies is Identically
the same. And that they are all of them
reducible into the same Matter at Last:
But that their Seeds are various, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
produce different Effects upon the
same Matter: yet do they all agree in this,
viz. That they are all invisible Beings,
and all of them have a dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98859:78"/>
their Exemplars, which are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
