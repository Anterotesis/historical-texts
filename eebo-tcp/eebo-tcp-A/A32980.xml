         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gratious, and abundant in
goodnesse and truth, who dost
according to thy will in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Heaven, &amp; rulest over
all the Kingdoms of the Earth;
in whose hand is Power and Might, and none
is able to withstand thy arme; we most vile sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
approach before thy Throne of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling
those manifold transgressions that
have provoked thy wrath and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us. We know, ô Lord, that affliction
cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spring out of the ground, but it is thou that
with rebukes dost chasten man for sinne. We
confesse that we were a wealthy and a carelesse
Nation, and our land was as the garden of <hi>Eden;</hi>
our deliverances were great, and thy blessings
were multiplied; we dwelt alone without feare
of evill, and were become the envy of those
that were round about us. Peace was within
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30671:8"/>
our walles, and plenteousnesse within our Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces.
But when we had eaten and were full,
and had waxen fat, we kicked against thee our
Maker who hadst done so great things for us:
our heart was lifted up &amp; forgot thee our God;
and lightly esteemed the rock of our salvation.
We loathed the Manna that raigned down upon
us; our Peace became a wearinesse, and we
snuffed at our happinesse; we murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Moses</hi> in our Tents, and made light of
thy Anoynted whom thou hadst set over us.
Therefore hast thou recompenced our waies
upon our own heads, and suffered our destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to proceed from our selves: our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
doth correct us; our backsliding doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
us; and our iniquity is become our ruine.
Thou hast broken upon us with a grievous
breach: thy anger hath divided us, and thy fury
hath dashed us one against another. Thou hast
mingled a spirit of perversenesse in the midst of
us; and made us a Nation voyd of Counsell
and understanding: in stead of Peace thou hast
sent bitternesse, and hast sent a fire into our
bowels; and it is kindled round about us. And
now, ô Lord, behold the sword is drunk with
our blood, and we are numbred to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30671:9"/>
the high wayes are unoccupied, and the
Travailers goe through by-paths: our fields are
divided, our inheritance is for a spoile, and our
substance to the robbers. We are become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the foolish People, and Servants bear
rule over us. The mean Man is risen against the
Honourable, and the fire out of the Bramble
devoureth the lofty Cedars, our Women are cast
out of their pleasant places, and the roab is pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off from the aged; there is no respect had to
the Priests, nor favour to the Elders. Thy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries,
even the excellency of thy strength, are
prophaned, and they have defiled the places
where thine honour dwelleth, and yet still the
seat of wickednesse frameth mischiefe by a
Law; and it turneth judgement backward, and
biddeth justice stand a farre off; and deviseth
deceitfull matters against those that are quiet in
the Land. Nay there is a lying Spirit gone out
into the mouth of the Prophets; they prophecy
falsely, and the People delight to have it so, and
they strengthen the hands of evill doers, that
they turne not back from their wickednesse.
Thus are we covered with a cloud in thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and our beauty is cast down to the ground.
But, ô Lord, shall thine indignation be powred
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30671:9"/>
out for ever? shall thy jealousy burne like fire?
O passe by the transgressions of the remnant of
thine Heritage, and take away the rebuke of
thy People. O remove from us reproach and
contempt; and strengthen the spoyled against
the destroyers. Bow down thine eare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the oppression of the poore, the sighing of
the needy, the groaning of the Prisoners, that
are fast bound in misery and iron. Lift up thy
selfe, because of the rage of thine Adversaries:
consider the desolation they have made in thy
Courts, and all that the enemy hath done wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
in thy Sanctuary. And yet still they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with pride, and cloath themselves with
violence as with a garment. How long, ô Lord,
shall they boast themselves in mischiefe? how
long shall they decree unrighteous decrees, and
write grievousnesse which they have prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed?
O make not a full end with us, but correct
us in mercy, though thou leave us not altogether
unpunished. Help us, ô Lord our God, for we
rest on thee, &amp; under the shadow of thy wings
shall be our refuge, untill this Tyranny be over
past. Disappoynt therefore the devices of the
crafty; let not the Rebellious exalt themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, and suffer not the Tabernacles of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30671:10"/>
Robbers to prosper. And as thou hast begunst
to shew thy Servants thy greatnesse, and thy
mighty hand: so continue thy marvailous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindnesse to those who put their trust in
thee. The Battaile is thine, ô Lord, thou hast
preserved us from the Arme of flesh; yea it is
thou that hast wrought all our works in us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when there was no might against that great
Company that came against us. When we were
few in number, and there was none to help us,
then thine own Arme brought salvation, and
thy righteousnesse sustained us. O perfect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy handy worke. Give salvation to Our
King, and deliver CHARLES thy servant from
the perill of the Sword, bind up His soule in the
bundle of life, gird Him with strength to the
Battaile, contend with those who contend
with Him, subdue thou the People under Him,
and suffer no weapon formed against him to
prosper. O deliver Him at length from the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of the People, and lift up His head above
His Enemies round about Him, give Him the
shield of thy salvation, and let thy gentlenesse
make him great: put a stop at last to the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the People: say to the destroying sword,
it is now enough: send us a seasonable and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30671:10"/>
blessed calme: visit us with the joy of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
&amp; make us glad according to the daies
wherein thou hast afflicted us. O restore to us
our solemne assemblies: bring us back into thy
Courts to praise thee, and let us once more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
thee in the beauty of thy holinesse. Save us
ô Lord, from our enemies, and from the hands
of all that hate us. That so we may serve thee
without feare, living a quiet and a peaceable
life, in all Godlinesse and honesty, looking for
the blessed appearance of the great God, and our
Saviour Jesus Christ. To whom with thee and
the Holy Spirit, be all Honour and Praise, world
without end. AMEN.</p>
