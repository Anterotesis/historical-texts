            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen your Stewards made choice of me to this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I laboured to find out, and pitch upon such a subject, as might through Gods blessing, bring most glory to him, edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your souls, and advantage to our Native Country and whereby you might be minded of the Principall ends of your meeting: And as the Lord was pleased to direct me to this ensuing subject, so did he of his infinite mercy appear so far in his own Ordinance, that there generally appeared in you a readinesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in advancing those good works which were proposed to your Christian considerations: It was intended that after dinner a generall subscription should have been promoted amongst you: but by reason of the shortnesse of time, and multiplicity of other businesses wherewith your Stewards were taken up, it was not carried on amongst a fifth part then present: Yet was there more done by those few, then hath been done by any one County of <hi>England</hi> in their late meetings: and amongst the rest of you, Mr. <hi>John Howkins</hi> (whose name I cannot but mention with honour, though he is unknown by face to me) subscribed four score pounds, towards the placing of poor boies born in <hi>Rugbie,</hi> Apprentices in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's pitty so good a foundation should want its superstructure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the request of your Stewards (though I never thought any sermon of mine worthy the Presse) I have adventured to publish this, hoping that the same goood word of God that so warmed your hearts in hearing, may by the same blessing, revive, and quicken your affections in reading, so as to perfect what was then so well begun amongst you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42736:3"/>The names of the Stewards (who are to have the oversight in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of your monies) I thought fit to, set down at the end of this Epistle: Men, I hope without exceptions, whose Prudence, and Fidelity you need not to suspect in the ordering of it. Amongst them Col. <hi>Thomas Clark</hi> at the Kings head within <hi>Algate,</hi> is chosen Treasurer, to whom if you please to send in what it shall please God to move your hearts to contribute to so good a work, I doubt not but as many shall have the benefit, so your own soules will find the comfort of it hereafter.</p>
            <p>Let not any one say that this Sermon might have been preached in <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> where good works are in such request whilst they hope to merit Heaven by them. No, it will rather vindicate our Doctrine from their fowl, and false aspertions whilst they call us <hi>Solifidians,</hi> and charge us as if we preached onely Faith, without good works: whereas on the contrary we still call upon our hearers to shew their Faith by their fruits, and tell them that Faith without works is dead, and can minister no true comfort, and therefore exhort them to grow up to fruitfulnesse which will sweetly seal up their calling to glory, and virtue, as the budding of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 10.</note> did his calling to the Priesthood, yea, we tell them, that if they be new creatures, they are <hi>created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that they should walk in them;</hi> and that if Christ be their Redeemer, he hath redeemed them <hi>from all iniquity, and purifieth them to himselfe a peculiar people,</hi> Zealous of Good<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> works: But I fear to exceed my limits, and therefore my prayer for you all is, that <hi>the God of hope wil fil you with all joy, and peace in believing:<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 13,</note> and make all Grace abound towards you, that ye alwaies having all sufficiencie in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese meetings of Country-men are no new thing, though of late years they have been interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by reason of the sad calamities, and distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed times, which our sins had plunged us into. They have formerly, and may again be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to a twofold benefit, and advantage.</p>
            <p>First, that by acquaintance, and society of Country-men, love might be bred, nourished, and encreased amongst them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That upon consideration of Gods goodnesse, bounty, and mercy to our selves here in this City, we may take occasion to remember the place of our Nativity, and provoke one another to think upon, and do some good works which may conduce, and tend to the publik benefit of the same. Now these being the principall ends of our present meeting, give me leave (Dear Country-men) to bespeake you, as our Apostle doth his Country-men here in my Text.</p>
            <q>Let us consider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works.</q>
            <p>But that we may better understand the occasion of these words, we must look back to what went before: And wee shall find that the principall scope of the Apostle in the former part of this Epistle is to prove that Christ by his Priestly office, and offering up himself a sacrifice to his Father, hath fulfilled, and also abolished all the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Sacrifices; and purchased eternall Redemption for his people: In the former part of this Chapter he sums up this Doctrine in few words, and then tells us what sweet use may be made of the same. As first, that therefore we should be constant in the faith of Christ.

            <p>From the context, as this Verse looks back to the two and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we may gather this proposition.</p>
            <p>That there is no true Faith which is not accompanied with love,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and good works. The Apostle <hi>James:</hi> Chap. 2. Tells us of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Faith: A dead Faith, and a living Faith: A dead Faith is that which consists in words and profession onely without good works. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>What</hi> (saith he) <hi>doth it profit, my brethren, though a man saith he hath Faith; and hath not workes? Can Faith save him?</hi> Hee meanes, such a livelesse, saplesse Faith: For (saith he) <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Faith if it hath not works, is dead being alone:</hi> For (according to the usuall <hi>Maxim</hi>) as Faith justifies our persons, so works justifie our Faith: And <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> chargeth him to teach this Doctrine to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42736:4"/>
his hearers,: <hi>This is a faithfull saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, That they which have believed in God might be carefull to maintain good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore cashieres from the number of true believers all those<note place="margin">Use.</note> rough, and rugged <hi>Esau's,</hi> who, <hi>Salamander</hi>-like, love to live in the fire of contention, and are never well but when they are embroiled in quarrells. Or that instead of provoking to love, do all that they can to make Nationall, and Church divisions by distinctive names, and titles seeking to divide, and subdivide us till they have crumbled us all to pieces. A most Diabolicall sin, who is the Author of Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and among the vulgar is known by his cloven foot: whereas God is the God of Peace: Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace: the Gospell, the Gospell of Peace: Christs Ministers the Ambassadors of peace: and therefore all his people should cry with <hi>David: I am for peace.</hi> Psal. 120. 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all such Solifidians, as boast much of their Faith, but are not carefull to maintain good works. These are barren Figtrees that bear fair leaves of profession without any fruit at all: but when Christ shall come with his basket and turn up their fair leaves, and find no fruit, he will set down his basket, and take up his Axe: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Now also is the axe laid unto the root of the Trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen: down, and cast into the fire.</hi> Or else he will curse them for their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse, as he did that tree. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us consider one another: Hence observe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Christians should with much seriousnesse, and diligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and acquaint themselves each with other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. </hi> But what is it that they are to observe each in other?</p>
            <p>Answ. <list>
                  <item>1. Their gifts, graces, experiences, and virtues to draw them forth for their mutuall benefit.</item>
                  <item>2. Their wants, and weaknesse to pitty, cover, and heal them.</item>
                  <item>3. Their dispositions, and temper, that we may know the better how to deal with them: According to that of <hi>Jud.</hi> verse 22. 23. <hi>Of some have compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore when we meet together we should not squander away<note place="margin">Use.</note> our pretious time in frothy, and idle discourses, or in vain, and fruitless impertinences: but according to the Apostles counsell here: we should <hi>consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.</hi> And this brings me to the principall point, for which I made choise of this Text. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42736:5"/>That it's the duty of all Christians to provoke one another to love,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and to good works; which Point you see consists of two branches: First, that we should provoke one another to love; So did <hi>Abraham</hi> speaking to <hi>Lot. Gen.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Let there be no strife I pray thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and thee, and between my Herdsmen, and thy Herdsmen, for we be bretheren.</hi> And <hi>Joseph</hi> speaking to his brethren. <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 24. <hi>See that yee fall not out by the way.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> speaking to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, saith, <hi>Love the brotherhood.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. What is this love that we must provoke one another to?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. It's a Christian virtue, or Grace infused into us by the Holy Ghost, whereby we sincerely love God for himself, and our brethren for Gods sake. I call it a Christian virtue, or Grace to distinguish it from the<note place="margin">Est ignis ab igne spiritus accensus Pros.</note> naturall affection of love which we bring into the World with us. And from that morall virtue which may be acquired by our own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and industry: whereas this is the work of Gods spirit in us, and an evidence of our future salvation. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>For we know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren,</hi> &amp; <hi>he that loveth not his brother</hi> (with this holy love) <hi>abideth in death.</hi> This love you see hath a two fold Objection. God, and man: The latter I conceive is principally meant in this Text, &amp; therfore I shal speak to that, &amp; it is an uniting, and cementing Grace, that soders mens hearts one to another, as <hi>Jonathans</hi> to <hi>David.</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 1. <hi>The soul of</hi> Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <hi>was knit with the soul of</hi> David, <hi>and he loved him as his own soul.</hi> And this is that which the Apostle exhorts us to. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 2. 4.—<hi>Forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>That their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love.</hi> And this is that for which the Primitive Christians were so famous. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 32. <hi>The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one soul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. What arguments may we use to provoke one another to love?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 1. <hi>Propter praeceptum:</hi> Because of the command of God, and were there no other reason for it, this should be <hi>instar omnium,</hi> instead of all: Because God will have it so: Indeed I may say of this as <hi>David</hi> doth of <hi>Goliaths</hi> sword. <hi>There is none to that:</hi> We see how perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily our Apostle requires it here. <hi>Provoke unto love,</hi> and our Saviour Christ is not lesse urgent. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 34. <hi>A new commandement I give unto you, that yee love one another:</hi> and this precept he backs with the best president: <hi>As I have loved you that ye also love one another.</hi> And that beloved Disciple that seems to be wholly composed of love, doth often inculcate it. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. He would have our love so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to lay down our lives for the brethren, and <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Let us not love in word, neither in tongue</hi> (onely) <hi>but in deed and in truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42736:5"/>
ver. 23. <hi>This is his commandement—that we love one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and Chap. 4. 7. <hi>Let us love one another: for love is of God, and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God,</hi> and verse 11. <hi>If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</hi> and ver. 12. <hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us:</hi> and in diverse other places of his Epistles. But to this, diverse other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be added. As</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Propter unitatem:</hi> Because of that unity, and Onenesse that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us: we are all men; therefore of the same kind: and the Apostle tells us. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. that <hi>God hath made of one blood all Nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth.</hi> Yea more: We are all Christians, and therefore should love one another. Yet more: We are all <hi>English</hi> men, and therefore should love one another. Once again: We are all the same County, <hi>Warwickshire</hi> men, and therefore should love one another: To all which unities may be added one more, if we are the same in truth, as we are in profession, we are all members of the same mysticall body whereof Christ is the head. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>We being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Propter bonitatem, &amp; pulchritudinem:</hi> Because of the goodness, and comlinesse of it. Love is an amiable Grace, as afterwards I shall shew. It's lovely in the eyes both of God &amp; man: Yea, they which want it themselves, yet admire, and love it in others. <hi>Psa.</hi> 133. 1. <hi>David</hi> set's an <hi>Ecce</hi> before it. <hi>Ecce quam bonum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold how good, and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Propter firmitatem.</hi> Because it strengthens us against adversaries: the old <hi>Maxim</hi> is, <hi>Divide, &amp; impera:</hi> They are easie to be ridden by every Usurper, who are first divided amongst themselves: Hence it was that <hi>Micypsa</hi> lying on his death-bead called all his sons together, and caused them to write this sentence in Golden letters. <hi>Concordiâ parvae res crescunt; Discordiâ magnae dilabuntur:</hi> By concord small things are encreased, and strengthned: But by discord the greatest are overthrown.</p>
            <p>And you know the story of <hi>Scillurus,</hi> who likewise calling for his eighty sons upon his death-bed, told them that whilst they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued knit together in brotherly love, like a bundle of darts, or sheaf of Arrows, they would be altogether invincible, but if once disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or severed by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hatred, they would quickly become a prey to their adversaries.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Propter similitudinem:</hi> Because of that likenesse that is amongst us: And, <hi>similitudo gignit amorem:</hi> Likenes breeds love. We see it in all tame, and profitable creatures, who loving each other in regard of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42736:6"/>
likenesse, feed and flock together: <hi>similis gaudet simili,</hi> Like loves his like. And truly we are more brutish then they, if this moves us not to love one another. Indeed it's the property of wild beasts, as of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Bears, Tygres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to love solitude in howling Wildernesses, and to walk abroad alone, and if they meet to intertear one another: But though the great Tyrants of the world <hi>joyne house to house, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>field to field that they may dwell alone.</hi> Yet seeing God hath made us sociable creatures, and Religion hath made us Christians: Let us provoke one another to love.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Propter propinquitatem.</hi> Because of that near alliance, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that is amongst us: If we be reall as well as Nominall Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? we have all one Father: God: One Mother: the Church: One Redeemer: Jesus Christ: One Sanctifier: The Holy Ghost. Are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished at the same breasts: The sincere milk of Gods word: Are heirs to the same Kingdom. The Kingdome of Heaven, and are often told by Gods word, that we are all brethren. Hence the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs that we should <hi>love as brethren.</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 8.</p>
            <p>7. Because it is the best Ornament that we can put upon us: Better then a chain to the neck, or a Ring to the finger. Yea, we should cloath our selves with love as with a Garment. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Above all put on charity, which is the bond of perfectnesse.</hi> But alas! It's now almost out of fashion: Many talke indeed of love, but shew no fruits of it: as some boast of costly Garments in their Wardrobes, or Chests, but wear them not, whereas God hath given us this Garment of love to wear; neither need we fear wearing of it out, as we may other Garments: For it's the better for using, as Gold is for rubbing that shines the brighter: yet, as we are not born with cloths on our back, nor with chaines about our neck: So neither are wee borne with this Grace of love in our hearts, but are by nature <hi>hateful, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another.</hi> Tit. 3. 3.</p>
            <p>8. The sacred Scriptures heap up many motives to stir us up to love: as 1. It will prove us to be true Disciples of our Lord and Master Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, not spurious, nor bastards. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 35. <hi>By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi> 2. It will be a great ornament to our profession, and will beautifie the Gospell of Jesus Christ: <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that in his time the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love amongst Christians was so eminent, and remarkable, that the Heathens taking notice of it, could say, <hi>Ecce quam invicem se di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligunt Christiani:</hi> Behold how loving the Christians are one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. It will declare, and demonstrate the truth of our Faith. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6 <hi>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but Faith which worketh by love.</hi> 4. It shewes that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42736:6"/>
we are translated from death to life. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. and hereby we may know that we are so. Yea, fifthly, Love is the life of God, Angells, and Heaven: Of God, for <hi>God is love.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8. Of the blessed Angels: for there is nothing but love, and concord amongst them. Of Heaven: for that wil perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our love, &amp; put an end to all the differences which are too rife even amongst Gods own people in this world: when holy <hi>Gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> lay upon his death-bead, he told a friend that came to visit him, that he was going to that place, <hi>ubi Luthero cum Zuinglio optime <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>convenit,</hi> where <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> agreed well, though they could never agree upon earth. 5. In regard of the eternity of this grace it is that the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. tells us, that <hi>charity never fails;</hi> and in this regard prefers it before Faith, and Hope. verse 13. <hi>Now abides Faith, Hope, and Charity, but the greatest of these is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> 6. It's a signe we walke by the light of Gods Word, and spirit. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</hi> 7. This Grace is of God, and sheweth that we are born of God. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Let us love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God.</hi> 8. Without this Grace of love no duty is accepted though never so difficult, or specious in the eyes of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> 9. Love will draw love from others: <hi>Cos Amoris amor</hi> Love is the whetstone, or Load stone rather of Love; <hi>ut ameris Ama:</hi> If you would be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of others, you must love others. Love is a coin that must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in its own kind: the excellent properties of it are further set forth by the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. 5. <hi>&amp;c. Charity suffereth long, and is kind,</hi> &amp;c. But we must remember (as was said before) that love comes from God, and therefore must be begged of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 7. All these things considered, will furnish you with arguments enough wherewith to provoke both your selves and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to love. Especially if on the contrary we do but remember what evills are attributed by the spirit of God to the contrary vice of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>He that hates his brother is in darknesse, and walks in darknesse.</hi> 1. John 3. 15. <hi>Who soever hateth his brother is a murderer, and we know that no murderer hath eternall life abiding in him.</hi> 1 John 4. 4. 20. <hi>If any man say, I love God and hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a liar: For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</hi> And thus I have opened, and proved the first part of my Doctrine, I am come now to the second.</p>

            <p>Now in the prosecution of this <hi>Thesis,</hi> or Position, we shall dispatch three things. First, to speak something by way of explication. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by way of confirmation. Thirdly, by way of Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. First, for Explication, we shall answer severall <hi>Queries.</hi> As</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. What work may be called good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p> Answ. There are three ingredients required to make up good works.</p>
            <p>1. They must be good <hi>materialiter,</hi> or in the matter of them: They must be such things as are either commanded, or at least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by God. Else he will say unto us, <hi>Who hath required these</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aa. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>things at your hands?</hi> There are indeed many actions which glister much in the eyes of the World, and yet are an abomination in the eyes of God. As the Popish Fastings, Pilgrimages, Bead-prayers, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Prayers to God by number, not by weight; of which I may say as the Apostle. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Which things indeed have a shew</hi> of wisdom in Will-worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body, and yet the Lord abhors them.</p>
            <p>2. They must be good <hi>quoad fontem,</hi> they must proceed from a right principle: A good heart, a pure conscience, and faith unfeigned. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Now the end of the Commandement</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is Charity out of a pure heart,</hi> &amp;c. Charity we know is a work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by God: and yet it's not accepted except it come from a good Fountain, a good heart, and a pure conscience. For the same Apostle tells us. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled, and unbelieving is nothing pure: because their mind, and conscience is defiled.</hi> He tells us also, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. that <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God;</hi> and therefore all works, though materially good, if done by unbelievers, they are but <hi>splendida peccata,</hi> as the Father said: But specious and glittering sins.</p>
            <p>3. They must be good, <hi>quoad finem:</hi> They must tend to a right end. <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God in our own, and the salvation of others. <hi>Christus opera nostra non tam actibus, quam finibus pensat:</hi> saith <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:</hi> God doth not so much judhe of, and weigh our works by the actions as by the ends: The want of a right end made <hi>Cain's</hi> sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> zeal, and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Fastings, and Prayers, and Almes abomination to the Lord, who searcheth the heart, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 2. &amp;c.</note> the reins, and knows all our thoughts a far of. Wee must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look well to our end in all our works, and see, that as the Sun
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42736:7"/>
puts out the light of the fire, so the glory of God puts out all other selfish ends whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. But what good works should we provoke one another to upon this occasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ.The most seasonable is at this our feast to remember the place of our Nativity, the Country where we were born, and to doe some good for that. I shall humbly propose these good works to your Christian considerations. First, laying down this Position: That the chiefest work of mercy is that which tends to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting and enriching of other mens souls: The Gospel indeed hath (through Gods mercy) been preached, and professed in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> ever since the first reformation in King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth his daies of glorious memory, and many blessed Martyrs suffered there for the truth under that <hi>Marian</hi> Persecution which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As sincere <hi>Sanders,</hi> gracious <hi>Glover,</hi> and many others. I could also name unto you many famous lights set up in the Candlestick of <hi>Warwickshire</hi> in the reign of our three late Soveraignes: besides such as are now there living; So that that Country hath been a <hi>Goshen,</hi> when many other parts of the Nation have been in a <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merian,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> darknesse; Yea, give me leave to tell you that which it may be you have not formerly taken notice of, that in <hi>Warwickshire</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 1519. the little Park by <hi>Coventry</hi> was perfumed with the odours of six of the Saints bodies burned in it upon one day for their profession,<note place="margin">See my English Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. <hi>pag.</hi> 64.</note> and perseverance in the truth: Besides diverse others which suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not long after: So that it appears, that before the name of <hi>Luther</hi> was heard of in the Christian world, Religion was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in our Native Country. Yet</p>
            <p>1. Are there not some blind, and barren places in the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verspread with Popery, and profanesse, where the people perish for lack of Knowledge, and that for want of a godly, able, and faithfull Ministry: And that for want of meanes to maintain such amongst them? And may we not some way or other be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall this day to help them to the bread of life, where we first drew in our breath of life?</p>
            <p>2. Is there not a great want of Schools in some parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby the poorer sort of Inhabitants, who cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their children abroad at publick schools, are disabled to breed them up in Knowledge, and learning as otherwise they might, and would do?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42736:8"/>3. Are there not many Widdowes, and Orphans of godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Christians, whose husbands, and Parents have been rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and undone in the late plundering times, (<hi>Warwickshire</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving born as great a share therein as most Counties in <hi>England</hi>) and whose present, and pressing necessities cry aloud unto us for reliefe, and pitty?</p>
            <p>4. Are there not many hopefull youths whose Parents are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to send, and place them in this City, who might be far more serviceable to God, and their Country, (as your own experience manifesteth) And may there not be some stock of monies raised for the taking of, and placing forth such, and when they come out of their time to lend unto them <hi>gratis</hi> upon good security for a certain time, which might enable them to live comfortably all their life after? Christian friends, I take not upon me to prescribe which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or how many of these shall be taken into your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but surely to further such good works will be very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and worthy our present meeting: Let us therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of my Text, Provoke one another to love, and to good works.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But who are they that must do such good works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 1. It's a duty that most especially is incumbent upon rich men, the Scripture every where calling upon them to be rich in good works, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy: That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, willing to communicate:</hi> For God gives them not riches to hoard up, and to lie by them, but to do good with them: and for this cause there are poor alwaies with us, that rich men might never want objects of their charity, and liberality, whereas the earth being the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof, he could make all rich, but he will not do it: as <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 7. Our Saviour Christ tells us. <hi>The poor ye have alwaies with you, and whensoever you will, you may do them good.</hi> Yea, we must do good unto them, and if we have any love to God, wee cannot but expresse it by shewing our love this way to his poor members. For 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Who so hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother hath need, and shuteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> By which interrogation is implyed a more vehement negation: <hi>viz.</hi> that certainly the love of God dwelleth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42736:8"/>
not in such a man. Yea, the Apostle <hi>James</hi> thundereth against such mercilesse, and hardhearted rich men, as are nothing affected with the miseries, and wants of their poor brethren. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>He shall have judgement without mercy that sheweth no mercy.</hi> As we see in the example of the rich man in Hell that was denyed a drop of water, because he had denied to relieve poor <hi>Lazarus: Non habuit guttam, quia non dedit micam,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi> He had not a drop of water, because he had denyed a crumb of bread. What good then will all your riches do you, whilst gaining the world you lose your own soules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, I desire covetous rich men often to read that flaming Text. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Go to now yee rich men, weep, and howl for the miseries which shall come upon you: Your riches are corrupted, and your garments motheaten: Your gold, and silver is cankred, and the rust of them will be a witnesse against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire, ye have heaped up treasure together for the last daies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Yet the poorer sort also must give something out of their poverty: For there are none of us here present that are so poor but there are others poorer, and in such a case we must remember the widdow. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. 42. <hi>Who cast in two mites, which make a farthing:</hi> and see how gratefull this was unto Christ, who did not onely take notice of it, and commend it to his Disciples; but hath left it upon record to her everlasting credit, that <hi>she of her want did cast in all she had,</hi> even <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>All her life,</hi> or livelyhood. How also doth the holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> commend the poor <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> for their Bounty to their poor brethren in <hi>Judeah.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. 2, 3. <hi>That in a great triall of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, abounded unto the riches of their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity. For to their power (I bear record) and beyond their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they were willing of themselves:</hi> where we see their poverty was no hindrance to their liberallity towards those that were poorer then themselves: And though such persons have little to give, yet let them give a little of that little, and they shall not lose their reward. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Whosoever shall give to drink, to one of these little ones a cup of cold water onely, in the name of a Disciple, verily I say unto you (saith Christ) he shall in no wise lose his reward.</hi> Ye know how the Lord blessed the poor widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> for relieving the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> in his wants 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42736:9"/>3. But suppose thou hast nothing to give (though it can hardly be supposed) yet look upon the wants of thy native Country, and contribute prayers for those that are in misery there. This will cost thee nothing out of thy purse: Yea bleed over their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 10.</note> and let the bowels of thy compassion erne over them. <hi>Et si nihil al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It was the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations<note place="margin">See his life in my first part of Lives. <hi>p.</hi> 97. <hi>Eodem</hi> p. 100.</note> of <hi>Ephrem Syrus,</hi> that when he had nothing himselfe to give to the poor, by his sweet, and attractive sermons, he stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the hearts of others to relieve them. The like we read of Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> that in the time of a Famine he sold his Lands, and all his other goods to relieve the poor, and stirred up other rich Merchants by Scripture and sweet speeches to contribute to their necessities.</p>
            <p>Thus having answered such objections as might lie in the way to obstruct, and hinder your bounty, and liberality at this your meeting: I am come in the next place to give you some motives, and arguments why you should take this present opportunity of provoking one another to good works for the publick benefit of our Country.</p>
            <p>1. Consider how much it may tend to the advancement of Gods glory, when thanksgivings are returned by many unto God in your behalf. The <hi>Italians</hi> boast that <hi>Italy</hi> is the Garden of the World, and <hi>Tuscany</hi> the Garden of <hi>Italy:</hi> How much trulier may I say that <hi>England</hi> is the Garden of the World? For if <hi>Italy</hi> abounds with superfluities? I am sure that <hi>England</hi> much more abounds with all manner of necessaries for the life of man: It being a land (as <hi>Palestine</hi>) flowing with milk and hony, which is the glory of all Lands: and wherein God feeds us with the fat of the kidneies of Wheat: Or if <hi>Italy</hi> abounds, or exceeds us in temporalls! I am sure <hi>England</hi> far exceeds in spiritualls, being a <hi>Goshen,</hi> whist the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42736:9"/>
is an <hi>Egypt:</hi> A Land wherein (through Gods infinite mercy) we enjoy the light of the glorious Gospell of Jesus Christ, whilst <hi>Italy</hi> sits in darknesse, and in the region, and shadow of death: And as they call <hi>Tuscany</hi> the Garden of <hi>Italy,</hi> I may call <hi>Warwickshire</hi> the Garden of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>England</hi> Epitomized in the Woodland, and Fielden parts of it: the one abounding with flourishing, and fruitfull Pastures, for Dairies: the other with rich, and fertill Arable Land for corn. Yet this Garden in some places of it wants weeding, and some tender Plants want nourishment, and if God shall please to make you this day instrumentall for the promoting of either, or both these works, I may say with the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>The administration of this service will not onely supply the wants of the Saints; but will be abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God in your behalf:</hi> Give me leave therefore to bespeak you in the words of <hi>Cyprian, Ne dormiat in Thesauris tuis, quod Pauperi prodesse potest:</hi> let not that sleep, &amp; rust in thy Treasury, which may be profitable to the poor. And again, <hi>Quod aliquando de necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te amittendum est, sponte pro Divina remuneratione distribuendum est.</hi> That which a man must sometime necessarily part with: Its wisdom for him to distribute it so, that God may everlastingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him.</p>
            <p>2. Consider how exceeding advantagious your liberality in this kind wil be to your selves, seeing hereby you make God your debtor. <hi>Pro.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>He that gives to the poor, lendeth to the Lord.</hi> Yea, <hi>Faeneratur Domino,</hi> he lends upon Usury, and the Lord binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to repay it: and in that text gives him security under his owne hand for it. <hi>That which he hath given will he repay him again.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word implies that he will do it fully, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: Mostly in this world, but infallably in the world to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest. But how doth the Lord use to repay such mercy, and good works?</hi>

Observe (I beseech you) what God by <hi>Solomon</hi> hath promised. <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>The liberall soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth, shall be watered also himself.</hi> And what the Prophet <hi>Esay C.</hi> 58. 10, 11. <hi>If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfiest the afflicted soul: then shall thy light arise in obscurity, and thy darknesse be as the noon day: And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfie thy soul in drought, and</hi>

               <hi>make fat thy bones: And thou shall be like a watered Garden, like a spring of water whose waters fail not.</hi> And what by the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. Psal.</hi> 112. 9. <hi>He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousnesse endureth for ever: his horne shall be exalted with honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. With variety of Temporall blessings: For God usually blesseth such.</p>
            <p>1. In their outward estate, encreasing that. <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>There is that scattereth, and yet encreaseth: and there is that withholdeth more then is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</hi> Bounty (saith one) is the most compendious way to plenty; neither is getting, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the best way to thrift. For in works of mercy, and charity, our scattering is increasing, no spending, but a lending, no laying out but a laying up. <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 24. The Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> the second,<note place="margin">See my Mirrour in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> being a valiant, godly, and liberall Prince, the more bountifull that he was to the poor, the more his riches encreased; so that hee had such quantities of Gold, Silver, and pretious things as none of his Predecessors ever attained the like. I suppose you are not strangers to that story, of a certain godly, and charitable Bishop of <hi>Millain,</hi> who journeying with his servant, was met by some poor people that begged an Almes of him: The Bishop commanded his man to give them all that little mony that he had, which was three Crowns: But his servant thinking to be a better husband for his Master, gave them but two Crowns, reserving the third for their expences at night. Soon after certain Noble men meeting the Bishop, and knowing him to be a good man, and liberall to the poor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two hundred Crowns to be delivered to the Bishops ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for his Masters use: The man having received the mony, ran with great joy, and told his Master of it: Ah, said the Bishop, what wrong hast thou done both to me, and thy selfe? <hi>Si enim tres de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disses, trecent as accepisses:</hi> If thou hadst given those three Crowns as I appointed thee, thou shouldst have received three hundred: As <hi>Melancthon</hi> relates the story. And indeed such open-handed, and openhearted Christians have more then once Gods word of promise for such an ample retribution. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 7. <hi>If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you a poor man of any of thy brethren, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother:</hi> ver. 8. <hi>but shalt open thine hand wide unto him.</hi> ver. 10. <hi>Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all thy works; and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi>

41. 2. The Lord promiseth such a mercifull man that <hi>he shall be blssed upon the earth:</hi> He shall not onely have the upper (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but the nether springs: Hee shall be blessed with the dew of Heaven, and with the fatnesse of the Earth.

            </p>
            <p>2. The Lord hath promised them safety, and protection in peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and dangerous times. <hi>Ps.</hi> 41. 1, 2. <hi>Blessed is he that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the poor: The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble: The Lord will preserve, and keep him alive, and thou wilt not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him unto the will of his enemies.</hi> Again, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 8. <hi>The glory of the Lord shall be his rereward,</hi> For his safety, and defence against dangers. <hi>Paulinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nola</hi> having consumed all his estate,<note place="margin">Paulus Diaconus.</note> in redeeming poor Christian Captives: at length having nothing left, pawned himself for a certain widdowes Son: but the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (moved with his goodnesse, and charity) returned him home, and many Captives with him freely</p>
            <p>3. The Lord will support, and comfort such with Divine consolations upon their bed of sicknesse, when all worldly, and creature comforts fail them; and when such soul-ravishing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are more worth then all the world. <hi>Psa.</hi> 41. 3. <hi>The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing, thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. Ps.</hi> 112. 4. unto such <hi>there ariseth light in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> v. 7. <hi>He shall not be affraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord.</hi> Yea, see that sweet promise. <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 9. <hi>Then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer; Thou shalt cry, and he shall say, here I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. You may hereby make God your debtor at death to send his blessed Angels to guard, and transport your soules through the territories, and regions of the Prince of the aier into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom. According to the counsell of our Saviour Christ. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Make to your selves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousnesse, that when you fail they may receive you into everlasting habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Hereby indeed we shall do as the blessed Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth us. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>Lay up in store for our selves a good foundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the time to come that ye may lay hold on eternall life.</hi> And for our further encouragement, let us remember what wise <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Cast thy bread up on the waters: for thou shalt find it after many daies.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42736:11"/>5. Yea, such liberall-hearted persons after death leave a blessed memoriall behind them: and <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 1. that<note place="margin">Ps. 112. 6. 9.</note> 
               <hi>a good name is better then pretious ointment:</hi> yet that will leave a sweet sent in the room when it is removed: How much more shall the name of such mercifull men be continued? See it in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of good <hi>Obadiah,</hi> who took the Lords Prophets, and hid them<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 13.</note> by fifty in a Cave, and fed them with bread and water. How sweet is the memoriall of that mercifull Proselit <hi>Cornelius?</hi> whose prayers,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 2</note> and Almes as they were had in remembrance before God, So are they recorded in the sacred Scriptures to his everlasting commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.<note place="margin">Act. 9. 36.</note> The like may be said of <hi>Dorcas,</hi> and many others. Our own Histories likewise furnish us with plentifull examples of this kind: As of Master <hi>Bradford, Georg Wiseheart, Giles</hi> of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> Doctor<note place="margin">See my Mirrour p. 117. &amp;c</note> 
               <hi>Tailor,</hi> Master <hi>Fox,</hi> Master <hi>Hooper;</hi> and of later time, the young Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wheatley</hi> of <hi>Banhury,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. Lastly, God is made a debtor to such to blesse their posterities after them: To such saith the Lord. <hi>Is.</hi> 58. 12. <hi>They that shall be of thee shall build the old wast places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations: and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach:</hi> And <hi>Psa.</hi> 112. 2. <hi>His seed shall be mighty upon Earth: the generation of the upright shall be bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Neither do we want examples of Gods faithfull performance of this promise: How well did <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> fare for the mercy which his Father <hi>Jonathan</hi> shewed to <hi>David?</hi> And what said <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> who had mercifully fed him, and his wearied men when he fled from <hi>Absolon?</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 38. <hi>The King answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Chimham</hi> (thy son) <hi>shall go over with me, and I wil do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do.</hi> I shall onely adde one famous example of our own: Queen <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> wife to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, was a very charitable woman, she used to carry a little purse about her for the poor, thinking no day well spent, wherein some had not fared the better at her hand: She also kept her maids, and such as were about her in working, and sowing garments for the poor; and see how the Lord dealt with her, in her onely child our renowned Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> whom the Lord wonderfully delivered from<note place="margin">See her life in my 2d. part of Lives.</note> death in the Reign of her Sister Qu. <hi>Mary,</hi> and after advanced her to the Throne, preserved her from the rage of <hi>Rome, Spain,</hi> and the Devill, giving her a long life, and glorious Reign to the comfort of her friends, and terror of her enemies.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewed you how by your charity, and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42736:11"/>
you make God your debtor, though, <hi>non ex merito,</hi> yet <hi>ex promisso,</hi> not out of merit (as the Papists teach) yet by vertue of his promise, which (we use to say) is due debt: Now I proceed to give you some further Motives and arguments to quicken you to this duty.</p>
            <p>3. Wee should therefore take the present opportunity of doing some publick good for our Country, because we know not how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a while we may enjoy our estates: We have of late seen Civill Warr, and plundering times wherein many of plentifull means have been suddenly brought to poverty: and sure I am, that the same sins which brought down those judgements are still common. Yea, I fear, I may truly say, that instead of amendment we wax worse, and worse, and our provocations are greater then formerly: Why may we not then expect some sweeping, and desolating judgement to be impendent over our heads? and should we by a generall, or some particular hand of God be emptied of that fulnesse which we now enjoy, we shall then be disabled to do such good works though we would: But me thinks I hear some objecting, and saying,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that because we know not how little a while we shall enjoy what we have, its therefore good to make much of it whilst we have it, and to lay up against a rainy day?</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that the spirit of God which is much wiser then we, hath made the contrary inference. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Give</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>a portion to seaven, and also to eight, for thou knowest not what evill shall be upon the Earth:</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul. Gal.</hi> 6. 10. Bids us whilst <hi>we have opportunity to doe good to all men: but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the houshold offaith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It's the readiest, and surest way to obtain mercy from God in our need, if we carefully, and conscienciously relieve others in their needs: we have Christs own testimony for this. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy:</hi> And the same is largely held forth by the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. from 7. to 13. as before.</p>
            <p>5. It will afford much inward peace, and comfort: For as light and influence accompanieth the Sun: and as heat goes along with the fire: and as every flower hath its peculiar sweetnesse: So every good work carries meat in the mouth, comfort in the performance. <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 15. <hi>It's joy to the just to doe judgement.</hi> The like may bee said of works of mercy: It will afford joy to them that doe them: whereas cruelty, and unmercifullnesse shall be a sting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42736:12"/>
in the consciences, and a dagger at the heart of those that are guilty thereof.</p>
            <p>6. God expects that like the Tree of <hi>Life</hi> mentioned. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 21. we should bring forth fruit every moneth. That wee should be like the <hi>Lemon</hi> tree that ever and anon sends forth young <hi>Lemons,</hi> so soon as the other fal off through ripenesse. Or like the <hi>Egyptian Figtree,</hi> which <hi>Solinus</hi> speaks of, which beareth fruit seven times in the year. Or, <hi>more perennis aquae:</hi> Like Fountaines which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually send forth fresh streames of water. But alas! most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on the contrary are like unto the <hi>Cypresse</hi> tree that is fair, and tall, but altogether fruitlesse: Or like that Figtree mentioned in the Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 6, 7. <hi>A certain man</hi> (said Christ) <hi>had a Figtree planted in his Vineyard, and he came, and sought fruit thereon but found none. Then said he to the dresser of his Vineyard,</hi> (mark the doom of such) <hi>Behold these three years came I seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit on this Figtree, and find none; Cut it down: Why cumbreth it the ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Lastly, God will make honorable mention of such merciful, and liberall persons at the day of judgement where your labour of love shewed to the poor members of Jesus Christ shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35. <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred and yee gave me meat: I was therstie and yee gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked and yee clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in Prison, and ye came unto me:</hi>—verse 40. <hi>In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>

            <p>Therefore it exhorts us all here present to improve this our<note place="margin">Use.</note> meeting, as the Apostle adviseth us here, <hi>To provoke one another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to love, and to good works.</hi> But many think that it will be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them to think of doing good works when they come to make their Wills before their death. Truly I will not discourage men from this duty at any time: But give me leave to tell you in the words of a Reverend Divine: Good works (saith he) done at a mans death are like a dark-lanthome that gives light only to those that come after it: but good works done in a mans life, are like a torch that equally gives light both to those that go before, and to those that follow after it. Yea, defer it not till another year, as some would perswade, for you know not whether ye may live

till an other year. Yea, what saith the Apostle, <hi>I am.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Ye know not what shall be on the morrow: For what is your life? It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take therfore the present opportunity: as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts you. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Non semper estas erit:</hi> Summer will not last alwaies: <hi>Post est occasio calva:</hi> A pretious opportunity once lost, may never be recovered again. <hi>Bis dat qui cito dat.</hi> He that gives speedily, gives twice. Remember <hi>Solomons</hi> advice. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Say not to thy neighbour, goe, and come again, and to morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee.</hi> Remember how gratefull a Sacrifice it is to God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>To do good and to distribute forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</hi> Hence <hi>Cyprian, Qui Pauperi Eleemosynam dat, Deo suavitatis odorem sacrificat,</hi> He that give an Almes to the poor, offers a sweet smelling sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God, and the same Father tells us, that <hi>Dives sine Elee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosyna,</hi> arich man without alms is one of the great absurdities in the life of man: And saith <hi>Gregory Nyssen:</hi> There is no excuse for hardheartednesse: For where can a rich man cast his eyes, but he may behold objects for his charity. As the husbandman casts some of his corn into a fruitfull soil, whereby in due time he reaps with advantage. So do you with your worldly blessings, sow them in the bowells, and on the backs of your poor Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, members of Christ, and in the day of Harvest you shall find a great encrease. Onely by way of caution let me give you this advice: Sow not sparingly. For 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>He which soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly; And he that soweth bountifully; shall reap bountifully.</hi> And <hi>Pro.</hi> 22. 9. <hi>He that hath a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eie shal be blessed: for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</hi> Hence <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight, and</hi> verse 6. <hi>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand.</hi> But especially remember the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 38. <hi>Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over shall men give into your bosom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For with the same measure you mete withall, it shall be measured to you again.</hi> Again Give not grudgingly: <hi>Every man</hi> (saith the Apostle. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 18</note> 7.) <hi>according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him giveu <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot grudgingly, or ofnecessity: For God loveth a cheerful giver.</hi> Rom. 12. 8. <hi>He that sheweth mercy must do it with chearfulness.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42736:13"/>
They must be <hi>ready to distribute, willing to communicate:</hi> And for your further encouragement herein, I am requested to give you notice, that what God shall stir up your hearts to contribute at this time, shall be faithfully imployed to good uses by your Stewards, who will be accountable to you for the same at the next Feast. Consider what hath been spoken, and the Lord stirre up your hearts to provoke one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother unto love, and to good works.</p>
