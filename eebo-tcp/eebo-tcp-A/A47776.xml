            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The coming of <hi>Eliſa</hi> breaks off their diſcourſe. <hi>Eliſa</hi> acquaints <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace</hi> wth her dream, and ſhe gives her her thoughts upon it. Walking together in the Garden of the Palace they over-hear the complaints of a fair Slave that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon <hi>Eliſa:</hi> Their curioſity prompts them to a further diſcovery, and upon their requeſt ſhe relates the ſtory of her life: She ſpeaks her name <hi>Olympia,</hi> and herſelf daughter to <hi>Adallas</hi> King of <hi>Thrace;</hi> Her own brother falls in love with her, and diſcovers his inceſtuous deſires, which ſhe entertains with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and amazement; She oppoſes his paſſion with all the ſtrength of Vertue and Reaſon, but in vain: She acquaints her Father with it, who ſharply reproves him, and reſolves to diſpoſe of her, but is prevented

               <hi>Candace's</hi> cares, though not ſlight ones, were yet more moderate than <hi>Eliſa's</hi> ſadneſs, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance which was freſh in her mind, that ſhe had ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the greateſt part of her grief, and ſhe was a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more ſatisfied to ſee her beloved Prince eſcaped from the dangers wherein ſhe had left him at her departure from <hi>Meroe,</hi> than ſhe could be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at the loſſe of her dominions, or with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects of her misfortune, which would have produced greater reſentments in any other ſpirit but hers. Notwithſtanding, if her mind found any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the knowledge that <hi>Ceſario</hi> was living, that he was not far from the place of her abode, and that by the report of thoſe whom <hi>Cornelius</hi> had ſent to his aſſiſtance, ſhe had learned, that together with his valiant companions, he was victorious in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat wherein ſhe had left him ingaged; ſhe could not baniſh her fear, which continually repreſented to her, that he was not eſcaped out of ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter without wounds, and her love making all things appear in the moſt dangerous condition, ſhe beleeved ſhe ſaw every moment her beloved Prince all wounded and bloody, and reduced to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his life.

               <hi>ever. Alas! 'tis poſſible that at this very moment whilst I spend my life in ſuch cruel apprehenſions, the unfortunate Prince draws near his end, and is breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that faithfull ſoul, which he had beſtowed upon me to his misfortune, and the glory of my days. Ah! if my fears be real, ye p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tyfull Heavens do not permit me to ſurvive him one minute, or if he be ſtill Maſter of any remainders of life, to imploy them in the reſearch of a Princeſſe, who is more happy in his love, than unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in the accidents of her life, guide his ſteps hither for pitie's ſake, and do not ſuffer us to live in this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein abſence entombs us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſhe ſpake theſe words, her eyes performed what her mouth could not abſolutely expreſs, and <hi>Clitie</hi> who ſtayed by her to dry up her tears, could have no ſucceſſe in comforting of her, but by recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things paſt to her memory, and by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to her the advantagious difference there was between her preſent condition and that wherein ſhe ſaw her ſelf a few days before, both in reſpect of the ſecurity of her own perſon, and of her beloved <hi>Ceſario.</hi> They conſulted then together what courſe they ſhould take to learn news concerning that Prince; and they could find no other expedient than to ſeek ſome perſon in whom they might have the confidence to ſend him to <hi>Tyridates</hi> his houſe, hoping that by the means of that Prince they might have ſome intelligence either of <hi>Ceſario,</hi> or <hi>Eteocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this fair Queen was troubled with fome diſquiets, whereunto her long ſufferings might have already inured her ſpirit, ſhe cauſed as many in the mind of a man, who a few days before had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46404:7"/>
paſſed his life in liberty enough, and the ſoul of <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> had ſo deeply received the dart which the Princeſs had fixed there, that in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his love he felt himſelf as much inflamed, as if he had already beſtowed whole years upon this dawning paſſion. At firſt he was filent, out of the reſpect which the Majeſty of <hi>Candace</hi> might imprint upon the moſt licentious ſpirits; but afterwards he believed he might indulge himſelf a little more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, both in regard of the condition wherein he ſaw this perſon, abandoned by all other aſſiſtance but his own, and the memory of the ſervice which he had rendred her, by which, in all probability, ſhe was obliged to a very great acknowledgement. This conſideration joyned to the condition of his fortune, and the abſolute power he had in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> gave him more boldneſſe than the countenance of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace</hi> had wont to leave him, and he beleeved at laſt (though beauty and high appearances might repreſent ſo much to him) that no reaſon ought to oblige him to a conſtraint which did incommodate him, and that he might juſtly hope much from a perſon, who was much engaged to him.</p>
            <p>The morrow after that day which the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes had beſtowed upon the relation of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the afflicted <hi>Eliſa, Candace</hi> being more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up than the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone with <hi>Clitie</hi> upon the balliſtred Terrace, which belonged to her lodging, ſaw he ſelf accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and having no knowlege of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, nor any repugnance againſt his perſon or entertainment, but what her inquietudes generally cauſed in her, againſt every thing that might trouble
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46404:8"/>
her thoughts, ſhe receided him with that civility, which ſhe beleeved was due to his condition, and the importance of the ſervice which he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gallus</hi> having taken her by the hand to aſſiſt her in her walk, entertained her a while with things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and being in a place which had a proſpect into the Sea, and ſome of the parts near <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> he ſhewed her thoſe places which were moſt remarkable either for their beauty or the memorable things that had paſſed there. He cauſed her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that famous place where the great <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> whoſe memory was ſo venerable amongſt men, ſeeing himſelf preſſed by <hi>Ptolomies</hi> troops, threw himſelf into the Sea, and ſwam over the ſtreight which divides the City from the Iſle of <hi>Pharos.</hi> From thence cauſing her to look further, he ſhewed her the place where the battail was fought the next day, and where the treacherous <hi>Ptolomie</hi> found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the waves the puniſhment due to his perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as well for his attempt againſt the perſon of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> as for the horrible cruelty which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the ſhore of <hi>Peluſium</hi> againſt the great but unfortunate <hi>Pompey.</hi> After that, cauſing her to look more forward upon the Sea, he ſhewed her the place where the Queen <hi>Cleopatra</hi> firſt preſented her ſelf to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and deſired his protection againſt the cruel perſecutions of her brother; and the place where <hi>Anthony</hi> met with that fair Queen at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their unfortunate loves, and all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were remarkable for any important e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents during the life of that Princeſſe, and the war
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46404:8"/>
ſhe had with <hi>Augustus,</hi> wherein ſhe loſt both life and Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candace</hi> beheld what <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſhewed her, and hearkned to his diſcourſe with ſuch a tenderneſſe as brought tears into her eyes: and <hi>Gallus</hi> attributing that to compaſſion only which proceeded partly from another intereſt, was the more inflamed by the knowledge he received of the goodneſſe of a perſon, in whom he had already obſerved all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent qualities in their higheſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>After he had given by his diſcourſe what was likely to be due to the curioſity of a ſtranger Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and what he more truly rendred to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency which his love cauſed in him towards her, looking upon her with eyes which partly ſignified his intention.<hi> But Madam, </hi>ſaid he,<hi> now I have acquainted you with theſe ſmall triflles which you deſired to know of me, ſhall I be too curious my ſelf, or rather ſhall I be indiſcreet, if I take the liberty to enquire of you the name, and the condition of this admirable perſon, to whom by my good fortune I have rendred ſome ſmall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without knowing of her, and who though unknown, is in as high eſteem with me, as if ſhe were the wife or daughter of </hi>Caeſar?<hi> 'Tis not upon any deſign of abuſing it, that I expreſſe this curioſity to you, but only out of a deſire of finding greater opportunities to ſerve you in a more plenary knowledge of you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſpake in this manner, and the Queen who was already prepared for this rancounter, and had premeditated with <hi>Clitie</hi> what to ſay, ſeemed very little ſurprized at <hi>Cornelius</hi> his diſcourſe. She did ſo far acknowledg the Obligation ſhe had to him,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46404:9"/>
as to have declared to him the truth of her life, and the condition of her fortune, if ſhe could have done it without intereſſing and endangering her dear <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſario,</hi> whom ſhe knew to be in that Country, and to have all <hi>Ceſars</hi> friends for his declared enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon this precaution, which ſhe believed was due to the ſafety of her beloved Prince, ſhe reſolved to conceal her name, her birth, and the greateſt part of her adventures; &amp; upon this deſign, after ſhe had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to <hi>Cornelius</hi> with obliging expreſſions, that his curioſity was not importunate to her, ſhe told him that ſhe was born in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> of very noble parents, who during the life of King <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> had enjoyed the higheſt dignities of that Kingdom; but that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being deſirous to teſtifie their fidelity to the Qu. <hi>Candace</hi> his daughter, when ſhe was deprived of her Kingdom by <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> that Tyrant being too powerfull for them had ruined them, and ſo eagerly purſued them, that they were conſtrained to put themſelves upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> with part of their moſt portable goods, from whence ſailing down into the open Sea, with an intention to ſeek out a Sanctuary from his Tyranny, they fell into the hands of the Pirate <hi>Zenodorus.</hi> After this paſſage ſhe concealed nothing of the truth from him, but only what would have obliged her to make mention of <hi>Ceſario;</hi> and relating to him the dangers which ſhe had eſcaped by reaſon of the Pirate's inſolence, and the flames of the Veſſel which ſhe had fired, and the wave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> into which ſhe had caſt her ſelf, ſhe powerfully mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him upon diverſe accounts, and filled him full of admiration at her vertue and greatneſs of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46404:9"/>
When he had given due praiſes to that noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of ſacrificing her life to the preſervation of her honour, looking upon her with an action much more paſſionate than before:<hi> I ſhould be ungratefull to the Gods, </hi>ſaid he,<hi> if I ſhould not be thankfull to them, as long as I live, for the favour they have done me, in guiding me to the occaſions of ſerving you, and in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me the means to conduct you into a place where I can offer you part of what you ſeek; but if my interest might be conſidered to the prejudice of yours, and if I might afflict my ſelf as much at my own ill, as I ought to rejoyce at yonr good fortune, poſſibly I would ſay, that in this rancounter I have no more cauſe to commend than to complain of my deſtiny, and that it is as much for my loſſe as for your ſafety that the Gods cauſed you to land upon this Coast, and leade me into the wood where I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you agaiust the violence of </hi>Zenodorus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gallus </hi>ſpake in this manner, and the Queen, though ſhe almoſt comprehended his diſcourſe, and received it with a very grief, pretended for all that, that ſhe did not underſtand him, and that ſhe might not continue without a reply, ſhe anſwered him without being moved:<hi> I ſhould be very ſorry that my arrival in this Country ſhould occaſion any damage to a perſon to whom I am ingaged for the preſervation of my life and honour, and to prevent the future, ſince it is not in our power to recall what is paſt, I ſhall depart without regret from a place where you have given me refuge, if my continuance here be never ſo little offenſive to you. Alas! </hi>replyed<hi> Gallus, </hi>with a ſigh,<hi> how unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would your departure be now, ſince you cannot carry away the wound, that I have in the midst of my heart, together with the eyes that made it? or rather how cruel
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46404:10"/>
would it be to me now, ſince in parting from me you will deprive my days of all that makes them deſirable to me, and poſſibly bereave me of a life, whereof all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moments are dedicated to you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt he ſpake thus, the Queen oppreſſed with a violent grief, upon this occaſion of new croſſes, which former paſſages made her foreſee in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtudied for terms to explain her ſelf, both according to the greatneſſe of her courage, and the condition ofher preſent fortune, whereby ſhe ſaw her ſelf abſolutely ſubjected to<hi> Cornelius </hi>his power; and when he had done ſpeaking, compoſing her countenance to a more ſerious poſture than before, which with the Majeſty that<hi> Gallus </hi>obſerved in it, ſtrook him into ſome awe:<hi> I am obliged to you, </hi>ſaid ſhe to him,<hi> for my life and honour, and I ſhould be much more engaged to you, if you would preſerve the glory of your benefit entire, and not diminiſh the price of it by the offence you do me. If it be an offence to love you, </hi>replyed the Pretor,<hi> and if it be an infinite offence to love you infinitely, I confeſſe that there is not a man in the world who hath offended you more than </hi>Cornelius;<hi> but if love, in the Country where you were born, be not different from that which we have obſerved in ours, if it makes a man abandon his liberty to bestow it upon that he loves, if it makes him forget his own proper intereſts, to ſacrifice himſelf intirely to the perſon beloved, and in fine, if it produce no other effects, than what we have ſeen it produce in thoſe places where I have paſſed my life, I cannot eaſily comprehend the ground of the offence which you can find in the love I have for you. I know not, </hi>replyed the Queen coldly,<hi> eiiher the effects or qualities of that paſſion, but the diſcourſe of it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46404:10"/>
to my humour, and I ſhould be very much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to yon, if you will find ſome other matter of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius,</hi> though a little repulſed with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which made him partly underſtand the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he ſhould have to conquer the ſpirit, which he had attempted, prepared himſelf to ſpeak, when he ſaw the Princeſſe <hi>Eliſa</hi> approach, who having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that <hi>Candace</hi> had been walking upon the Terrace a great while, had made her ſelf ready with all ſpeed to come &amp; find her, to enjoy in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that little conſolation which ſhe could meet with no where elſe. <hi>Eliſa</hi> was in a very careleſſe dreſs, part of her hair fell upon her cheeks without art or order, her complexion was extraordinary pale, and her eyes were dulled with watching, and red with their continual exerciſe of weeping, and yet ſhe appeared to the eyes of <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Gallus</hi> like a dazling Star, and made them judge that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art, nor nature could produce any thing more beautifull or more compleat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candace</hi> being very much ſatisfied to find this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable diverſion from the importunate conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> advanced toward the Princeſſe with open armes, and giving her the Good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with a great many kiſſes full of tender affection, ſhe received the embraces and careſſes of the fair Princeſs, which expreſſed no leſs affection than her own.</p>
            <p>After they had ſpent ſome time in mutual embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings the fair Queen beginning the diſcourſe, <hi>I longed</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to know how you had paſſed this night, and I had come to inform my ſelf at your chamber, but</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46404:11"/>
               <hi>that I was afraid to interrupt your ſleep. Alas</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Princeſs with an action full of tenderneſs and ſweetneſs, <hi>how little acquaintance have ſleep and I to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at this time, and how ill an office did your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs render me in depriving me, for a little rests ſake, which is now a ſtranger to me, of a ſight wherein I find all the comfort of my life. Candace</hi> repayed theſe words with others as full of affection, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſeeing them enter into a diſcourſe which did not permit him to purſue that which he had begun with <hi>Candace,</hi> after he had continued a while longer with them in a converſation full of civility, he left them alone to goe either to muſe upon his paſsion, or to employ himſelf in ſuch affairs as his charge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>After his departure the two Princeſſes began to entertain each other with more liberty than before, and the firſt diſcourſe being beſtowed in the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of<hi> Eliſa, </hi>and upon the hopes which ſhe might yet conceive of her<hi> Artaban's </hi>ſafety, (though ſhe built but little upon them) the Princeſs, though ſhe thought upon nothing elſe but the ſad cauſe of her grief, for all that obſerved ſome new penſiveneſs in<hi> Candace's </hi>countenance, and having asked her the cauſe of it with a grace, which left her no liberty to deny, the fair Queen prefacing the confeſſion ſhe was about to make with a little ſmile:<hi> 'Tis, </hi>ſaid ſhe,<hi> becauſe I am a little more unhappy than you, in that you did not arrive at </hi>Alexandria<hi> before me; for if </hi>Cornelius<hi> had ſeen the Princeſſe </hi>Eliſa<hi> before </hi>Candace, Candace<hi> would not be expoſed to that perſecution which ſhe hath begun to ſuffer to day. Eliſa </hi>eaſily comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Queen's diſcourſe, and receiving it with a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46404:11"/>
modeſty like to her own,<hi> If it be the love which you have cauſed in </hi>Cornelius, ſaid ſhe,<hi> which creates you a new ſubject of diſpleaſure, I was not capable to guard you from it, and what your powers have done in one day, mine being far inferiour to them, could not have done in divers years.

            <p>The two Princeſſes entertained one another in this manner, and they had a very long diſcourſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beſides, in the ſame place, wherein having paſſed from <hi>Candace's</hi> affairs to <hi>Eliſa's,</hi> that Princeſs,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46404:12"/>
according to the Queens Counſel, was reſolved to conceal neither her birth, nor her name from <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> ſuppoſing upon good grounds that ſhe could not find a better Sanctuary againſt the cruelty of the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> than amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, where <hi>Tyridates</hi> her Unkle had found refuge, and whoſe protection was the moſt puiſſant that ſhe could look for in the world. <hi>Candace</hi> believed, that then ſhe might, without putting <hi>Tiridates</hi> in danger, inform his Niece of the place of his retreat, and the obligations ſhe had to him, which ſhe did without any further delay, and by that diſcourſe ſhe wrought in the Princeſs great thoughts of tenderneſs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem towards her Uncle, whoſe perſon was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to her, and as earneſt a deſire to ſee him, as in this ſad condition of her life ſhe was capable of having for any thing in the world.</p>
            <p>This deſolate Princeſs reſtrained her ſelf pretty well before <hi>Candace,</hi> and indeed without laying any reſtraint upon her ſelf, ſhe found a ſweet conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in her company; but at the Core her grief was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>From theſe ſad diſcourſes ſhe had with <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> wherein ſhe found more ſweetneſs than in all the other actions of her life, ſhe turned her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt her ill fortune, and all her moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and piety towards the Gods could not hinder her ſometimes from quarrelling at the rigorous decrees of Heaven, for the cruel continuance and ſad ſucceſs of her misfortunes.

            <p>One night, during which ſhe had extrordinarily tormented her ſelf, having cloſed her eyes a little before the darkneſſe began to quit the earth, at the time when dreams preſent themſelves to our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation more clear and undiſturbed: After ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions without order or coherence, which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly precede thoſe which ſeem moſt agreeable to the truth; whether it were upon the effect of thoſe

This ſight having produced a violent effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Eliſa's</hi> ſpirit, ſhe would have cried out with tranſport, and by the effoort ſhe uſed in that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe wakened her ſelf with a ſtart. When ſhe was awake he had her arms ſtretched out to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which was preſented to her eyes when they were ſhut, and not being able by awakening pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46404:14"/>
to drive that dear <hi>Idea</hi> out of her immaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe felt about the bed, and ſought after that <hi>Artaban</hi> which had appeared before her, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his name two or three times. But when her ſleepineſs was perfectly over, and ſhe ſaw her ſelf abuſed by ſleep, her grief renewed with violence, and ſeeing that object that was ſo agreeable to her eyes, and dear to her memory, no longer appear, ſhe abandoned her ſelf to regrets, and recalled her tears which had hardly ſtopped their courſe whilſt ſhe was aſleep: <q>Ah! <hi>Artaban, ſaid ſhe, melting into tears,</hi> thou deceiveſt me, and flieſt from me, and thou doſt not preſent thy ſelf to me during theſe moments of ſleep which thou leaveſt me, but to render the loſſe more preſent to me, and to renew my griefs, thou calleſt to me from the ſhore, or rather from the port whereunto thou art arrived by thy death, after thou hadſt been ſo long toſſed upon the tempeſtuous Sea of miſeries and croſſes, wherein thou leaveſt the deplorable <hi>Eliſa;</hi> thou calleſt me <hi>Artaban,</hi> &amp; by thy action reproacheſt me for this weakneſs, which hath not permitted me to go and ſeek with thee that tranquillity which thou enjoyeſt; but if thou beeſt not cruel, do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me for having abandoned thee out of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of love of life; but beleeve that I am ſo little in love with it ſince I loſt thee, that I am ready to give willingly the remains of it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to thee.</q> Upon this thought divers Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reſolutions preſented themſelves to her ſpirit, and paſſing from this remembrance to the former part of her dream, where the God of the Sea promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her that ſhe ſhould ſee her <hi>Artaban</hi> again at the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46404:15"/>
Tomb of a Faithfull Lover. <q>Yet, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> 'tis no ſmall comfort to <hi>Eliſa,</hi> that ſhe may ſee again at the Tomb, him whom ſhe beleeved was buried in the entrals of the Fiſhes. I do not doubt but that my <hi>Artaban</hi> hath been faithfull to his <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and ſince I have not been permitted to cloſe his eyes, and to receive his laſt breath, I could not, God of the Seas, receive from thee in repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the cruel outrage thou haſt done, a dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er favour than thou doſt me, in bringing this belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved body to the ſhore, and in giving me the means to encloſe my ſelf in the ſame Tomb with my faithfull lover; I willingly fly to the Tomb that is conſecrated for <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and as <hi>Artaban</hi> himſelf is the grave wherein all my affections are buried, ſo I will not avoid the occaſion of encloſing my ſelf with him in the ſame Tomb upon the ſhore of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Eliſa</hi> uttered theſe ſad words in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which might move the moſt inſenſble hearts to pity, the brightneſs of the approaching day began to ſpread it ſelf about her Chamber, and at the noiſe of ſome words which ſhe pronounced aloud, and ſome ſobs that accompanied them, a young Slave, whom with divers others <hi>Cornelius</hi> had given to her to ſerve her (as he had given many likewiſe to the Qu. of <hi>Ethiopia)</hi> drawing near her bed asked her with a great deal of care if ſhe were not well, and if ſhe had need of any thing. <hi>Eliſa</hi> being quite buried in the ſad thoughts which poſſeſſed her, heard not the Slaves words, and inſtead of dreaming of her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming her diſcourſe with many ſighs; <q>Ah dear I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of that I love, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> return again to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46404:15"/>
me for a few moments, and ſince that by the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of my deſtiny I am condemned never to ſee thee more but by illuſion, make theſe illuſions laſt as long as the deplorable life thou haſt left me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words pronounced with a tone of voice which might have made a paſſage into the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate ſouls, pierced deep into the mind of the Slave who heard them, and ſhe poſſibly being not ignorant of the effects of that paſſion, which was the cauſe of <hi>Eliſa's</hi> greateſt misfortunes, her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion made her preſently intereſſe her ſelf in the grief of a perſon, whom her admirable parts made her ſerve already with a great deal of inclination. <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaid ſhe, with a ſigh as profound as <hi>Eliſa's</hi> could be; <hi>as far as I can judge both Love and Fortune exerciſe their powers every where, and thoſe which till now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of their Tyranny may find companions throughout the whole world.</hi> She had poſſibly enlarged her ſelf in this meditation, if <hi>Eliſa,</hi> not being able to take repoſe in any poſture, had not turned here ſelf that way, and ſeen her by her Bed ſide, whereof the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was a little drawn. The Princeſs was a little ſurprized to ſee her there ſo early, and having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice that it was neither <hi>Urione</hi> nor <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> ſhe asked her with a great deal of ſweetneſs what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had brought her thither. <hi>'Tis my deſire to ſerve you Madam,</hi> anſwered the Slave, <hi>and I have heard ſome complaints from your mouth which made me fear that you were indiſpoſed. Alas!</hi> replyed the deſolate Princeſs, <hi>how can you apply any remedy to my indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how unprofitably are your officious cares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the comfort of ſo unfortunate a perſon? As for</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46404:16"/>
               <hi>the diſeaſes of the mind,</hi> anſwered the |Slave, <hi>reaſon, time, and the aſſiſtance of Heaven may remedy them, and there are poſſibly Madam, ſome as unfortunate at your ſelf, who make their reaſon act for their conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and expect from Time and Heaven the ſweetning of their miſeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the time that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had beſtowed this Slave upon the Princeſs, ſhe had taken no notice of her; but hearing her ſpeak in this manner, with an accent which reliſhed ſomething of a more than vulgar ſweetneſs, ſhe caſt her eyes upon her face, and viewed her with ſome attention. <hi>Eliſa's</hi> eyes were troubled with the tears which ſhe had ſhed, and there was not yet light enough in that part of the Chamber, that ſhe might diſcern particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but if <hi>Eliſa</hi> could not particularly obſerve the features of the Slave's countenance, ſhe ſaw that ſhe was of a very handſom proportion, and that in her eyes, as dull and languiſhing as they were, there ſparkled ſomething very lively and very bright; ſhe was moved with ſome greater conſideration for her, than people ordinarily have for Slaves, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering her diſcourſe with more attention than could probably be expected from the exceſs of her grief. <q>They which can make uſe of their reaſon in calamities of the ſame nature with mine, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> have left it a command over their ſpitit which ſuch diſaſters as mine are wont to deſtroy, and I doubt very much that reaſon hath not ſtrength enough to take away all ſenſibility in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, wherein all hope of remedies, either from the aſſiſtance of men, or the ſuccour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is quite extinguiſhed. "It would be too
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46404:16"/>
much to require at Reaſon's hands, <hi>replyed the Slave,</hi> to expect from that, that it ſhould render us inſenſible of thoſe misfortunes wherein all hope hath quite deſerted us; but after we have yeilded to that reſentment, part of that which humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity can not deny it, we ſhall find without doubt in the aſſiſtance of reaſon, part of what we have loſt, together with our hopes; and ſince it pleaſes you, Madam, out of an exceſs of goodneſs to permit a poor Slave to enter into diſcourſe with you, I will take the liberty to tell you, that in the greateſt calamities we partly find ſome remedy and conſolation in our ſelves, and that we help to exaſperate or ſweeten them by the conſtancy wherewith we ſupport them, and certainly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue would ſignifie little in us if we did not make uſe of it in afflictions, and as it ſerves in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity to make us receive good ſucceſs with out pride and inſolence, ſo likewiſe in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it ought to make us ſupport diſgraces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminution of courage. Whether we have drawn theſe miſeries upon us by our own faults, or whether they fall upon us from Heaven, which for reaſons hidden from our weak underſtanding, is pleaſed to try, or exerciſe us; In either caſe we can only have recourſe to patience, in relation to the calamities which we deſerve, or to reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in reſpect of thoſe which fall upon us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of our Superiours, againſt whom we are not permitted ſo much as to murmur.</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words which the Slave pronounced with an admirable grace, the Princeſs of the <hi>Parthians</hi> looking upon her with much greater attention than
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46404:17"/>
before, in the beginning of their diſcourſe: <hi>Ah Maid!</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>by whom have you been ſo well instructed? If you practiſe theſe Maxims of which you diſcourſe ſo handſomly in the condition you are in, there are but few not only amongſt free perſons, but thoſe of the higheſt dignity, whom you do not exceed in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of your underſtanding. Oftentimes,</hi> replyed the Slave, <hi>Vertue is better known, than practiſed, but if my inclinations have carried me that way, I had as much occaſion to exerciſe it, as any other Maid poſſibly now in the world, and it is only, Madam, upon the acount of the long acquaintance I have had with misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, that I have ventured to ſay ſomething to you upon a ſubject wherein experience hath made me but too knowing. Ah! my Girl,</hi> replyed <hi>Eliſa, is it poſſible that you have taſted of them too, and that pityleſs fortune hath ſpared you no more than others? Alas!</hi> anſwered the afflicted Slave, <hi>ſhe hath ſpared me but too much in leaving me my life after ſhe had rendred it more hard and more inſupportable a thouſand times than all the moſt cruel deaths ſhe could make me ſuffer, and there remained only that end to conclude all the cruelties to which ſhe hath expoſed the moſt unfortunate life that ever was: you may ſee one mark of it in the condition wherein you find me, ſince I can aſſure you that I was not born a Slave, and I will adde to what you know already, that poſſibly ſervitude is the leaſt of my miſeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Slave had ſpoken more to this purpoſe, and the Princeſs who hearkned to her with thoughts far from indifferency, and out of her natural goodneſs began to interſs her ſelf in thoſe miſeries, whereof ſhe made mention, would have preſſed her without doubt to a further diſcovery, if <hi>Urione</hi> and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46404:17"/>
being got up, after they knew that <hi>Eliſa</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, had not come near to her Bed ſide. The Slave retired at their approach, and the Princeſs, who in another condition would not have let her been quiet without ſatisfying the curioſity ſhe had begun to raiſe in her, as ſhe was at preſent was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to defer the remainder of their diſcourſe till another time.</p>
            <p>A little after the Queen<hi> Candace </hi>being but half ready came into the Chamber; and ſitting down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Princeſſes Bed ſide, ſhe informed her ſelf of the condition of her health, and her laſt nights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as ſhe had been accuſtomed to do.<hi> Eliſa </hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while without returning her any anſwer, preſſing her between her arms with a charming ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and when ſhe began to ſpeak:<hi> Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, </hi>ſaid ſhe ſighing,<hi> how cruel hath my awakening been to me this morning, in depriving me of a dear ſight which ſleep had preſented to me? I ſaw my unfortunate </hi>Artaban<hi> ſtretching out his arms to me, and inviting me to him into places whither my weakneſs hindred me from following him. He appeared to my eyes being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſuch as he had formerly appeared to my heart; he had the ſame port<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame actions, and the ſame features in his face, and that unſeaſonable awakening hindred me from hearing the tone of the ſame voice, which formerly made me ſuch real proteſtations of an inviolable fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe words ſhe related to her with a very paſſionate action all the particulars of her dream: The Queen hearkned to them with the intereſt which ſhe took in the affairs of that fair Princeſſe, and did all ſhe could poſſibly to find ſomething in it

that might ſerve for her comfort, ſhe apparently met with it in the former part of the dream, and being unwilling to loſe this occaſion of recompoſing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Spirit of this afflicted Princeſs, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the Gods without doubt contribute to confirm you in the hopes I give you of your</hi> Artaban's <hi>ſafety, and he that governs that unfaithfull Element wherein you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve you loſt him, takes care to juſtifie himſelf againſt the complaints you make of him, he tells you himſelf that he hath not detained</hi> that <hi>which you demand of him, but hath rendred it to you upon the ſhore, where you ſhall be permitted to ſee him again. Yes,</hi> interrupted <hi>Eliſa, he tells me he hath restored it to me, but doth not tell me in what condition, and conſidering the ſmall diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the place where the unfortunate</hi> Artaban <hi>threw himſelf into the waves, and the ſhore, I do not doubt but the waves, as they ſay 'tis ordinary, may have carried his body to the Shore;</hi> Neptune <hi>may have restored it, but he hath not restored it alive, as he received it, and if it had been ſo, he would not have forgotten to give me that comfort, ſince he had begun to take care of it. Neither in dreams!</hi> replyed <hi>Candace, nor in their Oracles themſelves are the God's accuſtomed to explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more clearly to us, and in all thoſe which anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hath obſerved, you ſhall find none wherein part of the truth was not concealed until the manifestation of it by the event. But</hi> anſwered <hi>Eliſa, the God ſufficiently declares himſelf in that he tells me that I ſhall ſee</hi> Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban <hi>again at the Tomb of a faithfull Lover, and if he promiſed me that I ſhould ſee him again any where elſe but at a Tomb, I might conceive ſome glimpſe of hope for his life, but 'tis only at a Tomb that we muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, and in that reſpect the words of the God do make</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46404:18"/>
               <hi>themſelves ſo intelligible, that it would be but folly in me to expect any comfort from them. Candace</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of <hi>Eliſa's</hi> opinion, and found a great deal of probability in what ſhe ſaid, but ſhe diſguiſed her thoughts a little, to appeaſe her grief, and ſeeking upon that deſign for ſome explication of her dream, contrary to her own judgment: <q>If it were only, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> to acquaint you with <hi>Artabans</hi> death, the Gods would not have taken the care to give you a belief, which is but too much eſtabliſhed already in your ſpirit, and there is leſs probability that they meant to abuſe you, in giving you falſe hopes by ambiguous words. As for the word <hi>Tomb</hi> which terrifies you, you cannot, as I conceive, find any juſt matter of fear in it, and as you never doubted but that you were mortal, you ought not to be aſtoniſhed if Heaven promiſes you that you ſhall lie in the ſame Tomb with <hi>Artaban,</hi> in this promiſe there is ſomething more advantagious than in the reſt of the dream, and Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt acquaints you, that after you have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great many years together, you ſhall be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the ſame Tomb. However it be, my dear Princeſſe, we muſt always judge well of a thing when the appearances are more favourable than contrary to us, and as the Gods have more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to acquaint us with good than evil, we ſhould offend them without doubt if we ſhould not rather expect good than evil, upon an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they leave us more room for hope than fear.</q> 
               <hi>Candace</hi> ſpake in this manner, partly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her own thoughts, and <hi>Eliſa</hi> out of the belief ſhe had in that fair Queen, did what poſſibly ſhe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46404:19"/>
could to receive part of the conſolation which ſhe deſired to adminiſter to her.</p>
            <p>From this diſcourſe, which was of ſome longer continuance between them, <hi>Eliſa</hi> paſſed to that which ſhe had had with the Slave, of whom ſhe made ſuch a mention to the Queen, that ſhe made her deſire to ſee her preſently. She commanded her to be called, and a little after ſhe came into the Chamber, and preſented her ſelf before the two Princeſſes. They beheld her then in a perfect light, and with more care than they had had for her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and they found in her perſon wherewithall to entertain their eyes and their attention. In the condition where unto the miſeries of her life had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her, the beauty which ſhe might have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Heaven could not appear in its ordinary luſtre, ſhe had almoſt loſt all her fleſh, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of her complexion was almoſt ſpoiled by the length of the grief and troubles where with her mind and body had been perplexed, her lips did not bluſh with that pure coronation which formerly had cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and her leaneſs had lengthned her viſage, and changed the features of it, ſo that upon a ſlight view nothing could be ſeen in her face which might give any ready knowledge of the beauties which ſhe had once been Miſtreſs of. But after that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes had more nearly and more carefully obſerved her, they took notice of ſomething in that almoſt decayed complexion that was wonderfully delicate; in the form of her mouth, and the compoſition of the features of her face, though they were altered by the loſs of her fleſh, they remarked an admirable regularity, and when ſhe lifted up her eyes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46404:19"/>
the demands they made her, they ſaw luſtres or rather lightnings proceed from thence, which dazled her ſight: As languiſhing and caſt down as they were, yet they were full of that potent fire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Souls have but little power of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and if their languiſhing had taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from the force of their regards, it had made them loſe nothing of their ſweetneſſe, but ſeemed to have added ſomething more tender and moving to them, they were of a bright gray as <hi>Eliſa's</hi> were, and her hair very near the Princeſſes, her proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was tall and ſtreight, and finally by the ruines of this beauty one might judge, conſidering it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that it had been one of the moſt excellent in the world, and according to the youthfulneſſe of the Slave (who ſeemed not to be above twenty years of age) might return to its former condition, if the cauſe of thoſe ſorrows which had thus defaced it were removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candace </hi>looked upon her with a particular curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and when ſhe had obſerved in her countenance ſome things which moved her to a different conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from that which we have for perſons of that condition:<hi> Fair Maid, </hi>ſaid ſhe,<hi> I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſome things concerning you from the mouth of this Princeſs, that have created a great deſire in me to ſee you, and the report ſhe hath made me of your perſon, and the vertue which appears in your diſcourſe hath wrought an intereſt in me for you, that will make me willingly ſeek out the means of adminiſtring comfort to you in your preſent condition. Madam, </hi>anſwered the Slave,<hi> this effect of your goodneſſe is very conformable to the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and nobleneſs that appears in your perſon, and as I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46404:20"/>
beleeve that it is very difficult to find any in the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to your ſelf and the Princeſſe, who hath made you this advantagious relation of me, ſo I do not doubt but that in the honour of ſerving you both, I may find all the eaſe of my miſeries that I can hope for in the condition I now am. But O Gods! </hi>continued ſhe, with ſome tears that fell from her fair eyes,<hi> how hard is it to apply any remedy to my diſpleaſures, and how much are my griefs above ordinary conſolation? You are not, </hi>replied<hi> Candace, the only Maid that fortune hath ill uſed, and poſſibly you ſee an example in us of the greateſt rigors that ever ſhe exerciſed againſt perſons of our ſex and birth. If the cauſe of your grief proceeds from your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, we will employ our credit to make you change your condition, and poſſibly we ſhall have power enough with the Pretor, </hi>continued ſhe ſmiling upon<hi> Eliſa, to obtain your liberty of of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They would have ſpoken more, and <hi>Candace</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with tenderneſs to the Slave, and leſs oppreſſed with grief than the <hi>Parthian</hi> Princeſs, would have preſſed this Maid to a more ample de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of her ſelf, if <hi>Cornelius</hi> after he underſtood that they were in a condition fit to be ſeen, had not entred into the Chamber. The Princeſſes received him with civility, and though the knowledge of his love began to work ſome repugnance in <hi>Candace,</hi> ſhe thought her ſelf obliged by the neceſſity of her preſent condition to lay ſome conſtraint upon her ſelf. After the firſt complements of ſalutation and reception, <hi>Cornelius</hi> told the Princeſſes, that he came to impart to them the news that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he informed them that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> being departed from <hi>Cyprus</hi> to come to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:46404:20"/>
where he had been long expected, had been aſſailed by a furious tempeſt, probably the ſame that brought the Princeſſes upon that ſhore, that great part of his Veſſels were either caſt away, or ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that he being by a ſingular favour of: Heaven preſerved with a few others, was landed at laſt at <hi>Poluſium,</hi> where he ſtaid a few days to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before he came to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and thence had ſent him a command to ſtay for his coming thither, and not to meet him as he was reſolved to have done. He told them likewiſe, that it was beleeved that by that ſhipwrack divers important perſons were loſt, and amongſt the reſt the Princeſſe <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> of whom they could hear no news, and for whom the greateſt part of the Emperour's Court was in great ſadneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candace</hi> was mightily moved at this news, out of the intereſt ſhe took in all the Kindred of <hi>Ceſario,</hi> and having asked <hi>Cornelius</hi> how <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had been enveloped in that Shipwrack, ſeeing the principal perſons had eſcaped it: She was, replyed <hi>Cornelius,</hi> in <hi>Octavia's</hi> Veſſel, whom ſhe accompanied in that Voyage, and ſome hours before the tempeſt, that Princeſs with all her attendants having paſſed into <hi>Ceſars</hi> Veſſel, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> who that day found her ſelf indiſpoſed, or melancholy and unfit for greater company, ſtayed in <hi>Octavia's</hi> Ship with ſome Maids that ſerved her, and the Seamen. A little after the Tempeſt ſurprized them with ſo much ſuddenneſs and violence, that the Veſſels could never joyn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſince that time the ſhip wherein <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> was, was never ſeen, nor divers others, by whoſe loſs the Fleet hath been diminiſhed. <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:46404:21"/>
was very much afflicted at this relation, and having continued ſome moments without ſpeaking, and yet not being able to diſſemble the ſadneſs ſhe reſented for the loſs of her dear <hi>Ceſario's</hi> Siſter: <hi>I have heard ſo much spoken,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>of the beauty and vertue of that Princeſs, that I cannot receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of her loſſe without grief, and I deſire with all my heart, that by ſome aſſiſtance of Heaven ſhe may have eſcaped that danger. They who have ſpoken to you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Princeſs,</hi> anſwered <hi>Cornelius, were not skilfull enough to depaint unto you either her divine beauty or her admirable qualities in that perfection wherein ſhe poſſeſſes them, and though ſome years are paſt ſince I ſaw her, which without doubt have made a grand addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe prodigious beginnings, the reputation of them hath ſpread ſo far ſince, that'tis almoſt impoſſible that any one ſhould be ignorant of them in places more remote than</hi> Alexandria. <hi>O Gods!</hi> ſaid the fair <hi>Eliſa</hi> lifting up her eyes to Heaven with a ſigh, <hi>O Sea, O fortune, how cruelly do ye ſport you ſelves with our deſtinies, and how doth that unfaithfull Element carry away the moſt precious ſpotls, whilſt it leaves the miſerable remainders amongſt men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words pronounced in a very pitifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with an action which proceeding from ſuch a beauty as <hi>Eliſa's</hi> was, produced miraculous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, awakened the curioſity which <hi>Cornelius</hi> had always had to know this Princeſs, and having ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified as much to her, with the greateſt diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he poſſibly could, <hi>Eliſa</hi> who had reſolved before with <hi>Candace</hi> to conceal herſelf no longer from him, taking up the diſcourſe with an attractive grace: <hi>You ſee</hi> Cornelius, ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>you ſee the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:46404:21"/>
               <hi>of the</hi> Romans <hi>greateſt Enemy, whom deſign and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune equally conduct into your hands, to receive from</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar <hi>the protection which he hath already granted to my Uncle</hi> Tiridates. Phraates <hi>brother to that Prince, and father to the Princeſs who ſpeaks to you, is our common perſecutor, and I hope that</hi> Auguſtus <hi>will not refuſe me the refuge which I would deſire of him againſt the cruelty of a man who ſheds the blood of his nearest relations, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than if they were his moſt cruel enemies. Eliſa</hi> had hardly any need of this diſcourſe to perſwade <hi>Cornelius</hi> that ſhe was born in a very high condition, and ſhe carried ſo many marks of it in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that it was not eaſie to take her for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſon: But ſhe had no ſooner acquainted the Pretor with this truth, but ſtepping a little back with ſigns of aſtoniſhment, and looking upon her with the reſpect due to the only daughter of the greateſt of all Kings, &amp; of that King who only in the world oppoſed the greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>I beg your pardon Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>with an action full of ſubmiſſion, for the faults which my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hath made me commit. I judged before by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tokens that your birth was not mean, but I ſhould never have beleeved that fortune had brought upon our coaſts the daughter of the great King of the</hi> Parthians <hi>in the equipage wherein we ſee you, and in the condition wherein we lighted on you, you need not doubt but that you may find under</hi> Ceſar's <hi>protection all manner of refuge againſt the perſecution of</hi> Phraates, <hi>and whilſt you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his own promiſe which he will make you within theſe few days, you ſhall receive from his Lieutenant all the reſpect and ſervices that are due to an admirable perſon, and of ſuch a birth as yours. Eliſa</hi> returned <hi>Cornelius</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:46404:22"/>
thanks with a great deal of ſweetneſs, and after that he had reiterated his offers, and began to behave himſelf towards her, as towards a Princeſs who might diſpute priority with <hi>Ceſar's</hi> daughter, they paſſed the reſt of the morning in diſcourſe till dinner time, and <hi>Eliſa</hi> made a brief relation to <hi>Cornelius</hi> of the accidents of her life, which could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the publick, and the laſt diſaſters which caſt her upon the Shore of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this time forward he began to cauſe her to be ſerved according to her dignity, he appointed her a number of Officers and Slaves to attend her; and though he beleeved <hi>Candace's</hi> quality to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to <hi>Eliſa's,</hi> the love he had for her making him to ſupply that defect, made him to treat them both, as to appearance, with little difference.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſes lived in this manner at <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſome days, during which the <hi>Pretor</hi> loſt no occaſion to teſtifie his love to <hi>Candace</hi> both by his actions and diſcourſe. The Queen received the teſtimonies of his paſſion with a great deal of diſpleaſure, and if ſhe had been ruled by her reſentments, ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them with all the ſigns of ſharpneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, but by experience which in ſo youthfull an age the croſſes of her life had taught her, ſhe had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is a grand piece of prudence to diſſemble when one is not able to reſiſt, and calling to mind the hazards ſhe had run by the violence of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom her bad fortune had ſubmitted her, ſhe deſired to keep a lover, whoſe power was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, within the limits of that reſpect that he had begun to ſhew her, by a treatment of him, which, though it was ſevere, and not very capable of giving
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46404:22"/>
him farther hopes, yet ſavoured nothing of rudeneſs or incivility. <hi>Cornelius</hi> uſed diverſe inventions to divert her, and the Princeſs <hi>Eliſa</hi> too, from whom ſhe was inſeparable, and beſides the recreations he endeavoured to give them in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he led them oftentimes to walk without the City, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them a hunting, to which he had a great deal of inclination. The two Princeſſes received his cares diverſly, <hi>Eliſa,</hi> as a perſon, in whom all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and all hopes were extinguiſhed, and <hi>Candace,</hi> as a perſon, in whom hope was not defunct, but her mind was prepoſſeſſed with ſuch great cares, that ſhe had but little attention left for all the divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that <hi>Cornelius</hi> could give her. She contrived it ſo handſomly that by <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tie's</hi> means ſhe might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire news of <hi>Cleomedon</hi> or <hi>Eteocles,</hi> and <hi>Eliſa</hi> had cauſed the ſhore to be often ſearched to find the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of her dear <hi>Artaban,</hi> according as the God had promiſed her, and according to the probability there was that it was caſt upon the ſhore; but hitherto both their pains had been in vain, and they both expected, though in a different manner, the eaſe of their miſeries, in which they found no ſuch ſweet conſolations as thoſe which they mutually gave each other by the charms of their good company.</p>
            <p>They walked one morning in the Gardens of the Palace, conformable in their beauty to the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of <hi>Cleopatra, Anthony,</hi> and ſo many mighty Kings who had beſtowed both coſt and care in the embelliſhing of them, and they had already meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red part of the fair and ſpacious walks, when paſſing by a high hedge, they heard through the branches which compoſed it, the voice of a perſon that ſung
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46404:23"/>
upon the other ſide, it was melodious enough to cauſe ſome attention in the hearers, and<hi> Candace </hi>in whom all curioſity was not extinct, becauſe her hopes were ſtill alive, ſtaying<hi> Eliſa </hi>by the arm, prayed her to hearken a few moments to that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſound, which had ſo ſweetly ſaluted her ear;<hi> Ellſa </hi>who was of a complying humour, ſtayed at<hi> Candace's </hi>requeſt, though her grief left her but little inclination to thoſe things wherein other perſons might find divertiſement, and the two Princeſſes hearkned a while with pleaſure to a very delicate voice which with a ſorrowfull tone breathed out amorous reſentments. It was a woman that ſung, but her ſong was interrupted by another that was near her, juſt when the Princeſſes began to be moved at it, but they were the better pleaſed, becauſe they could hear the diſcourſe of thoſe two perſons, who beleeving that they were not over-heard, did freely declare their moſt private thoughts.<hi> Leave this ſingiug, </hi>Ericia, ſaid ſhe who interrupted her,<hi> leave this ſinging, which is no fit companion for my ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein I cannot, as I have done formerly, find ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eaſe or comfort, let us ſeek elſewhere the ſweetning of my grief, or rather let us ſeek for Sanctuary in death againſt the perſecutions of my pityleſs fortune. Let me die, let me die </hi>Ericia,<hi> and do not oppoſe thy ſelf any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the laſt remedy that the Gods leave me, ſeeing by that only I can put an end to thoſe cruel ſorrows which my destiny hath preſcribed me. </hi>This woman had hardly done ſpeaking, but<hi> Cepbiſa </hi>coming near to<hi> Eliſa, Madam, </hi>ſaid ſhe,<hi> I know not whether you have taken notice of this voice, but I can aſſure you that it is the air Slave's whom you have ſometimes honoured with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46404:23"/>
your diſcourſe, who comforted you ſo handſomly the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and whom Madam, </hi>ſaid ſhe, pointing to<hi> Candace, you deſired to ſee and diſcourſe with. </hi>'Tis the very ſame ſaid the Princeſs, who eaſily diſcerned her voice:<hi> And that, </hi>added<hi> Candace, creates the greater curioſity in me, and will make me hearken with the more attention out of the deſire that I have had a long time to be acquainted with her. </hi>Theſe words were ſpoken ſo low that they could not be heard on the other ſide of the hedge, and<hi> Candace </hi>having laid her finger upon her mouth to enjoyn them to ſilence, ſhe laid her ear nearer to the hedge, to hearken to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the two Slaves. She whoſe ſong was interrupted began to reſume the diſcourſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering by a ſigh what ſhare ſhe had in thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which ſhe lamented in her Song,<hi> Alas! </hi>ſaid ſhe,<hi> will our miſeries never have an end, and will Heaven never ceaſe from tormenting perſons who have not merited by any crime the evils whereunto they ſee themſelves ſo long expoſed? Never poſſibly was a life ſo innocent ſubjected to ſo many diſaſters, and you have reaſon to beleeve, that neither by my mournfull ſong, nor by all the tears my eyes can ſhed I am able to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date my ſelf to the greatneſs of our miſhaps. I am too blame, </hi>replyed the fair Slave,<hi> for letting one word ſlip in my giief, whereby I have poſſibly failed of that reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which I would always have to the will of the Gods, and it proceeds from an effect of our weakneſs rather than a deliberate murmur, that I have made any accuſation againſt Heaven for the cruel continuance of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; But 'tis certain, </hi>Ericia,<hi> that I have need of a perfect conſtancy to ſupport the burthen of my afflictions without ſinking under them, and that ſo weak a ſpirit as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46404:24"/>
mine might poſſibly be excuſed ſometimes when it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes the strict rules of moderation: O Gods! </hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, lifting up her hands and eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<hi> Gods whom I have invoked without murmur in my hardeſt afflictions, behold I abſolutely ſubmit to your will, and if that which I have hitherto ſuffered be not capable to appeaſe your wrath, and repair the crimes of my relations, or mine own faults, throw down upon this unfortunate creature more cruel evils than yet ſhe hath been ſenſible of, and only giver her conſtancie enough to ſuffer them without offending you; there are few diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to which this Spirit hath not been ſubject, few toils to which this bodie hath not been expoſed, and few dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into which my honour and my life have not been thrown; and yet, great Gods, I will endure all with patience, and will not make the ſmalleſt complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Divine Ordinances, if you render me that which I have loſt, and if you reſtore me that which as abſolutely loſt as it can be for me, keeps me in grief, in miſerie and ſlaverie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fair afflicted perſon without doubt had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more, if the Princeſs <hi>Eliſa,</hi> in whom the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſorrowfull perſons like her ſelf wrought a puiſſant effect, feeling her grief revived by the Slave's diſcourſe, had not broken ſilence with an exclamation loud enough to be heard at a farther diſtance than that which ſeparated them. <hi>O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> cryed ſhe, <hi>O pityleſs fortune, 'tis not then upon us alone that you let fall the effects of your choler!</hi> Theſe words were underſtood by the fair Slave, and by her who was known as well as ſhe by <hi>Clitie</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſe</hi> to be a companion of her ſervitude. At the firſt they were rroubled when they perceived their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46404:24"/>
diſcourſe was over-heard, and they continued a good while without ſpeaking or ſtirring from the place where they ſate, in ſearch of ſome means to repair the fault which they ſuppoſed they had committed; but they were much more amazed, when the fair Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who had hearkned to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with much more attention than the Princeſs of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> having found a paſſage through the hedge a few paces off, paſſed to that ſide where they were, and ſhewed her ſelf to them, and preſently after came <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and their women that attended them.

            <p>During the diſcourſe of the fair Queen, the Slave recovered from her aſtoniſhment, and looking in her face, with eyes full of the moſt lively and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſweetneſs, eyes that as heavy and as languiſhing as they were, could dart out a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand moſt violent flames, ſhe appeared to the two Princeſſes in ſuch a condition as made them look upon her with more confideration than before. The open light of the garden diſcovered more beauties to them than they could ſo well obſerve in places more obſcure, and they judged with a little confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that this beauty in it's natural luſtre, had not poſſibly been much inferiour to their own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candace</hi> would have gone on to diſcover her thoughts, when the Slave having fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed her ſelf, and arming herſelf with an abſolute confidence before ſuch perſons as gave her ſo many teſtimonies of their affection: <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> I ſhould not be diſpleaſed at all to have been ſurprized in a converſation, the particularities whereof may poſſibly have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſomething of my life, if the Princeſs whom I ſerve, and your ſelf might find any ſatisfaction in it, or any conſolation to your diſpleaſures; and the knowledge I have now of your goodneſs hath made me ſo little ſuſpect you, that though this accident had not engaged me, I ſhould not have refuſed to diſcover my ſelf to you, when you ſhould have ſignified your deſires to me. I owe this deference (and I will ſpeak of you with more juſtice than you have ſpoken of this unfortunate perſon) to the admirable beauty of two ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46404:25"/>
perſons, to ſo many rare qualities of the mind that accompany the miracles of their bodies, to the goodneſs of thoſe offers full of compaſſion and generoſity, which you have made me, and (as much as to all theſe conſiderations) to the conformity that happens out between miſerable and afflicted perſons. You may diſlike this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech in a ſimple Slave, but poſſibly you will partly pardon me, when I ſhall have rendred to your commands the obedience that you deſire of me. Dear Maid, <hi>ſaid Eliſa,</hi> I have found ſo much conſolation in your diſcourſe, that I cannot diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, and you expreſs your ſelf with ſo much prudence and diſcretion, that one cannot hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you without eſteeming and loving you: this effect of merit gives me conſiderations for you, which ſervitude cannot take from you, and though you are a Slave rather by the means of your fortune than by your birth, yet you have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſuch a curioſity in me of knowing you, as, in the deplorable condition wherein I am at preſent, I had not poſſibly been capable of in relation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing. I ſhall ſatisfie your deſires when you pleaſe, <hi>replyed the Slave,</hi> and I ſhall make no difficulty to doe it before theſe perſons that are with you <hi>(purſued ſhe, pointing to</hi> Urione, Cephiſa, <hi>and</hi> Clitie, <hi>who without any other company followed their Miſtreſſes)</hi> upon the confidence that I have that their diſcretion is conformable to the goodneſs of the perſons whom they ſerve: I will acquaint you with ſuch things as you will judge to be of ſo much importance as not to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated but to a few perſons, and you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

by the confidence I have in you, that incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation rather than ſervitude engages me to obey you; but leſt the diſcourſe I have to make you ſhould be over-heard, as that was which I had with this Maid, if you pleaſe, we will change our place, and I deſire you to take the pains to walk to that Arbor which you ſee at the corner of the hedge, where with leſs fear I ſhall render you an exact account of that which you deſire of me.</q>

            <p>The two Princeſſes having a freſh admired the grace ſhe had in expreſſing her ſelf, did what ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and preſently after went to the Arbor which ſhe ſhewed them, where they could not be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by any perſon. The two Princeſſes ſate down upon the green banks, and their Maids being ſeated at rheir feet, <hi>Eliſa</hi> made a ſign to the Slave to ſit down by <hi>Cephiſa;</hi> but ſhe did not obey that ſign, and ſtanding up as if ſhe ſeemed not to have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, and beginning the diſcourſe with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and a geſture that ſignified nothing of a Slave: <q>Before I take the place which you appoint me, <hi>ſaid ſhe, Eliſa,</hi> I muſt inform you who I am, that you may judge whether I be worthy of the grace you do to a Slave, and poſſibly you will partly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the liberty I have taken with you, when you ſhall know that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am a Kings daughter as well as you, and that the Slave whom fortune hath put into your ſervice, is deſcended as you are, from a long ſucceſſion of Monarchs, who have all worn, and do yet wear to this day, a Crown upon their head.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words pronounced with an admirable grace, ſurprized the two Princeſſes in ſuch a manner,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46404:26"/>
that at firſt they could not expreſs their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only by their ſilence, and their looks which ſurveied the Princely Slave anew from head to foot: But a little after recovering themſelves out of the confuſion which this adventure cauſed in them, they roſe up both together, and coming neerer to her with an action full of civility and deference,<hi> What, Madam, </hi>cryed they out both at once,<hi> are you a Kings Daughter?

Eliſa </hi>the more confounded of the two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as remembring that ſhe had received ſervices from that Princeſs, that are not uſually received but from perſons of the meaneſt birth, ſpake firſt, and expreſſing her ſhame by a bluſh that mounted into her cheeks;<hi> Ah Madam, </hi>ſaid ſhe,<hi> in whas manner ſhall I repair the faults I have committed against a Princeſs of an equal birth to mine? I have no regret, </hi>replyed the Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Slave,<hi> for the ſervices I have rendred you, and I will willingly continue, out of inclination, that which I have begun, in respect to my fortune, which hath made me fall into ſervitude: I have received from you but too many marks of goodneſs for a Slave, and in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein I appeared to your eyes, I could not have hoped from you the graces you have done me. Ah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, </hi>anſwered<hi> Eliſa, I am not excuſable, or at leaſt I must make my grief my Apology, which deprives me of all manner of knowledge, and hath hindred me from obſerving in your countenance the marks of grandeur, which diſcover your bi th. If I have not taken notice of

the abſolute truth, </hi>added<hi> Candace, I have at least conjectured a part of it, and if I have not taken this Princeſs for what ſhe is, yet 'tis very certain that ſince the firſt converſation we had together, I have judg'd her birth to be very diſproportionable to her preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe words <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Eliſa</hi> embraced the Princely Slave, who making no difficulty after the diſcovery ſhe had made, to receive their careſſes with more equality than ſhe had done a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before, ſtretched out her arms too, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their imbraces with tears of tenderneſs, which trickled down the eyes of the three Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, out of the conſideration which they made at the ſame time upon that fortune, which treated three perſons of ſo high a dignity with an equal ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and brought into the ſame place from divers parts of the earth, three King's daughters in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſo different from their condition. <hi>O humane grandeurs and felicities,</hi> cryed <hi>Candace, how are they abuſed that lay any foundation upon your ſtability, and how much inconſtancy and weakneſs have ye to blot out all the charms that blinded ſpirits find in you!</hi> After theſe words and ſome others, which they added upon this Subject, they deſired the Princely Slave to ſit between them, and relate the Story of her life, the knowledge of her condition having much augmented their curioſity: She made ſome difficulty to take that place in the habit ſhe then wore, for fear ſhe might be ſurprized in a place which would have made her diſcover a truth which ſhe deſired to conceal: But the Princeſſes would not permit her to ſit elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and to remedy the fear ſhe had of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46404:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they made one of their Maids ſtay at the entrance of the Arbor, to give them notice when ſhe ſaw any one approach.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſes being thus placed, the Slave was intreated again by the two others with all manner of civilities and careſſes to diſcover them the events ofher life, wherein they already took a great deal of intereſt, and ſhe being willing to give them that ſatisfaction without being any further preſſed to it, After ſhe had meditated a few moments to recall into her memory a great many accidents wherewith her life was croſſed, ſhe began her diſcourſe in theſe terms.</p>

with all the amity of a Siſter, and a rationality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove my age: But my endeavours were in vain, and he patred from me proteſting that death only ſhould cure his love, and that he would renounce his life, if I would not preſerve it for him by an affection e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to his own.</p>
               <p>After this day he lived with me as a declared Lover, and though his love partly blotted out of my ſoul that friendſhip which nature had there eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and began to render him odious to me, as a man whoſe thoughts were deteſtable; yet ſuch was his birth, that I could not avoid him, as I might have avoided any other perſon, if I had had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to do it; and beſides, whilſt I expected that time, or reaſon, or the Kings authority ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome remedy, I did all that poſſibly I could to conceal a thing, of which, as I thought, half the ſhame reflected upon me; and upon this conſideration I could not openly expreſs with what repugnance I received the Prince's viſits, becauſe I would not divulge the cauſe; yet I could not hinder it from being quickly known, and he grew ſo blind in his paſſion, that he loſt all manner of diſcretion, and by his ill conduct made all the Court ſenſible of that which he ſhould have concealed at the rate of his own life.</p>
               <p>The King had knowledge of it by a thouſand too viſible marks, and when I was no longer able to ſupport the perſecutions of my Brother, I took my laſt reſolution to complain of him, and to diſcover to my Father that which out of my care of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I had always concealed from him.

upon the diſcourſe he made me concerning it, I was conſtrained to confeſs it my ſelf to him, he was tranſported with anger, and teſtified his diſpleaſure by divers marks, which wrought no effect upon the Prince's ſpirit; He cauſed him to be called, and after that he had ſignified to him with divers words full of ſharpneſs, the grief he had to ſee him fall into and perſever in ſo uncommon a crime, he repreſented the deformity of it in ſuch terms as were capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to reaſon, if he had been in a condition to hearken to them; but after he had given a very quiet audience to the Kings diſcourſe, and ſurmounted the confuſion which his reproaches might have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, making an effort upon the fear which the Character of a Father ought to have imprinted upon his Spirit: <q>Sir, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I wiſh with all my heart I were in a condition to teſtifie to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the ſubmiſſion I have to your will, and I would ſtrip my ſelf of my ſtrongeſt paſſions, to render what is due from me to my Father, and to my King, if reaſon and acknowledgement had preſerved power enough over my ſpirit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it within the limits of its duty: But, Sir, by the rigor of my deſtinie, I ſee my ſelf reduced to ſuch terms, that I have no power left to comply with you, but only by making an end of my life, if that be diſagreeable to you. 'Tis true, Sir, that I love <hi>Olympia,</hi> and I love her in ſuch a manner, that death only can free me from that paſſion which you condemn; 'Tis in this that my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more worthy of pity than reproach, and ſeeing my ſelf conducted by my ill fortune to the love of a perſon of whom I am not beloved, a love
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46404:32"/>
coudemned as a crime by the King my Father, I ſee no ſafety nor refuge for my ſelf but in death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor will I ſeek it elſewhere; but ſince I am ſo unhappy as not to find pity, neither in the ſoul of a Siſter, nor of a Father, I will eſcape by the only remedy wherewith my paſſion can inſpire me, from the long calamities to which it would expoſe my life, if the courſe of it were not cut ſhort by my final reſolution.</q> He pronounced theſe words with ſo much violence, that the King was much troubled at them, &amp; feared ſome violent effect of his deſpair, being well acquainted with his boyling and impetuous humour. This fear made him act with the more ſweerneſs to endeavour to reduce a Spirit, which was not in a condition to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by violance; but all the things he could allege to him to make him ſubmit to reaſon were but in vain, and his love, as it ſeemed, being ſpurred on by the reſiſtance that it found, grew ſtronger every day, and by its augmentation augmented my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. I paſſed above a whole year in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither the treatments that I made him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh his hopes, nor the Kings dealing with him, who from flattery, when it was without effect, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes fell to threatning, nor any humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration being able to remedy this diſaſter of our Family.</p>
               <p>In fine the King beleeving that it was his laſt and ſureſt expedient, reſolved to marry me to ſome one of the neighbouring Princes, amongſt whom there were divers that deſired his alliance, and he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by this ſeparation from the eyes of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his paſſion might be mortified, and that all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46404:32"/>
his criminal thoughts might be diſſipated by impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, when he had executed his deſigns. I know not what would have hapned thereupon, if the poor Prince could have acted his reſolution but to my miſfortune it was hardly formed when he was ſeized by a violent Fever, which laid him in his grave within ten days: Before he died, amongſt divers inſtructions that he gave his Son for the government of the Kingdom he left him, he exhorted him the moſt tenderly that poſſibly he could to quit himſelf of the love he had for me, and threatned him with all manner of misfortunes if he perſevered in it. <hi>Adallus</hi> ſeeing the King near his end, diſſembled his thoughts, and feigning that he was moved with theſe expreſſions of his Fathers laſt will, promiſed him all he deſired of him: The King preached to me too upon the ſame Text, and expreſly charged me never to ſuffer that his family ſhould be polluted with an inceſtuous marriage; But this command was not neceſſary, and the horror of my Brothers intentions was ſo deeply engraved in my heart, that I had no need of the King's ſollicitations to diſpoſe me rather to death than to his ſhamefull conſent.</p>
               <p>The good King died, to my great regret, and his peoples grief, whom he had govermed with a great deal of Juſtice and ſweetneſs. I will not entertain you with the complaints which this loſs cauſed me to make; you may judge, Ladies, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, and beſides the grief which the nearneſs of blood could not but make me ſenſible of in the loſs of ſo good a Father, I was particularly intereſted by the loſs of his protection, who had till then defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46404:33"/>
me againſt the purſures of my Brother. He was publiquely crowned in <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and he had hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom parts enough to give his people good hopes of his government, he is comely of his perſon, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally endued with ſpirit and courage, and if <hi>that</hi> irrational love, and the effects which it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced had not laid a blot upon his life that he will never be able to wipe off, he would not be the leaſt conſiderable amongſt the Kings who at this day wear a Crown.</p>
               <p>He began his government with the ordinary forms, he rendred funeral honours to the King our Father with a great deal of magnificence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed divers days about affairs of State, and the eſtabliſhment of his dignity, giving me time to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the death of my Father, without interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in that ſad exerciſe by his perſecutions: And truly he made me conceive ſome hope, that I might for the future be exempted from them, and that the Kings laſt words, or the change of his condition had produced this effect upon his Spirit: but I ſaw my ſelf cruelly deceived in this hope, and whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had had only the purſutes of a Brother to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, who had no command over me, I found my ſelf ſubjected to the power of a King, who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of me with authority, which before he had ſought by the ways of love and ſweetneſſe: Yet the firſt marks he gave me of the continuation of his love were upon the former terms, and he was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make uſe of the civility of a Lover, before he had recourſe to the power of a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>I will not tell you, Ladies (for my narration would be of too exceſſive a length) all the amorous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46404:33"/>
diſcourſes that he made me for diverſe moneths, whereby he thought to change my mind, and make me conſent to mariage, nor the anſwers I made him in that time, to make him comprehend the foulneſs of the crime which he propoſed, and to imprint in his heart the ſhame of an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> action that would be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by all the world. He alleged to me inſtead of all reaſons, that Kings were not ſubject to the Laws they made themſelves, and that they governed themſelves by other Maxims than they did their people. At laſt having obſerved that the ways of ſweetneſs were to no purpoſe, and that inſtead of expreſſing any deſire to comply with his intentions, I conceived every day more horror againſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he reſolved to employ his authority, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me, that ſeeing neither as a Brother, nor as a Lover he was able to move me either to love or pity, nor make me conſent to a thing whereupon the preſervation of his life depended, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to act as a King in his dominions, and to ſeek his own ſafety by that power which the Gods and his own birth had beſtowed upon him. At this cruel declaration I continued rather dead than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and looking upon himwith eyes that ſignified my grief and juſt reſentment, <hi>What Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>will you make uſe of your authority to force your Siſter to an action which will draw upon you the indignation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the detestation of the whole world? will you not conſider that I am tyed to you by ſuch a nearneſs of blood, that you cannot deſire any greater alliance with me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rendring your ſelf abominable? and will you not call to mind that I am deſcended from too noble a blood, as well as you, to be expoſed to that violence which is not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:46404:34"/>
                  <hi>againſt the meanest Subjects? If I had any other ways,</hi> replyed <hi>Adallus, to perſwade you, I ſhould not have recourſe to thoſe you force me to make uſe of, and you know your ſelf that I have forgot nothing which was probably capable to prevail with you; but in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity whereunto you have reduced me by the hardneſs of your heart, either I must needs die, or ſerve my ſelf with the power which I have received from Heaven to ſave my ſelf. Ah! Sir,</hi> replyed I, tranſported with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, <hi>you will not die, but this unfortunate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which hath ſo unluckily troubled your repoſe, and by her beauty, ſuch as it is, reduces you to the neceſſity of committing horrible crimes, will die without doubt, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mean be wanting to deliver her from that authority with which you threaten her; 'Twas in you that I hoped to find protection againſt any forein power; but ſince the Gods permit, that in the perſon of a Brother I find a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor and a cruel Enemy, they leave me thoſe waies to free my ſelf that are open to all the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King was a little touched at theſe words, but he was not a jot ſtaggered in his reſolution, and looking upon me with an eye divided between ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and authority,<hi> You have no reaſon, </hi>ſaid he,<hi> to throw your ſelf into despair for theſe testimonies of my love, which any other perſon but your ſelf poſſibly would not call perſecution; I think you cannot hope to marrie a Prince with whom your condition would be better or more ſublime than with me; and as for the crime which you fear, if there be any, it will lie all upon me who cauſe you to do a thing contrarie to your inclinations by the power which I have in my dominior<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He left me half dead with grief at theſe cruel words, and the tears which he ſaw in my eyes at our parting were not capable to move him or divert him from his cruel intentions. I abandoned my ſelf to ſorrow all the reſt of that day, and for divers others, and not being able to diſgeſt this violence from that perſon in the world from whom I ought to have feared it leaſt, I wanted but a little of throwing my ſelf into Tragical reſolutions. <q>What, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> ſhall the Daughter of a King be uſed with ſuch tyrannie as is not exerciſed upon the vileſt perſons? and ſhall that Brother, whoſe power ought to ſecure her from violence and oppreſſion, be the perſon by whom ſhe ſhall ſee her ſelf expoſed to outrage and indignity? Shall <hi>Olympia,</hi> in whom the Gods have implanted ſome love to Vertue, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions averſe from vice, and thoughts though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little criminal, ſuffer her ſelf by her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be expoſed to publike ſhame, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the whole world? Ah! no <hi>Adallus,</hi> no Tyrant, for the name of Brother is not due to thee becauſe of the outragious violence, which thou committeſt againſt a Siſter, who poſſibly was not unworthy of her birth, neither doſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46404:35"/>
the name of a King by reaſon of the injuſtice which thou beginneſt to practiſe againſt perſons who ought to be leaſt ſubject to it: No Barbarian, thou art not yet abſolute enough in thy dominions to extend thy authority over ſpirits, &amp; ſuch a Spirit as <hi>Olympia</hi>'s: I am not ignorant of the ways to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape oppreſſion, and to defend that which thou aſſaulteſt, I will arm my ſelf with a courage which poſſibly thou didſt not think to have found in a young Princeſs, and the Siſter of a man ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conformable to her diſpoſition.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner I bemoaned my ſelf, and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my misfortune night and day with a flood of tears: But all in vain, the barbarous man was not moved at them, and the repugnance I expreſſed to marry him augmented his deſire, and ſeemed to redouble his paſſion; I ſpent diverſe moneths in this manner, during which time he ſaw me every day, and tormented me perpetually. Sometimes he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated me; and when by his prayers he could not incline my ſpirit to his deſign, he fell to threatning, and proteſted to me, that he was reſolved to make uſe of his authority, without any longer delay. A few moments after he grew milder, ſeeing ſome tears fall from my eyes, his love having given me ſome power over his Spirit.</p>
               <p>There is no neceſſity that I ſhould detain you any longer upon this accompt, when he ſaw that all his flatteries were to no purpoſe, and that he was paſt hope of making me conſent to his deſires, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in good earneſt to put his threats in execution, and commanded me with a terrible countenance to diſpoſe my ſelf to marry him within eight days,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46404:35"/>
without any longer delay. I wept, but to no end, I threw my ſelf at his feet, but in vain, after that cruel command, all this was not able to move him, but he proteſted to me before the chiefeſt perſons of his Court, that ſince I abuſed the indulgence he had for me in this manner, nothing could hinder him from making tryal, whether he was King in his Dominions, or nor.</p>
               <p>I paſſed the eight days he had given me in the ſaddeſt imployments in the world, and when I gave any intermiſſion to my regrers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'twas but to invent ſome means to ſave my ſelf from his tyranny: I was fully reſolved, if all other ways failed me, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace death rather than to conſent to an action, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I could not caſt a thought without horror, but I was minded firſt to try whether I could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſelf from my misfortune by flight; I knew well that I could not find any ſanctuary in my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Dominions againſt his power; but I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that if I could eſcape out of the places under his command, and be ſo happy as to get as far as <hi>Cilicia,</hi> I ſhould find a retreating place there with the King, who was Brother to the deceaſed Queen our Mother, and probably though my Brother was near to him in the ſame degree, would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert me in ſo juſt a cauſe. There was ſome uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the ſucceſſe of this enterpriſe, there was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to run, and trouble to ſupport, and difficulty to ſave my ſelf: But yet this ſeemed to me more ſweet than death, and finding no other way at all but death, or flight, I preferred flight before death, out of a fearfulneſs incident to my ſex and age.</p>
               <p>Before I had well taken this reſolution, the time
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46404:36"/>
he had given me was almoſt expired, and I had not put thoſe things in order which were neceſſary for the execution of my enterpriſe. At laſt, when I was fully reſolved upon the deſign, I ſhewed the King a little better countenance than I had done before; and having ſeen him in my Chamber the ſeventh day of the eight which he had given me, after I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain made trial of prayers and tears, which wrought as little effect as before, faining that I ſuffered my ſelf a little to be overcome, and fixing my eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his face with a kinder action than ordinary: <hi>I ſee well, Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>that I do reſist your will in vain, and am too weak to oppoſe the power of a great King in his Dominions: I confeſſe I find a great repugnance in my nature, as to the thing you deſire of me, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I have not been able to overcome: but at laſt I muſt reſolve, after I have made all poſſible reſiſtance againſt an abſolute authoritie, and all that is neceſſarie to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie my ſelf from an action to which you constrain me: I deſire eight days longer of you, which I will imploy to ſurmount the difficulties which yet remain as impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to an ultimate reſolution, and after that time, Sir, I promiſe you, you ſhall find in me no contr adiction of your deſires.</hi> The King was tranſported with joy at this diſcourſe, and expreſſed an exceſſive deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in his countenance, and in his words, he eaſily granted me the eight days I deſired, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to me that I ſhould be the moſt happy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs upon the earth with a Husband who would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore me whilſt he breathed. I confirmed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I had made to him with a very ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for fear he ſhould diſcover my policy by too quick a change.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:46404:36"/>
After I had begun to put my affairs thus in order, I deſired to loſe no more time, knowing well that that which I had gotten was neceſſary to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for my departure; but then it was that I ſaw my ſelf reduced to no ſmall trouble; For though I had divers perſons in my ſervice, that were very affectionate to me, yet I doubted whether I ſhould find any bold enough to oppoſe the King, in ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me upon this occaſion, and to expoſe themſelves to ruine, as they would apparently do, by favouring me, and accompanying me in my flight: I feared likewiſe that thoſe to whom I ſhould diſcover my ſelf would betray me, and by diſcovering my deſign to the King deprive me of the means of putting it in execution. This fear kept me one day in a ſtrange perplexity, but at laſt I was reſolved to put it to the venture, and I caſt my eyes upon <hi>Eurilas,</hi> the moſt antient of my ſervants, and Husband to a Lady that was my Governeſs; I had obſetved in him by divers marks a great affection to me, and I beleeved that I might better confide in him than in all the world beſide. I ſent for him into my Cloſet, and having repreſented the ſadneſſe of my condition, which was not unknown to him, I acquainted him with my deſign, and the deſire I had to truſt my life, and whatſoever was more precious to me, upon his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and conduct. <hi>Eurilas</hi> was amazed at my bold reſolution, and repreſented to me the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the dangers of it; but ſeeing that all things reliſhed better with my ſpirit than the violence that would have been done me, he declared to me that he thought himſelf highly honoured by the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I repoſed in him, and that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46404:37"/>
imbrace the occaſion of hazarding all, yea, and of dying too for my ſervice. After this he named me the perſons whom he thought moſt affectionate to me, and whom he judged that I might make the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of my flight, and this little number was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of his wife my Governeſs, and three of my Maids, one of which you ſee before you named <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> who hath always been the deareſt to me of all the reſt, and three or four ſervants the beſt known, and moſt neceſſary. He did not think it fit that I ſhould be attended upon by any more perſons, for fear leſt in a greater number ſome or other might be capable of betraying me. After this reſolution, and the deciſion of ſome petty difficulties, upon which we beſtowed part of the day, he went to give private order for providing a nimble Veſſel furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with all neceſſary accommodations for our voyage, there was always a great number of them in the Port of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and <hi>Eurilas</hi> had credit enough amongſt thoſe that commanded them to have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to depart thence at what hour he pleaſed, without any hindrance.</p>
               <p>I will abridge this part of my relation as the moſt troubleſome, and I will only tell you that the fourth day we were aſſured of the perſons that were to attend me, and all things ſorted as well as we could deſire to the execution of our enterpiſe. The 5 day, the night whereof was deſign'd for our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I feigned my ſelf ſick, and having intreated the King, who had ſpent ſome hours in my Chamber, to give me leave to repoſe my ſelf till the morrow, he retired himſelf, and having given order that no perſon ſhould enter into my appartment, I had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46404:37"/>
liberty to put in execution what I had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>When we were free, having made all the perſons, who were not to go with us, retire into their chambers, I cloathed my ſelf in mans apparel that <hi>Eurilas</hi> had brought me; my Governeſs and my Maids did the like; aud if we had diſguiſed our ſelves upon a leſs ſad occaſion, I ſhould have had ſome divertiſement to ſee our ſelves ſo tranſ-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but the account that obliged me to do it, and the fear of being ſurprized made me tremble conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and my fears made me almoſt incapable of performing what I had reſolved. At laſt having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured my ſelf the beſt I poſſibly could, and having taken with me the greateſt part of my Jewels, I went down by a little pair of ſtairs which belonged to my appartment, into the great Garden of the Palace, whether I had always free entrance, and from thence by a gare, whire of <hi>Eurilas</hi> had the Key, we came to the port near adjoyning, where we were attended in the Veſſel by the perſons whom <hi>Eurilas</hi> had left there.</p>
               <p>We paſſed by thoſe we met, covering our faces with our Cloaks, though, without that precaution, the obſcurity of the night, and the habits we were in were favourable enough to our deſign. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at laſt into the Veſſel an hour within night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving haſtned our departure to take the advantage of the whole night, and to be far enough off before they perceived our abſence, or put themſelves into a condition to purſue us. We hoiſed up our Sails, and made off from the Port with all ſpeed, taking the way of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which our Pilot was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E quitted the ſhore of <hi>Bizantium</hi> with a proſperous gale, and the fear I had of being purſued and taken by thoſe whom the King might ſend after me, making me continually ſollicit the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Mariners, We paſſed the <hi>Thracian Boſphorus</hi> with admirable ſpeed, and through the ſtraight of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> we entred into the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea with full Sails. I thought my ſelf then in ſome ſecurity from the purſutes of my Brother, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take a little breath after thoſe terrors that had tormented me the firſt days of our navigation: Neither the peril whereunto I was expoſed by the infidelity of that Element to which I had truſted my life, nor the dangerous adventures that might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur upon the Sea, could any way equal the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I had in my mind to ſee my ſelf eſcaped from the violence of the King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and I rendred thanks to the Gods upon that account, as if I had been already in the ſecureſt harbour.</p>
            <p>In effect, both nature and reaſon had made me conceive ſo much averfion and horror for the deſign he had againſt me, that to free my ſelf from it I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all manner of inconveniencies, and ſhould have precipitated my ſelf into the moſt manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers without conſideration: Yet I could not reflect upon the condition of my fortune, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome ſmall complaint to Heaven, nor conſider
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46404:40"/>
with an abſolute moderation, how the Daughter of a great King was handled by her deſtiny, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her being of ſo youthfull an age, and ſo tender a complexion, to fly her native Country, and to hazard her ſelf upon the inconſtancy of the waves, to ſave her ſelf from an Enemy who ought to have been her Protector, and to avoid him as a Monſter, from whom in all probability ſhe ought to have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for refuge againſt all manner of misfortunes. <q>How know I, <hi>ſaid I ſometimes when I was most trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with theſe ſad conſiderations,</hi> how know I, but that in the ſame places where I ſeek for Sanctuary I may find more enemies? and who will give me any aſſurance of thoſe perſons who are allyed to me by ſome proximity of blood, if I have met with nothing but perſecution and cruelty in my own Brother? Will an Uncle be more pitiful to me than a Brother? and may not I fear that he will prefer the amity of the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> before the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction due to me, and that he will put me again into the hands of a Prince, whoſe alliance is more conſiderable to him, than the occaſion of aſſiſting an afflicted Princeſs, and drawing an enemy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, whoſe power is not contemptible? Ah! without doubt I have not ſufficiently deliberated upon this difficulty before I embarqued my ſelf in ſo hazardous an enterprize, and I ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the Maxims of Kings, and the intereſts of State are very different from the thoughts which Vertue and Piety inſpire us with: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of <hi>Cilicia</hi> ſhall put me himſelf into my Brother's hands, or refuſe me the refuſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire againſt him; In either of theſe two misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes I ſee my loſs abſolutely infallible, and what
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46404:40"/>
way ſoever I turn my thoughts, I know no other way for my ſafety, Well, <hi>added I, raiſing up my courage,</hi> if Gods and men abandon us, death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail us, and we will receive it in the ſame manner either in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> or in the waves, as we would have received it at <hi>Bizantium,</hi> rather than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I oftentimes entertained my ſelf with theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with <hi>Eurilas,</hi> with my Governeſs, and this Maid named <hi>Ericia,</hi> on whom I have beſtowed my moſt tender affections from my Infancy, and they took the pains to comfort me, and to repreſent to me the little likelyhood there was that the King of <hi>Cilicia</hi> my Uncle ſhould refuſe me his protection, to which he was obliged by conſanguinity, vertue, and all manner of conſiderations, nor need I to fear that the King my Brother would obſtinately demand me, or undertake war againſt my Protector upon a quarrel which would expoſe him to the blame of all the world. They made me ſome other diſcourſes beſides, wherein I really found reaſon and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and receiving my diſaſters from the hand of Heaven, I expected the end of them with all the patience that poſſibly I could.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we followed our Voyage with a great deal of diligence: We had coaſted the Iſle of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> we had a view of <hi>Eubea,</hi> as we paſſed by, we had left <hi>Creet</hi> upon our right hand, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46404:41"/>
               <hi>Rhodes</hi> upon the left, and we had gone a good way betwixt <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> when fortune which had favoured us ever ſince our departure from <hi>Bizanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> changed her countenance, and made us know, that changing of a Climate alters not deſtiny, and that unfortunate perſons drag the chain of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps after them whitherſover they go.</p>
            <p>We were but one days journey from the neareſt port to <hi>Tharſus,</hi> where the King of <hi>Cilicia</hi> makes his reſidence, when, contrary to all appearances, the weather changed, the winds became impetuous, and all the Sea was agitated by a furious Tempeſt: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſtorm ſo ſudden and ſo violent, and though our Mariners were very expert, and our Veſſel in very good condition, the toſſing of the waves was ſo vehement, that within a few moments, the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who had often been in the like dangers, cried out we were loſt, and began to deſpair of our ſafety. You may judge fair Princeſſes, what my fears were then, and if the Spirit of a young Maid, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prepared for all manner of diſaſters, was ſlightly troubled at the approaches of a terrible death: I was afraid, I ſent up my vowes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with prayers and tears, and yet I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent my ſelf, that <hi>I</hi> had thrown my ſelf into this danger, to avoid that whereunto <hi>I</hi> was expoſed in my native Country. <hi>'Tis hard,</hi> ſaid <hi>I</hi> in my ſelf, <hi>'tis a cruel thing for a Princeſs to loſe her life among the waves at ſuch an age as mine: but it would have been far more inſupportable for me to live in the ſhame and crime to which</hi> Adallus <hi>his violence had deſtinied me. We will die if the Gods have ſo ordained it, but we will die in our primitive innocence, without polluting it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46404:41"/>
unworthy repentance, or regret for having ſacrificed this unfortunate life, to that which we owe to conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity and vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while as the Storm redoubled, our Mariners did all things poſſible for to ſave us. They cut down the Maſts of the Ship, diſcharging it of all their heavieſt lading: and forgot nothing that their experience in this art could prompt them to put in practice, poſſibly their care hindred us from periſhing all among the waves, but it could not hinder the loſs of a part of our company; and after we had parted a dreadfull night in the continual ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of an approaching death, at the break of day we diſcovered the main land on one ſide, and on the other ſide part of thoſe rocks which render na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation dangerous near the Coaſt of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> We would have done our endeavours to reach the land, which we looked upon with ſome remainder of hope: but the winds were not only contrary to this deſign, but our Veſſel was no longer in a condition to be conducted by the ſcience of men; and when it had reſiſted a little longer the impetuoſity of the waves, it was taken by a guſt of wind, which with a ſwiftneſs comparable to an Arrow out of a Bow, daſhed it againſl the point of a Rock, where it ſplit into a thouſand pieces,</p>
            <p>I had periſhed at this time if I had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for greater misfortunes, and the Gods who had deſtinied me to them, were pleaſed that I ſhould be ſaved from this Shipwrack, to paſs the remainder of my deplorable life in a more cruel tempeſt than that which they permitted me at that time to eſcape. I was preſerved by the care that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46404:42"/>
divers perſons took of my ſafety, two of my Maids were drowned, with many of the Men; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Eurilas,</hi> his wife <hi>Ericia,</hi> and ſome other of my ſervantr, and the Mariners, I was carried up on the Rock all wet, and half dead with fear, and the pain I had endured: Yet the Gods were pleaſed to our extraordinary good hap, that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which we had in the Veſſel were driven upon the Rock, and by the pains our people took about them, the greateſt part of them was preſerved, had it not been for this, hunger would quickly have made us found, what we were lately threatned with by the cruelty of the waves.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I lay upon the Shore quite ſpent with toyl and grief, where holding my eyes fixed upon Heaven, I ſilently accuſed it of my misfortune, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of returning thanks for the preſervation of a life, which in that place, and the condition we were in, could not probably be prolonged but for a few days: Some of our men being mounted up to the top of the Rock, found ſand, and ſome trees, and walking a little further, they ſaw we were landed upon a ſmall Iſland of five or ſix hundred paces long, but craggy, deſart and uninhabited. Upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port they made me of it, <hi>Eurilas</hi> coming to me, and ſtretching out his hand, prayed me to ariſe to goe and take ſome place leſs inconvenient, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſuccour of Heaven, from whence we might yet receive aſſiſtance. I aroſe from my ſeat with my face all bedewed with tears, and looking every way upon the pitifull remainders of our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. <hi>Ah!</hi> Eurilas, ſaid I, <hi>what would you have us now expect from Heaven, ean any thing remain for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46404:42"/>
us in the place and condition we now are, but a miſerable day or two to live in grief, and want of all neceſſaries?</hi> With theſe words caſting my eyes again upon the bodies of the two Maids that were drowned, which the waves had driven to the ſhore, I powred out a ſtream of tears for their loſs, and afflicted my ſelf for it in ſuch a manner, that the care of thoſe which remained could hardly oblige me to take any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <hi>Ah!</hi> cryed I out, <hi>'tis not juſt that a life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by ſuch cruel croſſes, and by the death of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were dear and faithfull to me, ſhould be of a long continuance, and I ſhould offend the Gods who look upon me with indignation, if I ſhould make Prayers to them for an unfortunate perſon, whom they judge to be worthy of their anger. Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eurilas</hi> to me, <hi>you cannot by any of your actions, have drawn the anger of Heaven upon you, and nevor poſſibly had any perſon more reaſon than you to expect particular aſsiſtances from thence, the moſt innocent perſons have fallen into the ſame diſaſter which hath lately befalen you, and I have hope ſtill to ſee you reſcued hence, by the protection which without doubt is due from Heaven to your vertue. Let us go then,</hi> Eurilas, ſaid I as I roſe up, <hi>and let us not despair of Heavens ſuccour ſince we cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further provoking of it againſt us.</hi> Upon theſe words, after I had given the laſt Adieu to thoſe poor Maids, whom hey took up, together with the other perſons that were drowned, to render them the laſt devoirs of burial, as the place and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we were in could permit, I walked by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Eurilas</hi> upon the brink of thoſe waves, whoſe rage was not yet appeaſed, and we took, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of thoſe that had already diſcovered
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46404:43"/>
it, the plaineſt way to go to the leaſt incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place of the little Iſland.</p>
            <p>But behold, to entangle me in new diſgraces, much more ſenſible than thoſe to which I ſaw my ſelf already expoſed, 'twasthe will of fortune, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had walk'd near upon a hundred paces upon the ſhore, I ſaw at my foot the body of a man, which the water had caſt up there upon a plank which he ſtill embraced. I ſtayed my ſelf at this ſpectacle, and thought at firſt that it was one of our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe loſs we had not obſerved, and I turned my ſelf toward the reſt, to make them ſee if their companion was ſtill in a condition to receive any help, or to cauſe his body to be buried, if he was abſolutely dead; but we quickly changed our opinion when we ſaw the richneſs of his habit, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which though it was wet and ſoiled with the ſome and ſand in ſome places, the gold was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpied by thoſe that advanced to his ſuccour. This made them take a little more notice of that perſon; and though I was already caſt down at my owm misfortune, &amp; incommodated by the wetneſs of my garments, I conquered mine own inconvenience by the compaſſion I had upon a perſon faln into the like diſaſter with my ſelf, and I ſtaid to ſee his face, and to behold with ſome attention the event of the office which my ſervants went to render him. His legs were ſtill in the water, his body lay along upon the plank, which he held faſt, and his face was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the ground, and almoſt buried in the ſand. They drew him quite out of the water, and turned his face upwards, but it was ſo covered with ſome and ſand, that they could not at firſt perceive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46404:43"/>
the figure of it; they preſently threw water upon him, and when hee was cleanſed from the filth which covered him, they perceived as well as the pale wan colour of his face would permit, all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of an admirable beauty in a perſon of his ſex. His age ſeemed not to be above nineteen years; his perſon was the moſt compleat and beſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the world, and his long black hair, which the moyſture of the water could not deprive of their natural Curles, hung about his cheeks, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an extraordinary grace to the whiteneſs of them: but a great part of his beauties was clouded, his eyes were faſt cloſed, his lips were diſcoloured, and a deadly paleneſs being ſpread all over his viſage had baniſhed thence that vivacity of complexion, which doeth ſo advantageouſly ſet off the lineaments and proportion of a handſome face. Yet in this languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form he appeared more comely to me, than all that had been repreſented to my eyes till then, and out of a preſage, whereof the cauſe was unknown to me at that time, I felt a throbbing of my heart, which ſeemed to me to foretel part of that which this adventure hath made me ſuffer ſince.</p>
            <p>There appeared but little ſhew of life in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but <hi>Eurilas</hi> having laid his hand upon his heart, found there ſome motion, and ſome heat: <hi>This man is not dead,</hi> ſaid he: <hi>Then we muſt ſuccour him,</hi> added I preſently, <hi>and give him all the aſsiſtance we can to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſave his life.</hi> Immediately all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were with us employed themſelves about it, and two or three men having taken him up by the feet, and holding his head downwards, the ſalt water, with which his belly was all ſwelled up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46404:44"/>
to run out of his mouth in ſuch great abundance, that we were ſtruck with wonder how the body of a man could contain ſo much. After he had caſt it all up, he continued ſome moments longer without ſhewing any other ſignes of life than thoſe they had already obſerved, and though I was in an incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious condition my ſelf, I had the patience to wait a while longer to ſee if he would recover his ſences. The Gods were pleaſed that my expectation ſhould not be long, and the fair unknown began, by his motion, to ſhew the effect of the aſſiſtance which had been rendred him; a little after he opened his eyes, and recovered his ſences and knowledge: I was very joyful to ſee him return into that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and out of an unknown principle, I already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted my ſelf in his preſervation, ſo as <hi>I</hi> partly ſuſpended the memory of my own danger. He tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his eyes for a while round about him, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the place where he was, and the perſons which had ſuccoured him, and his aſtoniſhment diſcovered it's ſelf in his countenance, where the colour began to come again, and with that the exact perfection of beauty in a perſon of his ſex. At the firſt he was troubled to diſcern things, and what to judge of his adventure; but when the vapours that clouded his underſtanding were a little diſſipated, hee recalled to memory what had paſſed, he remembred his ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, and began to gueſs at part of the truth. When he had a little reflected upon it, he ſate up with a little pain, and looking upon us with eyes which expreſſed the remains of his aſtoniſhment; <hi>I know not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whether it be by Heavens aſſiſtance, or by yours that I have recovered my life, but I think it is not</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:46404:44"/>
               <hi>very long ſince I was expoſed to the mercy of the waves, and I am ignorant in what place I am, by what means I came hither, and to whom I am beholding for my ſafety. You owe it,</hi> replyed <hi>Eurilas, to the aſſiſtance of the Gods, and next to them, to perſons whoſe fortune is little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from yours, and who by a Shipwrack like you, have been driven upon this little I ſtand, with very little hope or means to get out of it, without the extraordinary help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hand of Heaven.</hi> The fair unknown whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and underſtanding recovered more and more, and whoſe eyes reſumed a vivacity and ſparkling light, which gave an unuſual Luſter and Majeſty to his countenance, looked upon the preſervers of his life with more affection than before, and having caſt his eyes upon my face, he found ſomething there which gave him a particular reſpect for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> was not clad then in man's apparel, with which <hi>I</hi> diſguiſed my ſelf to get out of <hi>Bizantium</hi> with the more facility; but after we came within ſight of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> out of the repugnance <hi>I</hi> had to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe ſo little ſorting with modeſty as <hi>I</hi> thought, <hi>I</hi> had together with my women reſumed the habit of my ſex, to enter in a more decent manner into the Country where <hi>I</hi> went to ſeek for refuge. The uu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known had no ſooner taken notice of me amongſt the other perſons that ſtood about me, of whom, by the reſpect they gave me, he judged me to bee Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, but all his acknowledgement turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and ſtriving with his feebleneſs to crawl to my feet: <hi>Madam,</hi> (ſaid he, in the <hi>Roman</hi> tongue, which was the ſame wherein <hi>Eurilas</hi> had ſpoken to him, and which we all underſtood as well as our own language,) <hi>'tis to you, I think, that I ought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:46404:45"/>
               <hi>thanks confo mable to the benefit I have received of your goodneſſe: Though I were not obliged to it by the preſervation of this life for which I am indebted to you, I would render you that by way of adoration, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement orders me to, and from perſons leſſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of knowledge your face will alwayes receive thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages which are due to divinities: I know not what I can offer you for the ſuccour I have received of you and yours, and this life which I owe to your aſſiſtances is now of too mean a value to ſatisfie my reſentments: but if, ſuch as it is, I durſt offer it at your feel, I would proteſt to you with the higheſt truth, that the preſervation of it ſhall not be ſo dear to me, as the occaſions of parting with it for your intereſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fair unknown ſpake in this manner, but it was with ſo uncommon a grace, that in the moſt happy condition of my life <hi>I</hi> could not have hearkned to him with a more entire attention: And when he had done ſpeaking, looking upon him with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that expreſſed more ſatisfaction than our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fortune could probably have left me: <q>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my perſon, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> nor the aſſiſtance you have received of us can merit either your acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or adorations: the ſuccour that hath been rendred you, as it was due to all men, ſo it could not be better employed than upon ſuch a perſon as your ſelf: and that which you have obſerved in my countenance (if I may give abſolute credit to your diſcourſe could move no other thoughts in you, but what pitty might inſpite you with towards perſons reduced into a condition like your own; the aſſiſtance that hath been given you will only ſerve to prolong for a few dayes that life which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46404:45"/>
you thought to have loſt upon the waves, if it's continuance be not longer than what we hope for in relation to our own. We are upon this Rock, whither the tempeſt hath driven us an hour ſince, without any veſſel, with little victuals, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of return, if Heaven doth not afford us ſome miraculous ſuccour. Heaven, <hi>replied the unknown,</hi> hath not placed in your perſon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it had moſt great and admirable, to abandon you in the danger which you repreſent to me, and you ought without doubt to hope from thence whatſoever its providence can perform for thoſe things that are moſt worthy of its protection: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, if I can be moved with the news that you tell me, 'tis onely in conſideration of your danger, which hath expunged all memory of my own out of my mind, and I ſhould not be ill ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with my fortune, if I could ſacrifice this life which I hold of you to the preſervation of yours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He had ſpoken more to this purpoſe, if the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which I already took in him had not made me conſider that he was weak and weary, and in a very bad condition in reſpect of his health; he had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered ſtrength enough to ſtand up, and we were fain to make him lean upon two men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him with us to a leſs incommodious place, where ſome of our men had already cut down good ſtore of branches; and began to make little lodgings for to ſhelter us. To be ſhort in my diſcourſe, they made diverſe of them, and one I cauſed to be given to the unknown, with two of our men to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, I took one of the moſt ſpacious they could make for my ſelf and my women, and the men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

of themſelves in the reſt. They had ſaved ſome cloathes which ſerved us whileſt our own were dryed, and they eaſily got fire out of the flints that lay in great number upon the ſhore. <hi>Eurilas</hi> took the care of husbanding our proviſions to make them laſt as long as he could, ſeeing all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our hopes relyed upon them, and we could hope for no more but by the miraculous arrival of ſome veſſel: we made our ſelves beds with leaves, only upon mine they laid ſome part of the cloaths that were left, that I might lodge with the leſſe inconvenience.</p>
            <p>The firſt night paſſed in this manner, part of which I ſpent in ſleep, and the reſt upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the miſery to which I was reduced: I I would add, if I durſt, that my thoughts diverſe times inclined to the remembrance of the fair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and that in ſpite of my mis-fortune, I could not baniſh out of my mind, the <hi>Idea</hi> that was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed there, of his Majeſtical and ſtately <hi>mine,</hi> and the admirable grace hee had in his action and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The reflection I made upon it, did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently produce any powerful effect upon me, it only raiſed ſome motions in my mind which I was not uſed to feel: and I took ſome pleaſure in calling to mind the extraordinary things I had obſerved in that unknown perſon.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the firſt thing that came into my thoughts was to enquire how he did; and I had no ſooner done it, but I repented my ſelf of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, and a bluſh that mounted up into my cheeks, reproached me for having too much care of a man, who already encroached upon my liberty:<hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:46404:46"/>
Ah! Olympia, </hi>ſaid I upon this conſideration,<hi> what a fool art thou to caſt thy thoughts upon a ſtranger, whom thou never ſaweſt till within theſe few moments? Thou which wouldſt poſſibly have ſeen the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of </hi>Aſia<hi> whole years in thy ſervice without being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at it, how little reaſon haſt thou to make any reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a man, at a time when all men ought to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from thy remembrance, and at a time when thou oughteſt to dream upon nothing but thy death, which thou ſeeſt preſent before thy eyes, and which thou canst not defer above a few dayes? What doth it concern thee to hear news of this strangers health, in a condition wherein the care of thine own would be unprofitable, and the ſaving of thine own life is enough to take up all thy thoughts? And why doeſt thou inform thy ſelf of it, when thou ſhouldeſt only inform thy ſelf of ſome means to get out of this deſert Iſland? Dye </hi>Olympia,<hi> ſince thou muſt dye, in the free condition wherein thou haſt hitherto kept thy ſelf, and do not permit that purity, to which thou haſt ſacrificed thy life, to be blemiſhed with the least ſtain: Thy thoughts hitherto are innocent, compaſſion and an extraordinary merit might produce them without any culpable effect; but the time, if there remains any longer time to live, may render them leſſe excuſable, and 'tis by theſe beginnings that people engage themſelves in that paſſion which I never felt, nor ever had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this diſcourſe I would have fortified my heart againſt the weakneſs whereof I ſuſpected it, and I took a kind of reſolution to impute all to compaſſion, without any other intereſt, and not look upon this unknown otherwiſe than I did upon all other men. I had almoſt formed this deſign, when I was told,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46404:47"/>
that by his reſt the laſt night he was perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and was at the entrance of my lodging, where he waited till I was in a condition to receive his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. As I had not uncloathed my ſelf, ſo I was not troubled to make my ſelf ready, but only raiſing my ſelf from the leaves, where I had paſſed the night with inconvenience enough, I gave order for him to come in: I did verily believe that I could not ſee him without ſome ſmall diſturbance, but, I muſt confeſſe, I was much more moved than I feared, and he entred into my lodging in ſuch a manner as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt would have ſurpriſed a mind better forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than mine. Whatſoever the Sea, and the toyl he had endured the day before, had done to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his natural beauty, was diſſipated by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had taken, the clearneſſe of his complexion, the ſparkling of his eyes, and the Majeſty of his port and action were returned with all their ordinary advantages; 'tis certain that there was not one of thoſe perſons who ſaw him in that condition, but looked upon him with admiration, and took him for a man far different from the ordinary ſort. Hee was of a taller ſize than ordinary, but ſo ſtraight, ſo clean, and ſo well-proportioned, his gate ſo noble, and the aire of his countenance compoſed of ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſo excellent a grace, that 'twas impoſſible to ſee any thing more compleat in every part. The good opinion I had of him, and the advantagious judgments I made of his exquiſite parts, obliged me to receive him with all the civility I could have rendred to a great Prince, and he accoſted me with all the marks of the moſt profound ſubmiſſion. Yet I obſerved, or at leaſt I thought I did ſo, that before
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46404:47"/>
he opened his mouth to ſpeak to me, he continued ſome moments in a maze, and looked upon me with marks of ſome aſtoniſhment and confuſion: He had ſome trouble, as I thought, to recompoſe himſelf upon a ſuddain, but having done it at laſt, with a boldneſs that is very natural to him: <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I come to beg your pardon for the faults I committed yeſterday in a condition when I was not capable of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring what I owed to your perſon, and the benefit of life which I have received from your bounty. If the Gods would pleaſe that I might employ the remains of it in your ſervice, the preſervation of it would be much more dear to me than it is out of the natural deſire we have of it, and I ſhould be farther engaged to your ſelf, if you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to the opportunities of teſtifying my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to you, than I can be to thoſe generous aſſistances to which I owe my ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He uttered theſe words in ſuch a noble and ſuch a charming faſhion, that I continued a while in an incapacity of giving him an anſwer, and 'twas not without trouble that I began at laſt to ſpeak: <hi>I am very much ſatisfied,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>to ſee you in a condition ſo different from that wherein you appeared to me yesterday; and that ſuccour upon which you ſet too high an esteem, produces in you an acknowledgment which exceeds the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: I could wiſh it had been rendred to you to greater purpoſe, and that you had received that from us for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, which neither you nor we are like to enjoy but for a few dayes. Thoſe few dayes,</hi> replied the unknown with a ſigh, and an action wherein there appeared ſomething of an intereſſed perſon, <hi>will be very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to me from thoſe I have paſſed hitherto, and I do not believe that the Gods, by your aſſiſtance, would have</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:46404:48"/>
               <hi>ſaved me from a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon or ſingle death, to make me periſh by a death which wil give me great cauſe to accuſe them of cruelty.</hi> I would not ſuddenly penetrate into the ſence of theſe words, though the action of him that uttered them, and mine own inclination made me partly ſuſpect what they meant; I anſwered him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſuch terms as might make him judge that I did not underſtand them. We entred into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation full of civility, the handſomneſs of his perſon, and the marks of as high birth, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his countenance, having wrought in me as much conſideration as I could have had for a great Prince.</p>
            <p>The day being clear and fair, and very much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe which had preceded it, we went out of our lodging, and walked up and down the little Iſland, which in ſome places we ſhould have found agreeable enough, if we could have looked upon it otherwiſe than upon the place of our Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Eurilus</hi> cauſed ſome to ſtand Centinels upon the top of the Rock, to diſcover ſome favourable Veſſel ſent by Heaven for our ſuccour, and our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle company did inceſſantly make vowes to Heaven to obtain aſſiſtances from thence, of which they had little hope.</p>
            <p>This day being paſſed, the ſucceeding night filled mind with importunate thoughts, &amp; the <hi>Idea</hi> of the fair unknown preſented it ſelf, and fixed it ſelf there, more pertinatiouſly than I would have deſired: his gallant mind, and the ſweetneſs of his countenance intermingled with Majeſty, his noble deportment, and the admirable grace which attended his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and action came again into my memory in a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46404:48"/>
very advantageous form, and made good their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion maugre the endeavour to expell them thence: <hi>Leave me,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>leave me troubleſom Idea which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentest thy ſelf to my imagination ſo inconveniently and unſeaſonably, it muſt be in ſome other Spirit than mine that thou mayſt find part of that complacency which thou ſeekeſt for, but in</hi> Olympia's <hi>thou ſhalt never produce any effect, if the Gods do not forſake her. If this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known be handſom, if he be amiable, if he be admirable in all parts, what doth it concern the unfortunate</hi> Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia? <hi>And what interest can ſhe take in a man, with whom her acquaintance is but of a days ſtanding, whom ſhe cannot know but for a few days more, and whom ſhe would not know at all, if that knowledge muſt diſturb her repoſe? Let him ſerve himſelf againſt ſome other heart than mine with all the advantages that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Heaven and Nature, and let him work ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and love every where elſe; but let him leave a mind in peace, to which neither nature hath given, nor her fortune left any diſpoſitions to receive the thoughts which he would introduce there.</hi> By this reaſoning with my ſelf I put off for ſome moments this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting remembrance, and embraced, as I thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrongly, a reſolution never to think upon him more: But a little after, maugre my reſolution, this importunate Image came again into my memory, and made me fix my thoughts in ſpite of my teeth, upon the conſideration of thoſe marvails which I had found in the perſon of the unknown: This agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my Spirit permitted no acceſs to ſleep, and ſeeing the greateſt part of the night was paſſed, and I had not been able to cloſe my eyes, I began to be really angry both with theſe thoughts, till
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46404:49"/>
then unknown to my ſpirit, and with him that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them. <q>What, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> ſhall this unknown u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp that already with authority, which poſſibly he would not have ſufficiently purchaſed all his life time? Have I ſcarcely ſeen him, and muſt he oppoſe my ſleep, &amp; encroach upon my repoſe and liberty? In a condition of life when I ought to think upon nothing but death, ſhall he alone be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to with-hold my thoughts, and ſhall he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them ſo, that I ſhould loſe my ſleep, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and liberty? Ah! my liberty, Ah! my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ye are but weakly grounded in my ſoul, if the firſt ſight of a man can ſo eaſily overthrow you and if ye abandon me for having ſeen a man a few moments, in whom poſſibly all appearances are deceitfull, a man that poſſibly hath nothing ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but that outſide which blinded me at firſt ſight, a man, it may be of no birth or vertue, a man which loves me not, nor poſſibly ever will whilſt he lives. Wilt thou <hi>Olympia,</hi> hazard they affections upon ſuch doubtfull terms? &amp; are they of ſo little value that thou oughteſt not to ſettle them in a place conformable to thy birth &amp; the profeſſion which hitherto thou haſt made of a large ſhare of vertue? It would have been much better for thee, if thou hadſt been buried under thoſe waves which have ſpared thee, or if they had ſwallowed up this enemy which they have driven upon this ſhore to ruine thee: and if thou findeſt thy ſelf ſo weak as to ſuffer thy ſelf to be taken with the ſeducing charm, which appears in his face, thou muſt hate him as a Monſter ready to devour thee, or at leaſt thou muſt avoid him as an enemy ready armed for thy deſtruction.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:46404:49"/>
With theſe words I really gave way to ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, and ſome motions of choler againſt him, and making a very violent effort upon theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate thoughts, I diverted them in ſuch a manner, that a little after I fell faſt aſleep: But in my ſleep I was more ſtrongly aſſaulted, and I was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſleep but the cruel enemy of my repoſe preſented himſelf before me with ſomething more great and more extraordinary than all I had obſerved till then, and looking upon me with a countenance, which as full of paſſion as it ſeemed to be, did yet expreſſe a great confidence in his fortune: <hi>Olympia,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in vain doſt thou arm thy ſelf againſt me, let the destinies take their courſe, 'tis to no purpoſe to oppoſe them, 'tis the will of Heaven that you ſhould love me, 'tis for me only that thou haſt been brought upon this ſhore, I am not unworthy of thy affections, and how ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou wouldeſt dispoſe of them, I tell thee from the Gods that 'tis for me that they are abſolutely reſerved.</hi> It ſeemed to me that as he finiſhed theſe words, and was going from me, he layed his hand upon his heart to ſhew me the wound I had made there. I awaked a little after, ſo troubled with my dream, that I could not recompoſe my ſelf, I knew not whether I ought to take it as a real advice from Heaven, which amongſt the vapours of ſleep doth frequently acquaint us with future things, or for an effect of thoſe thoughts which had ſo ſtrongly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me when I was awake: Howſoever it was, I could not hinder my ſelf from being moved at it in ſuch a manner, that I had hardly any knowledge or uſe of reaſon; &amp; the Idea of that which was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me during my ſleep was ſo ſtrongly imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46404:50"/>
in my imagination, that I could not diſ-engage my memory for a moment.</p>
            <p>After I had meditated a good while upon this, not being able to quit my ſelf of this pertinacious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: <hi>Ah! Gods,</hi> ſaid I within my ſelf with a ſigh, <hi>can it be poſſible that my deſtiny ſhould be ſuch as ye tell me by the mouth of this enemy of mine? and that ye have brought me out of my native Country, and cauſed me to ſuffer ſhipwrack upon this Rock, to ſee there the cruel effect of his threatnings. If it be your intention, great Gods! I know it would be but in vain for me to reſist it, but till I am more fully informed by ſome other way, than by a mouth which I very much ſuſpect, I will defend my ſelf with all my power againſt the aſſaults of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous perſon, who hath already ſo much confidence either in his merit or in his fortune.</hi> This was then my intention, and I really ſummoned to my aſſiſtance all the reſentment and choler I could form againſt this audacious perſon which had ſo highly threatned me. For all this it was impoſſible for me to ſleep one moment longer, but I felt my ſelf ſo tired with watching, and the perſecution I had ſuffered from my importunate thoughts, that I deſired to beſtow part of the day in repoſing my mind and body, and it was almoſt Noon before I thought of quitting my ſorry lodging.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ericia</hi> coming to me about that time asked me if I would not riſe, and told me that the unknown was at the entrance of my Cabin, and enquired how I did, and if he might be permitted to give me Good Morrow. My blood was moved at <hi>Ericia</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and rallying up all the reſentment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I had fortified my ſelf: <hi>I cannot ſee him to day,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:46404:50"/>
ſaid I, to <hi>Ericia, tell him I am indispoſed, and do you keep him company if you will, for he cannot poſſibly expect mine.</hi> Theſe words eſcaped me before <hi>Ericia,</hi> and I ſhould have been very ſorry, if it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any body elſe, but this Maid, whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways truſted with my moſt ſecret thoughts. She was troubled at this diſcourſe, and at the action with which I pronounced it, and fearing I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome diſpleaſure from the Unknown: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>have you any occaſion to complain of this man, who is beholding to you for his life, and expreſſes ſuch great reſentments of that obligation? No</hi> ſaid I, <hi>but I cannot ſee him, go and entertain him if thou wilt, and leave me a little to my repoſe. Ericia</hi> did as I gave order, and a little after my Governeſs coming to me, I told her that I was troubled with a pain in my head, occaſioned by my want of reſt that night, and that I would try if I could take the other nap.</p>
            <p>It would be a hard matter for me, fair Princeſſes, to repreſent to you what the agitation of my Spirit was at that time, I know very well that of all the paſſions which ſtrove for place there, choler took up the moſt room, and I was ſo ill ſatisfied with my ſelf, for the weakneſſe I obſerved in my ſelf, that I thought my ſelf unworthy of my own eſteem and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid I ſighing, <hi>What</hi> Olympia, <hi>in one day, and with a ſtranger too? With a ſtranger,</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I, <hi>and in one day,</hi> Olympia? Theſe thoughts tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled me in ſuch a manner all that day, that my mind enjoyed not one moment of repoſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Ericia,</hi> as I had commanded her, went to entertain the fair unknown, and ſhe had no ſooner acquainted him (as ſhe told me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46404:51"/>
that I would not ſee him that day; but ſhe obſerved great ſigns of ſadneſs in his countenance. After he had kept his eyes fixed upon the ground a while, looking this Maid in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the face with an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted air.<hi> Could it be poſſible </hi>ſaid he,<hi> that I ſhould be importunately troubleſome to your Lady, or that I ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to diſpleaſe her by any of my actions? No certainly, </hi>replyed<hi> Ericia, conſidering the manner of the converſation you have had with her, it would be hard if ſhe ſhould have received any trouble or diſpleaſure from you: but ſhe is a little indiſpoſed, and 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, conſidering what ſhe ſuffered at Sea, and endures ſtill by her bad lodging, her ſorry bedding, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of all manner of things, which without doubt might alter a complexion much leſs delicate than hers. </hi>If the unknown was troubled out of fear of having diſpleaſed me, he was no leſs afflicted with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he conceived of my indiſpoſition, and looking upon<hi> Ericia </hi>with an action that ſignified to her that he took a great deal of intereſt in me already:<hi> I would willingly render back, </hi>ſaid he,<hi> this life of mine to the waves, from whence you have reſcued it, if any one of my actions hath been diſagreeable to that Princeſs, to whom I owe all, both in respect of the infinite merit of her perſon, and the preſervation of my life. But though that misfortune ſhould not betide me, I cannot but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unhappy in the knowledge you give me of her indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I cannot but be nearly ſenſible of all the ills to which a perſon ſo extraordinary, and to whom I am ſo much obliged, can be expoſed. Her malady is not very great, </hi>replyed<hi> Ericia, ſhe is only troubled with a pain in her head proceeding from want of reſt laſt night. If watching </hi>anſwered the unknown,<hi> and the loſs of reſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46404:51"/>
muſt produce this effect upon a complexion ſomewhat ſtronger than hers, there are ſome poſſibly that would be more indiſpoſed than the Princeſſe is, and without doubt they would have given ſomething more pretious than their health for the return and preſervation of hers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had diverſe other diſcourſes with her, by which he diſcovered ſome diſorder and alteration in his ſoul, till dinner time, and then he dined with her, and <hi>Eurilas,</hi> and my Governeſle, I keeping cloſe, though with a great deal of pain, to the reſolution I had taken not to ſee him that day.</p>
            <p>The ſucceeding night was as reſtleſs to me as that which went before, and the next day endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make my Spirit yeild to the conſtraint, which I had laid upon it the day before, and to hinder my ſelf from ſeeing the cruel enemy of my repoſe, that in ſo ſmall a time had made ſuch ſtrange depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in my ſoul, 'twas impoſſible for me to diſpoſe my ſelf to it, and to deny <hi>Ericia</hi> the permiſſion to ſee me, which ſhe deſired on his behalf. I ſaw him, not without trouble and emotion, I ſaw him as he appeared to mee in my dream, which came inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly into my remembrance, and I ſaw him in a condition capable to overthrow all the reſentments that I had muſtered up againſt him in my Spirit. He ſpake to me, as I thought, with a great deal leſſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance than before, and I believed that every time I ſpake to him, I diſcovered ſome part of my own diſorder.</p>
            <p>I will not amuſe you with the particularities of all our diſcourſe, which proceeded no farther yet, than to things indifferent, or at leaſt very diſtant from thoſe thoughts which took up the greateſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46404:52"/>
room in our Spirits; we talked concerning the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and miſeries of our ſhipwrack, what hopes we had of our ſafety from Heaven, and what reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ought to take to dye couragiouſly, if we received no ſuccour, before the little proviſion we had was ſpent: and when we were upon this ſubject, I plainly perceived that the fair unknown expreſſed more reſentment for the danger which threatned me, than for his own. The more he proceeded in his diſcourſe, the more he ſpake to me with an unaſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red countenance, his words were alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſighs, and his looks, which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fixed upon my face, loſt all their confidence, when I looked upon him. Though I had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to engage my ſelf to this unknown perſon, who probably was not of a birth proportionable to mine, and with whom, in the evident danger we were, I could not contract any friendſhip without the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of folly, yet I confeſſe, my heart having made him way, it was with ſome joy that I obſerved this alteration in his ſpirit, and having been afraid till then, that, beſides the diſproportion of his birth, he had but little diſpoſition to love me, I could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diſſipate that fear without ſome ſatisfaction. I had a great deſire to be informed by him of his name, his Country, and extraction, but then I met with great difficulties, and I no ſooner opened my mouth to ask him about the buſineſs; but it was ſtopped with the fear I had to underſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might diſpleaſe me; He was not forward of himſelf to declare himſelf, and I durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deſire any fuller intelligence of him, for fear of finding ſomething in his extraction that might
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46404:52"/>
make me condemn the thoughts I had for him. This fear really hindred me from expreſſing my curioſity, and alwayes when this deſire urged me, this fear expelled it ſo, that I had not the confidence ſo much as to enquire of <hi>Ericia,</hi> to whom hee might have diſcovered himſelf more familiarly, than to me.</p>
            <p>Diverſe dayes paſſed in this manner, I not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to inform my ſelf any farther, and in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim I found ſo many amiable parts in this unknown, or rather ſo many parts capable of ſurprizing the hearts and ſouls of perſons leſs apt to receive the impreſſions of Love, that neither the difference that I beleeved to be between our conditions, nor the uncertainty of being beloved by him, nor the apprehenſion of an approaching death, wherewith we were ſo evidently threatned, could hinder me, fair Princeſſes, (I ſpeak it with ſome confuſion) could hinder me, I ſay, from loving him. It muſt needs be that this affection was decreed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ſeeing it received its original by ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ways, and in a condition when, according to all probability, our Spirits ſhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of its impreſſions: but in concluſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were out of Sympathy which ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſuch effects, or by deſtiny which acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to my dream in this adventure, I began to love this unknown to the prejudice of mine own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and all the reſiſtance I could make, was not ſtrong enough to defend the entrance of my heart.</p>
            <p>I fear, Ladies, that you have not indulgence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pardon this weakneſs in me, and that you

have reaſon to find it a thing very much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in a Kings daughter, to have ſo haſtily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her inclinations to a man of whom ſhe had no knowledge, but the good opinion ſhe had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his perſon; one that ſhe had never ſeen but a few dayes before, and to whom ſhe was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for any ſervice, or obligation: and truly I will not excuſe it, either by the extraordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the unknown, or by any of thoſe reaſons which are wont to be alleged in a juſtification of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but I will impute it only to the force of my deſtiny, which, as you will judge by the ſequel of my diſcourſe, acted extraordinarily in this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſoul. 'Tis true I began to love this fair unknown, whatſoever endeavours I uſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but I conſerved command enough over this growing affection, to frame a very ſtrong reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, never to make the leaſt diſcovery of it, till I knew that his condition was ſuch, that without any blame I might hope one day to receive him for my husband (if the Gods were pleaſed to prolong our dayes by thoſe ſuccours which were neceſſary for us to get out of this little deſert Iſland, where in all likelyhood we could hope for nothing but death) and if it were my mis-fortune not to find him ſuch as I might deſire, to ſuffer death rather than ever to declare to him my affection, in which without ecclipſing my honour, and incurring reproach, I could not rationally expect any good ſucceſſe. This was my reſolution, and I found my ſelf capable of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in execution, a great deal more than I was to reſiſt this paſſion, which had aſſailed me with ſo much impetuoſity, and from this moment I began to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46404:53"/>
curb my looks, and to lay a reſtraint upon all things that might give the unknown any intelligence of the advantage he had gotten upon my Spirit: I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him as ſeldom as in civility I could, and he obſerving that I retracted ſomewhat of that which I permitted him at firſt, became a great deal ſadder than ordinary, and favoured my deſign himſelf, more than I would have wiſhed, in ſeeking ſolitude in the moſt retired places of our little Iſland. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe for all that I was troubled at it, and though I did all that I could poſſibly to avoid him, yet my deſire was that my diſtance only might ſeparate us one from another, without his contributing any thing on his part, and I was well pleaſed that he ſhould look after me, though I was ſometimes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to meet him. Yet the complacency I had with my affection made me ſuſpect that it was not out of averſion that he kept from me, and that I had poſſibly wrought ſomething upon his Spirit which rendred him more circumſpect in avoiding the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of diſpleaſing me, but the uncertainty I was in very much troubled me, and the condition of my Spirit being ſtrangely changed, I was as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid then, that I was not beloved by him, as I was at firſt that I loved him better than I ſhould do.</p>
            <p>Whileſt we were upon theſe terms, when any other Spirits than ours, would have found another ſubject for their thoughts than that which took up ours, we ſaw no Veſſel appear to ſuccour us, and our proviſions decreaſed in ſuch a manner, that we had no more left than for eight dayes: 'Tis true our men had found an invention to catch fiſh, and there was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46404:54"/>
in that little Iſland a ſpring of freſh water, and by that means we hoped to ſpin out our days a little longer, when all our other victuals failed us; but this was but a very ſorry ſhift, and there was little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that a tender complexion ſhould long ſubſiſt upon no nouriſhment but only fiſh and water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the incommodities of lodging and bedding, might in time ruine a more robuſtious conſtitution than mine. All our people were in a very deſolate condition, and though they expected ſome return of the prayers which they continually made to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all hope had almoſt deſerted them. I was the leaſt troubled at the apprehenſions of death, and the unknown made it ſufficiently appear to me, that if he was moved at it, 'twas not upon the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his own life. <hi>I ſhould be very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> ſaid he to me one day, <hi>if I have only prolonged my life to ſee the end of yours; and the ſuccour I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from your goodneſs would be very cruel to me, if I muſt purchaſe theſe few dayes which it hath added to mine by the greateſt of all diſpleaſures under which a courage can ſuffer. Ah! If my deſtiny be ſo, I may well accuſe Heaven to my last gaſp, for not permitting me to loſe my life amongſt the waves where all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany have found their ſepulture. If that muſt happen,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>we muſt conform our ſelves to the will of the Gods, who with ſoveraign authority diſpoſe of our days, and your murmuring will not make them change their decrees. No,</hi> added the Unknown, <hi>but it will convince them of cruelty and injuſtice, and where there is ſo juſt a cauſe of complaint, it is no eaſie thing to keep within the bounds of an abſolute moderation. Vertue,</hi> replyed I, <hi>ought to produce this effect in us, and from</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:46404:54"/>
               <hi>that only we may receive ability to ſupport the utmost ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of our destinie. Ah! Vertue,</hi> cryed he with a ſigh, <hi>if thou oughteſt to ſuccour me, why is thy aſſiſtance ſo ſlow, and why haſt thou not defended me in a far greater neceſſity than this danger is to which our lives are now expoſed. Ah! Madam,</hi> continued he, looking upon me with an ill-aſſured countenance, <hi>how much inequality will there be, if the God, have ſo decreed it, in the end of our days, and how great ought the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be between our grief in reſpect of the loſſes we muſt have.</hi> In uttering theſe words he let fall ſome tears, and I was ſo moved at them, that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt let him underſtand by ſome marks of weakneſs, that in the death which we expected, or in the thought which then took up our ſpirits, there was no ſuch great difference as he imagined.</p>
            <p>We paſſed divers days in this manner, without his giving me any more particular knowledge of his cruel inquietudes, which I could not impute only to the fear of death, and he went alone to ſpend the greateſt of the day in the moſt private and unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented parts of the little Iſland, that he might not be interrupted in his muſing and melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and at thoſe hours when he was obliged in civility to viſit me, he accoſted me, and ſpake to me with a countenance ſo troubled, and ſo different from that, which he had ſhewed me ſome days before, that it was eaſie to judge by exteriour appearances, that he had inwardly received ſome powerfull alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. According to his example I ſought occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſollitude, and oftentimes quitting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of my Governeſs and <hi>Eurilas,</hi> I went abroad to walk with <hi>Ericia</hi> only, in thoſe places where we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46404:55"/>
might be leaſt diſturbed in our converſation. This Maid had related to me all the diſcourſe ſhe had heard from the mouth of the unknown, in which one might eaſily obſerve ſome particular intereſt; and having an abſolute confidence in her, I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to her, though with a little ſhame, all my moſt ſecret thoughts, and the inclination I had for the unknown. <hi>Ericia</hi> was not troubled at this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and whether it were that her compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceney to me hindred her from condemning me, or whether ſhe was favourable to the man, becauſe ſhe ſuſpected his thoughts to be of the ſame nature with mine, ſhe did not ſtrive to ſuppreſſe this inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the birth, but oftentimes told me, that if any man was capable of producing a ſudden affection, without doubt it was the unknown, and that if it pleaſed the Gods that he were of a birth never ſo little near to mine, one could not ſee a couple in the world better matched. This indulgence which <hi>Ericia</hi> had for my thoughts, made me love him the more, and I declared my mind to her with the greater liberty. We often made conjectures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon the actions and diſcourſes of this man, to judge if I was beloved by him, and though we had great ſuſpitions of it, we were ſtill in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, when fortune ſent us an occaſion to clear our doubts.</p>
            <p>I went one day out of my lodging, only with this Maid, to entertain my ſelf with her concerning that which at that time wholy imployed my thoughts, and leaning upon her arm, I walked to the leaſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented parts of the little Iſland, when approaching to one of the extremities of it, where there was a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46404:55"/>
little thick tuft of trees, and ſome points of a Rock above the Shore, <hi>Ericia</hi> made me take notice of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers inſcriptions engraved upon the bark of the trees with a bodkin, or the point of a knife, the letters which compoſed the inſcriptions were <hi>Greek,</hi> and the little knowledge we had of that Character hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred us from diſcerning them handſomly; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the inſcriptions there were wounded Hearts, True-lovers-knots, and other pretty repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons much uſed amongſt amorous perſons. We were amazed at firſt at this accident; and in regard the Letters were but newly cut, we knew very well they could not have been there long, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they were made by ſome perſon then in the Iſland. Amongſt my retinue I judged that none but <hi>Eurilas</hi> was capable of theſe things, and yet both his age, and his humour too, in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we then were, were ſo little conformable to this gallantry, that I could not accuſe him of it, and I was immediately of <hi>Ericia's</hi> judgement, that it muſt needs come from the fair Unknown, <hi>Never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me;</hi> ſaid <hi>Ericia, if theſe be not the effects of that which I have ſo much ſuſpected, and if this man, who is as paſſionate in my imagination as any man can be doth not communicate to trees and things inſenſible that which his respect and the fear of diſpleaſing you hinders him from diſcovering to you.</hi> I was almoſt of her opinion, but I anſwered only with a ſigh, which I could not poſſibly contain, and leaning my head upon hers, I looked upon the inſcriptions in ſeveral places with ſome tenderneſs and intereſt: But a little after, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricia</hi> being gone a few paces from me, found ſome words upon the Rock written in <hi>Latin,</hi> which ſhe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46404:56"/>
underſtood, And after ſhe had read them, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to me with extraordinary ſpeed: <hi>I pray, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>be pleaſed to take the pains to come and ſee ſome things that will fully confirm you in the judgement we have made.</hi> And with theſe words, pulling me by the arm, ſhe lead me to the foot of the Rock, which ſtood over the ſhore, where amongſt divers characters like to thoſe which were upon the trees, I ſaw theſe words engraved in the ſame manner in the Roman language: <hi>Here lang uiſhes, here declares its paſsion to things incapable of knowledge, an heart infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with love, an heart upon which reſpect layes a cruel violence: Ye inſenſible witneſſes and confidents to whom I communicate my dear ſecret, be ye as diſcrect as he that truſted you.</hi> And a little lower were written theſe words in the ſame language and character: <hi>Why have the Gods preſerved me from the water, to make me periſh in the fire? why have they hindred me from dying free, to make die a Slave, and in what could this change of my deſtiny advantage their glory?</hi> In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place a little further off were engraved theſe words. <hi>I do not complain of thee, my heart, I do not complain of thee my liberty, your destiny could not be more honourable, than to be ſacrificed to the divine</hi> O. There was no more than this firſt Letter of my name; but I was almoſt confident that by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he meant <hi>Olympia,</hi> and with a new emotion which this ſight cauſed in me, I continued to read that which followed in this manner: <hi>But my heart! but my liberty, to what end do ye hazard your ſelves, do ye beleeve that in beſtowing your ſelves upon this divinity, ye have made her a preſent worthy of her ſelf, and do ye know that eternal ſufferings are all the reward ye can</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:46404:56"/>
               <hi>hope for thence? Suffer then, my heart, theſe glorious pains, and never complain of them, ſince you have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them without reſiſtance, and Heaven it ſelf contributes thereto.</hi> I finiſhed the reading of theſe words with pain, and not being ignorant, as I thought, either of the cauſe or the author, I could not read them without taking an intereſt in them, which cauſed an extraordinary emotion in me. I ſat down upon the body of a rree that lay cloſe by me, and leaning my head upon both my hands, I began to meditate upon this adventure, when <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricia</hi> coming to me: <hi>Well Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>do you not think that I am right in my conjectures? I beleeve,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>that the Unknown may have written theſe words, and I will tell thee more, if thou wilt, that I will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee that he did not write them for me; but though it were true that he loved me ardently, if he be not of an extraction worthy to be allyed with mine, what can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from his love but a torment to my ſoul, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſpleaſure? and though by on extraordinary favour of Heaven, his birth ſhould prove ſuch as I could deſire it, what can I expect in our preſent condition, whilſt we look for death, which threatens us both within a few daies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpake theſe words ſimply, not beleeving that they were over-heard, but I was deceived; for the Unknown of whom we ſpake, lay about four paces from us, within a point of the Rock, from whence he had ſeen all our actions, and heard all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. At theſe laſt words which he had heard, ſuppoſing he had found the faireſt occaſion that ever he could hope for in his life to preſent and declare himſelf to me, he roſe, and diſcovered himſelf to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46404:57"/>
me in ſuch an unexpected manner, that I cannot yet call to mind that adventure without ſome aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. The place where <hi>I</hi> ſaw him was ſo near to me, that <hi>I</hi> could not but beleeve immediately that he had heard my diſcourſe, and <hi>I</hi> was ſo full of ſhame and confuſion at it, that my countenance changed colour a hundred times in a moment, and not finding confidence enough in my ſelf to look in the man's face, who had learned ſo much of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, contrary to my intention, <hi>I</hi> could do nothing elſe but turn my head the other way, and lean it upon <hi>Ericia's</hi> ſhoulder.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he drew near me with an unſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pace, and as <hi>I</hi> underſtood by <hi>Ericia</hi> afterwards, with a diffident countenance; he caſt himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently at my knees, he fixed his eyes upon the ground, which he durſt not raiſe up to my face, and beginning to ſpeak with ſuch a tone of voice, as, in ſpite of his natural boldneſs diſcovered the fear and trouble of his Spirit: <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I would not preſent my ſelf to you in the criminal condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I now appear, if in my conſcience I did not know my ſelf to be very innocent in relation to you: I have thoughts of adoration for you which I cannot deny, but they are ſo conformable to thoſe which we have for the Gods, that if you were devested of all that is humane, you could not poſsibly find in them any real ſubject of offence. If ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was neceſſary to obſerve religiouſlie the reſpect which is due to you, Heaven is my witneſs, that I have not violated it, but have been betrayed, contrary to my intention, by thoſe inſenſible things in which I imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie confided; If my raſhneſs diſpleaſe you, howſoever I would excuſe it, I wil inflict that puniſhment upon it which</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:46404:57"/>
               <hi>it deſerves, by throwing again amongst the waves that which you ſaved from thence, and depriving this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate man of your ſight for ever, whoſe audacious thoughts have been capable of meriting your anger: but if they may find any juſtification in thoſe things which poſſibly render them a little leſſe diſproportionable than they have appeared to you, I will take the liberty to tell you, Madam, that if by my perſon and my ſervices I can merit any approbation from your goodneſſe, you will not poſſibly find any thing in my birth which may make you condemn it, and that I am born of a blood ſufficiently noble to intitle my thoughts to any thing that a man can aſpire to.</hi> The unknown expreſſed himſelf thus, with a grace and action which notwithſtanding his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate humility, did marvailouſly authorize his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and in his laſt words I found ſomething ſo agreeable to me, and ſo ſatisfactory againſt the doubt which <hi>I</hi> had of his birth, that the trouble which had ſeized me was partly deſſipated, and the reſentments I had againſt his raſhneſs began inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to grow calm.</p>
            <p>By little and little I turned my eyes towards his face, and in this ſubmiſſive humble condition, I found it ſo handſome, and ſo capable of making it ſelf beloved and of diſarming my anger, that when I thought to open my mouth to condemn his temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with words of rigour, my heart could never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, but ſtifled in my mouth the diſcourſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. I turned away my eyes once more from his face, to recal a reſolution which this ſight did too ſtrongly oppoſe, and I began to examine my ſelf, and ſtudy what diſcourſe to make to reconcile my duty with my inclination, or to comply with my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46404:58"/>
without offending againſt my duty. I know not whether my ſilence and confuſed action did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden him, but after he had waited a while for my anſwer, ſeeing that I opened not my mouth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: <hi>I ſee very well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that my raſhneſſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and 'tis reaſonable that I ſhould expiate the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence I have done you with that life which I owe to your goodneſſe, I will willingly ſacrifice it on that ſcore, and all the regret I can have in ſo doing, will be, that in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only with my life, I ſhall part with nothing that is mine for the reparation of my crime. Command me, Madam, to reſtore back again to the Sea, that which by a ſecret or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Heaven, it threw at your feet, or command me to take out of the world this object of your reſentment by any other way that is capable of giving you ſatisfastion: and if you find me ſlow in obeying you, judge, as you may have reaſon to do, that I have undertaken to ſerve you with a courage too low for ſo high an enterpriſe, or if Heaven, which hath ſubjected me to you by ſo uncommon a way, ſtirs up your pity in my favour, and diſpoſes you to ſuffer my adorations, as it ſuffers them its ſelf, do not oppoſe thoſe pityful inſpirations, and look with a gentle eye upon the moſt religious and ſubmiſſive ſlave that ever your divine beauties could make conqueſt of.</hi> Whileſt he was pronouncing theſe laſt words, I had a little recompoſed my ſelf, but not ſo much neither but that there remained enough diſorder and confuſion in my ſoul to hinder me from forming any rational diſcourſe. I turned my ſelf a little towards him, and ſeeing him in that ſubmiſſive poſture, which he had uſed all the time: <hi>And who art thou,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>that comest to aſſault my heart with ſuch armes as oblige me to look upon thee as my enemy, and one who in a place,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:46404:58"/>
               <hi>and a condition where, and when we expect nothing but death, endeavoureſt to trouble the tranquillity of my last dayes? What is thy thought, what are thy hopes, what is it thou offereſt me, and what is it thou deſireſt of me? I offer you,</hi> replyed the unknown, <hi>I offer you a heart that was never offered to any but your ſelf, and I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto you the moſt innocent thoughts that ever any mind conceived; I only deſire you to allow of this reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſion which fixes me at your feet for that ſhort time of my life which yet remains, the fear of approaching death which you ſet before my eyes, hath not been able to oppoſe its birth, and if it pleaſe the Gods that our dayes receive their period in this place where we ſeem to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by their aſſiſtance, the glory of theſe laſt dayes, when you have owned them, will be more dear to me, than all the time of my life I have paſſed hitherto in a more compoſed condition; if I trouble the repoſe of your dayes, and make an attempt upon your heart with armes too weak to make any impreſſion there, impute it to your own powers which are too ſtrong to find any reſiſtance in a ſoul that is ſuſceptible of love, and to the deſtinies which have acted after an extraordinary manner in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of my liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt he was ſpeaking in this manner, by little and little I inured my ſelf to look upon him, and hearken to him, and to a mind prepoſſeſſed as mine was, all things appeared in him ſo agreeable and ſo advantageous that I could no longer retain the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my inclination which urged me to let him know that I did not hate him. In concluſion I could not be ſo much Miſtris over them, but that I bluſhed and expreſſed my ſelf to him in ſuch terms as quickly diſcovered my thoughts to him. <hi>I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>

he was much troubled that he had not been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſooner of his arrival, that he might have gone to meet him, and render him that which was due to his merit and fortune; He haſted to him with all the ſpeed he poſſibly could, but he could not be ſo nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that he found him already upon the ſtairs, followed by a ſtately retinue of the young <hi>Roman</hi> Nobilitie, whom his vertue and generous humour engaged to his perſon, more than his favour. If <hi>Agrippa</hi> was the chief at <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard of his great credit, and the eſteem both of the Emperour and people, or at leaſt if <hi>Marcellus</hi> did diſpute thoſe advantages with him, whom his youth had not as yet permitted to manage important affairs of State, and to have great commands of Armies, wherein <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> had acquired ſo high a reputation, <hi>Cornelius</hi> was likewiſe one of the moſt conſiderable perſons of the Empire, and if he made <hi>Agrippa</hi> the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reception that he could deviſe, <hi>Agrippa</hi> converſed with him too, as with a man who was dear to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and placed in the faireſt dignities. <hi>Gallus</hi> complained of him at the firſt for coming in this manner, without giving him notice of his arrival, and time to receive him, as he ought to have done, in all reſpects; and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom his fortune had never infected with pride, but in all the actions of his life expreſſed a marvellous modeſty, found fault with his diſcourſe, and told him that he did not deſire to be treated otherwiſe by him, than as his familiar and antient friend. <hi>Cornelius</hi> having conducted him to the lodging which was appointed for him againſt the time when they ſuppoſed he would come with the Emperour, cauſed him to be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46404:61"/>
ſerved a little after with as much magnificence as could be uſed: for the ſmall time there was of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preparation. A little after <hi>Agrippa</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him part of the affairs which obliged him to come thither ſome days before the Emperours ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; and after they had paſſed ſome hours in this entertainment, <hi>Cornelius</hi> acquainted him, how that the only daughter of the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of that mighty Empire, which only vied power with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> was then in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and in the Palace in a lodging not far from his: He did nor make ſo much mention to him of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace,</hi> beleeving that her birth was not anſwerable to <hi>Eliſa's,</hi> and not deſiring to be over laviſh in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of a perſon in whom he already took ſo much intereſt as might make him ſuſpicious of all things. <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſeemed ſurprized at this news, and after he had meditated a little upon it, he beleeved that <hi>Augustus</hi> would be highly ſatisfied to ſee the only daughter of the powerfull Enemy of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> refuged in his Court, and diſpoſed himſelf to go and give her aſſurance of the protection ſhe might expect from <hi>Ceſar:</hi> But if he had this thought out of conſideration of her birth, it was much more ſtrongly grounded in his mind by the diſcourſe which <hi>Cornelius</hi> made him of her admirable beauty, which he deſcribed to him in ſuch terms, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> being moved with an extraordinary curioſity, would no longer defer the beſtowing of a viſit upon the Princeſs. <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſent her notice of it, and a little after they went together to her chamber, where they found the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> with her, whom the deſire of ſeeing a man ſo famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46404:62"/>
in the world, had detained there. At the ſight of thoſe two Princeſſes, <hi>Agrippa</hi> and thoſe that attended him were all aſtoniſhed, and though they had ſeen in <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and in <hi>Julia</hi> ſuch excellencies as could not be ſurpaſſed by any mortal beauty, yet in the delicacy of <hi>Eliſa's</hi> features, and the Majeſty of <hi>Candace</hi>'s lineaments they found ſome ſubjects of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration which they had not expected.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſes were very well ſatisfied with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa's</hi> preſence, and they found all things in his perſon conformable to his dignity and reputation; his proportion was completely handſom, his mind high and gallant, and his age about three and thirty, or four and thirty years, in which time he had made himſelf known to all the world, as well by the great things he did at the battail of <hi>Artium</hi> the glory whereof was almoſt totally due to him, as by a great number of other ſignal victories, whereby ſince the comming of <hi>Augustus</hi> to the Empire, he had amply enlarged the extent of it on every ſide: The report that univerſally went of him cauſed a greater attention in the Princeſſes, than they would have had in the condition of their fortune, for a leſſe conſiderable perſon: and the ſight of their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beauty immediately ſtrook <hi>Agrippa</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that is not ordinarily conceived for morral perſons. He addreſſed himſelf to the Princeſs of the Parthians, whom <hi>Gallus</hi> ſhewed him; and with a diſcourſe full of civility and ſweetneſs he ſignified to her that the Emperour would receive with great joy the occaſion of protecting ſo great and ſo fair a Princeſs, and offered her his own particular ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to comfort her in her afflictions, and to defend
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46404:62"/>
her againſt all her enemies. <hi>Eliſa</hi> anſwered him with that admirable grace which accompanied all her actions, and thanked him for his offers with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſion full of acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the cloud of her mortal ſadneſs, her beauty ſtill preſerved its Empire, and though it languiſhed a little, yet that, in ſtead of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its powers, ſeemed to adde new ones to it, by that intereſt which affliction is able to form in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſouls. <hi>Agrippa</hi> made a very remarkable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of it, and that martial ſpirit which had ſpent all the years of his life in warlike employments, without ever ſubmitting himſelf to the yoak of an imperious beauty, at the firſt ſight of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> felt an alteration in that repoſe and liberty which he had ſo long preſerved: The ſparkling eyes of that Princeſs threw flames inſenſibly into his breaſt, and the charms he found in her countenance and diſcourſe, did ſo enchant him, that he continued a long time as it were quite dazled and amazed at the meeting with ſo many miracles. Though his mind began to be prepoſſeſſed, yet that did not hinder him from obſerving prodigies in <hi>Candace's</hi> perſon, that were not inferiour to <hi>Eliſa's:</hi> And beſides the reſpect he received for ſo extraordinary a beauty, the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which <hi>Cornelius</hi> gave him, that ſhe was born a Princeſs in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> obliged him to trear her with a great deal of honour. He addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Eliſa</hi> for all that in the greateſt part of their converſation, both becauſe he thought that moſt was due to the King of <hi>Parthia's</hi> Daughter, and becauſe his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation carried him to it. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was not diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, and as his paſſion made him obſerve all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46404:63"/>
things wherein he might be intereſſed, ſo he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully took notice that <hi>Agrippa</hi> was more fixed upon <hi>Eliſa's</hi> than <hi>Candace's</hi> beauties. He had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r,</hi> and in all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but the thought of thoſe which mignt have ſome pretenſions to <hi>Eliſa,</hi> raiſed a more terrible ſtorm, and more difficult to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in <hi>Agrippa's</hi> infant love, than all that ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune could have cauſed till then.</p>
            <p>This firſt interview was ſpent in offers on <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa's</hi> part, and in diſcourſes touching <hi>Eliſa's</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, wherein <hi>Agrippa</hi> began already to take too much intereſt, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> having deſired that he would ſup with the Princeſſes, after their repaſt he entred again into converſation with <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and found in her diſcourſe new occaſions of being inflamed and farther engaged.</p>
            <p>This employment hindred the Princeſſes from beſtowing that evening as they had reſolved, upon the ſequel of <hi>Olympias</hi> narration, and the part which they had begun to take in her fortune, had cauſed ſuch an impatience in them to hear the reſt, as made theſe two men's company unpleaſant. <hi>Eliſa</hi> was leſſe troubled at this paſſage, than <hi>Candace</hi> was; for <hi>Agrippa's</hi> thoughts being as yet unknown to her, ſhe received no other diſquiet or importunity from his ſight, than what her ſadneſs made her find amongſt all perſons with whom ſhe could expect no comfort. But <hi>Candace</hi> was not in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> having a free opportunity, whileſt <hi>Agrippa</hi> diſcourſed with <hi>Eliſa,</hi> employed all that time in giving her aſſurances of his paſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46404:63"/>
of her ſome teſtimonies of acknowledgement. <hi>Candace</hi> received theſe diſcourſes with a great deal of coldneſs, but yet ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not willing to break out into any impatience, for fear of his power to which ſhe ſaw her ſelf ſubject, and beleeving upon the account of her former adventures, that ſhe might retain his Spirit within the bounds of reſpect much better by ſweetneſs of carriage, than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to him the diſ-eſteem ſhe had of him. <hi>Cornelius</hi> being deſirous to give her all the divertiſement he could, and to ſhew <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſome paſſetime, whom he highly eſteemed for many reaſons, propoſed a match of hunting the next day, knowing how well <hi>Agrippa</hi> loved that exerciſe; and they engaged the Princeſſes to ſee the Courſe of a Stag in the woods near <hi>Alexandria.</hi> They could very well have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any ſuch diverſion, but they could not refuſe to comply with ſuch perſons in ſo ſmall a matter, and therefore they promiſed, that ſeeing they deſired it, they would bear them company.</p>
            <p>A little while after ſeeing it grew very late, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> bad them good night, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducted <hi>Candace</hi> to her chamber, had ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe with her concerning his vehement paſſion, which ſhe received with ſome trouble, but ſo, as the preſent neceſſity of her condition obliged her to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliſa</hi> being alone in her chamber, the Princeſſe <hi>Olympia</hi> entred preſently after, and no body being with her who was not acquainted with the truth, <hi>Eliſa</hi> made no difficulty to receive her and careſſe her according to the knowledge ſhe had of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and <hi>Olympia</hi> willingly forgot the garb of a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46404:64"/>
Slave to receive her endearements, and to return them with that equality, which the ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between their births permitted. <hi>Eliſa's</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes were not ſuch as they would have been at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, when ſhe was not ſo much dejected by her mortal ſadneſſe, but they were not the leſſe obliging for being the leſs ſpriteful: an <hi>Olympia</hi> knew very well that ſhe was in a condition too full of grief to expreſſe her reſentments by over-paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate demonſtrations: <q>My dear Princeſs, <hi>ſaid Eliſa to her,</hi> ſince my laſt diſaſter I have not been ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any diſpleaſure, as of that which I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when your diſcourſe was interrupted, and I was at that time ſo much intereſſed in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that my freſh and preſſing grief was allayed by that means: though it be late enough to go to reſt, yet I ſhould not let you be at quiet before I was acquainted with the remainder of your ſtory, if the fair Princeſſe, to whom you have declared, as well as to my ſelf, the beginning of your life, had not the ſame curioſity, and ought not to be preſent, as well as I, at your relation. The fear I ſhould have of diſpleaſing her, in deſiring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her in the knowledg of a thing, wherein, I aſſure my ſelf, that ſhe takes the ſame intereſt that I do, or of creating you the trouble to repeat the ſame diſcourſe twice, makes me ſuſpend mycurio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity till to morrow at our return from the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting match, to which they have engaged us, at which time I hope you will have the goodneſſe to finiſh a diſcourſe which I as greedily hearken to as if it concerned my own ſelf. It ſhall be done, <hi>anſwered</hi> Olympia, whenſoever you deſire, and as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46404:64"/>
long as I live, you ſhall have an abſolute power over a Princeſſe, who is not ſo much your Slave in regard of her fortune, as of her inclination. This effect of your fortune, <hi>replied</hi> Eliſa, doth not hinder me from eſteeming you as my ſiſter, and I will endeavour, by rendring for the future what is due to a Princeſſe of your quality, to repair the faults which my errour made me to commit.</q> As for this condition of a Slave, which conceals you from the knowledg of thoſe perſons that ſee you, I ſuppoſe you may eaſily get out of it, and though you ſhould not diſcover your ſelf to <hi>Cornelius</hi> or to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who upon the declaration of your birth would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt reſtore you to the condition wherein you ought to be, I know a perſon that hath credit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with <hi>Cornelius</hi> to obtain your liberty of him, whenſoever you ſhall pleaſe to demand it, without making you known, contrary to the intention which perhaps you have to conceal your ſelf for a longer time. <hi>'Tis true,</hi> ſaid <hi>Olympia, I am obliged to continue a while longer in this condition becauſe of my affairs, and nothing urges me yet to deſire my liberty the loſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall ſupport with patience, as long as I ſhall have the happineſſe to be near you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe words the two Princeſſes embraced each other with a great deal of affection and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and ſitting down both upon <hi>Eliſa's</hi> bed, that Princeſs made a brief relation to <hi>Olympia</hi> of thoſe particulars of her life which ſhe was ignorant of. The fair Slave had been made acquainted with what the Princeſs had related to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> but ſhe learned a great deal more from <hi>Eliſa's</hi> mouth, who confeſſed to her the love ſhe bare to the great and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46404:65"/>

Part of the night being ſpent in their converſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Eliſa</hi> deſired <hi>Olympia</hi> to lodge with her, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of returning to a bed and a chamber unworthy of her, and preſſed her to it very earneſtly, but the Princeſs of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But <hi>Agrippa</hi> paſſed this night in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from all the nights he had ever paſſed in his life, and the beauty of <hi>Eliſa</hi> had wrought that upon his Spirit in one day, which a leſs extraordinary one would not have done in whole years, and that which had not been done in ſo many years by all the <hi>Roman</hi> beauties, and ſo many others of the higheſt reputation, amongſt whom he had inſenſibly ſpent his life.

'Tis true, </hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied<hi> Agrippa, that when the mind is diſturbed by a violent paſſion, the body doth not eaſily find repoſe, and 'tis not long ſince I had experience of it, having paſſed a night in ſuch thoughts and ſuch diſquiets as I never was ſenſible of before.

               <hi>Agrippa</hi> would have ſpoken more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and poſſibly from this general diſcourſe, he would have paſſed to particulars, finding an object in <hi>Eliſa's</hi> preſence that encouraged and inflamed him more and more, if <hi>Cornelius</hi> had not interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to lead the Princeſſes to dinner which ſtaid for them, and was haſtened a few houres, that they might the longer enjoy the pleaſure of hunting: They took their repaſt together, and they had no ſooner made an end of it, but they went down into the Court of the Palace, where all things were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for that dayes divertiſement. The Princeſſes mounted into a light Chariot, drawn by ſix white Horſes, open before and upon the ſides, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only behind as much as was needful to ſhade the Princeſſes from the beams of the Sun, without hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them from diſcerning all the objects in the fields.

               <hi>Cephiſa</hi> at their feet without any other company. <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> being mounted upon two ſtately Horſes, marched by the Chariot, each as his inclination lead him, the perſons of their train fol-Iowed them in a very handſome equipage, and the Hunters with all their company attended at one of the City gates. <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> were in a Hunting garb, but they had affected more neatneſs and elegancy than they were wont to make uſe of in their ordinary habit, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> whoſe dawning paſſion had quite metamorpholed him in a dayes ſpace, out of a particular care, had forgot nothing that might ſet off his good parts: The two Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would not add any thing to their apparel, and had excuſed themſelves upon the account of their ſadneſs, and the condition of their fortune, for not accepting of thoſe habits which <hi>Cornelius</hi> had ſent them that morning to accouter themſelves confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to that dayes exerciſe. The two Lovers marching by the ſide of the two Princeſſes all the way they had to go to the place where the Chaſe was to begin, entertained them with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; <hi>Agrippa</hi> not daring ſo ſuddainly to diſcover his thoughts to a Princeſs whoſe birth and Majeſty obliged him to a more reſpectful ſilence, and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> not having the opportunity before <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to purſue the diſcourſe, whereof the fair Queen of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> had heard the beginning with an ill will. Their inquietude might be read in each of their countenances, and if <hi>Candace</hi> knew too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his paſſion, <hi>Eliſa</hi> began to ſuſpect as much of <hi>Agrippa's</hi> as grieved her to the very heart.</p>

When they were come to the Hunters Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, which was at the entrance of the wood, a ſhril noiſe of horns, and the cry of the Dogs, and the voices of the Hunters, made the ſhore of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> ring again for divers furlongs, and they found all things as ready as they could wiſh for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, by the good order that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. They preſently put up the Stag before the Dogs, and the Princeſſes had not only their part in the beginning of the pleaſure, but the wood being divided into an infinite number of ways, ſo that their Chariot might go almoſt any way, the greateſt part of that which paſſed in the Chaſe was in their ſight. <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> laying aſide that day the earneſt inclination they had for that exerciſe, kept themſelves almoſt all the while cloſe by the Ladies, and the Huntſmen to whom they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that care at that time, ſerved their intention ſo well, and turned the Stag ſo handſomly, that he was brought to a bay within ſight of the Princeſſes and almoſt at their feet, <hi>Agrippa</hi> killed him with his Sword.</p>
            <p>They had ſpent part of the day in this divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Sun began to decline, when the Princeſſes paſſing along one of the ways, and their two lovers at the ſide of the Chariot, they ſaw a Horſe without a Maſter, that leaping and bounding paſſed juſt by them, and drew near to the Chariot Horſes. He was all bloudy by reaſon of a wound he had in his flank, and the blood trickled down upon the graſs as he went along: <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſeeing him in this condition, beleeved in all probability that his Maſter might be killed, and that there had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46404:71"/>
been ſome combat near that place: and as his charge obliged him carefully to inform himſelf of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to remedy the diſorders that arrived in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he parted from <hi>Candace,</hi> and galloped towards the place whence he ſaw the horſe come. <hi>Candace</hi> conceiving with her ſelf, that in all adventures her <hi>Ceſario</hi> had ſome intereſt, and that in all combats where there was blood ſhed, her beloved Prince was in ſome danger, deſired that the Chariot might take the ſame way, and when they knew her mind they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

The Pretor ſtopped at this ſpectacle, and after he had viewed the dead, and the great wounds which had put them into that condition, with ſurprize and aſtoniſhment, he turned his eyes every way, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf concerning this adventure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome of his retinue to diſarm the faces of theſe men, to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>She ſpake in this manner, and <hi>Eliſa</hi> rejoyced with her in the hopes ſhe ſaw her conceive; when by the road which the Chariot, and thoſe which garded it followed, they drew near to a very fair houſe, which was at the outſide of the wood, by which they muſt needs paſs in their return to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The Chariot with all the company paſſed along the brink of a little Moat, which encompaſſed the houſe, and as the Queen by reaſon of her amorous inquietude, turned her eyes every way to try if ſhe could ſee <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teocles,</hi> ſhe caſt them upon one of the windows of the houſe, where immediately ſhe ſpied a man leaning; his Head and ſhoulders appeared without the window, and as much of his body as was ſeen was almoſt naked, and in the condition of a perſon riſing out of his bed; his head was bound about with a linnen cloath, under which his long hair, more nearly approaching in colour to fair, than black, fell careleſly upon his ſhoulders. His countenance was very pale, like one that had been long ſick but what change ſoever we might have received, and what diſtauce ſoever there might be from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to the Chariot, and how ſpeedy ſoever the pace of the Horſes was which drew the Chariot, all this could not hinder the Queen of <hi>Eshiopi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and conceiting with her ſelf, either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Idea ſhe had of it in her Spirit, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth, that it was <hi>Ceſario</hi> himſelf. If ſhe kept her ſelf from breaking out into exclamations at this ſight, it was not ſo much by the power ſhe had over her ſelf, as by the force of her aſtoniſhment, which tying up her tongue, and all the functions of the body, by which the reſentments of the ſoul might be expreſſed, left her immoveable in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, only holding her eyes turned towards the dear object of her heart as long as ſhe had the liberty to ſee him. Before that ſhe could come again to her ſelf, the Chariot was gone ſo far from the houſe, that though ſhe ſhould have put her head out of the boot, and her ſelf into ſuch a poſture that ſhe might look ſtill towards that which ſhe left behind her, the object was too far off to be any longer diſcerned. She came to her ſelf, as out of a profound ſleep, and ſignified the return of her ſpirits by a great ſigh, which <hi>Eliſa</hi> obſerved, and having taken notice of her action, the intereſt ſhe took in it making her unquiet, ſhe pulled her by the arm: <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>What is the news, have you ſeen</hi> Eteocles <hi>again, or any thing that confirms you in your hopes or deſtroys that them? Ah! Madam,</hi> replyed <hi>Candace,</hi> embracing her, and whiſpering in her ear, that ſhe might not be heard by thoſe that marched behind the Chariot, <hi>I have ſeen all that I could deſire to ſee, and I would it had pleaſed the Gods that you had ſeen</hi> Artaban <hi>as ſure as I ſaw</hi> Ceſario <hi>from a window of that houſe. Is it poſſible,</hi> anſwered <hi>Eliſa, and are you not deceived? No certainly,</hi> added <hi>Candace, 'tis hard if I ſhould be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an Image, which I carry eternally in my heart,</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:46404:74"/>
               <hi>I have ſeen my dear Prince himſelf, whoſe features are too familiar to me, for to be miſtaken by me and I do not account it ſtrange that his countenance is grown pale, becauſe of the wounds which probably he received in the combat wherein I left him engaged ſome days agoe. The Gods be praiſed for it,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eliſa</hi> to the fair Queen, rendring her her careſſes, <hi>and though they have not the ſame goodneſs for me, I beg of them for you with all my heart that ſatisfaction which they refuſe me. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> replyed <hi>Candace that I now receive from them the greateſt favour that ever I could deſire of them, and ſince I am aſſured of my</hi> Ceſario's <hi>life, all my other loſſes, and all my other diſpleaſures are incapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any impreſſion upon me: I can not at preſent follow the impetuoſity of my affection, which would carry me to this dear houſe, where all my happineſs is incloſed, and I have not ſufficient power over theſe men which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us, nor confidence enough in them to entreat them to conduct me back to my dear</hi> Ceſar, <hi>ſince without doubt I ſhould put his life into a very manifest danger, if I ſhould diſcover his abode in this Country to theſe perſons, who ought to be all ſuſpected by me; but ſince I know that he is alive, and in that houſe, 'tis ſo near to</hi> Alexandria, <hi>that I may hope by the aſſiſtance of the Gods, and my own invention, to find ſome means to give him intelligence of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words of the Queen were followed by ſome others, in which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe teſtified to <hi>Eliſa</hi> the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of her Soul for that happy accident, and the fair Princeſs of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> though ſhe deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſighed for her own misfortunes, was more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Queen's contentment, than in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46404:75"/>
ſhe could be in the ſad condition of her Soul. She expreſſed as much in words full of tenderneſs and ſweetneſs, to which the fair Queen replied with prayers and vowes to Heaven that the ſame happineſs might befall her, and this converſation full of the expreſſions of mutual affection, ended not till they arrived at the City, where they entred not long after, juſt when the Night began to ſpread her black Mantle over the Earth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the mean time <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> making haſte to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> had croſſed a great part of the Wood without finding any perſon that could give them any intelligence, they had obſerved the track of the Horſes as exactly as they could, and being come to a place where it equally parted into two wayes; that their purſute might be with the greater hope of ſucceſſe, they reſolved to divide themſelves, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> with his men taking the way upon the left hand, <hi>Agrippa</hi> with his party, went to the right, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had promiſed each other mutually to meet the next night in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> if they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome great impediment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> marched a great while along the Road which he had taken, turning his eyes and ears every way. The night was already near at hand, when he thought he heard a great noiſe in a part of the wood which he had left upon his left hand, this opinion made him ſtop a while to obſerve the place from whence it came, and when he thought he had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcerned it, he turned his horſe that way at full ſpeed. He croſſed a great deal of ground in a ſmall time, but whether it was that he had miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the place where the noiſe was made, or that the perſons which had made it, were gone before he came, he ſought and looked about every way to no
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46404:76"/>
purpoſe, neither could he find any body to direct him. This diſpleaſure did not befall him alone; for being mounted upon one of the fleeteſt Horſes in the world, his men that ſpurred after him could not keep pace with him, and in a ſmall time they loſt him amongſt the trees, which deprived them of his ſight, ſo that when he turned that way where he thought they were, he found himſelf alone, and this chanced to be juſt as day-light failed, and the darkneſs began to cover the earth. He ſtayed a while upon the place in expectation of them, and called them diverſe times with a loud voice, but all in vain; for in the errour whereinto the ſwiftneſs of their courſe had lead them, they had taken another way quite different from his, after they had loſt the view of him. This accident did much diſpleaſe him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf alone, in the dark, and in a Country where he was unacquainted, and conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all means of rendring <hi>Cleopatra</hi> thoſe aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that were due to her, and after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while uncertain what to do, he reſolved at laſt to ſeek them out, and marched amongſt the trees at all adventures, calling them ever now and then as loud as poſſibly he could: but becauſe the night was not very clear, and he was quite out of all the wayes, he wandred more and more up and down the wood, and knew not which way to go, either to find his men, or to return to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Any other ſoul but his would have been troubled with melancholy at this petty accident, but he was only diſpleaſed that he had ſucceeded no better in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of doing a good action, and moderating his paſſion by the greatneſs of his courage, he continued
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46404:77"/>
marching at adventure whither his fortune would guide him, ſuppoſing that when he was out of the wood, it would not be difficult for him to find the way to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time as he called out often to make himſelf heard by his men if it were poſſible, a man which wandered, as he did, at thoſe hours in the wood, being drawen thither by his voice, drew near the place where he was, and when he was at a diſtance that <hi>Agrippa</hi> might hear him: <hi>What art then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou which makest the woods to Eccho with thy exclamations at a time when all things elſe are buried in ſilence?</hi> He that ſpake theſe words was on foot, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> by reaſon of the darkneſs, ſpying him only a little amongſt the trees, and coming near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to him: <q>"But who art thou thy ſelf, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> thou which demandeſt who I am, and who, as well as my ſelf, doſt take this ſolitary walk during the ſhadows of the night? I am, <hi>replied the man,</hi> a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creature abandoned by the Gods, and by fortune, a man to whom thou wouldſt do a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in killing of him, or in furniſhing him with any means to get out of the mis-fortunes into which he is fallen.</q> Hearing theſe words, which the unknown accompanied with ſome ſobs, <hi>Agrippa</hi> beleeved that this voice was not abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, but ſeeing little appearance in the Idea which preſented it ſelf to him, he would not ground any thing upon it, but the better to inform himſelf: <q>Thou muſt needs be, <hi>anſwered he,</hi> very much afflicted, ſeeing thou deſireſt death, to which we are not wont to have recourſe but only in the extremity of miſery: and in ſtead of being a means
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46404:77"/>
of that I would more willingly beſtow ſome eaſe upon thy grief, if the opportunity of doing it were in my power. Thou ſpeakeſt like a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſon, <hi>added the unknown,</hi> and if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, thy voice reſembles a man's who is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe generous enough to adminiſter conſolation to the miſerable in their diſtreſſe. I know not, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi> Agrippa, whether thou findeſt any reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in my voice to any perſon that is known to thee: but ſince thou haſt begun to ſpeak to me, I have thought the ſound of thine to be ſo like a mans with whom I have had long acquaintance, &amp; whom I very much eſteemed, that if there were any probability that he might be in this Country at the houre and in the condition I meet thee, I ſhould certainly have taken thee for the ſame man: For my part I have no intention to conceal my ſelf, and I have no enemies that can oblige me to deny that I am <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this diſcovery, the unknown continued a while without ſpeaking, but a little after reſuming his diſcourſe:<hi> Your voice hath not deceived me, </hi>ſaid he,<hi> and I knew it at the firſt to be </hi>Agrippa's,<hi> but the time of night, and the condition wherein I meet you made me have reaſon to doubt of a truth, which ſeemed to me as improbable, as that I ſhould be here alone, by night, and on foot in a place which my mis-fortune hath made my enemy: I tell you enough to make a perfect diſcovery of my ſelf to you, and I ſuppoſe you are not ignorant now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I am the unfortunate </hi>Juba Coriolanus,<hi> upon whom you once beſtowed a ſhare of your friendſhip, and who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may have loſt it by becoming </hi>Ceſars<hi> enemy. The confidence which I have in your vertue, and the ſmall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46404:78"/>
reaſon I have to be in love with my life baniſh all the fear I might have had of diſcovering my ſelf to you in a Country where I can not be known without manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but though you ſhould be of the mind of my most cruel enemies (which I have all the reaſon in the world to believe ſince the change of </hi>Marcellus<hi> and </hi>Cleopatra)<hi> though you ſhould acquaint </hi>Ceſar,<hi> that I wander alone and unknown in his dominions, and though by declaring my ſelf to you I ſhould run upon the infallible loſs of my life: in loſing this wandring and unfortunate life, I ſhall loſe nothing but what is odious to me, and which I would have ſacrificed my ſelf to my grief this deplorable day, if I had not thought it my duty to employ the remainders of it in the ſervice which I owe to that ungrateful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to whom I have devoted it all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt the valiant King of the Moors was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this manner with a throng of ſighes and ſobs that accompanied every word, <hi>Agrippa</hi> hearkned to him with an amazement and irreſolution which kept him a long time immoveable and quite aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; He owed all he had to <hi>Ceſars</hi> bounty, and he could not without ſome offence to his vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any amity for his greateſt enemies: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the eſteem he had alwayes had for the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities, and the ſublime vertue of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> he thought he ſhould brand himſelf with a deteſtable baſeneſſe, if in ſo deplorable a condition as he ſaw him in, which he partly knew by the loſs of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and by what was repreſented to him in his diſcourſe, he had conſerved the thoughts of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and had looked upon him according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration due to his fortune, rather than according to that compaſſion which is due to vertuous men in

miſery. After he had made a ſhort reflection upon it, which by reaſon of his excellent nature, and the greatneſs of his ſoul, wrought a much more ſuddain effect upon him, than it would have done in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of more common thoughts, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> remained amazed at this accident, as well to find that Prince in ſo ſtrange a condition, and in ſo unexpected a manner, in a place where there was little likelyhood of his being found, when he thought him to be a great way off, as to hear him expreſs ſo much intereſt, and ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to whom he thought, as well as a great many others, that he had been unfaithfull. He reflected then upon it, not having had time du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the converſation they had together; or at leaſt <hi>Coriolanus</hi> his impatience not having permitted him to enquire why he tormented himſelf ſo for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom, according to the vulgar opinion he had ingratefully forſaken. This conſideration took up his thoughts a good while, before he could paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

judgement upon the uncertainty which this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture afforded; but a little after he beleeved that <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> whoſe generoſity was known to all the world, might doe that meerly upon the ſcore of Vertue, which another would have done for love, and that having ſeen the Princeſſe, whom he had dearly loved, in ſome danger, he had fought for her, and was ſo paſſionate to aſsiſt her, only out of the motions of his Vertue. He did not find it ſtrange, knowing himſelf to be capable of doing as much, and eaſily gueſſing by his own inclinations at the thoughts of vertuous perſons, he meditated a while upon this accident, and turning his memory with compaſſion upon the diverſe revolutions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who did ſo differently ſport her ſelf in the life of this brave <hi>African,</hi> whom ever ſince his birth ſhe had made the object of her inconſtant <hi>Capricies,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him fall before he was born, from Royalty into ſervitude, favouring him in a thouſand gallant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which had acquired him immortal glory amongſt men, and after ſhe had cauſed him to remount his Throne maugre all the forces of the Empire, tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him down again with the ſame ſuddenneſs into the loſs of all, into miſery, and that deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein he had met him, he could not but be very much moved at it, and lifting up his eyes to Heaven with a ſigh: <hi>O Gods,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>how incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible are your judgements, and how inconſiderable is the life of man, ſince the greateſt and most vertuous are ſubject to ſo many misfortune? 'tis in the fortune of this Prince, the braveſt perſon that ever the Sun ſhined upon, that the inſtability of humane things is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and thence we learn a very obſervable leſſon</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:46404:81"/>
               <hi>how little confidence we ought to have in things ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſo apt to periſh.</hi> He had ſtayed longer upon this conſideration, which produced powerful effects in ſuch a ſoul as his, if his new paſſion, which at that time left little room for other thoughts, had not inſenſibly baniſhed thence another mans intereſts, to take full poſſeſſion of his mind its ſelf.</p>
            <p>By the mis-fortunes of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> which love alone, for the moſt part, had produced, he foreſaw what he might fall into himſelf by the ſame paſſion, and making a ſhort mediation thereupon: <q>Alas, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that which I deplore in another, may poſſibly ere long befal my ſelf, and <hi>Eliſa</hi> without doubt is able to cauſe the ſame diſorders in my ſoul and fortune, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had cauſed in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus</hi>'s: I have all the reaſons that can be to fear it, ſeeing in the ſpace of one night and a day, that imperious beauty hath ruined my repoſe, which to all appearance was ſo well eſtabliſhed, and hath made a greacer progreſs in this little time, than another could have done in diverſe years: I feel and ſuffer already all that perſons grown old in love can feel and ſuffer, and if in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my paſſion handles me with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, what may I expect when its forces are aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and its powers are abſolutely eſtabliſhed over this heart, which it ſpares ſo little already? Ah! <hi>continued he, a little after,</hi> though I ſhould have all the reaſon that might be to be afraid of this fatall engagement of my heart, yet it is too handſome for me to make any attempt to break it off, and that deſtiny that brings a divine beauty from the fartheſt parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and from out the

            <p>As he uttered theſe words he laid himſelf down at the foot of Oak, being reſolved to paſſe away the reſt of the night there; for it was at that ſeaſon of the year when they are at the ſhorteſt.

how many troubles both of body and mind had I avoyded, under which both have deeply ſuffered? and yet, O my adorable </hi>(there he ſtopt becauſe he would not name her)<hi> and yet, O dear Miſtris of my heart, how ſorry ſhould I have been if I had followed theſe counſels, which were profitable indeed as to my repoſe, but contrary to the glory, and the ſatisfaction which I find in paſſing my dayes for your ſake in theſe miſeries, which are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more ſweet and more dear to me, than all the pleaſures and felicity I could have taſted in my life, if I had not devoted it to you.</hi>

You have reaſon to do ſo, <hi>replyed the afflicted Lover,</hi> and 'tis very certain that never poſſibly did a foul ſo intirely ſacrifice it ſelf to love as mine hath done, nor devoted its life thereunto with a more perfect reſignation; They are not hopes <hi>(that we may return to our former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)</hi> alas! they are not hopes that maintain it, and though they are not abſolutely extinguiſhed in me, by reaſon of the natural diſpoſition we have to preſerve ſome reliques of them to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: yet according to reaſon, and probability

there is ſo little hope left, and that little is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable to the greatneſs of my love, that in all likelyhood 'tis not by my hopes that my love is preſerved.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> made him this diſcourſe, out of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46404:84"/>
which he really felt in himſelf to eſteem and ſerve him, and by reaſon of ſome approaches of ſleep which began to ſeize upon him, and after two nights watching, and that days toyl lay heavy upon his Eyelids. The Unknown anſwered his offers with all the civility his grief could leave him for a man, of whom he judged very advantagiouſly already, and after ſome replies between them, <hi>Agrippa</hi> grew very drowfie, and at laſt fell faſt aſleep. The fair Image of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> wherewith his ſoul was continually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, appeared to him as he was aſleep, with all thoſe powers, which had ſo ſuddenly made him her ſubject, and he had the contentment to entertain her, and to give her aſſurances of his paſſion, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his ſleep; but it was for no long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and at the coming of the day, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a little after, he was awakened by a noiſe which the man made, with whom he had conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as he roſe from the place where he was, and mounted his horſe, with two Squires which had ſpent the night ſome paces from him. At another time this man, which wanted neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement nor civility, would not have gone from that place without being better acquainted with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> or without thanking him for the offer he had made; but having his ſoul prepoſſeſſed with a paſſion, which extinguiſhed in him all other deſires, and all other remembrances but of his beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he would not engage himſelf in the company of a man, from whom he feared he could not retire to ſeek either that which he had loſt, or ſolitude which was much more dear to him than the ſociety of men. He was already upon his horſe, by that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46404:85"/>
time <hi>Agrippa</hi> was fully awake, and the <hi>Roman</hi> being got up at the noiſe he made, ſaw him amongſt the trees parting from the place where he had ſpent the night, and taking the way on the right hand with his two Squires, who following their Maſters pace, marched very ſlowly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> judged by this departure of his, that he had no deſire to make himſelf known: and eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in him, out of the knowledg he had of the preoccupation of his Spirit, that which a leſſe ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perſon would have taken for want of civility; he conceived a greater deſire to ſee him, and to inform himſelf more fully concerning his fortune and his perſon, whereof he already had a very good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Conducted by this curioſity, he followed him at a diſtance amongſt the trees, and that was not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for him to do, becauſe the unknown having no certain way to go, but being directed rather by chance, than by deſign, went on a ſoft pace, deeply engaged in a profound muſing: <hi>Agrippa</hi> did already diſcern the handſomeneſs of his body as he rode, and the faſhion of his arms which were black, enriched with ſome Jewels of great value, his Caſque was covered with a black Plume of Feathers, ſomewhat ſpoyled with the rain, and worn with a long voyage, and that which appeared of his Caſaque was black too, covered with an embrodery of ſilver, which had been very handſome. <hi>Agrippa</hi> might obſerve all this as he walked amongſt the trees, and though he was on foot, and in a condition unconformable to his quality, he was grown more curious upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The unknown had marched a good while without breaking ſilence otherwiſe than by a few ſighs, and then calling one of his Squires to him,</hi> But <hi>Dion, ſaid he,</hi> doſt thou believe that I ought to ground any farther aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance upon that mans diſcourſe, and is it probable that his ſcience ſhould give him knowledg of my fortune for the future, when poſſibly he is ignorant of his own deſtiny? That is not without example, Sir, <hi>anſwered the Squire,</hi> and by that which he hath told you concerning the preſent condition of your ſoul, you may give ſome credit to what he hath promiſed you for the future. He hath promiſed me nothing punctually, <hi>replyed the unknown,</hi> but hath only given me ſome uncertain hopes, which I ſhould not have fixed upon, if I had any deſigns which that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might divert me from: Seek not, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ſeek not far from the ſhore of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that which thou haſt lost; thou ſhalt not find it any where elſe, and thou mayst hope that the Gods will reſtore it to thee in the ſame condition they gave it thee at firſt.

At this ſight, he knew not why, a ſhivering ran over his whole body, and ſtopping the bridle of his horſe, he continued with his face towards that object unmoveable and aſtoniſhed. <hi>Dion</hi> which followed next to him, ſeeing him ſtand ſtill in this poſture, and reading in his countenance, which was partly viſible his bever being up, all the ſignes of a ſtrange amazement: <q>What ayles you Sir, and by what ſurpriſe is your viſage ſo ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed?</q>

            <p>By means of the delay which this adventure had cauſed, <hi>Agrippa</hi> had the more time and convenience to follow <hi>Philadelph,</hi> without being perceived, he heard part of the words which were ſpoken to <hi>Dion,</hi> he ſaw him alight from his horſe, and gueſſing at ſomething of the truth by his diſcourſe, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his nature made him intereſs himſelf in this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46404:87"/>
adventure more than before, and wiſh the man, though he was unknown to him, happy ſucceſs in his buſineſſe. The richneſſe of his Armour made him already conjecture that he was of no mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and every thing in <hi>Philadelph's</hi> perſon plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his advantage. The paſſionate Prince marched towards the place where he ſaw the Ladies lye, with an extraordinary emotion and throbbing of his heart, and he was ſo troubled between ſome beames of hope, and the fear of being deceived, that he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had ſtrength and aſſurance to go along. He came at laſt with the leaſt noiſe that was poſſible, to the place where upon the green graſſe two Ladies were aſleep, at firſt the number diſpleaſed him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that <hi>Delia</hi> went from <hi>Cilicia</hi> with her Aunt and her Siſter, but he ſtaid not long upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, judging that in the voyages ſhe had made ſince, ſhe might be ſeparated from part of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He looked upon the two women with a very paſſionate action, and lifting up his eyes to Heaven in a very ſuppliant manner: <q>Immortal Gods, <hi>ſaid he, (but with his heart more than his mouth; for that continuing mute for fear of making a noiſe, left all its functions to the heart)</hi> pityful Gods, if by a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous effect of your goodneſſe, ye permit me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe perſons which chance preſents to me, to find my <hi>Delia,</hi> how much ſhould I be beholding to your pity, and for which ſhould I be moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to you, for the former life which I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from you,</q> or this latter which you render me? He paſſed from this thought to ſome motions of an uncertain and wavering joy, but immediately after that was deſtroyed by contrary appearances, and his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46404:87"/>
heart freeſing again with fear, which had been thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by hope: <q>Alas! <hi>replyed he to himſelf,</hi> what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can I have to imagine that this adverſe fortune, by whoſe means I have paſſed ſo many dayes in ſo deplorable a condition, ſhould deal ſo favourably with me to day? Have not I ſeen a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand women ſince I ſought after my wandring and fugitive <hi>Delia,</hi> without meeting her in all that great number, and muſt I hope becauſe ſhe appeared thus once to me, that every thing which preſents it ſelf ſo afterwards muſt needs be my adorable <hi>Delia?</hi> Ah! vain hope, how haſt thou abuſed me to no purpoſe, and how eaſie is it to judge that my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is troubled by my mis-fortunes, ſeeing I hope ſo eaſily for that which I deſire, contrary to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities? 'Tis not in woods, nor a dreadful ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that <hi>Delia</hi> ſpends her nights, and if my deſtiny cauſed me to find her there that fatall day, when I loſt my ſelf, muſt I expect the ſame fortune eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day? Go thy way then unfortunate man, to purſue thy uncertain ſearch, ſeek that which thou haſt loſt in the company of men, rather than in the retreat of beaſts, and do not diſturb the reſt of thoſe perſons which dream not of thee, nor ſo much as know thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Being deſerted by his hope, and abandoning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to grief, hee ſate down upon the graſſe full of ſadneſſe and irreſolution, and continued a long time in deliberation, whether he ſhould go on his way without relying upon the vain hope which had deceived him, or whether he ſhould have any indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for thoſe extraordinarie preſages which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſwade him, that he ſhould receive
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46404:88"/>
ſatisfaction from this adventure. At laſt, ſaid he, <q>though I ſhould find my ſelf deceived in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, which flatters me, I ſhall be in the ſame condition I was a few moments ago: if I fail of finding <hi>Delia</hi> here in this place, ſhe will be no more loſt to me, nor any farther from me, than ſhe was before, and ſeeing I live on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie to ſpend my life in ſearch of her, I ought not to neglect any occaſion of finding her, how improbable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be. Let us try our fortune then, with a firm reſolution to expect from Heaven, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhall pleaſe to ſend us, and let us beg of it, if it refuſe to give us <hi>Delia,</hi> either conſtancy enough to ſupport the redoubling of our grief, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe enough to yield to it, without lingering out this wandering and unfortunate life any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With this reſolution he roſe up, and drawing nearer to thoſe perſons, he viewed them over in a trembling poſture, and endeavoured to take exact notice of their faces; which was not eaſie for him to do without waking them, one of the two having her face covered with a linnen cloth, and the other lying in another poſture, leaned one of her cheeks upon her right arm, and covered the other wi h her left which ſhe had laid over her head; 'twas to her that he addreſſed himſelf, becauſe ſhe had black hair, and her companions fair hair made him know very well, that he muſt not expect her to be <hi>Delia.</hi> Never, in the moſt evident danger, did the moſt fearful ſouldier march with ſo much fear and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and if the amorous <hi>Philadelph</hi> had ſeen death preſent before his eyes in its moſt terrible ſhape, he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46404:88"/>
would certainly have encountred it with more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and reſolution, than this ſhadow or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Delia</hi> whom hee ſought throughout the world. He ſtood a while upright before them with his arms acroſs over his breaſt, in the poſture of a man deprived of a part of the faculties both of body and ſoul, not daring hardly to venture his looks to ſeek between thoſe envious arms, the face which they concealed from him. He had continued a time in this condition, when he was aſſaulted by a new fear, which till then had not aſſailed him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cruel reflections upon what was paſt: <hi>Alas!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>though by ſome favourable miracle it ſhould be true that this is my</hi> Delia, <hi>I ſhould have found her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, poſſibly to my greater mis-fortune, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the inhumanity ſhe had to defend her ſelf againſt my love, in a Country where I gave her ſo many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montes of it, and to forſake me by a flight which expoſes me to ſo many miſeries, juſt when I beleeved that by my love I had merited the utmost recompenſe I had preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, ought not I to fear that my preſence will be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to her, and that ſhe will flye from me ſtill, as from an enemy, whom ſhe avoids in all parts of the world. If ſo many obligations could not move her in the place of my birth, what ought I to expect from my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate purſutes in this deſart, whither poſſibly ſhe is conducted by ſome affection which renders her inſenſible of mine, which robs one of her ſight all the world over, and which without doubt hath cauſed all my mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, both by her flight, and by her hard heartedneſſe when ſhe was in</hi> Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. This thought afflicted him very ſenſibly, but it was not able to interrupt his deſign, and he reſolved to try whether this woman
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46404:89"/>
that lay aſleep, was his ingrateful or his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Delia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had rallied up the remainders of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he kneeled down upon one knee before her, and lifted up his eyes to Heaven, begging his <hi>Delia</hi> of the Gods, with ſighes and vows proceeding from the bottom of his heart, as if he had expected from them, that if this woman was an unknown perſon, they ſhould transform her into <hi>Delia</hi> at his requeſt. After this he put himſelf to the venture of looking what he could diſcover in her face, but, as ill luck would have it, it was ſo cloſely covered by her arm, which was jealous of his content, that he could diſcern nothing: this put him into an inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude full of impatience, not knowing whether he had beſt attend her awaking, or interrupt her ſleep. <q>If this be not <hi>Delia, ſaid he within himſelf,</hi> why ſhould I trouble the repoſe of a perſon, whoſe ſex I ought to honour, and if it be <hi>Delia,</hi> why ſhould I take the liberty to awake her, ſince I may pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently wait till the end of her ſleep? Ah! <hi>added he, correcting himſelf,</hi> if this be not <hi>Delia,</hi> a little incivility, which may be pardoned in relation to ſuch a paſſion as mine, will preſently free me of this errour, and if it be <hi>Delia,</hi> ſhe will eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this ſmall diſſturbance of her repoſe, when ſhe remembers that for her ſake my life is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived of all quietneſs, and that for her ſake, I ſpend my nights without ſleep, and my dayes without joy and comfort.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this thought he reached out his arm to raiſe up that which covered her face, but at the ſame time his fear pulled it back, and in this uncertainty,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46404:89"/>
devouring, as it were, the unknown perſon with his eyes, and bowing down his head towards hers with tranſports full of ardour and violence: <q>
                  <hi>Delia, ſaid he ſoftly,</hi> if you are my divine <hi>Delia,</hi> as my heart tels me, more than all appearances, open, open, thoſe fair eyes, whoſe firſt looks made ſo ready a paſſage to my heart: and with thoſe fair eyes, my Kings, my Maſters, and my Gods, which ſleep too cruelly hides from me, look upon the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Philadelph,</hi> which ſeeks after you all the world over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can neither find repoſe nor reſting place in all the world without you: or if you be not my <hi>Delia,</hi> whoſoever you are, pardon an error in me which is not injurious to you, and beleeve that I do you no wrong in taking you for that which I adore, and for that, than which the whole world can ſhew nothing more fair and amiable.</q> This thought troubled him again, and kept him for a while uncertain what to do; but at laſt not being able to maſter his impatient deſires, and fearing (as unfortunate men have reaſon to fear all things) that ſome accident might deprive him of this favourable opportunity, he ventured ſo far as to lay his hand upon the arm which was contrary to him, and to endeavour to remove it from her face, as gently as he could: He had already diſcovered that part of her forehead which was towards him, and began to ſee one eye cloſe ſhut, and ſeemed with an exceſſe of contentment to perceive nothing but what confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him in his hopes: when the perſon half awaking at the touch, removed her ſelf, and turning more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſide, ſhe put her ſelf into a poſture much more contrary to <hi>Philadelph's</hi> deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:46404:90"/>
He drew back his trembling hand, and out of a fear which love only could cauſe in him, he continued for ſome moments more immoveable than a ſtatue: But at laſt ſuppoſing he had ſurpaſſed the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and that by what he had ſeen conformable to his deſires, they were become more violent and impatient, he put himſelf again into a condition to give himſelf more ample ſatisfaction, and beginning again to uncover the Ladies face, his own was ſo near to hers, that his mouth did almoſt touch part of that cheek which appeared: but as he was very earneſt in his diſcovery, he was diſturbed by the voice of a man, who cryed out to him a few paces off: <hi>Hold, hold inſolent, or thou dyeſt.</hi> Theſe words having made him turn his head that way which the voice came, hee ſaw an armed man, who riſing up from between the trees where he had layen a while, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his head with his Caſque which he held in his left hand, and with his right hand drew his ſword, with an intention to fall upon him with a great deal of fury. If <hi>Philadelph's</hi> grief and trouble had left him time to conſider the face and the whole perſon of his enemy, he would have ſeen, that poſſibly there was not a man in the world more handſom, or more compleat in every reſpect, his age was not above two and twenty yeers, and his face being of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Symmetry, had in it ſo noble and ſo agreeable a fierceneſs, that any one but a perſon threatned and aſſalted, as <hi>Philadelph</hi> was, would have looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with reſpect and admiration. He haſtily threw on his Head-piece upon his long curled hair, which covered part of his ſhoulders, but in ſtead of his face, the proportion of his body might be ſeen,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46404:90"/>
which was ſomewhat taller than <hi>Philadelph's,</hi> but the ſtreighteſt, and the moſt exactly formed that could be. His armes were all compoſed of little ſilver ſcales filletted with gold, his Caſaque of cloth of ſilver, and his Caſque covered with a great Plume of white Feathers. <hi>Philadelph</hi> had not time to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve either his armour or his perſon, but as ſoon as he ſaw him running towards him, he aroſe from the poſture wherein he was, to defend himſelf, and drawing out his ſword to oppoſe his enemy, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards him full of reſentment and grief, not ſo much for his threats, and the attempt he was going to make againſt his life, as for being an obſtacle to his ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Lady whom this noiſe had ſtartled out of her ſleep, haſtily got up, and ran with her companion behind the trees, to put themſelves into ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, or to ſee the event of a buſineſſe, whereof they knew not the cauſe. <hi>Philadelph</hi> breathing out fiery ſighs through the paſſages of his Head-piece, would have turned his eyes that way to look after his <hi>Delia,</hi> but his enemy gave him no time to do that, nor hardly ſo much as to put himſelf into a poſture of defence. Then his choler mounted to the higheſt extremity, and looking upon him with eyes inflamed with indignation: <hi>I know not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>why thou ſetteſt upon me, whom I never injuried, nor poſſibly ever ſaw, but what occaſion ſo ever thou mayst have, thy life ſhall make reparation for the bloody out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thou haſt done me. Thine rather,</hi> replyed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, holding up the arm which he had raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>is forfeited by thy inſolence, and at that rate thou ſhalt learn what reſpect is due to ſuch Ladies as thou late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injuredſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:46404:91"/>
               <hi>Philadelph</hi> might eaſily have defended himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this accuſation, but he would not juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to an enemy againſt whom he was infinitely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and by whom he thought himſelf to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely injured: beſides he thought he ſhould ſooner make an end of the combat with him, than declare his innocent intentions to him, and in that choler which tranſported him, he imagined that man would make but little reſiſtance: but he was deceived in his opinion, and he had to do with an enemy, who in valour was not inferiour to him, nor hardly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon in the world. By the firſt blowes they beſtowed each upon other they took notice one of the others ſtrength, and their arms with which they both held their ſhields bowed under the weight of them: they ſeconded the firſt with a great number of others with more fury and precipitation, than judgement and addreſs, and in a few moments they were engaged in a combat, in which one, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly both, of their lives was in manifeſt danger, if <hi>Agrippa</hi> who was a ſpectatour of it, though at a far diſtance, and by theſe beginnings had conceived a marvailous opinion of both their valours, had not quitted the place, from whence he attentively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held theſe accidents, to go and hinder what might come of ſuch a furious combat. As he ran towards them, he cryed out to them diverſe times to hold, but they were ſo eager that they took no notice of his calling to them, and he was got up to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they turned themſelves to look towards him.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Agrippa</hi> was alone on foot, and without any other arms but his ſword, his courage which had carried him upon ſo many great and famous deſigns,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46404:91"/>
made him eaſily ſlight the danger, that might be in going in that condition to part two armed men, quite blinded with choler: and <hi>Philadelph's</hi> two Squires, who upon equal terms, would not have dared to aſſiſt their Maſter, being very joyfull for all that to ſee the endeavour which <hi>Agrippa</hi> uſed to part them, advanced towards him to help on that deſign as much as poſſibly they could; <hi>Agrippa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come near to them, and laying his ſword upon the point of theirs: <hi>Valiant men,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>be not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in fighting, poſſibly, for a ſlight cauſe, no body will hinder you from proceeding, when the reaſon of it is known to be of an importance enough to endanger the lives of two ſuch men as you ſeem to be: but in the mean time forbear a while at my requeſt, and at the command I lay upon you by the authority of</hi> Ceſar. <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſpake in this manner, and poſſibly hee would have had ſomewhat to do to obtain what he deſired of two men extraordinarily enraged, if the Lady which had been the cauſe of the combat, had not ran to him to ſecond him in his intention, and conjured him in the Name of the Gods, not to permit (if he could poſſibly hinder them) theſe two men to fight any longer.</p>
            <p>At the tone of her voice <hi>Philadelph</hi> being ſtruck to the very bottom of his heart, turned his eyes that way, and ſuch was his fortune, that in that face, wherein by admirable preſages he had hoped to find <hi>Delia,</hi> he really obſerved all the lineaments of his well-beloved <hi>Delia.</hi> No joy, tranſport, or raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ever comparable to his at the ſight of that adored countenance, which had been ſo much ſought after all the world over, and after he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46404:92"/>
his firſt reſentments by a loud exclamation, ſlighting the enemy hee was engaged againſt, and the danger which threatned him, if he were never ſo little negligent, hee let fall his ſword and his ſhield upon the graſs, and ran to <hi>Delia</hi> with ſo much ſuddainneſs, that he had embraced her faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the knees, before that either ſhe or his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had time to perceive his intention. The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which poſſeſted him, depriving him of the uſe of his ſpeech, he expreſſed it at firſt by his action only, and <hi>Delia</hi> ſeeing her ſelf between the arms of a man whom ſhe knew not, becauſe he had not had time to diſcover his face, was more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled than before, and hee that had fought for her, being ignorant of his enemies deſign, maugre the hindrance he had received from <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphs</hi> Squires, advanced towards him with his ſword elevated: when the Prince of <hi>Cilicia</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently tearing off his Head-piece, and at laſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſpeak, amidſt a throng of ſighs which hardly gave him liberty to expreſſe himſelf: <hi>Delia,</hi> cryed he out, <hi>my divine</hi> Delia, <hi>the Gods do then reſtore you to him, whom you flie from throughout the whole world, and my heart did not deceive me, when it perſwaded me that in your perſon I ſhould find my</hi> Delia. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of theſe few words he made diverſe exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without order, or coherence, by which his violent paſſion diſcovered its ſelf to thoſe who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his action, and particularly to his enemy, who having ſtayed himſelf when he ſaw him no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a reſolution or a condition to fight, looked upon him with more amazement than the reſt.</p>
            <p>

When ſhe had had a little time to ruminate upon this adventure, and partly to recover her ſelf from the amazement into which this accident had put her: her face which in <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa's</hi> judgment, who looked upon her with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might compare with the moſt beautyfull upon earth) was ſpread over with a bluſh, which gave it a new luſtre, and it was hard to diſcern whether it proceeded from a principle of ſhame to ſee her ſelf accoſted by a man with ſo much expreſſion of paſſion, or whether it was for joy of having met a Prince to whom ſhe was ſo much obliged, and towards whom ſhe was not inſenſible. At laſt her aſtoniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little diſſipated, by the power which naturally ſhe had over her Spirit, and by that admirable pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which ſhe had expreſſed in all the actions of her life, ſhe endeavoured to reduce her countenance to the former markes of tranquillity, and poſſibly laying ſome violence upon her ſelf not to diſcover to <hi>Philadelph</hi> her more paſſionate thoughts by more tender endearements, ſhe reached him one of her fair hands with a great deal of ſweetneſſe, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon hm with an air, which in a perſon of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's</hi> humour, might perſwade him to any thing to his own advantage: <hi>Philadelph,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I am too much obliged to you to flye from you, and the memory of</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:46404:93"/>
               <hi>thoſe obligations I have to you is too dear to me, for me to let ſlip out of my heart the eſteem and the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I owe to your goodneſſe and to your perſon. Nothing ever kept me from you, but the effects of my bad fortune, which hath expoſed me to great croſſes ſince our ſeparation, and I ſee you now again with as much joy, as I can be ſenſible of at the meeting of thoſe perſons which ought to be moſt dear to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſhe made an end of theſe words with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable grace, ſhe made uſe of that hand which ſhe had reached out to <hi>Philadelph</hi> to raiſe him up, and the paſſionate Prince, who could hardly get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf looſe from her knees, yielding to that little vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with tranſports of joy, which his diſcourſe was not able to expreſs, and raiſing himſelf out of a poſture, wherein <hi>Delia</hi> would not let him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue any longer, fixing his eyes with a violent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour upon that beloved face: <hi>Great Gods!</hi> cryed he, <hi>is it poſſible, that you ſhould reſtore me</hi> Delia, <hi>whom my cruel fortune had taken and detained from me with ſo much cruelty? And you</hi> Delia, <hi>or that which appears to my eyes under the ſhape of</hi> Delia, <hi>is it poſſible that you ſhould be really that</hi> Delia, <hi>to whom I gave my heart the first moment I ſaw her, and whom I have carried in the middle of my heart, in all the journeys which I have made in ſearch of her? or am I not abuſed by ſome dream or illuſion, which in all manner of objects preſents to my crazed imagination the image of my divine</hi> Delia? Then he continued ſome moments viewing that fair perſon from head to foot, with an action that eaſily made the company take notice of the violence of his love, and <hi>Delia,</hi> who was tenderly moved at it, and could hardly her ſelf conceal part of her own
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46404:93"/>
reſentments, deſiring to help him out of this aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>Yes, Prince,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I am</hi> Delia <hi>her ſelf without illuſion, and you can not any longer miſtake her in me, if you have preſerved any Idea of her, and if it be true that you have been ſo mindful of her as you would perſwade me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At theſe words, <hi>Philadelph</hi> perfectly confirming himſelf in the knowledg of his happineſs, had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force to reſiſt the joy, which violently ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoul: It wanted but a little of depriving him of his ſences and knowledg, and it was as much out of weakneſſe and inability to ſuſtain himſelf, as out of deſign, that he let himſelf fall the ſecond time at <hi>Delia's</hi> feet, which, notwithſtanding all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhe uſed to put him out of that poſture, hee waſhed with a floud of tears, which the exceſs of his joy drew from his eyes at this accident as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly as grief could have done. 'Twas in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he found himſelf incapable of making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny coherent or rational diſcourſe, and abandoning himſelf to paſſion which entirely poſſeſſed him, he ſpake things, and did actions more capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the ſtrength of his love, than of his judgment. At laſt, quitting <hi>Delia's</hi> knees by the little violence which ſhe uſed to him, and lifting his hands and eyes to Heaven: <q>Immortal Gods! <hi>ſaid he,</hi> your goodneſs hath ſurpaſſed my hopes, and ſince that by ſo great and uncommon a benefit, you blot out of my ſoul the remembrance of thoſe mis-fortunes, to which my unfortunate life hath been expoſed, I beg your pardon for thoſe murmurings, which out of humane frailety I may have made againſt your divine wills: and you my pains, and my
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46404:94"/>
ſufferings how dear and precious are you to me now, ſince by your means I find again the Jewel of my life, and the only good for which the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this wandring life were preſerved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He made, after this, diverſe diſcourſes of the ſame nature in this tranſport, which wanted but a little of prejudicing his reaſon or his health, and <hi>Delia,</hi> who in all the Princes actions, obſerved the progreſs of that great Love, whereof ſhe had received ſuch fair proofs in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and which poſſibly ſhe took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of with more joy and ſatisfaction than ſhe durſt expreſſe, after ſhe had given ſome time to this firſt heat, and this firſt impetuoſity of <hi>Philadelph,</hi> taking up the diſcourſe with a compoſed action, and a look wherein, as modeſt as ſhe was, a part of her thoughts was diſcovered: <hi>Generous Prince,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I do not deſerve the teſtimonies which you give me of your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though I can truly proteſt to you, that I am as joyful to meet you as you would deſire, and certainly I ſhould be very ungrateful for the goodneſs you ſhewed to one unknown, to a maid expoſed to the diſgraces of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, if I had not received into my heart the reſentment due to it, and for your perſon all the eſteem which ſuch an extraordinary merit as yours ought to introduce there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Delia</hi> ſpake in this manner, and the amorous Prince being highly taken with her diſcourſe, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to her with tranſporting raviſhments, which might be obſerved both in his action and in his countenance: when the valiant man who had fought againſt him, and till then had ſeen their actions, and heard their diſcourſe without interrupting them, pulling off his Caſque as <hi>Philadelph</hi> had done,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46404:94"/>
and approaching to him with a countenance, which not only had nothing of an enemy in it, but might cauſe love or admiration in the moſt inſenſible ſouls: <hi>Generous Prince,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I take too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the good affices you have rendred</hi> Delia, <hi>and your vertue is already too well known to me by the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome effects which it hath produced in its own favour, not to be obliged to deſire of you, together with your pardon for the vain attempt I made againſt you, ſome part in your friendſhip: I owe this deſire both to the particular obligation I have to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ou, and to the merit of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philadelph</hi> who till then had taken little notice of any thing but <hi>Delia</hi> at this diſcourſe of the unknown turning his eyes towards his face, found occaſion enough in the compleatneſs of his perſon to fix them there with aſtoniſhment: He found him but too handſom, and too compleat in every reſpect, and ſeeing in what manner he was with <hi>Delia,</hi> and what intereſt hee took in the good offices which he had rendred her, he imagined preſently that he had met with a rival, and ſuch a rival, ſo far as ſo little a time could diſcover, as was not contemptible. This thought immediately made a chilneſſe run over all his body, and his jealouſie was almoſt as ſtrong in its original as if it had been of long continuance. He looked upon him without returning any anſwer, with thoughts that had little conformity to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which he had heard from his mouth, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated with himſelf, as unreſolved what anſwer he ſhould make him, when <hi>Delia</hi> reading part of the truth in his looks, and deſiring to draw him out of the diſquiet whereinto he began to plange himſelf;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46404:95"/>
Philadelph, ſaid ſhe, <hi>do not refuſe this Prince your ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he deſires of you, and who merits it upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conſiderations: there is no poſſible reaſon that ought to hinder you from it, and on can not grant it to a perſon, who is or ought to be more dear to me.</hi> What repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo ever <hi>Philadelph</hi> had already conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the unknown, he had a love for <hi>Delia,</hi> and a ſubmiſſion to her will, which did not permit him to refuſe what ſhe deſired, and ſo turning towards the man with a countenance not ſo full of kindneſſe as his, <hi>I know not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what obligation you have to me, nor what ſervice I have rendred you in the perſon of</hi> Delia, <hi>but what intereſt ſo ever you take in that, the proofs I have had of your valour could not but give me thoughts of eſteem for you, and the attempt you made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my life, leaves me no reſentment, but what your merit and</hi> Delia's <hi>command may eaſily diſſipate. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very well,</hi> replied the unknown with a ſmile, <hi>that you have not abſolutely pardoned me: but I hope that effect from the ſervices which I ſhall render you, and from the aſſiſtance of</hi> Delia.</p>
            <p>With theſe words he embraced him with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable grace in his careſſes, and <hi>Philadelph</hi> payed him back as much as he beleeved himſelf obliged to do by civility and <hi>Delia's</hi> will.</p>
            <p>All theſe things paſſed in <hi>Agrippa's</hi> preſence, who ever ſince the endeavour he had uſed to part the two combatants, had ſtood almoſt immoveable to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to their diſcourſes, and to obſerve their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein he thought he ought not to interrupt perſons from whom their paſſion took away all other conſideration: But by the name of Prince, which they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had often pronounced, and that of <hi>Philadelph</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:46404:95"/>
which had many times reached his eares, judging of the qualities of theſe perſons, he intereſſed himſelf in their adventures more than before, and reſolved to offer them his aſſiſtance, in a condition when they might have need of it, and in a Country where he had credit and authority. Upon his deſign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Philadelph,</hi> who was better known to him than the reſt by the converſation which they had had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the night before. <q>Prince, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe we had together laſt night, when we did not ſee each other, cauſed a great deſire in me to ſerve you, and though you ſhunned me this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a kind of diſdain, that ſlighting did not make me loſe my deſign, nor hinder me from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you in getting near enough to hinder your combat: I believe your condition is changed, and the ſadneſſe which you expreſſed to me by your diſcourſe laſt night is diſſipated by this happy meeting; I take a great ſhare in your ſatisfaction, in regard of the knowledg I begin to have of you, and in reſpect of that which the very ſight of you, and that which you did in my preſence, perſwade me to, to your advantage: and upon that which I have underſtood of your birth in the diſcourſe of that admirable perſon; I offer to you now as to a Prince, and to thoſe which are with you, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a condition little different from your own, whatſoever, upon your preſent occaſions, you ſhall poſſibly deſire of one who is intereſſed in you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</q> and is not without credit in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> expreſſed himſelf thus, and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> as deeply engaged as he was in his paſſion, turning towards him, and having looked upon him very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively

during his diſcourſe, eaſily knew him by his voice, for the ſame man with whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained himſelf in the dark, and by whom his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and he had been parted in their combat. His diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was not only obliging and generous, but ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified too that hee was a man of authority, and though <hi>Agrippa</hi> was alone and on foot at ſuch an houre, in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Philadelph</hi> having viewed him a while, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to return him an anſwer, though he did not know very well how hee ſhould treat with him, when they heard a great noiſe, and at the ſame time ſaw a great troupe of horſe appear, who came up to them as ſoon as they had ſpied <hi>Agrippa, Delia</hi> and her company were troubled at this ſight, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and <hi>Philadelph</hi> were putting themſelves into a poſture of defending themſelves, if theſe men ſhould offer any incivility, but by their action they ſaw they had no need to fear them; for they all alighted and came round about <hi>Agrippa</hi> with ſuch ſubmiſſive reſpects as made them judge that he was their maſter. They were indeed the people of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa's</hi> retinue, who having ſought all night for him in places far diſtant from that where he was, came thither at laſt having ſearched all the corners of the wood: he that was the chiefeſt amongſt them coming to <hi>Agrippa</hi> before the reſt: <hi>The Gods be</hi>

As for what you have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our birth by our diſcourſe, I will confeſſe to you that I am a Prince, and that the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Delia</hi> is ſuch, that there is neither Princeſſe nor Queen under Heaven, to whom the ſervices and the reſpects of all vertuous perſons can be more juſtly due. As for this valiant man againſt whom this happy adventure cauſed me to draw my ſword, I can give you no accounnt of him, having never ſeen him before: but all the marks in his countenance, and in his whole perſon are ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that one can not but judge very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly of them. The judgement you make of them, <hi>replyed the unknown,</hi> is too favourable on my part, and 'tis not by the marks which appear in my perſon that my birth can be diſcovered: <hi>Delia</hi> will anſwer for me that it is none of the meaneſt, and then poſſibly you will grant me a part in your friendſhip, which you can hardly vouchſafe me now.</q>

preventing the effect of his curioſity: <q>I perceive, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that you look with ſome aſtoniſhment, upon theſe perſons who carry ſuch uncommon marks in their countenances: mine was no leſs than yours when I firſt met with them, and I judged conformably to the truth, that under ſuch noble appearances perſons of the moſt ſublime condition were concealed. They are Princes of rare merit, and extraordinary valour (as far as I could judge in the ſmall time when I ſaw them have occaſion to expreſſe it) whom fortune hath brought into the Countries under your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I thought I ſhould not be diſowned by you, if I ſhould offer them a place of retreat here, and all the aſſiſtances which they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of vertuous perſons.

Indeed there was hardly ever ſeen in the world, a more exact beauty than the fair Strangers was, and beſides the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which by the ſparkling quickneſs of her eyes, and the juſt proportion of the lineaments of her face, ſhe had over the moſt illuſtrious beauties, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did the faireſt viſages carry in them ſo many marks of modeſty and vertue as hers did, in which they might be ſeen as in their moſt real and moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural place. The Symmetry of her whole perſon was ſo compoſed as that it might ſecurely outbrave envy, her port and her action were accompanied with a grace, wherein nature had imprinted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as great and high as ſhe was able to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>The amorous and tranſported <hi>Philadelph</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the ſide of this admirable perſon, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who knowing the ſtrong intereſt wherewith he was engaged, were
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46404:100"/>
willing to give him free liberty to entertain her, and looking upon her with eyes almoſt ſparkling with the ardency of his affection: <q>Divine <hi>Delia, ſaid he, Delia,</hi> the only aym, and the only cauſe of my life, where ſhall I begin to declare to you the thoughts of my ſoul, or deſire to know yours, upon which my dayes are inſeparably fixed? Shall I blame you for that cruel flight, by which you have made me wander ſo long in the moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition, that ever an unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was reduced to? Shall I repreſent to you the grievous ſufferings, wherein I have paſſed my life, occaſioned by the loſs of your ſight, and almoſt of all my hopes? Or rather, ſhall I ask of you, if there remains ſtill in your Spirit any remembrance of my love, any reliques of pity, or any favourable intention for your faithfull <hi>Philadelph?</hi> Alas! 'tis upon this laſt point only that I ought to inſiſt: my complaints will work no more effect upon your Spirit, than they did heretofore in <hi>Cilicia:</hi> you will apprehend nothing of the pain which your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence hath made me ſuffer, but what you know already by the knowledge you have of my love. All that is paſt is pleaſing to my memory, when I call to mind, that 'tis for you that I have ſuffered all, and in ſtead of calling it to mind by my diſcourſe, 'twere much better <hi>Delia,</hi> that I ſhould ask you, and expect from your mouth the deſtiny of <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph. But O Gods!</hi> here it is that my courage fails me, and I continue without reſolution or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in expectation of a ſentence upon which my life or death doth certainly depend. I am ſtil igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant whether amongſt the thoughts of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46404:100"/>
which work ſome effect upon ſuch a a ſoul as yours, there was formerly intermingled any motion of a particular affection. I know not whether thoſe thoughts, whatſoever they might be, continue in the ſame condition, in relation to me, as they were diſcovered to me in <hi>Cilicia;</hi> whether your departure out of our Country, was not cauſed by ſomething that deſtroyes all the hope which my love had permitted me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; whether that hard-heartedneſs, which you alwayes had for me, be not increaſed by abſence, or rather <hi>Delia</hi> (and I tremble in ſpeaking it to you, both for fear of offending you, and for fear leſt my ſuſpicions ſhould be too true) whether all the avenues of that heart, which I have ſo vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempted with ſo much love, be not blocked up againſt me by ſome other affection which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its birth ſince our ſeparation, or before our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philadelph </hi>ſpake theſe words with ſome pain, and finiſhed them with his eyes caſt down to the ground, with an action that ſignified to<hi> Delia, </hi>a great deal of fear and confuſion: the fair Lady look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him a while in that condition, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning him any anſwer, and a little after ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her countenance with a little more than ordinary ſweetneſſe and ſerenity, and giving the paſſionate Prince a look, able to recal him from the grave:<hi> Be pacified </hi>Philadelph, ſaid ſhe,<hi> and believe that if my Spirit was ever capable of any affection, or may be ſo for the future, it never was, nor ever ſhall be, but for you: by this aſſurance you may be ſecured againſt all your fears, with part of which I could find ſome occaſion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46404:101"/>
to be offended, if the obligation I have to you did not make me eaſily paſſe over ſlight conſiderations. As to the reproach you make me concerning my departure out of </hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,<hi> I thought I had been partly juſtified by the reaſons which I alleged you for it, in the paper which I gave you at our parting, and I believed that you would find enough there to excuſe a procedure which appearances made you condemn. Ah! Madam, </hi>cryed the Prince, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her,<hi> I underſtood nothing upon that account, and if the Gods had left me that means to let me know my fortune, it may be I had not wandred ſo long in ſearch of you, with ſo much miſery and grief: that ſacred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wherein the ſecret of my life was incloſed, was taken from me by an incredible mis-fortune, and the religious obſervation of the prohibition which you made me when you gave it me, cauſed me a loſſe whereof I was more ſenſible, than I ſhould have been of the loſſe of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon that he related to her how he loſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet where the paper was incloſed, and he made her that diſcourſe in ſuch terms as made her more and more acquainted with the violence of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when he had done ſpeaking, <hi>Delia,</hi> who had quietly hearkened to him, taking up the diſcourſe with a ſmile: <q>You have loſt nothing, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> ſince by our meeting, the addreſſe I gave you to inform your ſelf of me is rendred unneceſſary. If you might be accuſed of negligence, for having ill kept a thing, which in regard of the intereſt you take in it ought to be of ſome importance to you, yet the reſpect you had to the requeſt I made you when I gave it you, ought to ſatisfie me, and I receive it as no ſlight proof of your affection, which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46404:101"/>
ſhall alwayes be as dear to me as you can deſire. I did a little wonder to hear you talk in ſuch a manner as might make me judge that you were ſtill ignorant of thoſe things which you might have underſtood by that means: you ſhall ſhortlie underſtand them from the mouth of a perſon, who is too much obliged to you to uſe any diſguiſe with you whileſt ſhe lives, and then I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the adventures which have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len me ſince our ſeparation, which were the cauſe that you failed of finding me in the Country where I was born, which I did not conceal from you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philadelph</hi> even ſurfeting with a joy which his ſoul was hardly able to contain, was about to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>Delia's</hi> obliging diſcourſe, when the brave unknown, who looked upon him with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance full of all the marks of amity, rode up to his ſide, and came to participate in their converſation, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> who upon another account would have looked with love and admiration upon the wonders that appeared in his perſon, and who naturally had a ſoul as full of ſweetneſs and courteſie as any man in the world, beheld this man with a repugnance which he could not diſſemble, and ſeemed as little ſenſible of the teſtimonies of eſteem which he gave him, as if he had loſt his judgement and knowledg. The meeting of a man as highly accompliſhed as ever any nature framed, in <hi>Delia's</hi> company, and the familiaritie that ſeemed to be between them, was ſo much ſuſpected by him, that had it not been for the reſpect he bare to <hi>Delia,</hi> he had made the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his jealouſie appear againſt him without any farther delay: and whileſt <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:46404:102"/>
looked upon him as an admirable man, and as one that did equal at leaſt all the completeſt perſons that ever they ſaw, all the confidence he had in <hi>Delia's</hi> words, and the long experience he had of her admirable vertue could not hinder him from looking upon him as a Tyger ready to tear his heart in pieces: The brave unknown highlie courted him without being repulſed at his coldneſs, and gueſſing ſomewhat nearlie at the cauſe: <hi>I hope,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that you will not be alwayes inſenſible of the esteem I have for you, and that you will bemone me in ſtead of hating me, when you ſhall know that my ill fortune can move nothing but pity in ſuch perſons as you are;</hi> He ſpake only theſe words to him holding him by the hand, and being unwilling to interrupt him any farther, breathing out a deep ſigh, hee turned his horſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Cornelius,</hi> juſt as the company was arrived cloſe by the gates of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> would willinglie have lodged this laſt company in the Palace of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> had it not been for <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for whom all the lodgings were already taken up, though <hi>Cornelius</hi> had left his two illuſtrious gueſts in theirs, ſuppoſing that the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would be well pleaſed that he had rendred this civility to the Heir of the Crown of <hi>Parthia,</hi> and he conducted them to one of the faireſt lodgings in the City, which hee had ſent one of his men before to take up for them. The brave unknown and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph</hi> were compleatly armed, but they had given their Head-pieces to their Squires, and marched bare-faced through the ſtreets of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The brave unknown rode by <hi>Cornelius</hi> his ſide, and his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46404:102"/>
handſomeneſs drew upon him the eyes and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all that were preſent at his paſſing by: amongſt thoſe a woman, who with ſome others; ſtood upon one of the Balconies of the Palace, had no ſooner looked upon him and viewed him a little while, but without conſidering how many people were about her, lifting up her hands and her eyes to Heaven, <hi>O Gods!</hi> cryed ſhe, <hi>O great Gods!</hi> and at the ſame time being overpreſſed with ſome violent motion, ſhe loſt her ſences, and fell down between the arms of thoſe perſons who were near her. The fair unknown was not ſo far off, but that this voice came confuſedly to his ears, and he took notice of the buſtling of the people upon the balcon, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the woman that ſwooned, yet he did not hear the tone of the voice diſtinctly enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it perfectly; neither did he hear ſo little, but that hee preſently felt an extraordinary emotion thereupon: the Idea which was preſent in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory carried the ſound into the middle of his heart, with ſo much trouble that it was taken notice of by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and not being able to diſſemble it: <hi>Am I a fool?</hi> ſaid he, changing his colour two or three times in a moment. <hi>Agrippa</hi> makinog a ſip to look upon him asked him if he found himſelf ill, and the unknown endeavouring to recompoſe himſelf: <hi>'Tis nothing,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>but ſomething muſt be indulged to a man, whoſe imagination is a little crazed, and who is not alwayes himſelf.</hi> As he ſpake theſe words, he endeavoured to diſſipate that which he attributed to his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and recovering his former condition as much as poſſibly he could, he rode on, &amp; arrived with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> at the lodging which he had deſigned for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:46404:103"/>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> after he had given order himſelf, for their accommodation, with a care whereunto he was not obliged in relation to perſons of a meaner quality than thoſe of Soveraign dignity, and had learned from <hi>Philadelph</hi>'s mouth his birth, and a ſmall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of his principal adventures, returned to the Palace to diſpatch diverſe affaires, which were then upon his hands, and (more than upon any other conſideration) to ſee <hi>Candace,</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her ſome account of the diligence he had uſed in the ſervice of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> wherein he had ſeen her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed. He found that fair Queen in the Princeſs <hi>Eliſa's</hi> chamber, where ſhe had lain that night to diſcourſe with her concerning the diſcovery, ſhe thought ſhe had made, of her dear <hi>Ceſario.</hi> Ever ſince that moment, wherein that well-beloved coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance appeared to her eyes, the Spirit of that great Princeſſe could not recover its ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, and all that an exceſſive joy, yet modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a fear of being miſtaken, could produce in a ſoul, had agitated her's without intermiſſion. All that night ſleep never approached her eyes, and ſhe experimented that joy was much more contrary to it, than grief which ordinarily cauſes ſleep, and doth not keep the Spirits in that agitation, which hinders the repoſe of the body. The ſad <hi>Eliza</hi> was conſtrained to watch a good part of the night to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Queen's diſcourſe, and to give her the counſel ſhe deſired upon that adventure. <hi>Candace</hi> was very uncertain what way to take, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her <hi>Ceſario</hi> of her condition, and having no man near her whom ſhe could truſt with a ſecret of that importance, ſhe remained very much unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46404:103"/>
and ignorant what to do. But however it was ſome comſort to her to know (if her ſight did not deceive her) that her <hi>Ceſario</hi> was at ſo little a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from her, and if the paleneſs which ſhe had obſerved in his countenance, did grieve her in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the bad condition of his health, ſhe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her ſelf on the other ſide, out of a belief ſhe had, that in that caſe <hi>Ceſario</hi> could not ſuddainly go far from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſo ſhe ſhould have what time ſhe deſired to make uſe of this adventure. She was not likewiſe without ſome hope that the Prince had ſeen her from the window where he leaned, and reflecting upon that thought: <hi>If my Image be in his heart,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>as his entirely poſſeſſes mine, without doubt he ſaw me and knew me, and he did not fix his ſight ſo much upon the perſons of our company and our train, but that he diſcerned amongst that number, her, who not long ſince, was the object of all his thoughts and all his affections.</hi> From this brief reaſoning with her ſelf, ſhe paſſed to a conſnlation with <hi>Eliſa</hi> how to find out ſome means to help her ſelf, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſufficiently meditated upon it, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it could not be better done, than by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Prince <hi>Tiridates,</hi> to whom ſhe was already beholding for her life, whom ſhe had acquainted with part of her adventures, and whom ſhe knew to be very generous, and well-affected to her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.</p>
            <p>Upon this thought addreſſing her ſelf to <hi>Eliſa:</hi> 
               <q>My fair Princeſſe, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> the Prince <hi>Tiridates</hi> your Uncle is a Prince ſo vertuous, and ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the eſteem of all his relations, that you can not without injuring your ſelf, neglect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46404:104"/>
of knowing him, and I ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull for the obligation I have to him, if I ſhould not contribute whit I could to the making of you known to each other: though he diſcovers himſelf to few perſons, and eſpecially to thoſe of <hi>Phraates</hi> his family, I aſſure my ſelf he will take it well at my hands when I ſhall have procured him the ſight of ſuch a Neece as you, and of a Princeſſe who is diſcontenced, and that flyes, as well as he from the cruelty of <hi>Phraates:</hi> the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hee hath from company, and the difficulty there will be to perſwade him to quit his ſolitude, to come amongſt the world of people in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> obliges me to propoſe a walk to you towards the houſe which hee hath choſen for his retreat: <hi>Cornelius</hi> will willingly furniſh us with a neceſſary equipage for this deſign, and I preſume upon my ſmall intereſt, which partly obliges me to make you this propoſition, to make uſe of <hi>Tiridates</hi> his goodneſs, after I have diſcovered <hi>Ceſario's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to him, which, ſo far as I can judge, is not far diſtant from his. By the aſſiſtance of this cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Prince, to whom I have diſcovered my name and part of my affairs, I may, without doubt, ſee my dear <hi>Ceſario,</hi> or find out ſome means to let him know where I am. Candace <hi>expreſſed her ſelf in this manner, and</hi> Eliſa <hi>having a little meditated upon her diſcourſe:</hi> That which you propoſe to me, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> is not very imptobable, and beſides the deſire I may have to know a man of mine own kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and a vertuous man too, as you deſcribe him, and as the common report goes of him; I ſhall be very much ſatisfied, my fair Queen, if upon this

occaſion you can find out any means to ſerve your intentions. I will go with you to ſee both <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> and <hi>Ceſario,</hi> and I ſhall receive no ſmall conſolation of my own diſpleaſures, if I can any way contribute to the caſe of yours.</q>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46404:105"/>
had obſerved in the perſon of the fair unknown, whom he repreſented to be one of the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed men in the world: <hi>Ah! if you had ſeen my</hi> Artaban, <hi>Ah! if you had known my</hi> Ceſario, ſaid the two Princeſſes to themſelves, at the ſame time, <hi>you would be ſilent concerning all other men; to give them alone all the praiſes which you beſtow upon the unknown:</hi> They continued a while in this converſation, and though the two Lovers had ſomething elſe upon their hearts, <hi>Agrippa</hi> durſt not declare himſelf to <hi>Eliſa</hi> before <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> nor <hi>Cornelius</hi> proceed in that he had begun with <hi>Candace,</hi> before <hi>Agrippa</hi> and the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After they were gone forth, the two Princeſſes hath ſome farther diſcourſe concerning the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had to go and ſeek out <hi>Tiridates</hi> and <hi>Ceſario,</hi> and they agreed to take that walk the next day if <hi>Cornelius</hi> would give them opportunity to do it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had pitched upon this deſign, they thought upon the Princeſs <hi>Olympia,</hi> towards whom for her beautie and for her rare qualities they were very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately inclined, but they had not ſeen her that day. The evening before, the trouble wherein <hi>Candace's</hi> ſpirit was, in relation to the adventures which had befallen her, had hindred them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of her the continuation of her hiſtorie, but when they ſaw themſelves a little free, they refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon it, and found themſelves very deſirous to be acquainted with the ſequel of it, and to give the Princeſſe new teſtimonies of the amitie which they had already contracted with her. They would have gone preſently to viſit her in her chamber, and they were not ignorant that they owed that civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46404:105"/>
to a perſon, who in birth, and all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts was little inferiour to them, but they knew ſhe had no intention to diſcover her ſelf, and that they could not render that good office to a ſlave, without making that ſuſpected which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to conceal. They contented themſelves for that time to ſend <hi>Cephiſa</hi> to her, to know how ſhe did, and to make their excuſes, becauſe they did not viſit her, out of fear of diſpleaſing her. <hi>Cephiſa</hi> went to do her meſſage, and a little while after, ſhe returned to the Princeſſes with ſome aſtoniſhment in her countenance: <hi>Candace</hi> having preſently ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the cauſe; <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the Princeſſe of</hi> Thrace <hi>is not in a condition to give you a viſit to day, and I have left her upon her bed in a violent feaver, with greater troubles in her mind than there appears diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in her body.</hi> The Princeſſes at this report, had no regard of their former circumſpection, and made no doubt but that in this caſe they ought to go and viſit <hi>Olympia. Let us go ſee her, Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eliſa</hi> to <hi>Candace; for I have ſuch an eſteem and affection for her, that I can not hear of her being ill, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflicted at it. I will bear you company very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,</hi> replyed <hi>Candace, and as far as I can judge, that Princeſs is ſo worthy of the affection and eſteem of thoſe perſons that know her, that I ſhould be very ſorry that you ſhould go beyond me upon that account.</hi>

            <p>Having ſpoken theſe words, they went together to the chamber of the Princelie ſlave, which was hard by theirs, and as they came in they were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to find her in a place ſo unconformable to her condition. She was upon the bed juſt as <hi>Cephiſa</hi> had told them, and only <hi>Ericia</hi> with her, who had
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46404:106"/>
ſhut the windows, and left but little light in the chamber. As ſoon as the Princeſſes were come near, <hi>Candace</hi> ſitting down upon the ſide of the bed, and leaving <hi>Eliſa</hi> a chair at the beds head: <q>What is the matter, my fair Princeſſe, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> and what alteration have you received ſince yeſterdaie in your health, which is verie dear to all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that know you? The alteration, <hi>replyed</hi> Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, is verie great, both in my health, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and you ſee me now, as it pleaſes the Gods and Fortune, in a verie different eſtate from that wherein I was this morning. And what is bef l en you of ſo great importance, <hi>added</hi> Eliſa <hi>preſently?</hi> be pleaſed to tell us, that we may take our ſhare in it, as we have hitherto done, out of inclination and knowledg, in every thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned you. I am ſo diſcompoſed, <hi>anſwered</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympia that I know not whether I ſhall be able to expreſs my ſelf, and all the paſſions are confuſed in my ſoul with ſo much violence, that my bodie is not able to reſiſt them, and I have hardlie ſo much as my ſpeech at libertie, I know not whether it be joy that puts me into this condition, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is be grief that works this effect both upon my bodie and my Spirit, but however it be, I will tell you, if I can, ſeeing you have the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to intereſſe your ſelves thus in my fortune, that the man of whom I formerlie ſpake to you with ſo much paſſion, the fair unknown, to whom by a ſtrange fatalitie I gave my heart at the firſt ſight, he who afterwards by diverſe great actions, and great proofs of his love took the abſolute poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of my ſoul, he, for whoſe ſake onlie I have
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46404:106"/>
ſurvived ſuch long ſorrows, and for whom I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this unfortunate life with a little hope of ſeeing him again, is now in <hi>Alexandria.</hi> O Gods, <hi>cryed</hi> Candace, what do you tell us <hi>Olympia,</hi> and what aſſurance have you of his arrival? That <hi>reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Olympia, which my eyes gave me, and being with <hi>Ericia,</hi> and ſome other perſons upon that Balconie which lookes into the ſtreet, when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> returned, I ſaw him with his face uncovered, I ſaw him ſo plainly that I could not be miſtaken, and I could not ſee him but with ſo great a trouble and emotion, that my ſences failed me, and I fell in a ſwoon betwixt <hi>Ericia's</hi> arms. Ah! without doubt, <hi>added</hi> Candace, 'tis the fair unknown, of whom <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſpeke to us with ſo many Elogies, he, whom he found in the wood with a Lady, whoſe admirable beauty hee repreſented to us. 'Tis the very ſame, <hi>anſwered</hi> Olympia, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> could not ſpeak to you of him with ſo many praiſes, but he muſt forget ſome admirable qualities in his perſon, he, for whom I have breathed out ſo many ſighs, is at laſt retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to me, and hee for whoſe ſake I lingred out my dayes in ſlavery and miſery, comes to be a witneſs of my captivity, and ſervitude, which I ſupported with patience through the love I had for him. Well, <hi>ſaid the ſad</hi> Eliſa, <hi>interrupting her,</hi> Well, my dear <hi>Olympia,</hi> ſee, you have the greateſt occaſion of joy that ever you could deſire, and in the mean time it produces in you ſuch effects as do not ordinarily proceed from any thing but grief: Alas! you recover all that you had loſt, and <hi>Eliſa</hi> only remains without hope of ever ſeeing again
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46404:107"/>
that which the pityleſſe deſtinies have taken from her. 'Tis indeed to me, <hi>replyed</hi> Olympia, <hi>with two or three ſighs,</hi> the only occaſion of joy that I could wiſh for, to ſee him again whom I ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved, and the Gods bear me witneſs, that had it not been for the hope I had of it, my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate dayes had not been of ſo long a continuance: but 'tis indeed to me a greater occaſion of grief if I ſee him again unfaithful, than if I had never ſeen him again, nor outlived ſo many miſeries, only to bee a witneſſe of his infidelity: It had been more acceptable, and much better for me to have loſt this deplorable life, either amongſt the waves, or in thoſe miſeries wherewith hitherto it hath been turmoiled. You have ſome reaſon, <hi>ſaid</hi> Candace <hi>much troubled,</hi> but what knowledg, or rather what ſuſpicion have you, that this man, from whom you have received ſo many reſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of love, is now unfaithful to you? I have, <hi>anſwered</hi> Olympia, the ſame that you your ſelf gave me, when you told me, that he was found in the wood by <hi>Agrippa</hi> with a Ladie of admirable beautie; thoſe few words you ſpake of it exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated my wound with a violent pain: but beſides that, I will tell you, that being come again to my ſelf out of my ſwoon, whereinto ſo unexpected a ſight had caſt me, and being hardly able to give credit to my eyes upon the report they had made to my heart, nor believe that this object of my life had appeared to my ſight anie otherwiſe than by illuſion, or the effect of my imagination, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Ericia</hi> to go preſentlie to make a farther diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie, and having enquired out the houſe,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46404:107"/>
where <hi>Cornelius</hi> had lodged thoſe ſtrangers, I commanded her to mingle her ſelf amongſt the other ſlaves which were employed in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to go into the houſe with her face cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to take notice of him who had put me into the trouble I was in: She punctually executed this order, and eaſily found means to ſlip into the chamber, whither he was then retired, ſhe ſaw him, and ſhe knew him ſo well, that ſhe could not doubt in the leaſt, but that it was he. But, O Gods! ſhe ſaw him with that young Lady, of whom <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſpake to you, who diverſe times in <hi>Ericia's</hi> preſence threw her arms about his neck, and uſed manie affectionate expreſſions, which this perfidious man anſwered again with careſſes full of all the marks of Love. The report which <hi>Ericia</hi> plainly made me of it put me into the condition you ſee, and there needs no more to ſend this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate creature to her grave.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She ended theſe words with a manie ſobs, and a multitude of tears, which her reſentment drew from her fair eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace</hi> ſympathized in her grief, and were nearly touched with compaſſion at it; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected at the ſame time upon the report which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi> had made them of the beauty of <hi>Delia,</hi> and the marks of amity which in his preſence ſhe beſtowed upon the unknown, and upon the remembrance of this diſcourſe they conjectured that the ſuſpicions of the ſad <hi>Olympia</hi> might be rational enough, yet they would not confirm her in them, nor declare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heir real thoughts to her for fear of aggravating her affliction. And <hi>Candace</hi> reſuming the diſcourſe, after
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46404:108"/>
ſhe had been a while ſilent: <hi>My fair Princeſs,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>your grief would be juſtifiable, if you ſhould really find in fidelity in a man, to whom you expreſſe ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or rather this grief ought to make way for a juſt reſentment, which with reaſon enough might baniſh him from your heart and memory; but you ought not, upon ſlight appearances, to entertain this belief which is the enemy of your repoſe; and the importance of it is ſo great that you ought not no neglect any thing that may inſtruct you in the truth. Olympia</hi> in ſtead of returning an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Candace's</hi> words, lifting her eyes to Heaven in a very pityful manner: <hi>Great Gods!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>

After they had ſpent ſome time with her in this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they believed ſhe had need of reſt, and that her paſſionate expreſſions in their preſence might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double her feaver. This belief obliged them to quit her, after they had promiſed her that they would return within an hour, and not leave her till ſhe was better ſetled in her mind.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the meam time the charming <hi>Delia,</hi> the fair unknown, and the amorous <hi>Philàdelph</hi> paſſed the reſt of the day in little differing cares and employments, in the houſe where <hi>Cornelius</hi> had lodged them. <hi>Philadelph</hi> being alone in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, began to ſtudy with a profound meditation, what judgement he ſhould make of his fortune, and conſidering the bleſſing he had received from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that day, hee was ready to give himſelf up to tranſports of joy, but he quickly found that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the motions of his jealouſie. <q>I have found my <hi>Delia</hi> again, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> and after ſo long a ſearch, and an abſence ſo cruel to an amorous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as mine is, the Gods have looked upon me with pity, and have reſtored to me the only aim and object of my life. I will live no longer in that dreadful darkneſſe, wherein my ſoul hath been ſo long entombed, and I ſhall be permitted to look upon my <hi>Delia</hi> with the ſame eyes, which have ſhed ſo many tears for her ſince our ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Ah my ſorrows! Ah my languiſhings! Ah my tedious nights! you are all diſſipated by this bleſſed day which <hi>Delia</hi> hath brought back into my ſoul, and from hence forward the ſad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my cruel ſufferings, ſhall work no other

effect upon my Spirit, than to render the good things I am to taſt, more ſweet, more charming, and more ſenſible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He pauſed a while upon this conſideration of his good fortune, but a little after, that paſſion, the enemy of repoſe, which having its original from love alwayes endeavours its ruine, that importunate jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie which corrupts the beſt thoughts, bringing to his remembrance the fair unknown, and the marks of amitie, and familiaritie which he had ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<hi> Delia </hi>and him, overclowded all his joy, and troubled him in ſuch a manner that he was but verie imperfectlie ſenſible of anie part of it.<hi> What doth it avail me, </hi>ſaid he,<hi> to have found </hi>Delia<hi> again, if I find her unfaithful? and what advantageous change have I received in my condition, if I ſee her again whom I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo dearly, only to ſee her in a rivals arms? She travailes up and down the world, ſhe lyes in woods in the company of a man endued with all manner of lovely parts, ſhe careſſes him, and treats him with friendſhip in my preſence, and indeed forgets nothing that may occaſion a juſt ſuspicion. Ah! </hi>Delia,<hi> how strange an alteration is this in you, and how different is this manner of life from that ſevere and ſcrupulous vertue, which cauſed me ſo many ſufferings in </hi>Cilicia?</p>
            <p>
               <q>But on the otherſide, <hi>added he, checking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> ſeeing I have ſo many teſtimonies of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the ſinceritie, and the puritie of <hi>Delia's</hi> heart and ſpirit, ought I upon the firſt conjecture to overthrow an opinion grounded upon ſo manie proofs? did I find any change in her countenance, or in the entertainment I received from <hi>Delia?</hi> and have not I received from her own mouth more
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46404:110"/>
clear and ample aſſurances of her affection, than ever ſhe gave me heretofore? did there appear any conſtraint in her countenance in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that action? did ſhe vary in any thing which might make me ſuſpect her inconſtancy? and do not I owe reſpect and conſideration enough to the knowledg I have of her Spirit, to give ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute credit to her words? All this is very true, <hi>purſued he,</hi> but yet, who is this fair unknown? what is this man, who poſſeſſing ſo many amiable qualities, accompanies her almoſt alone in her voyages, that paſſes the nights with her in the woods, that armed himſelf againſt me with ſo much fury when I would have accoſted her, and that receives ſo manie teſtimonies of affection and familiarity from her in my preſence? what is this unknown if he be not a Lover, if he be not a man, beloved and favoured by <hi>Delia?</hi> Ha! whatſoever he be, <hi>continued he, growing into paſſion,</hi> he ſhall be the object of the moſt juſt reſentment that ever ſoul conceived, and if it be true that he deprives me of <hi>Delia,</hi> the reſpect I have for her, which tied my hands to day in her preſence, will not be able to hinder me from killing him in any patt of the world where I ſhall find him, or from leaving at the point of his ſword a life, which he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more cruelly aſſaulted, than he can do by the way of arms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He entertained himſelf thus in his thoughts, when he heard a noiſe at his chambet door, and caſting his eyes immediatelie that way, he ſaw the brave unknown come in, who at that time took up all his thoughts, and who was no leſs the object of his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46404:110"/>
hatred and reſentment, than <hi>Delia</hi> was of his Love. <hi>Philadelph</hi> who was not prepared for this viſit, grew pale at the fight of him, and by the changes of his countenance made him eaſily gueſſe at the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ſoul, and the little inclination he had for ſo unexpected a ſight. The fair unknown was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by the coldneſs of his entertainment, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſting him with a countenance, wherein if there were not all the marks of joy, there were at leaſt all the aſſurances of amitie: <q>I come, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> to render you that which I owe you, both in relation to the merit of your perſon, and to the obligation by which you have engaged both me and my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to your ſervice. You are not obliged to me, <hi>replyed</hi> Philadelph, except you pretend to be ſo for the ſervices I rendred <hi>Delia,</hi> when her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune made her land in our Country, where ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing from me, but what ſhe might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from all perſons that were capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. 'Tis upon that very ſcore, <hi>anſwered the unknown,</hi> that I am redeuable to you, and you could not render <hi>Delia</hi> thoſe aſſiſtances which ſhe received from your generoſitie, in defending her againſt the enemies, which your affection raiſed her, and preſerving her with ſo much care and bounty from thoſe dangers which threatned her life and reputation, without laying a ſtrong obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon a man, who intereſſes himſelf in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's</hi> preſervation as much as in his own. I free you from that obligation, <hi>replyed</hi> Philadelph, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be cholerick at this diſcourſe,</hi> and if my deſire was to preſerve <hi>Delia</hi> from thoſe dangers whereinto ſhe fell by my mis-fortune, 'twas never
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46404:111"/>
my intention to preſerve her for you, or for any perſon elſe, that might make benefit of the effects of my love and duty, as long as I have a drop of blod or a moment of life left to defend my preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I be not obliged to your intentions, <hi>ſaid the unknown,</hi> I am ſo, without doubt, to the effects of them, and 'tis that which partly injoyns me to deſire that friendſhip of you, which you have little diſpoſition to grant me, though <hi>Delia</hi> her ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it of you for me. You have, <hi>anſwered</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph, all the qualities that might gain more important friendſhips than mine, but that ought to be very indifferent to you, ſeeing I can not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive yours, nor look upon you but as upon the moſt crnel of my enemies, as long as you ſhall dream of <hi>Delia,</hi> and pretend to reap the fruit of the ſervices which I have rendred her. There is no neceſſity of diſſembling any longer. No, you can not but be my enemie, and the reſentment you expreſſe for an office, which I never had a deſign to render you, kindles another in my ſoul, which renders our two lives incompatible. If you inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe your ſelf in the ſervice which I rendred <hi>Delia,</hi> ſo much as you make ſhew of, or rather if you love her as well as you would expreſſe, you muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute her with me other wayes, than by offers of a friendſhip which I cannot receive from you. The reſpect I bear to <hi>Delia</hi> hindred me from declaring in her preſence that which hath been upon my heart all this day, but ſince ſhe knows very well that the love I have for her hath made me fail a hundred times in my duty to my Father, ſhe will pardon me, what the ſame paſſion ſhall make me
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46404:111"/>
undertake againſt a man, whom ſhe looks upon but too favourably to my mis-fortune, and whom ſhe ought never to have looked upon to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of ſuch a fidelitie as mine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philadelph</hi> ſpake in this manner, &amp; by theſe words vented a part of his inward fire with a furious impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſitie, when the fair unknown looking upon him with his former coldneſs, and adding a ſmile full of ſweetneſs to the moderation which appeared in his countenance, <q>I know not, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> whether I ever wanted courage hitherto, or whether dangers and threats have over much affrighted me in the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions I have met withal, but I very well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that you will hardlie make me reſolve to draw my ſword any more againſt you, and if <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> can not be diſputed between us but by armes, the pretentions we may have to her will not be ſuddainly decided. I am very unhappy to find in you ſuch a hardneſſe of heart as I thought not to have met with, and no body but your ſelf would poſſibly be ſo cruel as to denie me a friendſhip which I thought I might merit by the deſire which I have expreſſed of it. You deſerve better, <hi>anſwered</hi> Philadelph, and you have but too excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts to be my enemie; I ſhould have had leſſe diſpoſition to become yours, if you had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ordinary in you, and this is an effect of my ill fortune that finding in you whatſoever, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another account, might have attracted my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and affection, it muſt needs be, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie in that reſpect, you are ſo much the more odious to me, by how much you are the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutable: But I wonder, <hi>purſued he, looking upon
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46404:112"/>
him with a ſeverer eye than before,</hi> that you perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in this manner of acting with me, ſeeing the little ſenſibilitie I expreſſe of your kindneſs, and it ſeems you have a mind to make a peece of raillerie of the moſt important buiſineſs that ever you med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with in your life. If you reallie love <hi>Delia</hi> as your words and actions do declare, there is little probabilitie that you ſhould deſire my friendſhip ſo much as you would perſwade me you do, and I know not upon what conſideration you court a man, for whom this concurrence can leave you nothing but repugnance and averſion: and if you do it to inſult over an unfortunate man in your happy condition, know that as yet it is but ill grounded, and you have not ſo contemptible an enemie of me, but that you have need of all your power to preſerve that, which at the rate of your life he will diſpute with you to the laſt moment of his own.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Philadelph </hi>uttering theſe words with violence, and not being able any longer to endure the ſight of the unknown, was going to fling out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when hee ſtaid him by the arm, and having much ado to hold him:<hi> Stay </hi>Philadelph, ſaid he,<hi> and if you can not endure me as the Lover of </hi>Delia,<hi> at leaſt endure me as her brother.

that you make me this diſcourſe? I am the brother of </hi>Delia, replyed the unknown,<hi> and ſhe knowing that our amity cauſed your jealouſie, would not have me deſer any longer the diſcovery of this truth to you my ſelf, I was not unwilling to give her that ſatisfaction, and beſides what the knowledg of your merit might produce in me ſince I ſaw you, the relation ſhe made me of your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous procedure towards her, cauſed ſo much eſteem and ſo much affection in me for you, that there was hardly any thing in the world which I could more ardently deſire than the opportunity of ſeeing and ſerving you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe words he ſtrerched out his armes to him, and <hi>Philadelph</hi> receiving him into his with an exceſſive joy, <q>O Gods, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> how happy am I, if it be true that you are the brother of <hi>Delia,</hi> and how ſatisfied ſhall I be, that now I may love and adore in you thoſe admirable parts which cauſed ſo much jealouſie in me? Never doubt, <hi>anſwered the unknown,</hi> of a truth which in time and at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you will learn from <hi>Delia's</hi> mouth: my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall make you yet a fuller diſcoverie, and you ſhall receive from me, as from the brother of <hi>Delia,</hi> ſuch ſervices in relation to her, as you could not expect from her lover. I beg your pardon then, <hi>added</hi> Philadelph, <hi>tranſported with joy,</hi> for the faults which my error made me commit, and I conjure you with a real repentance, to grant me that friendſhip now which my indiſcreet jealouſie made me ſo unhandſomelie reject.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe words they embraced each other with a real brotherlie affection, and <hi>Philadelph</hi> looking upon him then as <hi>Delia's</hi> brother with different eyes from thoſe which his jealouſie before had opened,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46404:113"/>
felt himſelf preſently inclined to love and admire him, who had a little before cauſed ſo many ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in him; they continued a great while embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing each other, and after they had made diverſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual proteſtations of eternal amitie: <hi>Delia,</hi> ſaid the unknown, <hi>must perfect our reconciliation, let us go and viſit her together, if you pleaſe, and you ſhall begin to know whether I intereſſe my ſelf in</hi> Philadelph's <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as the brother, or as the lover of</hi> Delia.</p>
            <p>Having done ſpeaking theſe words, they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of the chamber, and paſſed into <hi>Delia's,</hi> which was not far off. That fair Lady was laid down upon her bed to repoſe her ſelf after a little weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhe no ſooner ſaw the two new friends approach, but addreſſing her diſcourſe to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: <q>Well brother, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> have you appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that enemy, which had ſo much repugnance for the brother of <hi>Delia?</hi> The brother of <hi>Delia, anſwered</hi> Philadelph, is and ſhall alwayes be as dear to me as my life, but the perſon of a lover, and of a lover favoured by <hi>Delia</hi> could not but be very odious to me. You ſhall never, <hi>replyed</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, <hi>cauſing him to place himſelf in a chair near her bed's head,</hi> you ſhall never have cauſe to envy the favours you ſhall ſee me do any other, and ſince the time you have ſeen me, you might have known me well enough, to believe that it is not eaſie to find any lovers favoured by <hi>Delia:</hi> 'Tis true this man, whom you have ſo much ſuſpected is my brother, and a brother, <hi>continued ſhe, making him ſit down upon the ſide of her bed, and imbracing him with a great deal of tenderneſs,</hi> who is as dear to me as my life: but I will make no difficultie to tell
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46404:113"/>
you before him, that he is not more dear to me than <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and though the qualities of your perſon had not been capable to produce the effect you may hope for from them only, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your pure and generous affection conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in my heart with ſuch a real reſentment, that nothing will ever be able to efface it thence. I lived in <hi>Cilicia</hi> with ſome circumſpection, that poſſibly you did not approve of, and I went from thence at a time when you might probablie expect all the acknowledgment that might be of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but 'tis time now, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> to declare to you thoſe reaſons which may juſtifie my actions, and to let you know that Fortune hath not been ſo blind, as you believed, in making you addreſſe your affections to a perſon of a baſe and obſcure birth; trulie you have been generous and diſ-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed in loving with ſo honeſt and ſo rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, a Maid, whom you believed to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitelie inferior to you, and deſigning for her, merelie out of the knowledge you had of her face and vertue, a Crown and a place which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princeſſes of <hi>Aſia</hi> would gladlie have accepted of: but it was not the will of the Gods that this generoſitie ſhould remain without recompenſe, and they have permitted you, in the perſon of that obſcure <hi>Delia,</hi> to love the daughter of a great King, and a Princeſs that might pretend, being known to you, to that which you ſo freelie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her before you knew her. What, Madam, <hi>cryed</hi> Philadelph, are you a Kings daughter? I am ſo without doubt, <hi>replyed</hi> Delia, and the daughter of a King of the ſupremeſt ranks of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Ha! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46404:114"/>
                  <hi>anſwered the Prince, falling upon his knees by her beds ſide,</hi> this diſcoverie cauſes me more grief than joy, and if I take part in the ſatisfaction which you have in being of a birth conformable to the greatneſs of your vertue, what excuſes ſhall I be able to find for ſo manie faults, which my error hath made me commit againſt you? 'Tis that, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> Delia, for which I have great cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you eternally, and though you had known my true condition, I could not deſire more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from you, than you have alwayes expreſſed to me. Ah! without doubt, <hi>replyed the Prince,</hi> I might have perceived by ſo manie markes of greatneſs which appeared in your perſon, and your actions, that you were not born of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure blood; and I had great ſuſpicions of the truth, which I have often communicated to the Princeſs <hi>Andromeda:</hi> but this belief was ſtifled by the little reaſon we ſaw in you to conceal that truth with ſo much perſeverance, at a time when this declaration might have freed you from a great manie diſpleaſures, and given a great deal of ſatisfaction to thoſe perſons of whoſe affection you could not doubt. I had ſome reaſons for it, <hi>anſwered the Princeſs,</hi> which other perſons poſſibly might have paſſed by, but in thoſe of my humour they were capable of doing what they did; and if it were advantageous for me in your mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that I was born of a Royal blood, it was dangerous for me to confeſs that I was of a familie, which is an enemie to yours, and ſo much hated by yours, that I could expect nothing upon anie conſideration but a ſhameful and cruel uſage from
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46404:114"/>
the King your Father. Ha! Madam, <hi>interrupted</hi> Philadelph, though you were the daughter of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus,</hi> and the ſiſter of the cruel <hi>Artaxus</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who by the death of our near relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath done ſuch bloodie injuries to our familie; you carrie that in your countenance which might guard you from all dangers, and you ſhould have alwayes found me your ſlave, that would have defended you to the laſt drop of his blood againſt his Father as well as againſt the ſtrangeſt enemies. I was affraid too upon your account, <hi>replyed the Princeſs,</hi> not of anie ill uſage, being ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your vertue and goodneſs, which without doubt would have protected me, though Love had not interpoſed, but ſome change, or coldneſs in your affection of which I alwayes had a high eſteem: but ſince it is come to the proof of ſuch a declaration, I will make no more difficultie to confeſſe to you that I am <hi>Arſinoe</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſiſter to the ſame <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxus,</hi> from whom you have received ſuch bloodie diſpleaſures in your familie, and this Prince for whom at firſt you had ſo much averſion, is the Prince <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> my brother, of a verie diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent humour from the King his elder brother, and who had no hand in that crueltie, which cauſed ſo great a reſentment againſt <hi>Artaxus</hi> in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the King your Father. See now, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> whether you love <hi>Delia</hi> ſtill, or the ſiſter of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxus,</hi> and whether I have not loſt what my good fortune had gained upon your Spirit, by being born of a blood which is odious to your Familie. Ah! Madam, <hi>cryed the tranſported Prince, imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:46404:115"/>
                  <hi>almoſt by force a fiery kiſſe upon</hi> Arſiones <hi>fair hand,</hi> though <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſhould have expoſed me my ſelf to the moſt violent effects of cruelty, the Princeſſe <hi>Arſinoe</hi> his ſiſter, and yet my adorable <hi>Delia,</hi> is no leſſe amiable, nor leſſe worthie of my reſpects, and I do not onlie continue in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer terms of my love to her, but upon her conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>Artaxus</hi> is no longer odious unto me, and ſeeing he is <hi>Delia's</hi> brother I would ſerve him with my life and blood.</q>

            <p>Upon theſe words the Prince<hi> Ariobarzanes </hi>ſtretching out his arms to him:<hi> And may not I, ſaid </hi>he,<hi> who did no way contribute to thoſe actions which gave you ſo juſt an occaſion to hate the cruel </hi>Artaxus,<hi> I who was a great way off from the place where they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and after I had heard of them alwayes looked upon mine own brother with averſion and repugnance, may not I hope more juſtly than he, that the ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which cauſes you ſo eaſily to pardon the culpable, will incline you to love the innocent, and thoſe which have never offended you nor yours? Philadelph </hi>tenderlie embracing<hi> Ariobarzanes: What reſentment ſo ever, </hi>ſaid he,<hi> my jealouſie cauſed in me to day against you, you are compoſed of ſuch admirable parts, that it would be no difficulty for you to gain the hearts of your moſt cruel enemies, and if any thing could remain upon my heart against you, it would be becauſe I believed you were the Lover of </hi>Delia,<hi> and not becauſe I know you to be the brother of </hi>Artaxus:<hi> But, Madam, </hi>continued he, turning to the Princeſſe,<hi> you ſurprize me with your diſcourſe, I have been informed that in the King of </hi>Armenia's<hi> Family there was a Prince </hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<hi> and a Princeſſe </hi>Arſinoe,<hi> born both with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

qualities: but there came a report to us ſince, that as they were going to </hi>Rome,<hi> both </hi>Arſinoe<hi> and </hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes<hi> periſhed by a ſhipwrack, which made all </hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia<hi> deplore their loſſe, as being two imcomparable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. We did really ſuffer ſhipwrack, </hi>replyed<hi> Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, and I believe we are dead ſtill in the opinion of the </hi>Armenians,<hi> and of the greateſt part that of thoſe that knew us: but the Gods to whom the perſon of </hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<hi> was precious, would not let him periſh, but ſaved me too for his ſake. </hi>This is that which I would now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with, and after that I have briefly made known to you the reaſons which cauſed me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal my ſelf in<hi> Cilicia, </hi>and which obliged me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence, I will give you an account of that which hath befallen me ſince our ſeparation, which hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me from retiring into<hi> Armenia, </hi>as my intention was to do.</p>
            <p>With theſe words ſhe cauſed him to ſit down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in his chair, and in the mean time the Prince <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> not judging it neceſſarie for him to be preſent at a relation, whereof he knew all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and deſiring to give the two Lovers leaſure to diſcourſe of their adventures with all freedom, whileſt hee went to entertain himſelf with thoſe thoughts with which his Spirit was diſturbed, went out of the chamber, to go and walk in a garden, which he ſaw under the windows.

               <head>The Hiſtory of the Princeſſe ARSINOE.</head>
               <p>THere are few remarkeable things in my life wherewith you are not acquainted: thoſe of the moſt importance befell me in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> whereof you were a witneſs and the principal cauſe: and you are ignorant of nothing almoſt, but what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince our ſepatation, and that I ſhall acquaint you with at large, after that I have ſuccinctlie paſſed over former buſineſſes, and thoſe reaſons which may defend me againſt your accuſations.</p>
               <p>I will not begin my diſcourſe with the beginnings of my life, which have nothing of importance in them, but what is known throughout all <hi>Aſia;</hi> my firſt years paſſed away with ſweetneſs and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie enough, and the time of our tender infancie was ſpent in a flouriſhing Court, and a peaceable and fortunate Kingdom: but I hardlie began to have the uſe of reaſon, or any knowledg of our condition of life, when by the cruel ſurprize of <hi>Anthony,</hi> the unfortunate <hi>Artabazus</hi> our Father was carried pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and all his familie with him, except <hi>Artaxus</hi> our elder brother, who ſucceeded him in the enjoyment of the Crown. My brother <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> my ſiſter <hi>Artemiſa</hi> and my ſelf lived in a captivitie in a pompous Court, till I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight or nine years old, and this loſs of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie (the ſorrow whereof was ſo cruellie redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the deplorable death of the King our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which I believe no perſon is ignorant of) was
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46404:116"/>
not repaired till after the defeat and the laſt mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> at which time <hi>Ceſar</hi> being maſter of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Empire too by the fall of his competitour, freed us from captivity, and ſent us back with an honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> our brother, whom he received into the number of his Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
               <p>Prelate this to you in a few words as a thing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie divnlged, and I will not entertain you with the reception which <hi>Artaxus</hi> gave us, who looked upon the wrack of our familie with great reſentments for our common mis-fortune. We li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Court with all the ſplendor we had loſt, and we recovered there, together with our libertie, our former rank and dignitie. We were brought up, my brother, my ſiſter, and my ſelf, with great care, and it was not the fault of thoſe perſons who were put about me, that the ſlight advantages which I might have received from nature were not favourablie ſeconded by good education. There was nothing forgotten, which might frame my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the horror of vices, and to the love of vertue, and I will ſay, if I may do it without offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt modeſtie, that I had my inclinations natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie carried to eſteem that, which ſeemed good, and to avoid that which appeared to me to be vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I had a good Governeſs, the verie ſame you ſaw in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> whom I made to paſs for my Aunt, who took a great deal of pains to cultivate whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe thought ſhe obſerved of good in me, and contributed as much as poſſiblie ſhe could to form me according to her deſires, &amp; vertuous inclinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:46404:117"/>
About this time, as you know, the King my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prompted by a verie juſt deſire of revenge, made war upon the King of the <hi>Medes</hi> your Allie, and in the firſt year he had ſome advantages, which made him hope the abſolute ruine of his enemies. 'Tis true, by what we could underſtand, he diſ-honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by his crueltie, and the Gods likewiſe to puniſh him for it, ſtopt the courſe of his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by the ſuccours you gave <hi>Tigranes,</hi> which changed his fortune, and forced him to be gone out of the Dominions of your Allies. 'Twas at that time that hee committed that action, which hath been ſo much condemned by all vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to cut the throats of two Princes of your blood, priſoners in a juſt war, and againſt whom he could have no lawful reſentment.</p>
               <p>This was that which made him loſe the valiant <hi>Britomarns,</hi> whoſe valour had been ſo favourable to him in the firſt years of the war, and upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which was made me of the generous quarrel he had with the King for the ſafetie of his priſoners, what cauſe ſo ever I had otherwiſe to blame the preſumption of that young warriour, I could not but have his vertue and greatneſs of courage in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and that eſteem made me forget ſome part of the reſentment I had againſt him. <hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who by the Kings command continued at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxata,</hi> as well becauſe of his youth which as yet was not capable of bearing armes, as to keep the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in obedience, whileſt their King made warre in forein Countries, wept for regret and grief at the relation of this cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, and made all thoſe judge who ſaw him at that time, that his inclinations
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46404:117"/>
would be verie different from thoſe of the King his brother. I enlarge my ſelf particularlie upon this action of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> becauſe it was upon this account that the hatred of the King your Father was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie exaſperated both againſt him and his, and it was upon the reſentment of this action that he made an oath never to pardon anie perſon of the blood or Alliance of <hi>Artaxus</hi> whom fortune ſhould cauſe to fall into his hands, and it was upon this knowledg, and out of the fear of this choler, that I obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reſolved upon ſo long a diſguiſe in <hi>Cilicia.</hi> You know better than I, what were the laſt ſucceſſes of that war, and how at laſt it was ended by <hi>Auguſtus's</hi> authoritie, who by the terror of his power, made theſe Kings, who were cruellie bent to ruin each other, to lay down their armes, and forced them to peace, when the weakneſs of them both might ſufficientlie have diſpoſed them to it, if their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred had not maintained the war, rather than their forces. <hi>'Tis true,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Philadelph,</hi> interrupting the Princeſſes diſcourſe) <hi>that the King my Father retired with ſo much grief and reſentment againſt</hi> Artaxus <hi>for the death of</hi> Ariſton <hi>and</hi> Theomedes <hi>his Nephews, that to revenge himſelf of that cruelty, there was no cruelty but he would have exerciſed; and I believe if fortune had made you your ſelf fall into his hands with this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous beauty and theſe divine graces, which might have diſarmed the rage of a hunger ſtarved Tyger, he would have made you to have felt the effects of his indignation without any reſpect. Do not think it ſtrange then, if I was affraid of him,</hi> replied <hi>Arſinoe, and do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to believe ſtill, that the conſideration of my life was not the cauſe of my greatest fears, and I had not uſed ſo
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46404:118"/>
much care for the preſervation of it, if I had not thought it due to my honour, which in his indignation an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy might poſſibly have expoſed to ignominy to take the more ſevere revenge upon</hi> Artaxus's <hi>his cruelty. I ſhould not poſſibly have had this fear of a man born of a Royal blood, and of one that was your Father, if it had not been confirmed in my Spirit, by the knowledge he gave me of it, as you ſhall underſtand in the ſequels of my diſcourſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know that a little while after this forced peace, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſent to demand <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and my ſelf to be brought up at <hi>Rome</hi> near him, with diverſe Kings children which were educated there in the ſame manner, and were kept by <hi>Augustus</hi> near himſelf, either to teſtifie his affection to their Parents, or to have a greater aſſurance of their ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie by means of thoſe hoſtages. <hi>Artaxus</hi> knew not preſentlie what to judge of it, but he durſt not diſobey <hi>Auguſtus's</hi> will, of which in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity this was an obliging effect on his part, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving communicated to us the order which he had received, he found us not unwilling to go the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> being naturally amorous of great things, joyfully received the propoſition which was made him of going to that ſtately City, Miſtris of the greateſt part of the Univerſe, to paſs ſome years in that pompous Court, where almoſt all the Kings in the world came to pay their homage: and beſides he had ſmall inclination to the ſevere deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> but being of a ſweet and pityful diſpoſition, he could not live without repugnance with a man ſo cruel and inexorable towards thoſe who had offended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:46404:118"/>
Theſe were the reaſons which obliged <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi> willingly to undertake the voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> and his good will eaſilie gained mine, without him I ſhould hardlie have ventured upon this enterpriſe, but ever ſince we were little ones there was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſo near an amitie between us, that we could hardlie live one without the other &amp; I did more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilielreſolve to go all the world over with <hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who was as dear to me as my ſelf, than to ſtay at <hi>Artaxata</hi> without him.</p>
               <p>It would be to no purpoſe to relate to you the preparations for our voyage, and the regrets which <hi>Artaxus</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa</hi> expreſſed at our departure, it will ſuffice me to tell you, that all things were orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as they ſhould be, with an equipage beſeeming our birth, we departed from <hi>Artaxata</hi> upon the way towards <hi>Italy,</hi> and marched as far as the <hi>Egean</hi> Sean, where we embarqued; after we had croſſed a good part of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and coaſted <hi>Licia</hi> and <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia</hi> by land, without any memorable accident. From the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea, in ſtead of paſſing over the Streight, to deſcend into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and to take ſhipping again upon the <hi>Adriatique</hi> Gulph, as that was our moſt direct way; fearing the tediouſneſſe of thoſe long voyages by land, where with we were already tired, we turned upon the left hand towards <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and deſcended into the <hi>Mediterr auean</hi> Sea, believing, that though it would be the longer, yet it would be the eaſyer way, not being obliged to embark and diſembark ſo often. It was rather our deſtinies that would have it thus, and the Gods who reſerved <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> &amp; I for other adventures, had not ordained that we ſhould ſee the banks of <hi>Tiber.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:46404:119"/>
We had been but a ſmall time upon this Sea, when we were ſeized upon by that furious tempeſt, wherein we ſuffered that ſhipwrack, which you have heard ſpoken of, and loſt our lives in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſo many perſons. I will not deſcribe to you the particulars of that impetuous ſtorm, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf to tell you, that the winds immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roſe ſo contrary to us, that they made us take a quite contrary way to that which we had begun to ſail; and after we had been toſſed up and down two dayes and two nights in perpetual fears of death, which preſented it ſelf to our eyes; they caſt our battered veſſel upon that coaſt of <hi>Cilicia</hi> which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where navigation is ſo dangerous by reaſon of an infinite number of ſmall rocks, which reach no higher than the ſuperficies of the water, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one of which our veſſel being diſabled from ſailing, was daſhed all to pieces and left us expoſed to the mercy of the pityleſs waves. I could not know then what became of <hi>Ariobarzanes:</hi> and though the ſtrict amitie which had alwayes been between us, rendred his ſafetie as dear to me as mine own, yet I was in a part of the ſhip, diſtant from that where he was employed, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full danger I was in at that time, made me forget every thing elſe but the preſervation of my life; I had little hope of it, and yet I would not neglect the means which Heaven might give me to prolong it. I cloſelie embraced a piece of the maſt, upon which I laid hold juſt when the veſſel ſplit, and my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſe and one of my maids who were alwayes cloſe by me, were likewiſe companions of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and holding by my two ſides they were carried
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46404:119"/>
above water by that favourable piece of wood, to which I owed my ſafetie, the violence of the waves made us manie times almoſt let go our hold, but neceſſitie gives ſtrength in ſuch extremities as thoſe, to which next to the aſſiſtance of Heaven we owed without doubt the preſervation of our lives. By good fortune the ſhore was not far off, and after we had been a long time toſſed up and down with little hope, and ſmall ſtrength or knowledg left, the maſt which ſuſtained us, by a wave, which was more impetuous than all that went before, was driven on ſhore with ſo much vehemence, that we found our ſelves upon the ſand, when we almoſt deſpaired of ever reaching to it.</p>
               <p>We continued lying a long while upon the ſhore, half dead with wearyneſs, the coldneſs of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo many miſeries as we had ſuffered, where I looked upon what had befallen us as upon a dream, and had hardlie ſo much knowledg left as to reflect upon my ſhipwrack. We were in this condition, when <hi>Briſeis</hi> that good woman, at whoſe houſe you met me, arrived as ſhe was walking upon the ſhore, and being moved with compaſſion at ſo pityful a ſpectacle, ſhe preſentlie offered us all the aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we could deſire of her in our preſent miſerie. I did not refuſe her offers in the neceſſitie we had of her ſuccour, and I eaſilie diſpoſed my ſelf to go with her to her houſe to dry my ſelf, and to take ſome reſt which I had need enough of: But I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie began to know that the Gods had ſaved my life from the danger which had threatned it, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred my brother, and upon that remembrance, grief wanted but a very little of making me loſe that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46404:120"/>
which the waves had ſpared, I would not leave the ſhore as wet and weary as I was, without ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as far as my ſtrength would permit, and calling on every ſide with a feeble voice upon the name of <hi>Ariobarzanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not <hi>Philadelph,</hi> deſcribe to you the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of my grief, that diſcourſe would be too trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to you but I will proteſt to your trulie &amp; the Gods bear me witneſs, that the loſs of my dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hindred me from being ſenſible of any joy for my own ſafetie, I earneſtlie complained that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had permitted me to ſurvive ſo amiable and ſo well-beloved a brother. and if I had not been flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with ſome ſmall hope that he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Heaven an aſſiſtance like to that which ſaved me, whereof being much ſtronger than I, he might make much better uſe, my grief would have been ſtrong enough to have given me that upon the land, which I avoided upon the water. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which my Governeſs laboured to give me in this uncertainty, and the endeavours of <hi>Briſeis,</hi> who applyed her ſelf to comfort and ſerve me with a great deal of goodneſs, wrought no effect upon my Spirit, and I ſpent the three or four firſt dayes in tears, which no diſcourſe could dry up; I had the name of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> perpetually in, my mouth, and his viſage eternally before my eyes, loſing no time in the mean while, in making the ſhore to be ſearched every way by <hi>Briſeis</hi>'s ſervants, to learn ſome news of him.</p>
               <p>This affliction which abſolutely took up my thoughts, did not permit me for above eight dayes ſo much as to inform my ſelf in what place we were;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46404:120"/>
but when I was rendred capable of ſome diſcourſe, and the firſt tranſports of grief were a little diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a <hi>ray</hi> of hope which I conceived, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> might be the ſame with mine, I gave my Governeſs leave to enquire, and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that we were but a dayes journey from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> This intelligence filled me with as much fear as I was capable of in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſadneſs, and not being ignorant upon what account the King of that Country was an enemie to our familie, and an enemie full of hatred, which could let me hope for nothing but all manner of ſhame, and ill uſage if I was diſcovered in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, I reſolved to diſguiſe my name and my birth, and underſtanding by <hi>Ericlea</hi> my Governeſs, and by <hi>Melite,</hi> who, as you knew, is the maid who is ſtill with me, that they had not acquainted <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis</hi> with any thing of the truth, I concealed my true name under that of <hi>Delia,</hi> and my condition under that of <hi>Ericlea</hi>'s Niece, praying my Governeſſe to carrie her ſelf towards me in publick as her Niece, and <hi>Milite</hi> to treat me as her ſiſter. This was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as I deſired, and the ſame day <hi>Briſeis</hi> was informed by us of thoſe things which we deſired ſhe ſhould know, and which were related to you a few dayes after: I had diverſe Jewels upon my cloathes, which I took off the better to diſguiſe the truth, and I cauſed part of them to be given to <hi>Briſeis</hi> by my Governeſs in acknowledgment of her generous bountie, though ſhe refuſed them a great while, and did not reſolve to take them till we threatned to be, gone from her, if ſhe refuſed thoſe ſmall tokens of our gratitude and amitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:46404:121"/>
We were upon theſe terms, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and waiting for ſome favourable opportunitie to return into my own Country without being diſcovered, I ſpent my time, when I could get free from thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in ſolitude, which was more agreeable to me than any company, by reaſon of the ſadneſs which the loſſe of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had eſtabliſhed in my ſoul, when it pleaſed the Gods that I ſhould meet you in that fatall wood, whither our common deſtiny con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us. You know better than I all that befel me in <hi>Cilicia</hi> from that day till the day of our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but you did not know part of the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the thoughts which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poſſeſſed my ſoul ſince that time, I will give you a brief account of them before I proceed to the relation of that which befel me ſince your departure out of <hi>Cilicia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not think, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> that I could look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo many proofs of ſo pure, and ſo perfect an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from a Prince ſo highlie accompliſhed as your ſelf, with that inſenſibilitie wherewith you have ſo often reproached me. I had eyes, as well as any other perſon, open, and clear-ſighted in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your excellent qualities; I had a Spirit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reſentment for ſo many good offices as you rendred me, and I had a ſoul upon which this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and this knowledg might produce all the effects which are not contrary to vertue; I did really eſteem you as much as in reaſon you could poſſibly deſire, as ſoon as by a little experience I had obſerved the conformi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie of the exteriour quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your perſon to the beauty of your interiour perfections, and this eſteem was ſo ſtronglie fixed in my Spirit, that I did not believe there was any
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46404:121"/>
perſon in the world more worthy of it than your ſelf. I began at laſt to approve verie well of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, after that the puritie of your intentions was made known to me; and I could not ſee a great Prince, as you were, love an unknown maid with ſo much ſinceritie and reſpect, and with a deſign to make her his wife, without feeling my ſelf tenderly obliged to ſuch obliging intentions.</p>
               <p>For a long time you gained nothing more upon my Spirit, than this eſteem and acknowledgment; &amp; beſides that I believed that this was all I could in reaſon grant you; till then my Spirit had never had any diſpoſition to engage it ſelf in that paſſion which is a troubler of repoſe, and which, in my opinion, how juſt a ground ſo ever it may have, is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely permitted with decency to perſons of our ſex. I had ſeen but one man in my life, compoſed of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable parts, in whom I obſerved particular thoughts for my ſelf, and though his perſon was ſuch, that if his birth had been proportionable to mine, I ſhould have looked upon him without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance; yet the inequalitie which was between us made me look upon his boldneſſe with averſion, and rendred all his good qualities uſeleſs to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. I had my Spirit free then, when I came into your parts, and this liberry, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſelf a long time againſt all the teſtimonies of your love.</p>
               <p>You began at laſt to make ſome attempts upon it, and it does not trouble me to make this confeſſion to you, when I call to mind that the moſt obdurate ſoul in the world would have been moved with ſo many proofs of your paſſion. Yet I oppoſed my ſelf
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46404:122"/>
diverſe dayes againſt the birth of theſe particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, till then unknown to my Spirit, and to which my heart could not accuſtom it ſelf. I was offended at the weakneſſe which I found in my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and I endeavoured to fortifie it by calling to mind my former reſolutions, which till then had oppoſed all manner of engagement, and by all the conſiderations, which in the condition I was then, might divert my inclinations from it. The beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy I could find for the defence of that, which you too ſtrongly aſlaulted, was to deſire leave of the Princeſſe your ſiſter to be gone, and to flye the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of engaging my ſelf any farther, by leaving of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> I had other pretences enough without diſcovering that, and beſides the deſire of ſeeing my native Country, and our family which without doubt had reſented my loſſe with ſome affliction, and of getting out of a condition which was ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that wherein I was born, and the danger which threatned me, if I was diſcovered in the King your Fathers Court; the troubles which I rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, and the diviſions which I innocently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the King and you, were a ſufficient motive to make me haſten my departure out of <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi> This was that likewiſe which I ofteneſt alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, both to the Princeſſe your ſiſter and your ſelf, when I prayed you both to conſent to my return. You know I preſſed you verie often to it, and at laſt I had concluded upon it, if I could have upheld my reſolutions againſt the grief which you expreſſed at this propoſition, and the proteſtations you made with tears and oaths, and with all the marks that might perſwade a veritie, that you
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46404:122"/>
could not, without dying, endure this ſeparation.</p>
               <p>'Twas in that weakneſs, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> that I knew I loved you, and you might have taken notice of it your ſelf, whatſoever intention I had to conceal it, if you had conſidered that complacencie onlie was not capable of making me expoſe my ſelf to ſo many diſgraces as had almoſt ruined me through the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King your Father, nor to make me continue in his Kingdom againſt the orders which he ſent me to be gone, and to put my ſelf into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an eternal confinement, and of poyſon, by which a little after you ſaw me reduced to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremities: 'Twas in this rancounter, <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph,</hi> that my ſoul received a very ſenſible impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for you, and though I could accuſe nothing for my approaching death, but onlie your love, in ſtead of having any reſentment againſt you for it, you did ſo move me with your grief, that I was hardly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the loſſe of my life but onlie for your ſake, &amp; I ſhould not at that time have deſired the prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it, but onlie to beſtow the reſt of it upon you, when the change of my condition, and the conſent of my friends would have permitted me to do it handſomlie. You may remember how that when I thought I had been at my laſt gaſpe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a diſcourſe by which you might probably judge, that I was going to diſcover to you ſome things which till then you had been ignorant of, and 'tis certain that it was my intention to acquaint you with that then, which I have declared to you to day, and to free you at my death from the regret or ſhame which might remain to you, for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed your thoughts and your deſignes to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

unworthy of you in regard of her birth. <hi>Alas!</hi> cryed <hi>Philadelph,</hi> interrupting the Princeſſes diſcourſe with a ſigh, <hi>Alas! Madam, how well do I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that paſſage of my life, and how often hath it come into my memory ſince our ſeparation, as one of the moſt remarkeable things and moſt worthy to be fixed in my memory? 'Tis true that when you were in a better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you repented your ſelf of the good intention you had had, and though I urged you very much upon it, you made as if you had forgotten what you had ſo well begun. But ſince that time, Madam, after you had received ſuch proofs of my love, as could not in reaſon permit you to be thus cloſe, and diſtruſtful of me, and then too when by your vertue you had reduced the King my Father to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and requeſt ſo earneſtly himſelf of you, that which till then he had ſo much rejected, what just reaſon could you have to conceal from me the truth of your birth, and what could you fear upon this confeſſion in a place where you were adored by all the perſons who had any power there?</hi> I was afraid of everie thing, replyed <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and beſides what I heard you ſay your ſelf everie day, of the hatred you bare to the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which might make me apprehend ſome change in your affection (for as for any other ill uſage I was ſecure on your part by the knowledg I had of your vertue) my fears were redoubled by an accident which diſcovered the Kings thoughts to our familie, more fullie than I had underſtood them till then, and I will tell you, if you do not know it alreadie, that about the time that you recovered of that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which reconciled you to him, and he began to ſignifie by his diſcourſe that he would no longer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your intentions, he came one evening into the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46404:123"/>
Princeſs your ſiſters chamber, who having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed that evening, had no bodie with her but my ſelf and two of her maids, one of which read to her the hiſtorie of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> When the King entred into the chamber, ſhe had newlie heard read of the crueltie which the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> exerciſed againſt the daughters of that Tyrant, making them dye the moſt cruel death they could invent, after they had expoſed them to all manner of ſhame and ignominy: The Princeſs who had her mind full of the <hi>Idea</hi> of that which had been read, could not forbear ſpeaking immediatelie to the King, with deteſtation and horrour, concerning the crueltie of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> making imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt thoſe barbarians who had uſed ſuch young, ſuch fair, and ſuch innocent Princeſſes with ſo much inhumanitie. The King after he had pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientlie hearkened to her: <hi>This action was very cruel,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but a juſt and violent reſentment may carry us to many things, and though I have not a natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cruelty, the outrage I received from the King of</hi> Armenia <hi>in the death of my Nephews, hath filled me with ſuch a grand reſentment against him, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if fortune ſhould put into my power any perſons of his family, of what age or ſex ſo ever they were, I ſhould uſe them as bad as poſſibly might be, to revenge my ſelf upon that cruel man.</hi> Theſe words filled the Princeſſe who heard them full of horror, but if they had obſerved my countenance in thoſe emotions, they would eaſilie have perceived the ſtrange effect, which they produced upon my Spirit. All that night, nor for many dayes afterwards, I could not overcome the fear that this diſcourſe cauſed in my
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46404:124"/>
Spirit, and I conceited everie moment that I was readie to be diſcovered, and expoſed by the Kings implacable hatred againſt our familie, to all manner of bad uſage. This was that which at laſt made me take a full reſolution to be gone out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and to wait for an opportunitie to put it in execution in good earneſt.</p>
               <p>Not long after it offered its ſelf of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, when <hi>Tigranes</hi> being outed of his dominions, came to <hi>Tharſus</hi> to beg ſuccour, and it was reſolved that you ſhould go at the head of an armie to reſtore him to his Kingdom. This is another paſſage, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph,</hi> wherein I confeſſe my weakneſs, as I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it my ſelf in that tranſaction, I believed that nothing but your abſence could give me courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to depart out of your Country, and if you had ſtayed there ſtill, I know not whether I ſhould ever have been able to reſolve to leave you in that grief, whereinto, as I might judge by former proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, my departure would put you. Beſides, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph,</hi> 'twas not without ſome diſpleaſure upon my own part, that I diſpoſed my ſelf to be gone from you, and you might have taken notice by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe marks that you were not indifferent to me. I judged then that I ought to take this time in your abſence, to free my ſelf from all difficulties, and from all the impediments which your affection, and all that was on my part, had laid in my way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my departure; but believing that without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude I could not part from you for ever, and make you loſe all the hopes which in regard of your love and ſervices you might with a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have conceived, I deſired partlie to exempt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46404:124"/>
from the reproach which you might lay upon me for it, and to comply with mine own inclination, which would not have permitted me without grief to part with you for ever, and upon this deſign, I thought it beſt (by ſome way or other, which might not retard the effect of my intention) to acquaint you with the truth of my name and birth, and the place whither I intended to retire; to the end that if you perſevered in your affection, after you knew who I was, and to whom you ought to addreſſe your ſelf, you might find out ſome means to come and ſee me, and obtain me for your wife of the King my brother, by thoſe wayes which are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie uſed amongſt perſons of our birth. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I will tell you (and that will poſſible make you excuſe in part the refuſal I made of the honour which the King your Father preſented me) that though I might have been diſcovered in his Court without anie danger, and though my inclinations had been more favourable to you, I ſhould never have conſented to the marriage which was propoſed to me, without putting my ſelf into the power of the King my brother, and obtaining his conſent in my abſolute libertie, and not whileſt I was in the power of his enemie. This likewiſe was one of the ſtrongeſt reaſons that made me haſten my departure for your ſake, thinking that this was the beſt way for me to be gone as ſoon as poſſiblie I could to that place, in which onlie you could hope to find your ſatisfaction. Behold, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> the naked truth of my intentions. In order to the executions of them I meant to ſerve my ſelf with that paper which I gave you, and knowing the ſinceritie of your love, I

I had to obtain leave to go of the Princeſſe your ſiſter: but trulie you have this obligation to to her amitie, that out of the care ſhe had of your ſatisfaction, ſhe ſpared neither prayers, nor teares, nor anie teſtimonie of the moſt ardent affection, to ſtay me. I continued diverſe dayes before I could diſpoſe her to let me go, and beſides the diſpleaſure ſhe expreſſed at my departure upon her own conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſhe proteſted to me that I could not have that deſign, except I meant to take away your life, and that I committed an action of ingratitude and inhumanitie unworthie of my ſelf: I told her, but in vain, that the matter was not ſo bad as ſhe made it, and that in the letter which I had given you, you would find wherewith to comfort your ſelf, and all the addreſs you could deſire towards an abſolute ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and contentment, which doubtleſs would be more dear to him, than my continuance in <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia:</hi> She took all this diſcourſe for a put-off, and I believe I had never wrought her to conſent, if ſhe had not remembred the requeſt you made to the King, and to her, to uſe fair means onlie to retain me, and not to offer me anie violence. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration brought her at laſt to that which I deſired of her, when ſhe ſaw that my reſolution could not be altered, ſhe acquainted the King with it her ſelf, and prayed him, as I had requeſted her, to cauſe me to be ſafelie conducted to one of the Cities under the obedience of the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> I deſired no more for fear of declaring my ſelf too far, and I knew well enough, that when I diſcovered my ſelf in the King my brothers dominions, I ſhould find all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of aſſiſtance and convoy to <hi>Artaxata.</hi>

At laſt when he ſaw me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon my deſign, he offered me all I could deſire for my voyage, and after he had conſidered whom he might truſt to conduct me, he gave the employment to <hi>Antigenes.</hi> This man at firſt I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, becauſe he had formerlie made love to me with a great deal of earneſtneſs, and with aſſurance to marrie me by the Kings favour, who as you know, upheld him in that deſign, yet remembring how he had behaved himſelf towards me ſince the day you prohibited him to ſee me, the reſpect he expreſſed to me in all his actions &amp; all the Apologies he often made me for thoſe things which he was conſtrained to do in obedience to the Kings command, I believed he had abſoſutelie loſt that intention, which he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pretended for fear of incurring the Kings diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and I as eaſilie imagined that he would acquit himſelf of his commiſſion with more affection than another, that by that means he might the better gain his Prince's favour.

and villany, and let me know the perfidiouſneſs of his intentions in a buſineſs that threatned me with manifeſt danger, if the Gods had not ſuccoured me</p>
               <p>I am going now to relate to you, without any farther delay, the moſt diſagreeable paſſages of my ſtory. I was permitted to walk upon the bank of the river, which waſhes the foot of the houſe, and in a great wood which environed it in on everie ſide, but never without having with me, either <hi>Antigenes,</hi> or his brother named <hi>Thraſillus,</hi> or many times both of them with ſix or ſeven men at their heels.</p>
               <p>One day, attended by this convoy, having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the bank of the river, where the walk was very pleaſant, and being gone farther from<hi> Thraſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s houſe than ever I had been before, drawing near to a little brook which there about ran into the river, being bordered on both ſides with a tuft of trees thicker than the reſt of the wood, upon our right hand, ſome paces diſtant from us, I heard, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diverſe ſighs and ſob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, the voice of a man who by the violence of his grief was forced to complain in that ſolitary place before inſenſible witneſſes. At the firſt ſound that reached my ears, I ſtopt and lent attention, but not out of any motion of curioſitie, which at that time had little room in my ſoul,<hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigenes </hi>who followed me ſtaid as well as I, and we had not long continued attentive, but we diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie heard the complaints of that afflicted perſon.<hi> To what intent, </hi>ſaid this diſconſolate man,<hi> to what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, wretch as thou art, dost thou ſpain out the remainder of thy unfortunate life in an extremity of miſerie, when
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46404:131"/>
thou ſeeſt thy ſelf abandoned by all hope? what motive can any longer make thee endure this deplorable life which hath been divided between glory and mis fortunes, and what effect at laſt doſt thou expect from thy grief to execute that, which thine own hand ſhould have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Doſt thou believe that by that courage which hath acquired thee ſome reputation amongſt men thou oughteſt to ſupport with conſtancy, or rather with inſenſibilitie evils worſe than the moſt cruel deaths, from which one death onlie might have ſecured thee? The Sun doth now unwillingly lend thee his light, and after the perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ingratitude of men, whereby thou ſeeſt thy ſelf expoſed to ſo many miſeries, all things are contrary to thee, all things are cnemies to thee; there is no more day, there is no more light for thee amongſt men, and if that which made thee love the day, be yet a live, it is no more for thee, poor wretch, it is no more for thee, the outcaſt of men and fortune. </hi>He ſtopt a while after theſe words, and it ſeemed to me that this tone of voice was not an abſolute ſtranger to me, although I could not well diſcern it. I turned my ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<hi> Melite </hi>to communicate to her what I thought of it, but I was diverted from it by the ſequel of his complaint, which he continued in this manner:<hi> O the obſcureſt night!

                     </gap>mies! All the rayes it darts upon me are ſo many witneſſes of my miſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fortunes, and by its light henceforth I can behold nothing, whereupon to fix my ſight without repugnance, ſince that for ever, alas! for ever I have lost the ſight of my adorable Princeſſe. Ah! my grief, ah! my juſt reſentment, is it poſſible
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46404:132"/>
that upon ſo ſad a remembrance you can leave my ſoul in ſo great tranquillity? Can you content your ſelves with a few regrets, and a few tears, which testifie my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as much as my affliction, when you ought to have made your ſelves known to all </hi>Aſia<hi> by Tragical and dreadful marks, and by rivers of blood which ſhould repair ſuch bloody injuries. Ah! without doubt my hand will ſerve me ſtill upon that deſign, and that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which hath acquired me ſome reputation, amongſt men, will arm thouſands of them still in my quarrel, if I would wear this ſword amongſt them to which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have attributed the gaining of battailes: but alas! I have my hands tyed by a respect which I ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to my grave; and my adorable Princeſſe is ſo much the more worthy of it, as ſhe is innocent of my miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and hath ſympathized in them by her pity; neither can I accuſe any body of them but the cruelty of men, and my own ill fortune. </hi>The ſad unknown accompanied theſe laſt words with a throng of ſighs, which ſtopped the paſſage of them, and ſighs and ſobs were the only language in which his grief did conclude its expreſſions, not a word more proceeding from his mouth that we could underſtand.</p>
               <p>Some moments after, having heard, as I beleeved, ſome noiſe in the place where we were, and avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing ſo much as company, hee aroſe from the place where he was to look out one more private, and permitted us to ſee, as he retired between the trees, the handſome proportion of his body, and part of his face. By that which appeared to our eyes we knew that he was extreamly pale and wan, and I perceived very well that his grief might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by other marks beſides his complaints.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46404:132"/>
My heart was tenderly moved at thoſe which I had heard, and though it ſeemed to me, as I told you before, that the voice (though a little changed with weakneſs) was not an abſolute ſtranger to me, I conjectured by the words which I had heard, which ſpake of Princeſſes and the gaining of battailes, that he which uttered them was no common perſon. I muſed upon it being very penſive, as much as the remembrance of mine own miſery could pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rmit me, when <hi>Antigenes</hi> who had heard all as well as I: <q>This man, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> whoſoever he is, eaſes his grief by his complaints, whileſt another man more wiſe than he would have been ſeeking remedies for it. 'Tis, <hi>replied I ſmartly,</hi> becauſe he is not a villain, becauſe he is not a raviſher, and becauſe he rather chooſes to be miſerable all his life, than to owe the end of his miſery to his crimes. You ſee how well he fares for it, <hi>anſwered</hi> Antigenes, and how happy his condition is, for having been ſo reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and circumſpect. 'Tis more happy than yours, <hi>ſaid I, being much netled and much concerned in this diſcourſe,</hi> and beſides that, he poſſibly hath the comfort of being beloved by a perſon whom he ſerves with reſpect, as much as you are hated and deteſted by her whom you uſe ſo baſelie, he hath the ſatisfaction of not being troubled with any remorſe, whileſt your conſcience may well torment you worſe, than the moſt cruel death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaw that <hi>Antigenes</hi> grew pale at theſe words, and was like one amazed, he changed his colour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe times in a moment, he trembled from head to foot, and hee ſeemed to me in the condition of a perſon that meditated upon ſome grand deſign. I
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46404:133"/>
conſeſs that the changing of his viſage, and his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled countenance made me affraid, and ſeeing him in ſuch a form as he had never appeared in to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I began to tremble my ſelf out of an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear which promiſed me no good. I was not fearful without reaſon; for the diſloyal villain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to me with a furious look: <hi>If I am ſo much hated and ſo much detested by you,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>I muſt merit this hatred and deteſtation by ſuch actions, as may ſecure you from the blame which you would have for hating me unjuſtly, and if I muſt be expoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, it ſhall be for a crime which may yield me ſome profit, and not for thoſe reſpects and adorations, which hither to I have ſo unprofitably rendred you; my patience is ſtretched to its uttermoſt dimenſions, and I will know this day, whether a heart which is invincible by love and pity can be tamed by any other wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe words (I know not whether his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was premeditated or not, as in probability it was, or whether the occaſion prompted him to the deſign) having made a ſign to his brother, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe which followed him, they came at the ſame time to pull <hi>Ericlea</hi> and <hi>Melite</hi> from off my arms, who held by me on both ſides, and <hi>Antige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> putting himſelf in <hi>Ericlea's</hi> place, began to lead me by force towards the moſt privat part of the wood, whileſt his brother, and one of his men held my two women by violence,</p>
               <p>This action made me deſperately affraid, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that in ſuch an extremity a diſguiſe was no longer neceſſary: Antigenes, ſaid I,<hi> think what thou goeſt about, and look no more upon me as an unknown </hi>Delia,<hi> but as the daughter of a great King, and as a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46404:133"/>
Princeſs who in what part ſo ever of the world thou ſhalt retire to, will make the vengeance of they crime light heavy upon thy head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe that <hi>Antigenes</hi> gave no credit to theſe words, which he thought I was inſpired with by the preſſing neceſſity wherein I was, to draw him off from his deſign by the reſpect which they might imprint in him. Howſoever it was, hee did not ſeem to be moved at them, and not vouchſafeing ſo much as to give me a reply, and continued dragging me with all his force towards the moſt ſolitary part of the wood. In this extremity I made the wood to Eccho with my cryes, and my women whom they hindred from coming to my aſſiſtance were as loud as I: Their cryes and mine without doubt did us more good, than our reſiſtance could have done, and they drew a man to us, who was retired into that thick and ſolitary place, whom we preſently knew to be the ſame, whoſe complaint we had heard a little before: Hee came out from between the trees where he ſought for ſilence and obſcurity, and caſting his eyes upon us, he preſently ſaw the cauſe of our cryes and the violence they offered to us, and his grief not being capable to extinguiſh generous reſentments in his ſoul, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the ſuccour that was due to oppreſſed maids, he ran to us with more ſpeed than could have been expected from the languiſhing and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted condition where in he appeared to us. <hi>Antige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> ſeeing him come, and fearing the hindrance of his deſign more than any other harm he could do him, being accompanied as he was, called his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who leaving my women in the hands of two of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46404:134"/>
his men, came to <hi>Antigenes</hi> with the reſt. This number did not trouble the unknown, but addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to <hi>Antigenes</hi> without ſo much as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the reſt, <hi>Baſe fellow,</hi> ſaid he, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious voice, <hi>ſtay, and do not oblige me to give thee thy death for a puniſhment of thy crime. Antigenes</hi> ſeeing himſelf fortified by the number of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions mocked at the pride of the unknown, and not vouchſafing to forbear from his deſign for him, hee made a ſign to his brother either to ſtay him or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him; but he had to do with a man who was not ſo eaſilie corrected in that manner, and though he had no more than <hi>Antigenes</hi> and his companions had, only his ſword, without any other arms, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented it to the eyes of his enemies, and fell upon them with as much aſſurance as if he had been backed by a greater number than theirs. O Gods! <hi>Phiiadelph,</hi> what proofs of valour did he give us in a few moments, and what ſpeedy execution did he make before our eyes, of five or ſix men, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as nothing in his ſingle hands? The firſt that fell under his ſword was the brother of <hi>Antigenes,</hi> whoſe right arm hee cut off at one blow, and made a large paſſage in his ſide, through which his ſoul bare his blood company: and almoſt at the ſacred time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving avoided a blow which another enemy made at him, he thruſt his bloody ſword into his body up to the hilts. I could ſee that action, and thoſe he did afterwards, becauſe the perfidious <hi>Antigenes</hi> no ſooner ſaw his brother fall, but leaving me with a great cry, he ran either to revenge his death or to bear him company. Theſe two which were left to guard my women ran to <hi>Antigenes</hi> at his cry, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46404:134"/>
theſe three enemies fell upon the Valiant Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, juſt as he had cloven the head and half the face of the laſt of the others with a back blow. He cared as little for theſe as he had done for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and picking out <hi>Antigenes</hi> between his two companions, he gave him a mortal wound in the throat, with which he fell at his feet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after was choaked with his bloud and dyed. My valiant defender received at the ſame time a ſlight wound upon his ſide, which did but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him the more, and haſtened the death of him who gave it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as he was juſt turning his back to run away, he thruſt his ſword into his reins and laid him dead cloſe by <hi>Antigenes.</hi> The laſt ſeeing ſo bloody an execution, had not confidence any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to reſiſt ſo terrible an enemy, and committing his ſafety to the nimbleneſs of his heels, hee ran croſs the wood in a deadly fright.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell you whether was greater in me, the aſtoniſhment at ſo prodigious a valour, or the joy of ſeeing my ſelf delivered from the hands of my treacherous raviſher, or the horror of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many dead men, who had loſt their lives upon my occaſion. I was ſo amazed, and ſo troubled, that I had not ſo much as the power to return thanks to my valiant deliverer, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a confuſion not knowing how to begin to ſpeak to him, when hee approaching to me with his bloody ſword in his hand, and with a colour which the heat of the combat had raiſed in his face: <hi>Your enemies are dead, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and if there remains any thing to do for your ſervice, I have</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:46404:135"/>
                  <hi>ſtrength enough still to free you out of a greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> He ſpeake no more, becauſe aſtoniſhment cut off the thread of his diſcourſe, and he had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caſt his eyes a little nearer upon my face, but he was full of amazement, and confuſion: My ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was no leſſe than his, when having looked upon him with attention, and diſcerned the tone of his voice, maugre the change which three or four years, and an extraordinary paleneſſe might have wrought upon his countenance, I thought I knew him for that brave and valiant <hi>Britomarus,</hi> of whom I made ſome ſmall mention to you in my diſcourſe, who by his miraculous actions of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in a few moneths attained to the higheſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall employments in the ſervice of the King my brother, and quitted it out of a generous reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt that cruelty, which cauſed the King your Father's hatred againſt our family; the very ſame, who being puffed up with the glory of his gallant actions, had the boldneſs to raiſe his eyes to me; and the ſame, whom, as I told you, I repulſed with choler and diſdain onely for the meanneſſe of his birth, not finding any thing elſe in his perſon which might not make him aſpire to the higheſt fortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have heard much talk of <hi>Britomarus, ſaid Prince</hi> Philadelph, <hi>upon this paſſage of the Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes relation,</hi> and beſides the eſteem which the ſame of his great actions hath given me for him, the obligation I have to him for this laſt, addes to it an acknowledgment and an affection which will render him dear and conſiderable to me as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46404:135"/>
long as I live: but why muſt it needs fall out that the puniſhment of the perfidious <hi>Antigenes</hi> ſhould be reſerved for any other hand than mine? and how could it be juſt that any other but <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph</hi> ſhould free his Princeſs from the danger whereinto ſhe was fallen by the imprudence of the King my Father? It was not neceſſary, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi> Arſinoe, that you ſhould add that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſo many others for which I am redeuable to you, and I had received ſufficient proofs of your affection, without having need of this laſt, which without doubt your vertue only would have prompted you to, upon the ſcore of an unknown perſon reduced to the ſame extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I doubted ſtill that my eyes did abuſe me in the knowledge of <hi>Britomarus;</hi> but hee cleared my doubts in defiring to ſatisfie his own, and after he had looked upon me a long time with an attention that ſignified the ſurprize of his Spirit: <q>O Gods! <hi>cryed he upon a ſuddain,</hi> can it be poſſibly that you ſhould be the Princeſs <hi>Arſinoe?</hi> I am <hi>Arſinoe, anſwered I,</hi> but is it true that you are <hi>Britoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus?</hi> Yes, Madam, <hi>replyed he,</hi> I am <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and <hi>Britomarus</hi> much more happy than he durſt hope to be in the deplorable condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he is now reduced, ſince he is permitted to ſee a Princeſs living, whoſe death is publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all over <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſince he hath had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to render you a ſervice which may partly repair the offence by which I formerly merited your indignation.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:46404:136"/>
Theſe words recalling what was paſt to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, made a bluſh mount up into my face, but did not hinder me from returning him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in theſe terms: <q>The offence you did me might be repaired by repentance and diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, and the ſervice which you have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me is of ſuch a value, that it may not only repair ſuch an injury, but command all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement that is due to the generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of my life and honour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpake theſe words with a real reſentment, as without doubt was due to the importance of ſo great a ſervice, and yet I was not without ſome diſpleaſure to ſee my ſelf fallen again into the hands of a man that had made love to me, and though by the knowledge which I had of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, I thought my ſelf ſecure from thoſe violences and dangers which I had lately eſcaped, I was aftraid of the company of a man, whom I could not look upon with a particular affection, without being ungrateful to <hi>Philadelph</hi>'s love, and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own courage, which made me formerly ſo much diſdain his preſumption: I believed too, as we are apt to flarter our ſelves in the good opinion we have of our ſelves, that I might have partly cauſed, either by my diſdair, or by the report of my death, his ſadneſs and ſolitude, and I did not make a ſuddain reflection upon the words, which I had heard him ſpeak a few moments before which might partly have freed me from that ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Do not make any difficulty then to receive thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of me which I am able to render you, and which may be neceſſary to you in the condition wherein I meet you, and be fully aſſured, that during the time that I ſhall be obliged to bear you company, either to compleat your delivery from your enemies power, if you have any yet left, or to reconduct you to the place whither you deſigned to retire, you ſhall ſee nothing in my actions that may importune you, or at leaſt make you fear the return of that paſſion which you juſtly condemned.</q>

               <p>Theſe words of <hi>Britomarus</hi> made me very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and having a good opinion of him, as all thoſe had who were acquainted with his vertue, I preſently gave abſolute credit to them, and made

               </p>
               <p>After theſe words, which hee received with a great deal of reſpect, he asked me what my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, and I having told him that I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more to my enemies houſe, where I had been a long time captive, and in the danger out of which he had reſcued me by his valour: he told me that he was lodged but a few furlongs from that place at a friends houſe who was a native of that Country, where hee had been ſtaid by a ſickneſſe

which had detained him there ſome dayes, and that if it pleaſed me to take my retreat there, I ſhould be ſecured from all manner of enemies to the laſt drop of his blood, and in the mean time he would give order to accommodate us with a veſſel, and other neceſſaries to conduct me into <hi>Armenia,</hi> or any other part of the world whither it ſhould pleaſe me to retire. I thanked him very much for his good intentions, and did not refuſe the effects of them, making the extremity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I was reduced, my excuſe for the incivility which I was conſtrained to commit, in ſuffering him to quit his own intereſts for mine, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the deſignes he might have to protect me in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and to conduct me into <hi>Armenia.</hi>

one of his Officers) had the care of procuring from the next Town all things that were neceſſary for us for the ſtay we were to make in that houſe, and another of his ſervants went the ſecond day after to go ſeek and ſtay a veſſel at the next port upon the way to <hi>Armenia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the time of our tarrying there, I received from <hi>Britomarus,</hi> as much as his ſadneſs would permit him, all the conſolation he could give me in my diſpleaſures, and I did all that poſſibly I could upon my part to mitigate the mortal grief that appeared in all his actions: but in that I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vain, and though he conſtrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very much to make his company ſupportable to me, I think that during all the time of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance together, I did not ſee him 'laugh ſo much as once, or any way expreſſe to me that his affliction had been eaſed for ſo much as a momen. His ſighs made continual ſallies out of his breaſt, accompanied with ſobs, and ſometimes with ſome complaints, which with all his moderation hee could not refrain, and at thoſe houres when he did not think himſelf obliged to keep me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he went abroad in the morning to ſeek for ſolitude in thoſe places which were leaſt frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſociety of men. He kept his promiſe very exactly with me which he had made not to give me any marks of the return of his former paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either by his diſcourſe or actions, and in ſtead of making me fear any ſuch thing, hee made me judge with a great deal of probability, that that paſſion had given place to a ſecond, where with his
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46404:138"/>
Spirit was at that time diſquieted; and which in my thoughts, made up the greateſt part of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures and inquietudes. As I ſaw no deſigne in him to diſcover himſelf any farther to me, ſo I did not deſire to preſſe him to it, and I expected that only from his own will, which I could not ask him without indiſcretion, yet one day having expreſſed a little more curioſity than ordinary, yet not ſo much as to make him judge that I deſired to know more of him than he was willing I ſhould, forcing ſome ſighs which commonly brake off the thread of his diſcourſe, and hardly retaining ſome tears which were ready to overſlow his eyes: <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> if there were any thing of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement in my life, I would have given you a relation of it, to paſſe away the tediouſneſs of your ſolitude: but of all that I have to tell you there is nothing worthy of your attention. I will only tell you, that Fortune hath di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fed me up with ſuch a pride, that I could hardly look upon the moſt puiſſant Kings upon earth as my ſuperiours: but if ſhe hath ſerved me in my glory ſhe hath abandoned me in the repoſe of my
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46404:139"/>
life, and hath left me nothing of all the good I received from her or my ſelf, but the regret of having loſt all, and the cruel remembrance of thoſe fair hopes which poſſibly I had unjuſtly conceived. Since this hard change, or rather ſince this deplorable fall, I wander like a Ghoſt amongſt men, finding nothing amongſt them but ingratitude and infidelity, and I ſpain out a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing life by an abſolute command which hath not permitted me to diſpoſe of my deſtiny, as without doubt I ſhould have done, if an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which ought to continue as long as my life had left me at liberty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Britomarus</hi> ſpake in this manner, and I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that hee was not willing that I ſhould know any more, ſo that I expreſſed no deſire that way, I only let him know that I ſympathized with him in his diſpleaſures, and I did all that poſſibly I could, by ſuch reaſons and examples as I alleged to him, to make him hope for ſome happy change in his condition. I was not ſo reſerved towards him as he was to me, but the ſecond day I ſpent in his company, I told him plainly all that had befallen me ſince his departure from <hi>Armenia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving my ſelf obliged to put that confidence in a man to whom I was ſo much redeuable, and not ſeeing (after the change of his affections) any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which engaged me not to acquaint him with the truth. I may truly ſay, that by the relation which I made to him of your generous and ſincere carriage towards me, I rendred him very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to you, and hee often teſtified to me by his
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46404:139"/>
diſcourſe, that he ſhould be much ſatisfied in the opportunities of ſerving a Prince, whoſe vertue he infinitely eſteemed upon my narration.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, I know not, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am obliged to tell you what place you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed at that time in my memory, and whether modeſty will permit me to confeſſe that my thoughts were daily upon you, as a perſon whoſe <hi>Idea</hi> did pleaſingly flatter me, and as a Prince, whom without ingratitude I could not forget. 'Tis certain, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and I will tell you as much without any fear that you ſhould abuſe it, or make any ill conſtruction of it, that during the time I continued captive with <hi>Antigenes,</hi> and at liberty with <hi>Britomarus,</hi> you came oftener into my mind than poſſibly you ſhould have done, and when I complained of my miſ-fortunes, I complained of them more upon your conſideration than upon mine own. I will ſpeak no more of this <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and without doubt I have ſpoken enough to make you judge that I have wanted neither acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor inclination for you.</p>
               <p>Our ſtay at that houſe was longer than we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and though the man whom <hi>Britomarus</hi> had ſent to make ſtay of a veſſel, executed his commiſſion with a great deal of diligence, yet we were fain to wait till the wind, which was then quite contrary to our intended courſe, became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to our navigation, and in the mean while, by a miſ-fortune which made me ſhed a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears, and which I ſtill do oftentimes deplore, my Governeſs <hi>Ericlea,</hi> whom you ſaw paſſe for my
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46404:140"/>
Aunt in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and to whom I had dear and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obligations, as well for the care ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon my education, as for her redineſſe to comfort me in my afflictions with a great deal of conſtancy and firmeneſſe of courage, fell ſick, and dyed within fifteen dayes. I was very nearly ſenſible, of this loſſe, as well for the reaſons which I have alleged to you, as in reſpect of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which was much more ſtrongly eſtabliſhed in my Spirit by our voyages, and common croſſes, than if we had never ſtirred out of <hi>Armenia;</hi> but after I had beſtowed ſome dayes in deploring her death, the acquaintance which I had long ſince contracted with grief, did a little mitigate it, and made me accuſtome my ſelf to this diſpleaſure, as I had inured my ſelf to ſo many other afflictions, that my ill fortune had raiſed me.</p>
               <p>After we had rendred her our laſt devoi S, and furniſhed our ſelves with all things neceſſary for our voyage, as well by Sea as by land, we depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from that houſe under the conduct of <hi>Britoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> attended by fifteen or twenty men which continued ſtill in his ſervice, and we went down the river <hi>Lapithus</hi> in boats, which carried us to <hi>Cemunia,</hi> where the river diſembogues itſelf into the Sea, and there we embarked the ſame day in the veſſel which waited for us.</p>
               <p>Our ſtreighteſt way to go into <hi>Armenia,</hi> was to return to <hi>Tharſus,</hi> and to croſſe all <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and this way we had only an arm of the Sea to paſſe over: but I deſired to avoid all occaſions of being ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the King your Fathers Court, whither you
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46404:140"/>
might have been returned, and where I might have been ſtayed by ſome accident, and becauſe we could not avoid paſſing through a corner of <hi>Cilicia, Britomarus,</hi> who was well acquainttd with the Map, was of opinion that we ſhould coaſt between that Kingdom and the Iſland which we leſt, and go land at the foot of the mountain <hi>Amanus</hi> hard by the place called the <hi>Streights of Amanus,</hi> by this meanes our voyage by Sea would be much longer, but our journey by land much ſhortened.</p>
               <p>I abſolutely committed my ſelf to the good conduct of <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and having ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his vertue, I hardly enquired what his intention was. He had a reſentment againſt the King my brother, for the diſpleaſure he had done him by the death of your two Kinſmen, which would not permit him to go to his Court, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me to <hi>Artaxata,</hi> but hee promiſed me to bring me as near the City as I pleaſed, and it was ſufficient for me to be conducted to the firſt place upon the frontires, where I believed I ſhould find a convenient convoy, and all things neceſſary for the performance of my voyage: But the Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed things otherwiſe than we had propoſed, and ſailing with a favourable wind we had hardly loſt the ſight of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> when we met with a veſſel of Pirats, which having ſailed cloſe up to us with all the ſigns of peace, and paſſed by us to view us without diſcovering themſelves, they had no ſooner obſerved the ſmall number of our men, but truſting in their own, which was a great deal bigger, they turned their prow towards us,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46404:141"/>
and after they had cryed out to us to yield, they fell upon us with a great deal of fury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Britomarus</hi> clapt on his armour in a moment, and encouraging his men with a few words, hee put himſelf in the head of them with his ſword in his hand, and finding himſelf more fit, for this kind of combat, than for that with arrows which the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats ſhot at our men, he gave them leave to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple our veſſel, and preſented himſelf the firſt upon the deck to the enemies that would enter.</p>
               <p>You may judge, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> in what a fright I was at that time, and though I had a very great confidence in the valour of my defender, the great number of our enemies froze me with fear, and made me, not without reaſon, to tremble in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what might be the ſucceſſe of ſo unequal a combat, yet I was aſhamed to go and hide my ſelf, and though thoſe enemies which could not come to handy-blows, ſhot arrows at us with which I might have been hurt, yet I did not go down into the Hold as <hi>Melite</hi> adviſed me, but ſtood a little out of the way, where I might ſee a good part of what paſſed, and there according as neceſſity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf to my ſight, I made vows to Heaven with a great deal of fervency.</p>
               <p>You will not credit my diſcourſe, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> when I ſhall relate to you the prodigious effects of <hi>Britomarus</hi>'s valour, but 'tis certain for all that, that I ſhall add nothing to the truth, when I ſhall tell you that a batallion of armed men upon the deck could not have done greater ſervice, nor made greater reſiſtance than he did with his ſingle hand,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46404:141"/>
and the few men he had with him, being ranked on each ſide of him, and animated by his example, did things infinitely above their ordinary ſtrength. The firſt that were ſo bold as to board our veſſel were tumbled back dead either into their own, or into the Sea by the hand of <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and in a few moments he was ſo covered with the blood of the moſt adventurous, that the reſt were as much affraid of his approach as of lightning and thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, and aſſaulted him with the more precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſucceſs of the combat was ſtill doubtful, and if the valour of <hi>Britomarus</hi> gave us ſome hope of the victory, the number of our enemies which exceeded our men by one half, made us partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of it, and in all likelyhood there was as much cauſe to fear as to hope, when amongſt the Slaves which were in the Pirates veſſel, one above all the reſt who had both his legs and arms laden with Irons, turning himſelf towards ſome of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, whileſt the laſt of the Pirates, ſeeing that all their forces were but neceſſary, were run to the combat: <hi>Friends,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what hinders us from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to regain our liberty, free me from theſe Irons which ſhackle me, and you ſhall ſee how I will open you the way to it.</hi> Hee had hardly utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe words, but two ſlaves who owed him a more particular reſpect than the others, preſently took his Irons in hand, and by the help of their companions having freed him of them with ſome pain, hee inſtantly clapt a ſhield upon his arm, which he found at his feet, and ſnatching, with as much ſwiſtneſſe as an Eagle, the ſword out of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46404:142"/>
firſt Pirat's hand that came in his way, he laid two of them dead at his feet with the two firſt blows hee gave amongſt them, and throwing himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt with a marvailous fury, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled them with terrour, diſorder, and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Only three or four men followed him in this encounter, and the reſt being uncertain of the iſſue, expected it with a great deal of fear not daring to declare themſelves. <hi>Britomarus</hi> having perceived this aſſiſtance by the tumult which he ſaw, and the cryes which he heard amongſt the Pirates, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely leapt into their veſſel, and laying the firſt he met at his feet, hee flew amongſt the others like a Lion; he was couragiouſly ſeconded by his men, and to abridge the diſcourſe of a thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have no skill, after the general fright had ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon the Pirates they made no conſiderable reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In this condition the ſlaves who durſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to danget a few moments before, killed a good part of them, and a ſmall number of the reſt was ſaved by the pity of <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and that valiant Slave which had ſo great a ſhare in the victory. <hi>Britomarus</hi> and he did mutually admire each other, and if the ſlave ſaw <hi>Britomarus</hi> kill the Commanders of the Pirates with his own hand, and lay more of them upon the ground than all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, <hi>Britomarus</hi> ſaw the ſlave, though without any arms more than a Sword and a Shield, give almoſt as many deaths as blows, and hew the bodies of the Pirates with ſuch wounds as could not proceed but from a prodigious force.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:46404:142"/>
After that their hands had no more employment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately ſurprized him in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he continued dumb ſome moments, but a little after having viewed his face with a little more attention: <hi>O Gods!</hi> cryed he, <hi>do not I ſee Prince</hi> Ariobarcanes? for it was he indeed. By this tone of voice perfectly knowing <hi>Britomarus,</hi> whom his countenance and valour had almoſt diſcovered: <hi>Yes,</hi> anſwered he, running to him with his arms open, <hi>I am</hi> Ariobarzanes, <hi>and having ſeen the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles you have done upon this occaſion, I make no more doubt but that you are</hi> Britomarus. After theſe words they embraced each other with expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions full of affection, and all the ſatisfaction they were capable of receiving one from another in the condition of their fortune, but <hi>Britomarus</hi> was the moſt amazed of the two, to ſee before him a Prince whom he thought to be dead, both according to the publick report, and the particular account I had given him of our ſhipwrack, He began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his aſtoniſhment to him, and my brother
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46404:143"/>
was about to give a true relation of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when the name of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> was carried from mouth to mouth to the place where I was and hearing them ſay diverſe times that Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riobarzanes</hi> was in the Pirats Veſſel, I was ſo tranſported at it, that running amongſt the dead bodies without fear, and throwing my ſelf into the Veſſel, which was grappled to ours, I went to ſeek in the middle of the throng for that brother whom I had ſo much lamented, and who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been dearer to me than my life. I found him, I ſaw him, I knew him, and he was not a little amazed when he felt me hanging about his neck, and heard me uſe all the expreſſions that ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a joy could put into my mouth. I gave him no leaſure a long time to inform himſelf, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his eyes in thoſe doubts, which his eares had raiſed upon my interrupted diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>It would be very hard, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> to repeat to you our diſcourſes full of tranſport and confuſion and to repreſent to you the amazement we wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We could not for a long time giv credit to our eyes or eares, and a whole hour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent in exclamations and incoherent queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, could hardly make us believe our happineſſe At laſt when we had reſolved our ſelves that w were alive indeed without illuſion, amazemen
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46404:143"/>
ſurrendred its place to joy, and we ſolemnized it by all the marks that could be expreſſed in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common an adventure. <q>Ha! brother, <hi>ſaid</hi> I, how can I contain the joy which I have to ſee you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after I had ſhed ſo many tears for your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed death? Ha! ſiſter, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> what other comfort could I receive in my afflictions, but to meet ſo dear a ſiſter, whom the Gods beſtow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new upon me, after that, in my opinion, they had taken her out of the world? The opinion of your loſſe, <hi>replyed I,</hi> made me out of love with life: And the meeting, with you, <hi>added he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me,</hi> makes me endure it with pleaſure, at a time when my mis-fortune makes me ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it with regret.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſpent a great deal of time in this manner of converſation, but <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> brake it off at laſt, to render due thanks to <hi>Britomarus</hi> for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to inform himſelf by what fortune I was in his company, and to be ſatisfied in a great many particulars of this adventure which cauſed his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment. Before I acquainted him with other things, as I pretended to do at large, I told him in a few words the obligation I had to <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and the adventure that obliged me to put my ſelf under his conduct, and having let him know by this diſcourſe how redeuable we were both to him, I filled him with reſentment for that valiant man to whom we owed our honour, life and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <q>Ha! generous <hi>Britomarus, ſaid he, hugging him between his arms,</hi> with how much envy ſhould I look upon you, if the benefits with which you
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46404:144"/>
have chained us to you, would permit me to do it without ingratitude, and how unjuſt will Heaven be if it do not recompence your vertue with the higheſt fortunes that it can beſtow upon men? I have received great favours thence ſome dayes ſince, <hi>replyed</hi> Britomarus, in being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to render a ſmall ſervice to thoſe perſons, to whom I owed and had vowed a great deal more, but as for this, valiant Prince, you have little reaſon to believe that you are redeuable to me for it, and this victory which hath regained your liberty is the effect of your own valour, and the aſſiſtance you gave us, rather than of any thing I could have done without you help.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> anſwered the modeſt diſcourſe of <hi>Britomarus</hi> with the like ſubmiſſion, and after a converſation full of civility, and as many careſſes as two men could uſe, who were under the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of grief, they deſired we might paſſe into our veſſel, which was not ſo much imbrewed with blood, nor ſo full of Tragical ſpectacles, as the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates was, in which <hi>Britomarus</hi> intended to put things in order, and ſet the ſlaves at liberty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring them the goods which were taken from them. Amongſt them there were two <hi>Medes,</hi> whom, as we retired into our veſſel, we ſaw fall down at <hi>Britomarus</hi>'s feet, and expreſſe diverſe ſignes of aſtoniſhment and joy to meet him.</p>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Britomarus</hi> was diſcourſing with them, <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and I retired our ſelves into my chamber, where preſently we began to give one another an account of the ſucceſſes by which we
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46404:144"/>
were ſaved from ſhipwrack, and of thoſe things which had happened ſince our ſeparation. I made a relation of my adventures firſt, being unwilling to deprive <hi>Britomarus</hi> who was abſent and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with mine, of the ſatisfaction he might receive in hearing <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>'s ſtory. The Prince was ſenſibly touched with my diſcourſe, and upon the relation I made him of what you had done for me in your Kingdom, hee conceived ſo much reſentment, and ſo much affection for you, that he often brake our into exclamations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to me that he never more earneſtly deſired any thing than to ſee you, and to expreſs his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to you for your generous bounty. He himſelf in ſome paſſages blamed my procedure of a little too much ſeverity and circumſpection, but he was partial, <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and of the opinion of all other men, to whom the rules of our duty are not known, or rather to whom the practiſe of them is not agreeable.</p>
               <p>We had paſſed two or three houres in diſcourſe without ſeeing <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and when we enquired for him, they told us that after he had entertained himſelf a while with the two <hi>Medes,</hi> to whom he had reſtored their liberty, and the goods which the Pirates had taken from them, he ſhut himſelf up in the Cabin of that veſſel, and prayed them to let him alone a few houres without interrupting him. The acquaintance I had with him, which rendred his ſadneſs very familiar to me, made me receive this news without aſtoniſhment; and I was not at all ſurprized at it; preſently after they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46404:145"/>
ſerved in ſupper, and part of the night was ſpent and yet we had no ſight of him.</p>
               <p>We beſtowed the reſt of the night in ſleep, I having certified my brother, that we could not do a greater diſpleaſure to <hi>Britomarus</hi> than to trouble his ſolitude: But the next day we were no ſooner awake, but we ſaw him come into the Cabin in ſuch a condition as preſently filled me with fear and pity. His countenance was ſo changed that it could hardly be known, and one could hardly have imagined that the ſpace of diverſe dayes could have wrought that change which appeared there in a few houres, his complexion was pale and wan, his eyes wild and rouling in his head with a fierce look, and in all his countenance there was the true image of a man not far from the brink of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Yet he uſed ſome endeavours to refrain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before us, and forcing ſome ſobs that oppoſed the current of his ſpeech: <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> though I had no inclination to appear again to the world in this ſad condition, which makes my company inſupportable, yet I had a deſign to render you the ſervice which I owe you, and I ſhould not have left you, till you had been conducted to the place where you would have pleaſed to hav made your reſidence. The Gods are my witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that the wretched remainders of my life were employed in that office with a great deal of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and I ſhould never have neglected the opportunities of doing you ſervice, upon any conſideration of mine own intereſt: But ſeeing that the Gods have more advantagiouſly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46404:145"/>
for your conduct, than when they called me to that honour, and have permitted me to commit you into the Prince your brothers hands, who may conduct you into your own Country a great deal more conveniently than I can do; give me leave, if you pleaſe, to run that courſe which my deſtiny calls me to: my condition and the ſtate of my mind are ſo much changed ſince yeſterday, that I have no comfort nor remedy left in the world, but only what I am now going in ſearch of. I leave you this veſſel furniſhed with all neceſſaries, and of all theſe perſons, of whom you may have need in the reſt of your voyage, I will have only three of my ſervants along with me, and the reſt ſhall continne at your ſervice in this veſſel; that which we have taken from the Pirates ſhall ſerve my turn, with the aſſiſtance of ſome perſons that I have met there, who will guide me to the place, whither I muſt needs make all the haſte, I can. Pardon, Madam, pardon, generous Prince, <hi>continued he, addreſſing himſelf to</hi> Ariobarzanes, the haſtineſſe of my departure, and believe that the neceſſity which conſtrains me to it, renders me more worthy of your pity, than of your diſpleaſure for this incivility.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſpoken theſe words he parted from us, without giving me time to reply, to thank him for his generous aſſiſtance, and to expreſſe my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the redoubling of his grief. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> having continued a while very much ſurprized and full of paſſion, aroſe from the place where he lay
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46404:146"/>
to run after him, but he was already gone into the Pirates veſſel, and having cauſed it to be diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from ours, was put off to ſea at full ſail.</p>
               <p>See, in what manner the valiant <hi>Britomarus</hi> went from us, and not having heard of him ever ſince, leaving us a very great regret for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a juſt reſentment for the obligations we had to him, and an admiration of his vertue, which makes us preſerve the memory of him as of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Ha! Madam, <hi>cryed Prince</hi> Philadelph, <hi>at this paſſage,</hi> how much reaſon have you to preſerve this eſteem, and how willingly would I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe opportunities to ſpend my blood for the intereſts of a man to whom I owe my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If you were acquainted with his perſon, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Princeſs,</hi> you would ſay more, and you would judge that Fortune would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him to have been born to a Crown, but only becauſe they are all inferiour to his courage and vertue.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am very happy, <hi>added the Prince ſmiling,</hi> that he was no longer my rival, and though he was not born to a Crown, I ſhould be more affraid of him, than of thoſe whom Fortune had beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended that way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>You need not fear any thing, <hi>anſwered</hi> Arſinoe, for beſides your birth and your Crowns, you are endued with all the qualities which may make a perſon conſiderable, and more than that you have the advantage of ſo many ſervices, and of ſo many
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46404:146"/>
precious proofs of affection, that I ſhould be the moſt ingrateful perſon of the world, if I ſhould not prefer you as long as I live before the maſters of the Univerſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to finiſh my narration, I will tell you, that we would have continued our voyage towards <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> but the Prince my brother prayed me firſt to hear the relation of his adventures, and having diſcourſed them to me in the ſame place, where he acquainted me with as great and as wonderfull things as ever I heard of, which you ſhall hear at better leaſure, either from his mouth or mine; he let me know at laſt that he was neceſſarily obliged to be at <hi>Alexandria</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in that place only he might hear news of a perſon, to whom he had abſoluteſy devoted his life, and without whom he could have neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe nor comfort. Though I had a great deſire to return to my native Country, and though the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of you might make me fear on your behalf, that, if I had any place ſtill in your thoughts, you would ſeek for me in <hi>Armenia</hi> to no purpoſe: yet my brothers intereſt was ſo urgent, and of ſo great importance (as you will underſtand when I ſhall acquaint you with it) that I ſhould have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely void of friendſhip, and reſpect towards him, if I ſhould have expreſſed the leaſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to go that voyage, before I went to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> gave me to underſtand that we went to ſeek in that Country for what he had loſt, <hi>that</hi> being the only part of the world where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46404:147"/>
hee might receive intelligence: and that if the Gods would permit him to find ſatisfaction there, we ſhould go into our native Countrey full of joy and contentment, but if fortune croſſed him, hee would reconduct me out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Armenia</hi> the ſhorteſt and the eaſieſt way. I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> ſo well that I deſired his repoſe as much as mine own, and by the relation which hee made me of his ſtrange adventures, I did ſo much intereſſe my ſelf in the fortune of that perſon for whom hee ſought, that I was the firſt that urged that voyage, and told him that all the trouble I could endure upon that account was not conſiderable in relation to a deſign of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> embraced me with tears in his eyes, as well in reſpect to the markes of affection which he found in me, as to the memory of the deplorable condition of his fortune, wherein I did ſo participate, that hee hardly ſeemed to be more afflicted than I.</p>
               <p>We turned about our veſſel, and the wind not being contrary to us, in a ſhort time we entred into the <hi>Syrian</hi> Sea: but, as ill luck would have it, either the troubles of my mind, or the toil of my body made me fall ſick, and it came to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> notwithſtanding the impatience which carried him along in thas voyage, perceiving that in that condition I could not brook the Sea, landed us at <hi>Sidon,</hi> where (to make as quick diſpatch of a thing of ſo ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as I can poſſibly) whatſoever care I took
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46404:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to forward my recovery, I was not in a condition to endure the Sea for above a month.</p>
               <p>After that time we put to Sea again, where contrary to my expectation, I ſuddainly recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my health. The men which <hi>Britomarus</hi> left us accompanied and ſerved us all the voyage with a great deal of affection; and by the diligence, and good conduct of his Mariners, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture worth ſpeaking of, we arrived yeſterday in the evening upon this coaſt. But our Veſſel was in ſo bad a condition, having born the brunt of a furious Tempeſt but a few dayes ſince, that we did not think we could lye there all night in ſafety: and leaving the care to our men to raccommode it, we came out of it in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein you met us to come to this City; but it was ſo late that night ſurprized us in the Wood, and ſo dark, that not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way, we were conſtrained to take up our lodging under the trees, where we ſpent the night, and whither our common deſtinie conducted you, to render you what you ſought for with more trouble than I deſerved, and to give me the comfort of ſeeing a Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who for ſo many reaſons ought to be moſt dear to me, and highly eſteemed by me as long as I live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arſinoe</hi> ended her diſcourſe in this manner, and when ſhe had done ſpeaking, the paſſionate Prince throwing himſelf at her feet, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her knees with tears of joy, expreſſed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46404:148"/>
himſelf with ſo much ardor, that the Princeſſe to whom the teſtimonies of his love were not diſagreeable, was more moved to tenderneſſe than ever ſhe had been before, and gave him all the marks of affection, that hee could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from ſo eminent a vertue as <hi>Delia's</hi> was.</p>
