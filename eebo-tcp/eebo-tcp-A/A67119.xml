            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou set back the Clock of my age and make it day-spring, when it is past the mid noone of my life. I court my fancy in my observations of you. My first Love, my first Master, your Vnkle Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> whose name is, and ever must bee sacred to <hi>Mars</hi> and the Muses, whose memory is still precious to the World, justly was the Rivall and Competitour to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with your glorious Grandsier <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, of <hi>France</hi> the greatest. In you deare Sir I finde the Character of them both, as if you were sole heire to both; and it joyes my Soule to see it. I had the Honour to gird the first sword about you, with this wish, that you might use it
<pb facs="tcp:102691:3"/>
in peace, like our Northern <hi>Solomon</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and drawn, as that <hi>Boanerges</hi> the sonne of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the glory of <hi>France,</hi> your Grandfather. When your Father (whose goodnesse makes him glorious) shall be gathered to his Fathers, his Titles must as your Birthright descend on you; amongst the rest that which is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the faith. This, as it is well worthy obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, was given by him who they say could not erre in <hi>Cathedra, plenario Consistorio &amp; pleno Concilio,</hi> to him who as some of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors say even in that gave him the lye, who gave him the title; tis true twas an unkind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall, but there was <hi>Digitus Dei</hi> in it, for it was like the selling of <hi>Ioseph</hi> into <hi>Egypt, fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix scelus in eventu,</hi> guided by that hand which cannot erre. It was a worke of great and high daring, a voyage wherein many of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours had suffered shipwracke, and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> observes the worke suited the man, and the man was made for the work: as <hi>Nebuchadonezar</hi> was for <hi>Tyre.</hi> Sure it is strange that out of the ruines of good workes faith should spring, &amp; disorder set all the Church in order, <hi>Sed Deus est qui fecit, &amp; est mirum in occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102691:3"/>
               <hi>nostris.</hi> Sir, the Title is the most glorious your Royall father hath, and his Second is, that he is the best Friend living. It was a promise of the Prophets, that Kings should bee Nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Queenes Nursing Mothers to the Church. And believe mee Sir, the words are Emphaticall, for the Fathers wisdome and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er should provide for the childe <hi>ad extra,</hi> the mothers care <hi>ad intra;</hi> The fathers is and should be <hi>protegendo, instruendo, promovendo, corrigendo;</hi> The mothers in her Oeconomicks <hi>pro victu &amp; amictu,</hi> Necessaries and Decency, and all with a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nurses affection. And I am so much <hi>Irish,</hi> that as they love, the Children the Nurse, and the Children their Nurses, and foster brothers as much or more then their own: such mutuall love wish I betwixt the Prince and the Church, and as that habit is acquired partly, and partly infused, So may God infuse that into your heart, and by many mutuall reciprocall actions may it become habituall. So shall the Church be happie in future, and you shall be glorious in your timely reigne, and blessed in your Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as your Father is in you, and the Prayers of the Church attracted as the Dew and Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:102691:4"/>
by the glory and heate of the Sunne above, shall bee returned in rich showers of blessing upon you and yours.</p>

Though <hi>Iudas</hi> die in the consciousnesse of his treason, yet an other must succeed him in his Bishoprick. As an obedient sonne to my mother the Church I wish her honour, and happinesse to the Common Weale, as a member of it; and that these two as Mercie and Truth may kisse each other, and in their unitie make the Soul and Bodie, the King and his people happie, so shall our Common-weale flourish, and our Church be glorious, and God even our own God shall blesse us: Peace shall be within our Walls, &amp; plentie within our palaces.</p>

And thus satisfied I would not that succeeding ages should finde my name amongst those who consented to eradicate Episcopacie. For my part I had rather suffer the censure of the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent then to be thought to consent to that which my conscience approves not.

            <p>I believe the Scripture to bee the sacred Word of God: and what truth I find therein, I conceive it to be <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> My reason, I confesse, is bound, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102691:6"/>
yields in the point of Episcopacie, that it is <hi>Iure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> because I find for it so many <hi>ipse dixit's</hi> in sacred Writ. My judgment also is further strengthned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by Reasons sufficient to settle humane belief.</p>

               </gap>, <hi>Great is the force of truth, and hath prevailed.</hi> To satisfie the World, what reason I have of this my confidence, I leave a Testimony thereof in this my discourse.</p>
            <p>I define <hi>Episcopum Presbyterum cum additamento supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritatis quoad regimen in Ecclesia:</hi> A Bishop to bee a Presbyter, having an addition of superioritie for the government of Gods Church: his charge is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see the Clergie, and their flocks. The word I confesse in a large signification may be taken for a Major of a Citie: for hee is Over-seer thereof: In <hi>Homer</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102691:6"/>
               <hi>Ajex</hi> is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Bishop or Orderer of his Army: But our <hi>Episcopus est Cleri &amp; Gregis in sua Dioecesi,</hi> Is Over-seer of his Clergie, and his flock, bounded within his own Diocesse. Hee is also called <hi>Presbyter</hi> an ancient, and therefore experienced and able to informe and direct.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>inferiour Presbyter</hi> or ancient, and <hi>Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Minister or Servant, they are distinct and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Bishop or superiour Presbyter, both in the New Testament, and in the practice of the first Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turie, and in all Ages even to this day. Let it not stumble any man that the <hi>Apostles</hi> sometimes terme themselves and <hi>Bishops</hi> by the title of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> they call themselves also <hi>Diaconos,</hi> Deacons, in a generall notion.</p>
            <p>Our Presbyterians would have Bishops to be <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores jure divine Praesides jure Ecclesiastico, Principes jure humano &amp; Diabolico,</hi> Pastors by Gods Law, Presidents by Ecclesiasticall Law, Lords by humane and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall law. How faultie this assertion is, let my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Discourse testifie.</p>
            <p>Our Bishop is a Presbyter or ancient Pastour set in eminent superiority over the Clergie and their flocks with a relation to the government of them in matters Ecclesiasticall. And such I say the Apostles instituted, and to them gave a charg how to demean themselves. A perpetuall Succession hereof by practice hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from Christs Apostles to this day.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Ius divinum,</hi> I take that to be of Divine Right which is warranted in sacred Scripture <hi>de cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendis &amp; agendis</hi> in matters to be believed or done.

               </gap> the practice of the Apostles, which never was questioned or excepted against, and is recorded in the canonicall Scripture; hath in it <hi>Ius Divinum,</hi> and shews what is of divine right <hi>defacto.</hi>

               <p>These things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being premised, I proceed to <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> against my Assertion, and <hi>Answere</hi> unto each of them particularly.</p>
               <p>Eminent superiority, &amp; Lordly authority over their people is that which the Lords of the Gentiles may &amp; do challenge &amp; practice, as their due, <hi>Iure human<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> by humane right. Therefore, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by law of things opposite, eminent superiority and Lordly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Clergie &amp; the people of God is that which Bishops ought not to challeng or practice <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> For proofe hereof see <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25. 26. The Princes of the Gentiles <hi>Dominantur,</hi> Lordly rule over them, but you <hi>non sic,</hi> not so, or, it shall not bee so with you. And 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. 3. Feed the flock of the Lord taking the over-sight therof not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready minde, neither as being Lords over Gods He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage.</p>
               <p>To this I answere, that the measure of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> not the matter lies in the word [<hi>sic</hi>] and so is expounded by the words aforegoing, not by constraint, but willingly, not churlishly or covetously, not as though ye were Lords domineering over them, but that yee may be ensamples to the flock. <hi>Non herile aut Regale imperium exercentes, sed</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102691:7"/>
                  <hi>pastorali superioritate, &amp; paterna gubernatione utentes,</hi> Not exercising a masterlike or Kingly command, but using a pastorall superiority and fatherly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And so this rather (as I conceive) confirms superiority and Episcopacy then destroies them. For the word <hi>sic,</hi> so, takes not away the legality, but quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the power given, by saying, let it be used <hi>sic,</hi> so. This I prove to bee the meaning of the Apostle by this argument.</p>
               <p>The practice of the Apostles is not contrary to Christs and their Doctrine, and the sense thereof: But the Apostles did practise eminent superiority, and such lawfull authority as Christ forbids not, over the Clergie and flock, and instituted successors. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their doctrine allowed the same. And so that cannot be meant by the words above, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: <hi>viz.</hi> that there should be a <hi>parity in the Clergie,</hi> and that <hi>Episcopacie</hi> is <hi>Dominium in Clerum,</hi> a Lordly rule over the Clergie, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an usurped authority.</p>
               <p>The successors which they instituted are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Christ, when hee said, I am with you to the end of the world: that is, I am with you, whilst you live, and with successors in your stead governing and teaching the Church to the worlds end. Hence it was that the Apostles ordained Bishops to succeed them, so did the ancient Fathers in the purer times. This course continued ever since.</p>
               <p>The practice of the Apostles was in a superiority above others of the Clergie: and to the Bishops whom they constituted to succeed themselves in place over the Clergie, they gave a superior authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102691:8"/>
neither did they either practise, or ever mention that parity in power, which the presbyteria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s so much endeavour to introduce. And therefore the Apostles never understood the words as these men doe, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should disallow of Bishops in superior au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority above other of the Clergie.</p>
               <p>To make the practice of the Apostles more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I appeale to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who gave to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Episcopall power. To the one in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to the other in <hi>Creet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to cleere this, let us first cleanse the spring head, and then the streames will run cleare down to the after times. I have to his end above defined <hi>Episcopum</hi> a Bishop: if we observe what he is, then shall we evidently see, whether Saint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> did insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute such a calling or no.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Civill Bishops</hi> I speake not: but of <hi>Spirituall.</hi> A <hi>Bishop</hi> of this kind I defined to be <hi>Presbyterum cum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditamento superioritatis quoad regimen in Ecclesia:</hi> he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Clergie and their flocks in spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Bishops of this Kind Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did institute. He made <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus Episcopos Cleri &amp; Gregis quoad regimen in Ecclesia,</hi> Bishops of the Clergie and their flocks, and to have Ecclesiasticall government over them: whereas before they were but Presbyters, or Disciples brought up under him. By this instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were other Presbyters made subordinate to them in governing and teaching the Church. Which to prove I thus argue.</p>
               <p>He that is ordained, and so ordained that hee hath power <hi>Constituere Presbyteres per civitates,</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain presbyters in every City, is greater then those,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102691:8"/>
who have no such power in their Cities or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and those who may correct, what is defective, are superiour to those for whom matters defective are corrected. But <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> had such power given them, and did so correct things defective, and none of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> had the same from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Therefore I conclude undeniably that <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> were superiors as <hi>Bishops</hi> over their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in their severall charges and Divisions, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> in <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they had this power given them by <hi>Paul</hi> appeares 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. Lay hands suddenly on no man. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. For this cause I left thee in <hi>Creet,</hi> that thou shouldst set in order things which are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee. If any other in these Churches could have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Presbyters, why was <hi>Timothy</hi> sent to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> left at <hi>Creet</hi> for this very purpose. And if the <hi>Cretians</hi> and their Presbyters could have set in order things defective, what neede was there that <hi>Tit.</hi> alone should have this commission.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> himselfe, who was accounted no great friend, but rather harsh against Episcopacie, in his Epistle to <hi>Evagrius, pag.</hi> 329. gives us this as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, remarkable betwixt a Presbyter and a Bishop, saying, <hi>Quid facit excepta ordinatione E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus, quod non facit Presbyter?</hi> What doth a Bishop, except the ordaining of others, which a Presbyter doth not? And it is worth the observation that the ancient Father and great Champion for the blessed Trinity <hi>Athanasius</hi> hath in his second Apologie, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Colythus</hi> a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102691:9"/>
had constituted Presbyters, but what became of them? <hi>Rescissa est haec ejus ordinatio, &amp; omnes ab eo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituti in laicorum ordinem redacti fuere,</hi> The ordaining of others by him, was made invalid, and they who were ordained by him, were degraded and made La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks.</p>
               <p>So then you see that Bishops are in this <hi>eminenter superiores Presbyteris,</hi> eminently superior to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having power <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>negative</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and practice of the ancient Fathers. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what the Apostles had taught &amp; practised, and appointed others in place above the ordinary Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to do.</p>
               <p>Now I come to shew a second difference betwixt a Bishop and a Presbyter, and wherein a Bishop hath, <hi>eminentem superioritatem,</hi> a cleere superiority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Presbyter, That is, <hi>excommunication,</hi> and was called <hi>Mucro Episcopalis,</hi> the Episcopall weapon, and was a power given to Bishops successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and was ever practised by them. This appears in that an account of it was and is expected at their hands, as is manifested by the quarel, which our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour had against the <hi>Angell</hi> of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> namely, that he suffered some of his Church who held the doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans;</hi> and against the <hi>Angell</hi> of the Church of <hi>Thyatira, viz.</hi> That hee suffered the woman <hi>Iezabell</hi> to teach and seduce the people. By this it is apparent that Christ expected they should doe, what they had by their places power to doe; namely, that they being Angells of their Churches (whom I affirme to bee also Bishops therof, and successors to the Apostles, as is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102691:9"/>
proved by <hi>the most reverend and learned Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Armach,</hi> and by <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, men in place above others) should <hi>haereticos coercere &amp; ex Ecclesia ejicere,</hi> Keepe under Heretikes and cast them out of the Church.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="objection_and_answer">
               <p>If here it be objected, that wee must<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not argue<note place="margin">Object.</note> from darke and mysticall places of Scripture, such<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as the Apocalypse.

Neither can we here admit of that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that <hi>Angelus</hi> is in this place to bee taken col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively <hi>pro tota Ecclesia,</hi> for the whole Church. For I conceive that there is not a word in the Scripture, but hath its weight: and was it not as easie to have said [<hi>Ecclesiae</hi>] as [<hi>Angelo Ecclesiae</hi>] if [<hi>Angelus</hi>] had not something more in it then [<hi>Ecclesiae.</hi>] And why not <hi>Angelus Ecclesi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> but <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus Ecclesiae,</hi> The Angell the Church, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Church, if it had beene to be taken col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively? But the tearmes be distinct and of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent force, like those, <hi>panis Domini,</hi> the bread of the Lord, and <hi>panis Dominus,</hi> bread representing the Lord.</p>
               <p>Besides, to return to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> they are injoyned to command others <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not to teach other doctrine, and <hi>obturare ora deceptorum, &amp; haereticos rejicere,</hi> to stop the mouthes of deceivers, and to reject Hereticks. These things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, and an account accordingly exspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of the performance thereof: which manifestly proves that every Church had his <hi>Angelum,</hi> who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102691:10"/>
had Episcopall authority and jurisdiction eminent above other inferior Clergie-men: And not many Angels in each of these Churches all of equall authority and place. Or at least the Angell in each of the seven churches was so absolute in his power, that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, chief Governour, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters assistants to him: he a spirituall Justicer and of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> they of the Counsell.</p>
               <p>The difference also of Episcopal authority from that of Presbyters appears, in the cause of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: where there was an appeal to the Synods, which either confirmd them, or dissolved them, but none to the people, none to the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This is confirmed by the ancient <hi>Councill at Nice</hi> Can. 5. and <hi>at Antioch</hi> Can. 6. And <hi>Ierom</hi> himselfe writing to <hi>Riparius</hi> concerning <hi>Vigilantius</hi> an Hereticall Presbyter, is angry that the Bishop under whom he was, did <hi>acquiescere eius furori, &amp; non virga Apostolica, virgaque ferreavas inutile confringere, &amp; tradere ad interitum carnis, ut spiritus salvu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> fiat,</hi> Did quietly give way to his fury, &amp; not rather break in pieces that unprofitable vessell with his Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like staffe and rod of iron, and deliver him up to the destruction of the flesh, that his soul might be saved.</p>
               <p>And it seemes strange to mee that any should think, that our blessed Saviour his Excecutors, Administrators, and assignes knew not the meaning of his will and Testament, as well, as wee in these dayes. Christ who ascending into Heaven gave guifts unto many, would not deny this guift so necessary. Hee, I say, giving supereminent guifts to his Apostles <hi>ad fundandam Ecclesiam,</hi> for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102691:10"/>
his Church, would not deny to their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors those, which were necessary <hi>Ecclesiae fundatae,</hi> to the Church being founded: and so necessary that nothing more concerneth the Church. Would he not, or could he not informe his Trustees how he pleased to have his Church his houshold gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his absence? To say he would not, is deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to his wisdome and goodnesse; to say he could not, to his Almighty and Sovereigne power.</p>
               <p>I therefore conclude these 2. points.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That Ordination of Presbyters was left to <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> as to men of higher place and authority, and not to the Presbyters who were of inferiour degree.</item>
                  <item>2 That the power, given to the Angells of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> and the other Churches, puts a difference of superiority and eminence betwixt a Bishop, and an ordinary Presbyter, and others the teachers of the Churches, and gives them commission <hi>prae caeteris tam Clericis quam Laicis,</hi> above others both Clergie and Laity, yea a coercive and castigative power.</item>

            </div>
            <div type="objection_and_answer">
               <p>Further they object and say. That Episcopacie<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> is not <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> because Christ did not command it in the Gospell.</p>
               <p>To this I answere. That <hi>Ius Divinum aliter se</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                  <hi>habet in rebus credendis, aliter in agendis; aliter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus fidei, aliter in rebus facti,</hi> There is a difference of Divine right betweene matters to bee belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and matters to bee done; betwixt matters of faith, and matters of fact. In matters of faith there must be <hi>textus manifestus, aut convincens deductio,</hi> a cleere text, or a sound consequence. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102691:11"/>
In the beginning God made all things. Here is <hi>textus manifestus.</hi> But there is only <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens deductio,</hi> concerning the mystery of the blessed Trinity: for the Trinity is proved not by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Text, but by convincing deductions out of sacred Scriptures; as thus.</p>
               <p>There came downe at the Baptisme of Christ the Holy Spirit in the form of a Dove, and a voice was heard saying, This is my beloved Son, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am well pleased. Here wee find the Spirit in the form of a Dove: There is heard a voice: And Christ is seene in the water. We know both by the sacred Scriptures and by the light of nature, that there is but one God: and that from one all things are, and that in one they terminate: and that there is <hi>aliud medium copulans primum &amp; ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> one between both coupling the first and the last. Seeing also we reade that there is a Father, a Son, and a Spirit, and that there is but one God, we hence infer by necessary deduction, that there are three persons and but one God. Besides this dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is further confirmed by that place <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, These three are one: which in some sort is <hi>textus manifestus,</hi> a cleere text.</p>
               <p>Now a matter of fact may be inferred to bee <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Divino</hi> (as I suppose) if I prove,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That the same fact was the practice of the Apostles.</item>
                  <item>2 That it is analogical to the institution of the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which was setled according to Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the mediation of Angels, by the Ministery of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </item>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102691:11"/>3 That it is pointed at and insinuated in the New Testament.</item>
                  <item>4 That it hath successively continued since the Apostles time. And as elsewhere, so particularly in <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>If these points can bee proved concerning the fact (<hi>viz.</hi> Government by Bishops) in question, I hope that none will deny it to be <hi>Iure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for proofe and confirmation of my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, That Episcopacie is <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> I will prove these points, and then say something more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the practice of some other Churches.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>the Apostle and Doctor of the Gentils</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the first point.</note>

                  </gap>, teach other Doctrine, and were offensive to the honour of their callings, and to cherish such as did well. These things are evident in the Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and of that to <hi>Titus.</hi> From <hi>Pauls</hi> practice of superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over these two, and from the institution of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to be Bishops, the one of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the other at <hi>Creet,</hi> I prove Episcopacie to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Apostles. To make which good thus I argue.</p>
               <p>If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe practised an eminent su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, and in the Epistles alleadged gave all that power, which of right Bishops challeng, or doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the definition of a Bishop, to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe did not only practise E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie, but did also constitute and institute them Bishops.

Such as the charge is, such is the power: but the tharge is personall, that is, given to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> particularly; and therefore the power and authority given is personall: to them for their time, and to their successors in place after them; and not to them and the Presbytery colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively: nothing in places where such charge is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth intimate the Presbyters or Deacons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing themselves in these Episcopall actions with <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> If they will have these priviledges and performances to belong to their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102691:12"/>
President, they must plead them due to him as he is successor to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> and so hee is in effect (if you give him continuance in his place) a Bishop indeede; the bare name of President can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make him of a different calling from a Bishop, when as he acteth the part of a Bishop in all points by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prescribed. The practice of all times, especially of the first Century warrants not a monethly or yeerly President doing nothing for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, convention, punishment, &amp; reward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advise and consent of a company of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but it allows Bishops superiority to presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Presbyters to Deacons: Yea, it placed Bishops as successors to the Apostles, as were <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> and Presbyters and Deacons subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat to Bishops, as to the Apostles, whilst they lived.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> the next Bishop to <hi>Evodius:</hi> Hee received Episcopall charge from the Apostles: and writing to them at <hi>Antioch,</hi> when hee was carried<note place="margin">Epist. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</note> prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> useth these words to the Laity, <hi>Obsequium praebete Presbyteris &amp; diaconis,</hi> Be yee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to your Presbyters and Deacons, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Presbyters, <hi>pascite gregem apud vos, done<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, to follow their Bishop as Jesus Christ did his Father: and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, as the Apostles.

               <p>In the life time of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> returning from his banishment out of <hi>Patmos,</hi> where he wrote his Revelation, summoned the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Bishops, who are conceived to be those named in the Apocalypse the Angells of the seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and used their ministery for setling and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own Metropolis of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the other Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> as the ancient Greeke Records found in the Library of <hi>Photius</hi> testifie.

               </p>
               <p>So then, by that which hath been said, wee see that Episcopacie is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, warranted by the practice of the Apostles, because that <hi>viventibus,</hi>

                  <hi>videntibus, constituentibus, confirmantibus Apostolis &amp; viris Apostolicis, patribus &amp; Doctoribus testantibus,</hi> The Apostles and Apostolike men being alive, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, appointing it, and confirming it, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; Doctors being eie witnesses thereof, There were these three distinct degrees in the Clergy, Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons.</p>
               <p>Now to the second Point. That <hi>Episcopacie is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The second point.</note> 
                  <hi>analogicall to the institution and constitution of the Church government of the Iewes in the old Testament:</hi> Which <hi>Moses</hi> as a Prince did establish by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the wildernesse, and which continued in force till the veil of the Temple was rent, and the Gentiles became heirs to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to him, were made good to us his heirs by faith and adoption: Because the Iews, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> heirs according to the flesh, by their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault &amp; disobedience forfeited their interest in that conveiance of inheritance, which they claimed from their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> by the evidences regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets. Episcopacie and subordination thereunto, I say, holds Analogie and a kinde of proportion with the Jewish Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For God in it appointed an <hi>High Priest, Priests and Levits</hi> subordinate one to the other, Such is the subordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the three degrees in the Clergie in the new Testament Church. This sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of the Christian Church Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> neere the end of his Epistle to <hi>Evagrius</hi> observes, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> says, <hi>Scimus traditiones Apostolorum sumptas de veteri Testamento. Quod</hi> Aaron <hi>&amp; filii ejus atque Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae in Templo fuere, hoc Episcopi, Presbyteri &amp; Diaconi</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102691:14"/>
                  <hi>sibi vendicant in Ecclesia,</hi> scil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Christiana.</hi> The orders delivered to the Church by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> were taken out of the <hi>old Testament.</hi> The same subordination which was seen in Aaron, <hi>his sons, and the Levits,</hi> now appeares in the Christian Church, in our <hi>Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons.</hi> This proportion is made undenyable by Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> who chargeth some with the gain-saying of <hi>Koreth.</hi> Now there can be no gain-saying like that of <hi>Koreh</hi> in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, except there be distinction &amp; subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of superiours and inferiors in the Clergie, as there was: and was gain-said by <hi>Koreh</hi> and his complices, desirous of superiour honour, and of higher degrees and places, then they had a calling unto. Here then you see that God would have a proportion of Church-government betwixt the Old and New Testament.</p>
               <p>It is further worthy the observation that both the <hi>Church and Common-wealth</hi> of the Jewes had in their government a kind of proportion established by God. For as the Church was <hi>Monarchicall</hi> in Moses, <hi>Aristocraticall</hi> in some select Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits governing under <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Democraticall</hi> in the rest of the Priests and Levits: So was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth <hi>Monarchicall</hi> in <hi>Moses, Aristocraticall</hi> in some select Princes of each Tribe governing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Democraticall</hi> in the rest, and in the whole body of the people. Such is the proportion betwixt our Church and Common-wealth, and such hath it beene from the first foundation. This will, I hope, appeare, when I come to speak of the succession in our Church. And what kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thus sutable to that of the Jews, is in any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102691:14"/>
one Church, may be in all Churches: namely, <hi>all degrees of men</hi> subordinate to their <hi>Princes,</hi> and all the <hi>Princes or Kings</hi> subordinate to <hi>Christ,</hi> without having any King on earth <hi>Head</hi> over the rest: as all <hi>degrees of men</hi> in the Churches were subordinate to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> going to severall and far remote Nations were all equally subordinate to <hi>Christ,</hi> and no one of them Head over the rest.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, seeing the Constitution of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall government is so agreeable to that which was most absolute, and was established by that wisdome, that no other Common-wealth and Church ever was; as one observes, <hi>Dictante Deo, constituente Mose,</hi> God ordaining it, and <hi>Moses</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in practice: Why should wee endeavour to alter it? Such an attempt might prove with us, as it did with the people of <hi>Capua,</hi> when <hi>Pacuvius</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Senators. It is held an axiome among <hi>Architectors,</hi> that it is scarce wisdom to pull down one of the mayne posts of a building, especially so ancient, except another be setled and fixed, which we are sure is right and fitted to our purpose: which yet for all the workmans skill may have a private flaw in it, which cannot be discovered by the most skilfull: and so may the building fall on the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders head.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the analogie and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Episcopacie and the Church government of the Jews.</p>
               <p>Now in the third place wee come to prove <hi>that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third point.</note>

the authority of Ordination, convention, punishment, and reward, put upon some speciall persons, may serve sufficiently to this purpose: yet some thing more <hi>I</hi> will here adde. Bee it so, that when the Apostle saith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>These things being granted, I thus argue.

               <p>I answer. Suppose this be granted, it maketh<note place="margin">Answ.</note> much more for what I intend. For first, if they be <hi>termes of so neere affinity,</hi> that they serve to expresse one and the <hi>same office</hi> in a different regard: then it followeth, that in regard of their affinity, the one may more easily succeed in the other place; for where there is a likenesse of nature, there is <hi>facilior transitus,</hi> an easier change of one thing into another,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102691:16"/>
as of aire into fire, because of their agreement in the quality of heat. Secondly, Seeing the terme of <hi>Apostle</hi> was by those and after-times in some sort <hi>appropriate to some few:</hi> it remayned that the other <hi>term, viz. Bishop,</hi> should be left and turned over <hi>to their successors.</hi> And with respect to this, <hi>Matthias</hi> is expresly said to succeed in <hi>Iudas</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie: and the <hi>chiefe Officers of the Clergie</hi> are termed <hi>Bishops</hi> rather then by any other name. This we read to have beene the constant practice of the first Century, in which (as it is likely) the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Feoffees in trust of our Lord, best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the meaning of the Testatour, and had gifts extraordinary, <hi>ad Ecclesiam &amp; fidem stabiliendam,</hi> as to establish our faith, so Gods Church too, and could best fit right terms to persons and callings.</p>
               <p>But to come close to our selves. This <hi>Isle recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fourth point.</note> 
                  <hi>Christianity very soon, even in the days of</hi> Tiberius, as <hi>Gildas Brito</hi> a grave Authour writeth: who wrote, <hi>Anno</hi> 493. And as another <hi>Gildas</hi> after him confirmeth. This <hi>Gildas</hi> was cald <hi>Albanicus,</hi> and, as some will have it, preceded the other. He testifies, that after the dispersing of the Disciples, by reason of the persecution, <hi>Philip</hi> sent out of <hi>France,</hi> Joseph <hi>of Arimathea,</hi> and divers others, who preached the Gospel in this Kingdome. Their Doctrine (as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesbury</hi> hath it) was afterward confirmed by other Preachers and Doctours here. This is also witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both by <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Theodoret;</hi> not to speake of those, who some of them affirme that <hi>Paul,</hi> some that <hi>Iames,</hi> some that <hi>Peter</hi> were in this Island, and visited the Church here established, as <hi>Baronius</hi> a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102691:17"/>
Romish Writer, and of special note in that Church, hath it. Tis further said, that <hi>Insula glacialis</hi> (which we now call <hi>Glastenbury</hi>) was granted them by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viragus</hi> King of the <hi>Britains.</hi> This is witnessed unto by divers memorable Records alleaged by the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and learned Searchers into the British and Saxon Antiquities.</p>
               <p>As for that report of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> and so often alleaged by divers others, I must either thinke that <hi>Rome</hi> had changed her customes, and many of her Tenents, or question the Truth of the relation: My Reason for this is: because, when in the yeer 601. <hi>Austin the Monk</hi> first required obedience to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church in three things, viz. 1. <hi>in Paschate ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrando,</hi> 2. <hi>in Baptismo ministrando,</hi> 3. <hi>in praedicando Anglis Saxonibus,</hi> In celebrating Easter, in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring Baptisme, in preaching to the English, His motion was refused, and <hi>Austin</hi> utterly disliked. <hi>Quia</hi> (to use the words of another) Augustini <hi>fastum spernebant,</hi> they disliked <hi>Austins</hi> pride. And well they might, for he was haughty and harsh, and did contrary to his directions from <hi>Gregory Bishop of Rome,</hi> who sent him hither. For he incensed <hi>Edle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> so against the poore Christians of <hi>Bangor,</hi> that he put twelve hundred of them to the sword. Of this the Reason is given: <hi>Quia noluere obsequium</hi> Augustino <hi>praebere,</hi> because they would not submit to <hi>Austins</hi> will. For this was indeed the quarrell, as our Writers say. This their refusall to yield to Austin <hi>the Monke,</hi> I produce as a proofe, that the Christians, which hee found here, held in many
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102691:17"/>
things with the <hi>Eastern Churches,</hi> as having their doctrine from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> whence <hi>the Gospel was to be sent,</hi> Esay 2. 3.

So likewise the Doctrine of salvation: for Christ, who gave the Apostles Commission to <hi>go to all Nations, and preach to them the Gospel,</hi> did bid them <hi>stay at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>till the Holy Ghost furnished them with guifts for the worke commanded.</hi> This further appeares by that resolute answere, which the <hi>Abbot of Bangor</hi> gave to <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, <hi>Anno</hi> 601. <hi>viz.</hi> That he and his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no Superioritie in the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> over them, nor any Superiour but their own <hi>Archbishop Caer-leonis,</hi> or (as some have it) <hi>Senovensis, qui sub Deo solus positus fuit super illos ad supervidendum, &amp; ad faciendum illos servare viam spiritualem,</hi> Who alone under God was made an Over-seer or Bishop to them, that hee might make them observe the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall way. Seeing this stout Champion thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, it is probable that they were of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive institution. And this I the rather give credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; because if the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had then held the present Tenet of that Church: <hi>That their Citie is the spirituall Metropolis, and that their Bishop is</hi> Caput Ecclesiae, <hi>our Predecessours would have acknowledged the Pope and his See, as they had been taught.</hi> But <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> saith, that our British Bishops are as ancient as those of <hi>Rome.</hi> And tis probable they were so.</p>
               <p>For this we have good proof; that at a Council at <hi>Arles</hi> held <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 314. wee had three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Eborius <hi>de Civitate</hi> Eboraci <hi>Episcopus,</hi> 2. <hi>Restitutus de civitate</hi> Londini <hi>Episcopus,</hi> 3. Aldelfius <hi>de civitate</hi> Coloniae Londinensium, <hi>&amp; exinde Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102691:18"/>
                  <hi>Presbyter,</hi> Arminius <hi>Diaconus, Eborius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Yorke, Restitutus</hi> Bishop of <hi>London, Adelfius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Colchester,</hi> and after them <hi>Sacerdos</hi> a Presbyter, <hi>Arminius</hi> a Deacon. These subscribed in this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Here therefore I observe, that <hi>Anno</hi> 314. wee had <hi>Bishops, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> the very Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours now in question. And Romish they were not, as I conceive: because they then acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not a Subordination to <hi>Rome:</hi> and because <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the second called learned <hi>Anselme, Patriarcha Britaniae,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Britaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, me thinks, it should not now be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, whether Episcopacy be a Romish Relicke, but rather, that it should be confirmed as an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Ordinance, and as ancient, as the first institution of Churches, and as a calling appointed by the Apostles.</hi> What more have we for <hi>Baptisme of Infants?</hi> What more for our <hi>Sunday,</hi> or <hi>the Lords day,</hi> but convincing deductions from the Scriptures, or the practice of the Apostles, and the observation of the same in the Churches of God successively to this very day? yet wee hold both these to be sacred Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and of divine institution: though they both be questioned by some learned men of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, as Episcopacie is among some of ours. The case is alike, and as cleere, if not much more, for Episcopacie: that it had a divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>If what is formerly said, satisfie not, I will only use this argument more, to prove that Episcopacie is <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> If the charge given 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 14. be <hi>to</hi> Timothy <hi>personally, and be perpetuall,</hi> then it is to one person, namely to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102691:18"/>
in his place: For <hi>Timothy</hi> was mortall, so that the perpetuitie of the charge must reach to all his successors, till the appearing of the <hi>Lord Christ Iesus.</hi> But the charge is personall to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall even to the appearing of our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Therefore it is to one person, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and to his successors for ever.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="objection_and_answer">
               <p>If it be here objected, that the charge there was<note place="margin">Object.</note> given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as elswhere <hi>the Keyes to</hi> PETER, and according to that, which is said, <hi>Quod dixit</hi> Petro, <hi>dixit caeteris Apostolis,</hi> What was spoken to <hi>Peter,</hi> was spoken to the other Apostles also: I<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Answer, It is so. For what was said to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was said <hi>caeterisque Episcopis &amp; successoribus eorum,</hi> both to other Bishops, and their successors: as Christs giving <hi>the keys to</hi> Peter were to him and the <hi>other Apostles:</hi> But not to all the Disciples, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and widdowes.</p>
               <p>To summe up all in a word; since it appeares that <hi>Episcopacie, Presbytery and Diaconatus</hi> are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practice of the Apostles <hi>analogicall</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to the constitution of the Jewish Church appointed by God, and established by <hi>Moses;</hi> pointed at, and in some kinde deciphered in the New Testament; and strongly insinuated by the successors of the Apostles, to have beene received and practised by them, as commended to them from divine authority: since these three orders in our Church are <hi>derived so high, have continued so long,</hi> even from the primitive times to this day: we may well conclude, that as Presbyters and Deacons, so Bishops are <hi>Iure divino:</hi> especially seeing Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie is so generally confirmed, and hath beene so
<pb facs="tcp:102691:19"/>
constantly continued by the <hi>Apostles, Apostolick men, Councills, Fathers, and Doctors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And much the rather am I induced thus, as I have said, to judge of Episcopacie: because the contrary part have not the like proofes, warrant, and approbation for their Presbytery; and can bring no sufficient and convincing authority for a quarterly or yeerely President, joynt Presbyters and Lay Elders usurping pastorall and Episcopall jurisdiction. And here in confidence of my cause I adde, that if they have any lawfull generall Councill, or any Synod (except their own) which established a Church Government by such a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Presbyters, and Lay-elders, as above, I will yeeld the cause.</p>
               <p>Now it concerns us very much to be well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and truly to judge of these matters; because it appeares in that dangerous and seditious <hi>Pamphlet</hi> concerning the <hi>late Protestation,</hi> that the Author therof, and such as he is, care not what government be established, so that <hi>Popery</hi> (which we wish more rightly then they) be abolished, <hi>Episcopacie and the present government</hi> (which change how inconvenient it may be, they know not) be altered, and that they may have <hi>liberty and toleration</hi> (which what state wil permit) to professe what manner of Religion they make choise of.</p>
               <p>So may we have as many religions, as there be at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and unpeople all our plantations by calling many phantasticall schismaticks home, who under colour of dislike of the Church Government here, have fallen out with our Religion, and framed to themselves divers opinions, if not Religions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:102691:19"/>
to ours, not only in forme, but in reality.</p>
               <p>Seeing there is but <hi>one Lord, one faith, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, one God and father of all, let us indevour to keepe the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: that there may be one body and one spirit, even as we are called in one hope of our calling, Eph.</hi> 4. Let us stick fast to that <hi>one truth,</hi> which wee are taught, and be stedfast in <hi>one faith:</hi> and agree joyntly <hi>with one accord,</hi> like children of <hi>one Father</hi> and <hi>Mother.</hi> Let us not lose the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Church Government, but reforme the personall errours. And since reformation signifies nothing else, but the reducing and setting matters into the forme in which they were most perfect: let us constantly hold our-selves to the forme kept and practised in the Primitive times, and in the first &amp; second Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turies. In which we shal find the <hi>Order Episcopall, Presbyteriall, and Diaconall</hi> observed, and ever since confirmed by <hi>Nationall Synods</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> of our own, neere 1400 yeeres agoe, or at least 1000, and practised by many Successions before and since. What then remayneth, but that wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish the present Government of our Church, which is so agreeable to the ancient Constitution?</p>
               <p>As for that which is alleaged by Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> in his Dialogue against the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> concerning those things which were rather <hi>in honorem sacerdotii, quam legis necessitate, gratia Principum &amp; Conciliorum authoritate data &amp; collata,</hi> for the honour of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, then the necessity of any Law, given and bestowed by the bounty of Princes, and authoritie of Councils; I say for these things, I take them not to be <hi>Iure divino,</hi> though <hi>Deo data:</hi> I know that God is to be honoured with our substance, and that it is as lawfull since Christs time to vow or
<pb facs="tcp:102691:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give to him, according as he blesseth out labours and meanes, as it was for <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> and their worthies; and how offensive it may be to him to alter what is given or vowed, as it was of old to change and give a bad lamb for a good, I leave to the grave consideration of others. Only I here wish that we may <hi>save the honour of our deare and aged Mother;</hi> and punish her sons, if any have dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her by Pride, Tyranny, or Covetousnesse: and that the <hi>Church and Common-wealth</hi> may hold such correspondencie, as they did in the daies of <hi>David and Solomon:</hi> and that as Kings were <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Fathers, and Queenes Nursing Mothers</hi> to the Church in her infancie; so in her age shee may find Kings to support her, if weake: and if any of her children be like those of <hi>Elies,</hi> their fathers may correct them so, that their Mother be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured nor ruined.</p>
               <p>To say no more, I conclude with that of Saint <hi>Augustine, Siquid tota Ecclesia hodie per orbem fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentat, hoc quin ita sit faciendum, disputare insolentis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simae est insaniae,</hi> If any thing at this day be of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent use in the whole Church, to question and dispute whether it ought so to be is a most insolent madnesse. <hi>Epist.</hi> 118. And that it is Aerianisme to say, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> (in the common accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) are equall to <hi>Bishops,</hi> such namely as were suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the Apostles, and such as Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> himselfe was. This <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reckons among the ancient Heresies, and time hath not bettered it: and whether it resembles and comes neere to the Antilogie of <hi>Koreh,</hi> or not, my self not being rigid, or prone to censure, I leave to be determined by others.</p>
