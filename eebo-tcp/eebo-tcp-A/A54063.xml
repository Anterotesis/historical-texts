         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>SEveral things hath the Life, begotten by the Eternal vertue, breathed in me towards my Father for, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both to my ſelf and others, from my Childhood. As touching my ſelf, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that I might be a Veſſel for Him, that I might be freed from the bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and brought forth in the Image of his Life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that I might be filled with his Life, that I might be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the preſence and with the fulneſs of the Spring of my Life: even that I might have enough of my God in my heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that he would of his own meer goodneſs both preſerve the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and dwell in it for ever: that ſo my Tenure and Poſſeſſion of him, and fitneſs for him might be of his Grace, of his Love, of his good Will, of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, depending wholly and altogether on him, and not at all on any thing that can
<pb facs="tcp:45705:3"/>
be expected from the Creature-hood in its pureſt State. And likewiſe, that if he pleaſed to uſe me in any ſervice, it might be of him, and for him, and to him: that he would bring me ſo low in my ſelf, that I might not be able to detain any of his Glory and vertue from him, but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Veſſel might ſtill ſo appear to me, and alſo be ſo ſenſibly diſcerned and acknowledged by all other eyes alſo, that the Excellency of the Power and of the Glory might run back entirely into his pure Boſom.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there have been Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſires in me concerning others alſo. <hi>Firſt,</hi> towards Mankind in general, that they might have an exceeding merciful and powerful day of Viſitation, even that the whole Earth might be touched with the Power of Life and drawn out of the Darkneſs. O how hath my Soul breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for poor loſt mankind, and how hath my Spirit travelled (with unutterable pangs and earneſtneſs) for unheard of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, and altogether unexpected
<pb facs="tcp:45705:3"/>
mercy and good will towards the Sons of Men in general! <hi>Secondly,</hi> towards my Brethren in Spirit, that they might know the day of Redemption and Power in Spirit, and not alwayes lie groveling on the Earth, and groaning and mourning becauſe of the Luſts and Corruptions, but might know Deliverance in Power, and might ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Song of the <hi>Lamb</hi> (becauſe of their feeling Victory over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Dragon) and might ſerve and worſhip the living God in Spirit and Truth, without fear of interruption, and Captivity from the Enemy any more. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> towards the Jews after the Fleſh, that their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity might be blotted out, their wound healed, the pure Eye opened in them, and the pure Glory revealed to them: that they might know the Shepherd of Iſrael in Spirit, the Spiritual Tents of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Beauty of the Footſteps of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Flock, and might Travel out of their Darkneſs, Earthlineſs and litteral Knowledge into the Land of pure Life,
<pb facs="tcp:45705:4"/>
Reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peace and freſh Joy in the living God (whereof their Land of Canaan, with all the good things thereof, was but a ſhadow) and might be Annointed with the freſh oyl of the Salvation of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and might become indeed an holy Nation, yea, a Kingdom of Prieſts to offer up Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifices on God's ſpiritual Altar.</p>
            <p>My Soul ſtill breatheth to the Lord, and waiteth on him, for all theſe things: and as he draweth my Spirit forth, ſo am I ready in Spirit to be ſerviceable unto him therein. Theſe preſent drawings and openings of my Life, in the <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> following, are both towards the Jews in Fleſh, and alſo the Jews in Spirit; that they may meet in one, even in the One Path and Paſture of life, where there is one Shepherd, one Seed, one Flock, one Spirit, one Beginning, one Progreſs, one End in one and the ſame Circle of Life. The Lord my God take it into his own Hand, diſpoſe of it for good, Mannage and Bleſs it according to his Pleaſure.</p>

            <head>Some QUESTIONS and ANSWERS for the opening of the eyes of the Jews natural, that they may ſee the Hope of ISRAEL, which hath ſo long been hid from them.</head>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>WHat was the Riſe of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Jewes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They came of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> after the Fleſh, who was God's Friend, whom God took from his Father's Houſe and from his Native Country (where he was worſhipping and ſerving Idols) to be the Stock and Pattern of the Faithful, both of the Jews according to the Fleſh, and of the Jews in Spirit. Of this Root, of this Stock came this People according to the Fleſh, who were an Holy Nation, a Circumciſed People, a Sanctified People outwardly: and (as long as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45705:5"/>
their day laſted) were the Beloved of God, the Pitied, the Pardoned, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Ones, even until the Shadows were finiſhed, and the Seaſon came, for the Subſtance to appear and be ſet up in the World; whereof they had the firſt offer alſo, and out of whom was the firſt gathering for the Spiritual building. But they generally harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts, and cleaving to the Wiſdom and Knowledge which their wiſe Ones had taught them (from their miſ-underſtanding the Letter of the Scriptures) miſſed of the Spirit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt the Redeeming Power, and ſo loſt their ſhare in the Inward Glory, and by God's Righteous hand were cut off from their outward alſo, their day being ſpent, and the Blood not onely of the Prophets, but of the Son and Heir himſelf alſo required at their hands.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How came this People to be the choſen People at firſt, and ſo long to continue ſuch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45705:5"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was not for their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, not for their Lovelineſs, or plyableneſs to God above other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but becauſe it pleaſed the Lord freely to love them, and to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for the People of his Choice after the Fleſh, in the free Covenant which he made with <hi>Abraham. The Earth is the Lord's with the fulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> and he may chuſe whom he will to fill with his Inward and Spiritual Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (even with the manifeſtations of his pure Love, Life and Preſence) and he may alſo chuſe whom he will to make outwardly or typically Beloved, Great and Glorious. He choſe <hi>Abraham</hi> freely, he gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> an Heart to follow him, he gave him the Faith and Obedience which made him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him: and he choſe his Seed after the Spirit to be his Eternal Heir, and his Seed after the Fleſh to be his Temporary Heir. Thus of <hi>Iſaac</hi> in Spirit came the Children of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45705:6"/>
Promiſe in Spirit, and of <hi>Iſaac</hi> after the Fleſh came the Seed of Promiſe after the Fleſh. <hi>Sarah</hi> after the Fleſh bare one of theſe, the <hi>Sarah</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by her (or the Free Woman which is from above) bare the other. And of <hi>Iſaac</hi> comes <hi>Jacob,</hi> Worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſerves for his Wife, who flies from the face of <hi>Eſau,</hi> yet afterwards finds fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in his Eyes: from this Worm do the Twelve Patriarks branch forth, who were the Heads of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thus hath it been with that Nation according to the letter; &amp; thus it hath alſo been and is ſtill inwardly in Spirit, as the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, the Jews in Spirit (who are Learned in the Law of the Spirit of Life) can very well read. Thus outwardly <hi>Iſrael</hi> was God's Child, <hi>Ephraim</hi> his Dear, his Beloved, his pleaſant Son; <hi>Judah</hi> his Praiſe, whom his heart was towards, and to whom he ſtretched forth his Arm of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45705:6"/>
Salvation all the day long. <hi>In all their Affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them: and he ſaid, Surely they are my People, Children that will not lie, ſo he became their Saviour.</hi> Thus it was with them till the day of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh expired, and the day of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Spirit was to ſucceed in the ſight of the World.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What was the end for which God choſe that People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was to be a Veſſel for him to form, to try and experiment what his Love could bring them to, and bring forth in them in that way of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and Operation. This God opens to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> concerning them, bidding him go down to the houſe of the Potter, where, in a Parable, they might read their own State, and what they were to expect from God, even to be formed by God unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, untill he had made a perfect try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of them, and then to be broken and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45705:7"/>
laid aſide, as a Veſſel that could never be fitted for the Maſter's uſe in this way of Diſpenſation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.4. On the Lord's part there was no defect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Child, his Spouſe, his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, his Garden of pleaſant Plants (as this People was in that Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:) for he was ſtill a Father to them, Faithful in Covenant, Tender in Bowels, abundant in Loving Kindneſs and Mercies: Yea what could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Lord towards a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to that Diſpenſation, which the Lord failed in? But they were ſtill faithleſs, continually break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, Erring from his Dear and tender Love, and drawing down the ſtrokes of his Wrath upon them, forſaking the guide of their youth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Love of their Eſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Man was made a Veſſel of Light, a Veſſel of Life, a Veſſel of pure Freedom. He was formed in the Eternal Image, and had a pure being in that Image. He was Light in the Lord, living in the Lord, free unto all Good, and from all Evil in the Lord. This was the ſtate of his being at firſt, and thus was he made in the Image a pure reſemblance of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Purity and Bleſſedneſs: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this he had the Eternal Life, the Eternal Subſtance, the Eternal Purity it ſelf dwelling in the Veſſel, ſhining in it, and manifeſting it ſelf from it according to its pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How came man to fall from this Eſtate?</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not willingly, not of an inclination of his own, but he was deceived, through the ſubtilty of Temptation, to entertain a deſire of enlarging his bleſſedneſs, out of the limits of the will of his Creator.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How could ſuch a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enter man, he being Pure and Holy, inclined to Good and againſt Evil, after the Image of his Creator?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Man was not made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a Perfection in himſelf ſeparate from his Creator, or to live of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but by dependance. Now though he had no inclination in him not to depend, or to ſeek a Life in himſelf out of the Fountain, yet there was a Capacity of ſo doing: before which Capacity the Tempter laid his bait of advancing him to a greater Wiſdom, Glory and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, than his Creator had placed him in; with which he conſulting out of the dependance upon his Creator, fell from that which alone
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45705:22"/>
was able to uphold him in the pure ſtate, wherein he was made. Thus was he taken in the ſnare of miſery and brought to that loſs, which all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> lie groveling under to this day, when the Lord at any time awakens the ſence thereof in them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What was the State of man in and ſince the fall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A ſtate of Darkneſs, a ſtate of Death, a ſtate of deep Captivity, wherein his Soul, Body and Spirit are become dark as to the Light of God, dead as to the Life of Righteouſneſs, and Captive unto that ſpirit which hath entred them by their hearkning thereto, who dwelleth and ruleth in them in the Darkneſs, as God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Light.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How is man dark? how is man dead? is his Soul or body dead as to their being? or how elſe is it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Man is not dead as to his being either in Soul or Body, but as to the right, pure and ſanctified ſtate

of each. The Veſſels ſtill remain the ſame in being, but they are emptied of their proper Liquor, and filled with other Wine. The Underſtanding is the ſame, the Reaſon the ſame, the Will the ſame, the Memory the ſame, the bodily Members the ſame as to their being or matter: but they are all otherwiſe leavened, and another King now dwells in them and Reigns over them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then there needs not any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of man's Reaſon, or bringing it to nothing, in relation to man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but onely a changing of the Leaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Man is become another thing by degeneration from the Life. He is ſo poiſoned by Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that he is to be wholly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down and brought to nothing, even in the very Naturals, that he may be new made and built up in the newneſs of the Spirit. Thus he is to become as a Fool, as a little Child, or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45705:23"/>
rather as a Seed to be caſt into the womb of Life, there to be formed and born of the Spirit. And as he ſprings up in the Life, he is to forget his own Country, living in the Spirit and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Spirit: where watching to the Spirit, and againſt his own Reaſon in the pure Childiſheſs, in the ſimple inſtinct and naturalneſs of the Life, he ſhall at length find a Reaſon new formed and ſpringing up in him, which waiting on the Lord in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſubjection, ſhall be taken into Unity with the Life: but if the Eye of Reaſon open too faſt, and be not kept down to the Light of Life, the Betrayer will enter again at that door, and bring the Soul into Death, after it hath had ſweet and Precious Taſts of the Redeeming Vertue and Power.</p>
            <p>Queſt, <hi>Can Man in the fall ſee his fallen Eſtate, and ſo ſeek after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery out of it?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not poſſible for him
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45705:24"/>
ſo to do, without ſome Light ſhining upon him from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. How can Darkneſs diſcover Darkneſs? That which maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifeſt the Darkneſs is Light. When the Veſſel is dark, and the Prince of Darkneſs filleth it and dwelleth in it, what can that Eye ſee but according to the Darkneſs, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil Good and Good Evil, bitter ſweet and ſweet bitter?</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But there is no man but hath ſome Light, no man but at ſome time or other ſeeth Good or Evil in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ariſeth not from the light of Man's Nature, as it now ſtands in the fall (which being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Enemie's hands, and being it ſelf become darkneſs, cannot at all give man notice of or light him out of the darkneſs) but from a freſh Viſitation of the Life, which giveth all men a day of Viſitation by the ſhining of its Light, wherein is ſome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45705:24"/>
manifeſtation to man, and ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſight by him both of the Good and of the Evil: and not onely ſo, but there is alſo the living Spirit ſtriving with him, and attracting him from the one to the other, according to the Lord's good pleaſure, whoſe is both the Light, and alſo the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the proportion of every man's Viſitation by it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But hath not man naturally a Light in the fallen Eſtate, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth unto him Good and Evil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not a true Light, not a true Diſcovery, but onely ſomewhat which the Enemy ſetteth up in man as ſuch, to keep him in the entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Deceit, and out of the ſuſpition of it. For the Enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into him, by his ſubtilty blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and deceiveth his Eye (that he may the better hold him Captive in the deceit) inſomuch as he diſcerneth not the falſe Image which the Enemy hath ſtamped upon him: for though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45705:25"/>
the Enemy bringeth man into a ſtate of real Darkneſs, Death and Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; yet theſe do not at preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to man what they are, but are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured or Painted to appear what they are not, the better to deceive, bewitch and entangle man therein. The Enemy did not repreſent Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in its Black hue, Death and Captivity in its dreadful Appearance to <hi>Adam</hi>; but as Wiſdom, as Light, as a better Life, as a greater Freedom. And thus he ſtill enters man, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner he ſtill dwells in man, until the true Light purſue him, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcovering his Deceit, and drawing man back from this falſe Paradiſe of pleaſure in wiſdom and liberty out of the Life, into a ſence of his want of, and breathings after the true Garden of the living God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is man then miſtaken in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Good and Evil ſince the fall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, altogether: and by this means doth he ſo pleaſingly ſcituate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45705:25"/>
himſelf, and take up his Habitation in the Kingdom of Darkneſs, wherein are ſtrong holds and wiſe reaſonings againſt the true God, and for the falſe Appearances of good, which the Enemy of the Soul ſtrongly makes men believe to be ſuch as he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them for, in the darkneſs. Thus in particular perſons, and alſo in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties evil is purſued after, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced for good, and the true good ſuppreſſed as evil, through the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Myſtery of Darkneſs in mens hearts.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What then is the proper E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Condition of man in the fall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A State of falſe light, of falſe life, of falſe liberty. He ſeemeth to himſelf advanced in Wiſdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the low, empty, naked Eſtate of Innocency, which is nothing and hath nothing, but by a continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the Goodneſs of the Creator. He ſeemeth alſo advanced

in Life, advanced in Liberty. He can ſpeak his own words, think his own thoughts, do his own will, ſeek himſelf, pleaſe himſelf, ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The life of Righteouſneſs is a yoak, a bond in his Eye: He is free from the reſtraint of it. He hath Life in himſelf, and is exceeding wiſe in the compaſs of his own dominions. Thus doth the Enemy transform the Kingdom of Darkneſs and Death, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fallen Man a ſhare with him in it, while he remains his willing Subject. And here the Goods of the Enemy, the Heart eſtranged from God, yea, not onely the devout and zealous Worſhipper in invented Forms, but alſo the groſs Sinner, the envious, luſtful and wicked Mind, the perverſe Tongue, the bloody Hands and Feet are at peace, and have joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their courſe and circuit in the Earth. But all this is but the Deceit of the Enemy, wherewith he hath
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45705:26"/>

nigh to watch over and ſupport Worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> yea nigh to revive life and ſpirit in him freely, and to heal his backſlidings and multiply par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, or it could never be. Yea, the Creature can never be brought ſo low or ſo far loſt, but there is ſtill help in the nature of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, though there may not be help in any revealed Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth God exerciſe the heart that is turned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In Faith and Obedience through very great varieties and changes of conditions. He exerciſeth it in believing his voyce, and in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voyce and following him, in what ever and into whatſoever he draws and requires.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How is the Voyce of God known? Doth not the Enemy ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly alſo, and reſemble his voyce? how then is the voyce of the Redeemer diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from him, who counterfeiteth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45705:29"/>
the Shepherd and his voyce?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> By theſe two means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Soul lying low, out of the Wiſdom in which the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears and forms his likeneſſes, in the Simplicity which the Lord hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, the Life opens to it, and the true Light appears, which manifeſts the falſe light and falſe appearances of the Deceiver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that which is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God there is not an haſtineſs or ſuddenneſs to determine, but a ſilent waiting on the Lord in Subjection, till the Life ſpeak and make things manifeſt. Thus the knowledge and light of the Child is held in the will of the Father, and received from his hand and according to his pleaſure. Thus what he will he hides, and what he will he makes manifeſt, and the Child which is born of his will is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his will; and lying down there, it keeps out of the Enemie's
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45705:29"/>
Territories, and out of the reach of his Temptations.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the ſeveral Eſtates or Conditions, wherein God exerciſeth the Spirit of man in Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The particular Eſtates and Conditions are innumerable, but they may be referred to theſe three general heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> An Eſtate of breaking down the former Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Eſtate of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation or Preparation to be New-built. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Eſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building. God doth not forget, but exerciſe his People in <hi>Egypt,</hi> even while they are in Bondage, before they come to receive his Law: he is viſiting them in the dark Land, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eye that can ſee the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cauſing groans and ſighs in their oppreſſed Spirits; and then holding forth to them the Promiſe, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them for a departure from that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45705:30"/>
Land. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath a time of ſtripping them, of Nurturing and bringing them up under his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and cloſe exerciſes, wherein they are Deſolate and ready to Sin and periſh every moment, but as they are wonderfully provided for and abundantly helped and Pardoned. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a ſtate of rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stones, when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared therefore, into a New-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Life to dwell in, and for their entrance into the Land of Life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Declare theſe Eſtates and the exerciſes therein more plainly, and firſt ſhew what is the Eſtate of the</hi> Soul <hi>in</hi> Egypt <hi>Spiritually, when the Lord viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it there with his Light?</hi>

The Soul then ſees its Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45705:30"/>
from the Life, and finds a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Death and Corruption raiſed up in it, in which the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells and bears rule: and then O how it groans and longs after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from that Land, and waits for the Promiſe of Redemption out of it! but yet it is ſtill left in the hand of the Enemy, and dayly feels the bitter Bondage, from the Powerfull Law of Sin and Death ſpringing up in the heart, and iſſuing out through the Members.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How is Faith and Obedience here exerciſed?</hi>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Eſtate of the Wilderneſs Spiritually?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is an Eſtate of waiting for the guidance of the leader, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving direction and Laws from the leader, of following the leader as he pleaſeth to lead, through the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements, Temptations, Straits and Neceſſities, which he ſeeth fit to exerciſe the Spirit with, for the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of that which is not to inherit, and for preparing the Heir for the Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How is Faith and Obedience here exerciſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In waiting on the Light for the leadings in the Law of Life, and then in ſubjecting to the leader, being content with all his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein: with the time he chuſeth for ſtanding ſtill, and with the time he chuſeth for Travelling on, with the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45705:31"/>
Proportion of Light and leading that he judgeth fit, with the food and cloathing which he prepares and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, with the Enemies which he ſees fit to have avoided or encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with. Hereby the own Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the own will, the own Strength, the own Deſires, the own Delights, with all the murmurings, wearineſs and diſcontents, which ariſe from the earthly part, are by degrees worn out, and a pure Veſſel prepared for the pure Birth to ſpring up and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A State of Regenerating or renewing in the Life and pure Image, where the building is reared up which is made without hands, where there is a ſweet and peaceable growth in the Life, and a freſh and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory enjoyment of the Life.</p>

as the Soul may in part, or in ſome reſpect (to his own underſtanding) be in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in part in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in part in the reſt, Life and Peace. But theſe things are not to be curiouſly ſought into, leſt a wrong Wiſdom and Knowledge get up; but abiding low and little in the little Seed, the Kingdom and everlaſting Inheritance grows dayly in the Soul, and the Soul dayly ſhoots up into it and is enlarged in it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there any return back into</hi> Egypt <hi>or into the Wilderneſs, after the State of the Soul is advanced higher, the entrance into the everlaſting Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being adminiſtred, and the Soul partly taken into and having found a place of reſt in the Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Enemy lies near to deceive: and while he hath Power to tempt, if there be an hearkening to his Temptations, there is a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the pure Life, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45705:33"/>
of the Captivity or bewildering in ſome meaſure. In the Faith and in the Obedience to the Light of Life is the preſervation, out of it is Death and Deſtruction Eternally.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not the pure being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by Death and Deſtruction? and ſhall not the Creature, when it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed into him, be as he is?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The pure being cannot be impure, evil cannot enter upon him, it hath no place in him, his nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it: nor can it enter into the Principle of Life that comes from him, and is always preſerved by him: nor can it enter upon that man, who is begotten of that Principle, abideth with it and is preſerved in it. But ſo to be in him, as to abide and not go forth is a great State, even higher then the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> knew.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Good and Evil all alike to God? &amp; ſhall they not be ſo alſo to him, who is in

perfect Unity and Fellowſhip with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Good and Evil which can iſſue from the Creature, cannot reach God's being as it is in it ſelf, but only ſo far as he hath pleaſed to expoſe his Life (in the various manifeſtations thereof) to be reached thereby. Yet his Eye ſeeth the Evil and the Good, the Perfection &amp; the Imperfection, and his Nature is perfectly excluded from all Evil and Imperfection; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he cannot poſſibly lie or deceive, or be unrighteous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful in any of his Diſpenſations: and that which is gathered into him, is thus one with him. But that which can do any thing which is ſinful and evil in it ſelf, is not in the true Unity with the Eternal Being, but in the deceit of that Spirit which Erreth from him, and centereth the creature in the imagined likeneſs of his Life and Happineſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By opening a larger Eye in them, than is given them in the Life to ſee with. The Eye of Life is limited in man, and man is to be held within the limits and openings of Life, and his Heart and Mind to be bounded within the Deſires and Delights, which ariſe from the Life: he is to wait on the Life for its living, moving and being all in his Being: and here he ſhall be large enough, and full enough, and wiſe enough, and happy enough. But there is ſomewhat which preſents to him a Kingdom, a Riches, a Dominion, a Vaſtneſs of Perfection in himſelf &amp; at his own command; the which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to liſten unto, the ſame opens

an Eye in him to ſee the Beauty and Glory thereof, and then Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his heart is taken, and he cannot avoid the ſnare: nor can he hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know where he is, until that which he hath forſaken, again pleaſe to viſit him, and to diſcover to him his Iniquity and Errour from the true Root.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the way of ſafety, when God enlargeth the Territories of Life in the Soul, and cauſeth his Love and Grace to abound?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To Drink the Draughts of Joy and Sweetneſs in the pure Fear and Trembling, not departing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from in what ever it doth for God or receives from him, till the Salvation be wholly wrought out and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Habitation of unſpotted Love prepared, and the Soul led into, and ſeated in its compleat Manſion therein.

of Life, though the Principle from whence the Fear ſprang, and the Birth and building (which was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, raiſed up, formed and perfected in the Fear) abideth for ever. So that the pure Love doth not caſt out the pure Fear (wherein is no Bondage of the Life, but the preſervation of the Life from the Bondage) but ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it up and comprehends it: for the pure Fear is but Love deſcended, and the pure Love is but Fear aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Eternal Principle or Subſtance being one and the ſame in both.</p>

from the Land of Death and Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and longing after the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power and Vertue of the Life, the Enemy (the Power of Darkneſs) layes load upon him, drawing him more and more under the Chains and Bonds of Iniquity to the utmoſt of its ſtrength. So that now Luſts abound, Evils increaſe, Temptations and Snares multiply; and in the Land of Captivity their ſtrength is great, the Soul weak and faint, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Power and Vertue ſeems very far off.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They bring into a meek, merciful and Tender-hearted frame to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others.</hi> He that is tempted, he that often falls, and is ſo often woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made miſerable, he pitties thoſe that err, he mourns over the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. His heart is broken with the Sins and Afflictions of others, and he knoweth not how to be hard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, feeling ſuch continual need of abundant mercy himſelf. It is the rich man, the ſound man in Religion, that is rough and hard: but he that is once throughly melted in the Furnace and made up again, is made up Tender, and retaineth the impreſſion of the Meekneſs, Love and Mercy for ever. Now a broken Eſtate in Religion, or a ſtate of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45705:40"/>
for the Life is much more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than that which is rich and full by what it had formerly received and ſtill holdeth, out of the Immediate feeling and freſh Vertue of the Life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>They bring into an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirſty ſtate after Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</hi> O how the Soul, that is ſenſible of its filth, longeth to be waſhed! how it panteth after the Paſtures of Life, the food of Life, the living Waters: to appear before and enjoy God in the Land of the living! O how doth the heart, that is dayly afflicted with its Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and Diſobedience, long for the Faith that ſtands in the Power, and the Obedience that flowes from the Power! <hi>O Teach me thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, ſhew me the pure Path of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the way of Life, guide my feet in the way everlaſting: O write thy Fear in my Heart, that I may not depart from thee: Create a clean heart in me, and put thy Spirit within me to be my ſtrength.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45705:40"/>
O continue thy Loving-kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy Righteouſneſs to the upright in Heart.</hi> O what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable Breathings dayly iſſue out from the broken Spirit, towards the Spring of its Life!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>They bring into a pure frame,</hi> into a cleanneſs of inſide. <hi>Cleanſe firſt the inſide of the Cup and Platter,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to the Phariſees, and he doth ſo in his Diſciples. <hi>With the mind I ſerve the Law of God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> when he cryed out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver!</hi> It is not conceiveable what purity of heart is Formed by God in his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the fire which he kindleth in his <hi>Sion,</hi> and by the Furnace which he ſetteth up in his <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: for though in the Furnace the Droſs ſtill appears, the ſight whereof is apt to grieve and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the precious Heart, yet the melting and purifying ſweetly goes on, and the Soul (which abideth the heat) is effectually cleanſed thereby,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45705:41"/>
as is very manifeſt afterwards, when Righteouſneſs ſprings up with the quiet Fruit thereof; but this cannot be diſcerned, while the flames are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and taking hold of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>They bring into a Patient Frame</hi>; fit to bear Reproaches and Perſecutions from the World, who in the midſt of all this weakneſs (miſery and diſtreſs) lay load upon the Poor Soul, Perſecuting him whom God hath ſmitten, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the grief of him whom God hath wounded. God ſmites for want of Obedience, for too much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to pleaſe the World, for not coming ſoon enough out of their Cuſtomes, Vanities, Earthly wayes and Worſhips: and ſo ſoon as the Heart and Converſation is given up in Obedience to the Lord, the World is diſcontent, and they ſmite and Perſecute becauſe of the Obedience. Now the more the Spirit is broken
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45705:41"/>
by the hand of the Lord, and taught thereby to fear him; and the leſs ſtrength it hath in it ſelf, to grapple with the Perſecuting Spirit of the World, the fitter it is to ſtand in God's Counſel, to wait for his ſtrength and preſervation, which is able to bear up its head, above all the rage and ſwelling of the waters of the worldly Spirit in the men of this World.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid, but this may ſuffice. What is behind will be felt inwardly, as the Soul waits on God in the leadings of his Spirit, through the Teachings, Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diſtreſſes of the Law.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>With what kind of things doth the Lord exerciſe the Spirits of his</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to bring their hearts into theſe and ſuch other like precious frames?</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> with Temptations from the Enemy, even of many Kinds, Natures and Degrees, according to the preſent temper and Condition of the Soul: as either to doubt and ſo deſpaire, or be Confident in the Fleſh from Knowledge received, out of the pure Fear and freſh feeling of the Life: ſo again either to halt and draw back, or to be over-haſty and forward: ſo likewiſe either not to obey and Act for God, or to Act in that Will and Wiſdom which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Where there is a ſtopping of the Vertue received from the Grace, and not an Anſwer of it in the heart, there the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is ſtopped. If the Soul fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not in the drawing, the drawing is loſt, as to it. If the Ear open not to hear the voyce of the Word, or if it be not mixed with Faith in the heart hearing, it proves ineffectual. If ſtrength iſſue forth from the Lord, yet if the Soul receive not the ſtrength which iſſueth forth and Bubleth up in it, or anſwer it not in giving up to it and Travelling on, the Soul abideth where it was at leaſt, if
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45705:49"/>
it alſo retire not backward from that Eſtate and Condition, whereto the Life had advanced it: for if the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Life and Grace be refuſed, there is an advantage given to Death to re-enter, and gain ground by its contrary Vertue and Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Mark therefore diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how the Lord doth carry on the Diſpenſation of his Love and Free Grace, even as if there were much done by the ſtrength and Diligence of the Creature. What wounding of it ſelf by Repentance! what ſtriving to believe! what wreſtling againſt Enemies and for the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Grace, and to keep the hope up and the diſtruſt out! what ſtrict watching and waiting, even as if the Creature did work out its whole Salvation!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Though the Creature ſeemeth to do much it ſelf (having received Life from the Grace, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45705:49"/>
acting abundantly towards God in the Grace) yet it is the Grace and Vertue which comes from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor (who is alſo the Redeemer) which indeed doth all: for though the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repent really, and turn from the Darkneſs with its whole heart, yet the Repentance is of the Vertue which flows from the Grace, and not of the creature which receives the Grace: and ſo likewiſe is the Faith, the Love, the Obedience, the Meekneſs, the Patience, the Watching, the Waiting, the Hoping, &amp;c. Yea the very receiving the Grace, is not of the creature, but of the Grace: for the creature is dead, until it be viſited by the Grace; and by the Viſitation of the Grace alone is made alive, and able to receive it.</p>
            <p>Behold then the myſtery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. God is all in Redemption. God doth all therein as fully as in Creation (it is a new Creation) even
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45705:50"/>
the whole Work thereof; yet the creature quickened and renewed is in Unity with him in his Operations, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. He whoſe Eyes are opened can read the Myſtery, and in true underſtanding ſay (if he hath been led and hath proceeded ſo far) <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me; yet not I, but the Grace of God in me.</hi> Now to bring the creature to this, the Lord exerciſeth it dayly in Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in the Life and Vertue which floweth forth from him, cauſing it to feel its weakneſs as it forgets the Vertue, or aſpires to live of it ſelf on the Vertue received, out of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible feeling of its Dependance upon the Spring. And indeed, the Vertue that comes from God can alone An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer God, and the creature is onely accepted with the Spring and Father of Life, as it is found therein.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But if the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45705:50"/>
be wrought by God's creating Power, how cometh it to meet with ſo many rubs and interruptions, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overturnings? can any thing ſtop God's Creating Power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So far as God abſolutely pleaſeth to Create, nothing can ſtop or hinder: but the entrance of that, which he beginneth to Create, into the creature and its getting a being there, as alſo the growth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it there, may be hindred by the force of Spiritual Enemies, if the Lord pleaſe to permit, or by the grieving and provoking of that Free Power, which alone begetteth and preſerveth Life in the Heart.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Then the Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not carryed on by an abſolute free-creating Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Creating Power and preſerving Power is the ſame, but the work is ſomewhat different, both in the outward viſible Creation, and in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45705:51"/>
the inward New-Creation. The preſervation of that which is Created and Planted (unto its growth and Perfection) is by the ſame Power which Created and Planted: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a way of Care, Induſtry, Art and Skill, than of ſuch Immediate Force and Power, though by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and putting forth of the ſame Vertue and Power.</p>
            <p>There are Three things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is the iſſuing out of the Free Grace, Love, Vertue and Divine Power towards the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the opening of the Eſtate of the Creature thereby, convincing and drawing it out of the Alienation from the Life, towards Unity with the Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is the following of the creature after the Life, in the quickening Vertue of the drawings,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45705:51"/>
through all the Snares, Temptations, Diverſions and Oppoſitions of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Now there is no hindring of the iſſuing forth of the Free Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the creature, or of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and inclinations of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to follow, which neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thereupon. But the Purſuit and Progreſs of the creature (or its abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the quickening Vertue and Power) may many wayes be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and diverted, and ſo the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture drawn from under the influence of the free Covenant: for though the Covenant be free, yet the creature onely partakes of it, as it is drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it and preſerved in it.</p>
            <p>Therefore let thoſe Fear, who feel the Power and Redeeming Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and know, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the free and certain Promiſe to the Seed, yet the creature is as Clay in the hands of the Potter, which may
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45705:52"/>
be made a Veſſel of Honour or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, as he pleaſeth to favour it or take occaſion againſt it. And who ever would paſs through the Work of Salvation and Redemption, unto the Salvation and Redemption it ſelf; in the living Vertue received from the Life, let him keep faſt hold on the good Pleaſure, and in it give all diligence to make his Calling and Election ſure, working out his Salvation with Fear and Trembling, becauſe God worketh in him both to will and to do of his good Will. And walking diligently and induſtriouſly in this Path, he may attain the Seal of the Redemption, even that Mark which can never be worn out, and to full Aſſurance of Faith in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Power: though it is alſo poſſible for him afterwards, through much negligence &amp; grieving the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit whereby he was ſealed, to loſe the ſight of the Mark and the comfort of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45705:52"/>
the Aſſurance, which was once freſh and clear in his Spirit.</p>
            <p>For a cloſe at this time, I ſhall add a few words concerning the Unity of God's Grace (or free Light of his Spirit) notwithſtanding the various Eſtates and Conditions of man whom it viſits, and the variety of its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>There is a threefold ſtate of Man, wherein the Grace of God vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Gentile-ſtate, or ſtate of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Jew-ſtate or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Law, wherein God takes him under his own Tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making known his will to him, and requiring Obedience of him: and not only ſo, but alſo directs him to the inward Teacher, and to the Principle of the pure Fear, which is the place of Wiſdom's teaching and inſtructions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:45705:53"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Goſpel-ſtate, or ſtate of Faith, where the Principle is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Seed lives, and that is felt ſpringing up, known and enjoyed, which does the Will and receives the Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Now in all theſe the Law, the Light, the Life, the Wiſdom, the Power is one and the ſame; but the Adminiſtrations are different.</p>
            <p>In the Gentile-ſtate or ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight which man receives there (to diſcover Evil and work him into Good) is of the Spirit and by vertue of the Promiſe. For he had been everlaſtingly ſhut up in the Darkneſs, had it not been for the Promiſe: and it is for the Promiſe ſake and from the free Grace, that he hath any Viſitation in the ſtate of Nature, and any deſires after or lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards the good and from the evil; which ſpring not nor can ſpring from corrupted Nature, but from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45705:53"/>
the free Fountain of the new Life.</p>
            <p>In the Law-ſtate the Light grows more clear, the Teacher is there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and acknowledged, his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, warnings, inſtructions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs felt more diſtinctly, and the Soul (that is watchful) continually exerciſed therein.</p>
            <p>In the Goſpel-ſtate the Principle of Life is raiſed, the promiſed Seed come, the Power which doth the Will received, and the Light of Life entring into and poſſeſſing the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
            <p>Now this is the whole of Man, to wait on the Miniſtration of the Life to him in his preſent-eſtate, whether he be yet in the eſtate of Nature, or under the Law or under Grace. To know whence his Redemption ſprings, and to wait on the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arm for the beginnings, progreſs and perfecting of it: And if he be in the feeling of that Vertue, it is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45705:54"/>
enough: or if he be but kept long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and panting after it, it is well: yea, if there be but a deſire in him after a thirſt, there is hope: nay, if there be but the leaſt feeling of his dead, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and ſenſleſs Eſtate, there is ſome Life in him, which the Lord loves and will find a time to expreſs his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels towards: yea, that which is wholly in the Darkneſs and ſhut up in the Pit, the Lord hath bowels in him towards, and after many dayes may pleaſe to viſit. Oh the height, the depth, the length, the breadth of the Riches of the Mercy and Love of God! who knows his yearning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Souls, and his wayes of viſiting and redeeming! O my Soul, hope thou in the Lord for evermore, and leave not breathing towards him, till thou and his whole Creation be filled and ſatisfied with him; and then fetch the full breath of Life in him for ever.</p>

            <head>A Poſt-ſcript.</head>
            <p>I Have been Treating of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Work, as it is wrought in the heart by the Power, and brought to the ſenſible Experimental Knowledge of the Creature; yet would not be ſo underſtood, as if I made void what was done without by Chriſt in his own Perſon, or any of thoſe ends and purpoſes for which it was wrought, and appointed ſo to be done by the Father: though this I know, that the knowledge of thoſe things with the belief therein, or any Practices and obſervations therefrom without the Life, can no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit now, than the <hi>Jews</hi> literal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law could profit them, when they were rejected therewith. And ſince the Apoſtacy, of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45705:55"/>
Age eſpecially, I have clearly ſeen in the Spirit of the Lord, that the Profeſſors Knowledge of the Letter of the Goſpel, and cleaving to their apprehenſions which they gather therefrom, is become a Snare and Trap to them, to keep them from feeling the Power, and living in the ſenſibility of the Vertue of the Grace, even as the <hi>Jews</hi> Table (or gathered knowledge from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets) became their Snare and Trap. The Lord open their Eyes in his due time to diſcern it, that they may not withſtand that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and Revelation of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, which God ſeeth good to viſit the Apoſtatiſed world with, after this long dark night of the Apoſtacy; whereof thoſe that ſtick in Forms, or knowledge of things from the Letter without the Power, cannot but prove the greateſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45705:55"/>
Enemies, Oppoſers and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>Now to help them a little, if the Lord pleaſe, in the rouling of my bowels towards them I find my heart opened, to lay a few things before them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> With my heart, in the ſight of the Lord do I own that Principle, which formerly wrought in ſome of them, which I my ſelf was wrought upon by, and knew not onely the outward knowledge which they were acquainted with, but alſo the inward work: and I alſo knew what I called the Light of Nature, and what I called the Light of the Spirit, the one whereof was not the other, but differed as far as Spirit and Fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> I alſo own all the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Refreſhments which they received from the Lord in reading of the Scriptures, in their Publick or
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45705:56"/>
Private Exerciſes, and the Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they had from God in their own hearts: and I know that theſe things in themſelves were true, in their Proportion; however their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſence, and holding of them out of that wherein they received them, may juſtly be judged by the Spirit of the Lord in his Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though thoſe things were true in their day, and in their Proportion and Meaſure, yet in them they might loſe their vertue and die; and ſo they not retain the thing in its Life, in its own Principle, in the newneſs of the Spirit, in that Birth to which God gave it, but onely an Image of it in the Natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the earthly part, in the dead Principle: and then their knowledge of God and their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences cannot but be corrupted, and now become the poſſeſſion of Death, and the Engines of Death in their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45705:56"/>
hearts. Again, God had ſomewhat further to manifeſt, even to bring forth that, which they ſo earneſtly prayed for in that Day; which they, having abided in that Vertue wherin they prayed, might eaſily have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and embraced: but being out of that, and pleaſing themſelves with the litteral knowledge of the things they then received, holding them in the wiſe earthly part, that part cannot but ſtumble at the low and contemptible Appearances of God, which are ſtill offenſive to that part. The great Glory of God is hid in a little Seed, and how can the great Eye of the fleſhly-wiſe ſee it? We have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi> after the Fleſh; But as for this man, we know not whence he is. Even ſo it is now: We know the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which the Scriptures have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Chriſt by the Apoſtles, we are ſure this is of God, ſay the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45705:57"/>
but as for this little Seed of the Kingdom, or Light of God in the heart, we cannot believe that all we want is to ſpring up in it.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Fourthly,</hi> there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity both of the knowledge of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to paſs away, and alſo of their Experiences to be given up and let fall, in theſe two caſes following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> When the Vertue is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from them, when Death hath caught them, when they become Death's goods. For that which is received from the Life, is onely profitable to the Soul in the vertue of the Life. When the earthly part hath caught them and ſeated it ſelf there, they then become the ſtrong holds of the Enemy, and the Engines of Death to the heart; ſo that then Life and true Relief is not to be had in them, but where the Eternal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue pleaſes next to appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When God hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45705:57"/>
to bring forth further in the world or in any particular heart, to make way for it, he brings Death upon that which was before living. Thus when God is pleaſed to bring forth a greater Meaſure of Faith and Power of his Spirit, he diſtreſſeth the heart, making the fore-going Faith and Power appear weak and paſs away, and many times for a ſeaſon ſhutteth up the Soul in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, until the Freſh Faith and Freſh Power ſpring up and ariſe. And this cauſeth the neceſſity of the further Diſpenſations of his Eternal Vertue to appear, and the Beauty of them to ſhine, which they would not have done ſo abundantly, had it not been for the fore-going diſtreſſe of the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e yet ſome things further weighty upon my heart to lay before them, needful for them to conſider of, which may be ſerviceable and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45705:58"/>
helpful to them in their preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if the Lord pleaſe to open their hearts and impreſs them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are four Propoſitions, relating to the right Knowledge of the things of God, which are theſe following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Knowledge of the things of God comes from the Spirit.</hi> As the Scriptures themſelves came from the Spirit: ſo the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them is alone given, to any man which receiveth it, by the ſame Spirit. And no man living can know the mind of the words which the Spirit ſpake, but as the ſame Spirit which ſpake them, gives the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Knowledge of God</hi> (the living Knowledge the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Knowledge) <hi>is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> held in the Spirit and in the Birth which is of the Spirit.</hi> Man's natural part is not the true Treaſury, nor is man's Reaſon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45705:58"/>
to be Maſter of any of the things of God's Spirit; but that which holds the Knowledge of the Kingdom, the Grace of the Kingdom, the living Experiences, is that which is born of the Seed of the Kingdom; and man's Reaſon is for ever to be ſhut out of the things of God, further than it bowes, is limited and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Spirit, is ſtill to be tryed by the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit alone can keep it living, and the Spirit alone can tell whether the Life and Vertue be ſtill in it, or whether Death hath caught it: whether it be Manna fit for the Soul's Food; or Manna once given, but now corrupted. O my Dear Friends, wait to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my Experience concerning this thing, which is this. That which I had certainly received from God, and which the true Birth at firſt had
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45705:59"/>
fed on, the earthly Birth would be catching at, laying hold of, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up to feed on at another time. Likewiſe in my reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, I lay open to this great ſnare of reading in my own will, and of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering from thence in mine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, &amp; ſo growing wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things of God after the Fleſh: for though, at that time, I was not without living Knowledge and Experiences of God, yet I knew not how to turn from the Death, nor to keep to the Life; and ſo the bad, the lean, the earthly, the ill-favoured overgrew the good and wel-pleaſing to God, and brought it into bitter miſery and Death. O that ye knew being begotten of the Will of the Father, and keeping the Will of the Father, &amp; receiving the Bread dayly from his hand. That which man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth concerning the Scriptures, is not the pure Milk of the Word, but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45705:59"/>
that which the Breaſts gives out: that is it which hath the Immediate Life, Vertue and true Nouriſhment in it. And this muſt be returned back into the Treaſury, and not held in the earthly part, in the earthly will and underſtanding, but received from the Life again when it is again need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yea, this have I often known, that when I have been in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, I have received freſh comfort from the Lord: but running to that afterwards, it never was able to comfort me, but more deeply woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me. And thus hath the Lord been Teaching me to live upon himſelf, and not upon any thing received from him, but upon the Life it ſelf, the Mercy, the good Pleaſure, which Proportions out the living Bread dayly to the living Birth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is eaſie receiving of Knowledge in the earthly part, in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45705:60"/>
earthly Wiſdom, out of the Spirit and living Vertue.</hi> When one readeth a Scripture, it is eaſie conceiving and apprehending a meaning ones ſelf, or taking in another man's meaning; but it is hard abſtaining from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings and reaſonings of the mind, and waiting for the pure Will and Opening of the Spirit therein. Alſo it is eaſie retaining of Knowledge, and making uſe of it in the will and wiſdom of the earthly mind (for both theſe are natural) but it is hard denying the reaſon, the thoughts and imaginations, and watching to the Spirit.</p>
            <p>O Profeſſors! wait for the living Appearance of God, even for the freſhneſs of his Spirit in your ſpirits, that in that which cometh from the Spirit ye may know the Spirit, and may alſo know how to turn to him and abide with him, having the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45705:60"/>
watch ſet againſt that wiſdom in your ſelves, which in all Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations is eternally ſhut out of the things of the Kingdom, although it may gather, get and hold a vaſt Knowledge of the things of the Kingdom in the earthly Treaſury. Thus Fleſhly-<hi>Iſrael</hi> hath the Wiſdom of the Letter, but Spiritual-<hi>Iſrael</hi> the Wiſdom, Vertue and Life of the Spirit in all Ages and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And though he that is born after the Fleſh, deſpiſeth him who is born after the Spirit, yet this is God's Heir: and the bond-woman, the earthly wiſdom, with all her Children (even the greateſt Giants in Knowledge, Profe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>I was in a poor low Condition, when the Lord formerly viſited me; as loſt, as undone, as miſerable as any. What Knowledge, what Life, what precious Vertue I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was from God's Grace; which was ſtill his own, and he might call for it at his pleaſure. And ſurely, he which hath received from the Fountain, ought to truſt and to give back again to the Fountain, when he calleth for it; and then to remain Empty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Naked and Deſolate, until he be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

willing to part with my Life, but ſtriving to retain it, and grow in the firſt way of the Diſpenſation of the Grace unto Perfection, he brake it after an unutterable manner, and brought ſuch a Miſery &amp; Deſolation upon me as I could not poſſibly have ſuſpected, having been ſealed by him. And now he is Teaching me to live more fully upon his Grace, or rather upon the Spring, where I am nothing, where I can be nothing for ever: but he is and will be what he will be, and when he will be; and nothing in me can be ſatisfied with him, but what is of him and lives in him. And here all that I have known, or formerly taſted of him, ſprings up again at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and I drink of the old Wine and alſo of the new, but have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at my own diſpoſe. And when I catch at any thing or would be any thing, I loſe the Spring and

am Corrected for my Backſliding and Adultery of ſpirit, but am ſtill again viſited with freſh Love, and the ſpringings up of the freſh Power and Life, and freſh Viſitations of the rich Mercy and Grace, which the everlaſting Fountain naturally openeth in its own. The Pearl is exceeding Rich, the Treaſure of Life unutterable; and he that will poſſeſſe it muſt ſell all for it, even all his Luſts and Corruptions, yea all the Riches of his Nature (the beſt of his Will, the beſt of his Wiſdom moſt refined) nay not onely ſo, but all the Riches of his Spirit, all that he hath held or can hold out of the Life. Then, when he is poor in Spirit, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in himſelf but emptineſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as to receive or retain the Life, but what is formed, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up in, and is preſerved in the Life according to its own meer will
