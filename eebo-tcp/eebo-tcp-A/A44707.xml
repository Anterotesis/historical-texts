            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Saxons</hi> having succeeded the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in the sway of this Country,
As they changed the name thereof from
<hi>Britain</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> so the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
also came to be altered, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to an <hi>Heptarchy</hi> or <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virat,</hi>
for there rul'd here seven Kings at once (such
as they were) for the space of 400. years and more, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time as the Government was confus'd, so the
History is full of distraction and incertitudes, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
scarce any Authentic Record to be found for asserting
any thing; In somuch that what is written of that <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy</hi>
is believed rather in courtesie, or by an <hi>implicit</hi>
Faith then otherwise.</p>
            <p>But since <hi>Egbert</hi> King of the West <hi>Saxons</hi> came
by his prowess and policy to be sole King of <hi>England,</hi>
which was above 800. years since, the current of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
runs more cleer, and the Renown of the succeeding
Kings rang lowder beyond the Seas, which made forren
Princes to seek Alliances and Confederations with us.</p>
            <p>Therefore touching the present Design, we will take
our Rise from that time when <hi>England</hi> came to be a
Monarchy, and first of King <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> the Son of
the foresaid <hi>Egbert,</hi> Anno Dom. 837.</p>

            <p>THere was a Matrimonial Alliance once before 'twixt the Blood
Royal of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> which was about <hi>Anno 1376.</hi>
between <hi>Iohn</hi> the First, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Philippa</hi>
daughter to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> King <hi>Iohn</hi> had five
Sons by her, the two eldest with the Father were all three Knights
of the Garter at one time; the youngest Son was <hi>Henry,</hi> who being
a speculative studious Prince was much addicted to the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
and specially to the Art of <hi>Navigation,</hi> which induced him
to set forth some Ships for Discovery of new Countries, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
succeeded so well, that in the first voyage, he discovered the
<hi>Azores</hi> &amp; other Islands in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, next the Coasts of <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Cape <hi>Verd,</hi> and so at last the passage by the <hi>Promontory,</hi> or Cape
of Good Hope to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> which discoveries have proved
so gainful and glorious to that Nation ever since.</p>
            <p>By the former Alliance, it may be said that <hi>Portugal</hi> married with
<hi>England,</hi> by this <hi>England</hi> hath married with <hi>Portugal.</hi> And as the
former was the fortunatest Alliance that <hi>Portugal</hi> ever made by their
own confession to this day; So may this prove to <hi>England:</hi> may all
the blessings of Heaven be poured down upon it according to the
due and daily Devotions of all true-hearted Subjects, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
