            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The <hi>Arabians</hi> alſo or their expoſitors, when they ſpeake of the water of any plant, they vnderſtand the decoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it in water: and likewiſe <hi>Nicolas Myrepſus</hi> that writte in <hi>Greke</hi> of the compoſitions of medicines, whome it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be a verye late wryter, by the barbarous woordes that he vſeth very oft: wherin I maruel this, that no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made by him of waters or oyles prepared in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtical inſtruments. Only the oyl <hi>Capniſtum</hi> or ſmoked, that is deſtilled by deſcention, doth he deſcribe, as <hi>Aetius</hi> alſo. Moreouer, the thinges that the Chimiſtes make may I comprehend in .ii. kindes for the moſte parte, that they be ether liquors or Maſſy things, the liquors againe are ether watery or oyly: and theſe ether aiery or fiery. The Maſſy things, are ether ſuch as reſt in the bottom: or ſuch as are caried vpwarde: and that .ii. waies, ether as pure bodies and ſubſtauces, as they which they cal ſublimated, quick ſiluer. &amp;c. or Sout for the remedies of the eies wyth Phiſicions. There be alſo other artificial manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parings, wherwith the pureſt and moſt effectual parte in medicines is drawne out, and as it were the forme is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the matter.</p>
            <p>And although I am not greatly trauailed nether in the Chymiſtical nor in the other manner of preparings, but by the way haue got the kuowledge of certain thinges, partly by mine own experience in ſome things, &amp; partlye of myfrends: yet what ſo euer and how much ſo euer this is, I wil communicat it with the ſtudions of Phiſick: not as though I entend to teach perfectly and abſolutely the very Art of deſtilling and preparing of other things, but as it were wryting vnto ſuch as now already are not all voyde and withoute knowledge of theſe things, hauing ether experimented them ſelues or red other mens wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. For I haue nothing ſo exrelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or ſecrete, but I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet it might ge abrode to the publik and common profit,
<pb facs="tcp:3245:6"/>
and although in ſmal wealth, yet haue I ben euer of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ready to communicate and make any man priuye of any cunning I had, which ſom referre vnto ſimplicitie or childiſhnes, other ſome better to the liberalitie of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. There be ſome that do vtterly cloke and kepe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete their things, and that diuers kinde of men: ſome for Ambicion, that they maye haue wherewith to excell and pas other menne: ſome alſo for couetouſnes, to get gayne thereby: other thorowe the ignoraunce of the aunciente wryters, as thoughe there were not put in wrytinge ether the ſame or far better by men of antiquitie, whiche now are deſpiſed of many, and a foliſh and vnſaciable luſt is ther alwais to find out new things. Ther wantes not ſuch as think, great and effectual medicins ſhuld be kepte ſecrete for this cauſe, leaſt vncunning men, as many prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticioners be, without al reaſon almoſt, and al learnynge, might abuſe them, and conuert thoſe thinges whiche are inuented for the helth of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to their deſtruction. To ſuch wold I anſwer, As no kind of euil ought to be committed for this intent that any good thing might follow therof: ſo that which is good ought not to be left vndone, leaſte ſom euil might enſue, for the world ſhal neuer be without them that wil abuſe good things and profitable inuenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But good men, ſimplely ſuche good thinges as they haue, they make them common, and wil not ſtick nor ceſe to do ſo becauſe they feare, that certain leud perſons may do hurt therby. But I wil leaue of this diſputation, thye do I proteſt ſincerely &amp; as I thinck withal my hart, that I couet by my example to ſtur vp learned and good Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that laying apart al Ambition, Couetouſnes, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Enuy, if they can bring any excellent thinge vnto our profeſſion, that they wold do it gentlely and publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As for the vnlearned certes, they in miniſtring not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe great and effectual medicines, of whiche ſorte we
<pb facs="tcp:3245:7"/>
ſhal put diuers in wrytinge heare, but meates alſo and moſt common drinkes, out of time, do haſard and brynge mens liues manye times to diſeaſes and deathe: and it is well known that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writ how our <hi>Ptiſan</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred not in due time, was the cauſe of death to a certaine man ſick of the Pleuriſy. Theſe therfore ought to be lefte partly to their ignorance, partly to their leude malapart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But they that haue nede of the Phyſicion are to be admoniſhed to do that in Phiſicke, that all men are wont to do in al other Artes: that is, to chuſe good Phyſicions, and learned, and ſuch as exerciſe and practiſe this Art by their profeſſion, both with reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as a part of Philoſophy and alſo in the very actions and doinges of cures. But I return to the purpoſe. The preparing therfor (as I ſay) is of the greateſt moment and weight in euerye matter. In Rhetorik vtterans, geſture, and pronunciation more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt moue the mindes of the hearers, then the very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is handled. Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it cometh that things put in meter and in numbers, do delite ſo greatly: which if a man vtter in proos, they ſhalbe taken for cold, dnl and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe. Hereof cometh it that one beinge aſked the queſtion what was the chiefeſt thinge in an orator, anſwered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation: what was the next and the third: the ſame. Shewes and plaies, that thei delite the hearers and behol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders ſo greatly, it is much more long of the form and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their forniture and preparance then of the matter plaied or ſhewed. In like maner in the verye thinges and workes, the forme, the faſhion, figure, maner, aſwel of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as of Art, finally a certain preparation is more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and commended then the matter. Likewiſe in phyſſk, the conninge to prepare thinges aright, and the deſcreſſion to miniſter them aptly, haue the greateſt moment and ſkil moſte. Nether is it of greater force what thou miniſtreſt, then in what maner. And althoughe there be manye cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſtances
<pb facs="tcp:3245:7"/>
to be conſidered, that thou maiſt exhibit the medicin aright, yet the maner, and the preparing is with in the medicine, and is at it were the form therof and part the other circumſtaunces are withoute it, as time, place, and ſuch things as are to be conſidred about the ſickman. But letting pas other waies of dreſſing and preparing at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we wil onli touch thoſe, bi the which al the ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue and faculti or operation is ſeparated from the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the medicins, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more liquid and moyſt, the more pure and ſubtil part of euery remedy or medicin, maye be bad ſeuered and drawn out from the groſe and erthy part: whether it be gathered into a liquor drawn out of the ſam remedy or medicin or into an other certaine ertarnall. &amp;c. which the barbarous wryter <hi>Arnold</hi> calleth <hi>Eruirtuare</hi> to <hi>outuerteuat,</hi> or <hi>Excorporare,</hi> to outcorporate. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, if ſumthings ſhal ſeme to be written ſomwhat curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or double diligently, ye muſt conſider that ſuthe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not to the Phyſicions of the common people and pore fooke, but to ſuch as abound more with riches and eaſe, &amp; haue plenty of ſeruants, or ſuch as remain in Prynces or Kings courts: or alſo to Philoſophers, that buſilye ſearche out the meruelous mutacion and vertues of natural thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in them delite them ſelues. To conclude, let no man maruel that ſo great and longe commendacions and praiſes are added to certain medicines, as vnto the <hi>Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſences</hi> as they call them, to <hi>Aqua vities,</hi> &amp; made ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mes, and that vnto ſome meruelous vertues are attributed, as to ſharpen the wit and memory, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue the ſenſes and youth. &amp;c. When as euen by the auncient Grekes &amp; Latins alſo we read ſuch effects and operacions to be aſcribed to Triacle and other preſeruatiues and compoſitions, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Arabians vnto diuers things, yea euen of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> alſo vnto Triacle. Ther be ſom that I wil not auow, and whoſe credit I leaue to the authors, whoſe names I
<pb facs="tcp:3245:8"/>
write euery where. But it is ſaid before alreadye, that we wryt all theſe thinges for the learned and diſcreate men, which for the moſt part ſhall iudge more eaſily how much credit is to be geuen to euery thinge. Althoughe in verye many it is not ſufficient to be furniſhed with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and iudgement, excepte experience and practiſe be ioyned alſo therwith. But I make an end heare of my Preface.</p>

It were longe to wryte all the ways, whiche I proued to finde oute thies thinges: yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xx"/> one will I touche, whiche ſemeth to me to be the beſt and the eaſieſt waye. That is by the vapoure and ſmoke of hoat water, in a double veſſell. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>A doubt. If ſo be it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyre maketh al thinges hoat and drye: all waters gotten by deſtillation, ought to be hoat and drye. Nether dothe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſubſtance diſproue this, for when as bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water is ſuche, it doth both bren and might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make hoat and dry mens bodies. Again, al wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be colde and moyſte, as long as the ſubſtance hath the vpper hande. But nether of thies is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes true: yea, ſome of thies ar more lyke vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xx"/> thoſe thinges wheroute they be taken, as roſe wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, bothe in ſmel, taſt, and operation. A phiall of plantain water, is able to ſtaunche bloud, where ſo euer it runne forth. Water of Lettis can not doo the ſame, although it be muche colder. A certain man of late endeuouring to encreaſe his memory infuſed and ſteept balm for the ſpace of thre days in whyte wyne, then lightly wringing oute the wyne, deſtilled a water, by the drinking wherof, he thought to recouer his memory. But hauing a hoat liuer, had almoſt deſtroyed his health. And this maner is called of the philoſophers, to ſette Starres in the ſkye. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xxx"/>
            </p>
            <p>Therfor men be wont to axe whether theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters reteyne and kiep their owne propre vertues
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3245:15"/>
and ſtrength. Wee once ſaide, whyles wee entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the euill maner of curing, that they are no ſtrengthes nor vertues, becauſe they are deſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of ſauour and taſte. For water of wormwode, nether ſmelleth like wormwode, nor is bitter yea that is more wonder, it is ſumwhat ſwiete. Yet burning water (to ſpeake nothing of Roſe water) well declareth that ther is a certaine vertue and efficacie in waters. For if you will ſay it is ſuche becauſe of fyre: how commeth it to pas that none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="x"/> other water is like it? for this doth marueilouſly make hoate, dryeth, perceth, hath a ſharp ſmell, &amp; burneth. It is plain therfore now, that there is ſtrength and vertues in waters: but not in al wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor equall with that they be drawn oute of. for what things ſoeuer haue a thinne ſubſtaunce ioyned with colde, gyue a water not vnlyke to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, as the Roſe. They that haue a thin and hoat ſubſtance, giue a lyke water, but burning withall, as wyne and certain metals. Suche as haue a groſſe and hoat ſubſtance, giue an vnlyke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xx"/> water and an euill, as wormwod. Such as haue groſſe and colde, they giue vnlyke, but not euill, as the Gourde. According to this reaſon, ſuche ſtrengthes of waters as ar receiued with ſoft fyre ar eaſy to be learned. for ſuche as require a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menr fyre, doo all vehemently drye, &amp; for the moſt parte alſo, make hoate. This ſaith <hi>Cardan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But me thinkes thies thinges would be more diligently conſidered and weyed. Firſt, wher he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xxx"/> ſaieth that wormwode water is not bitter: it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3245:16"/>
trew, if a man deſtill it negligently as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun apothecaries ar wont, in leaden limbeckes. but deſtill it in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and ſee whether it ſhall lacke his ſmell and taſt, or no. Yea, it ſhall retain boeth, and that effectuouſly, not only this herbe, but alſo any other plant whatſoeuer it be, hauing any ſauoure or taſte: if it be dried and weikte or ſtiept in wyne a few dayes, then deſtilled in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo Mariae</hi> or by aſſhes gentely, as I ſhall ſhewe further within. Now when certain thinges haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="x"/> great plentie of their ſmel, and that ſo ſtrong that it vaniſheth not of a long ſpace, whiche cummeth bycauſe the force of ſmelling is digeſted equally into the hoole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubſtance of them: it is no wonder, if in the ſame veſſelles ſome waters bee deſtilled lyke vnto their plantes, as of Roſes, whiche as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> wryteth, doo reteine their ſauour very long: other ſum be vnlyke to their plantes. for ſuche waters as haue their vertue and force in the vttermoſt and ſuperficial partes, they fume <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xx"/> out eaſyly, as of wormwode, whoſe ſmell may be iudged to bee in the ſame place where his bitter taſte is conteined: whiche wee fynde to be only in the vtter and ſuperficiall parte. For if thou ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the barke from the ſtalke or the braunches, thou ſhalt fynde that whiche is within to be vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery or vnſwiete. Therfor this difference is not to be required of the groſſenes or puritie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, although I thinke it alſo to be of ſome force: but rather of this, that the ſtrength of any thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xxx"/> is ether diſtributed equally through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoole pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3245:51"/>
it ſhould alſo become thin and pure, more &amp; more, and when euery fire, the thicker and groſſer it is, the more it burneth: contrariwiſe, the thinner, the leſſe: that which is moſt thin ſhould burn leaſte of all. By the ſame cauſe it commeth to paſſe, that a drop of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> poured in the palme of a mans hand, the better it is, the ſoner it vaniſheth awaye and is conſumed. I heare that this is a laudable note of this water, if <hi>ſuccinum amber</hi> being ſet on fire and put to it into a ſpone do burn.

By this ſpong the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſhalbe beſt deſtilled, and the fleame ſhall not paſſe through, becauſe of the oyle: &amp; by this menes ſhall a man do more with once deſtilling, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with thriſe. Notwithſtandinge the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck muſt be made withoute the gutter and circle within like to a blinde limbecke, but it muſte not lacke a noſe. Thus ſaith he.

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our time call it dead water: for it is vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery and ſtinking. Such, that is the ſtinking wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, whether it be yeilden of lies onlye, or alſo of wine, I haue not tried.</p>
            <p>For the deſtillation of <hi>aqua vitae</hi> or burning wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, a man muſte chuſe the beſt wine, blacke, red, or white. Black and old, yelds more plenty and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo better water, then any other.

The water that is gotten theroute, is ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med burning, or the ſoul and life of the wine: and when it is deſtilled twiſe or thriſe, then they cal it flaming water: <hi>Albertus</hi> as ſome alledge.</p>
            <p>Of fiue partes of lies, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is twiſe deſtilled I heare, one remaineth or ſomwhat les. Whan y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fleame is one cleane conſumed, nothing is loſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the deſtilling, but the hole is yeilded again. Of .iiii. meaſures of wine, for the moſte parte one meaſure of burnyng water is gathered in the firſt deſtillacion or there about according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xx"/> of the wine. Then in the next deſtillacion for one meaſure, there commeth the halfe. In y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> third, one part offiue is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed. In y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fourth, as much is yelded as you put in, for the moſt part if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillacion be done accordingly. Notwithſtanding if you continue deſtillinge, the water ſhall be the more perfect, in ſo much that at the ninth or tenth deſtillacion, it ſhal come out moſt perfect, But for as much as to the repeting of deſtillinge ſo ofte: a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xxx"/> man muſt beſtow both more time and more coſte,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3245:52"/>
for the moſt part we are content with the third or the fourthe deſtillacion, and call it perfecte. And ſurely it reſteth much in the inſtrument, that the water ſhould be perfected ſoner or ſlower. For the vapour is more deſtilled and perfected in the firſt deſtillacion in a ſerpentin (that is in a croked and bowed pipe) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thriſe deſtilled by a ſtreight pipe. Note further that ther diuers waters may be ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered in the firſt deſtillacion, wherof the firſte is perfit, that is, that whiche burneth and is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="x"/> with the fire, and a linnen cloth dipte therin and ſet on fire is not burnt. (You ſhall proue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe and then, and when the water ceaſeth burninge, looke what remaineth in the ſtill, you may caſt it away, as vnprofitable. The ſecond is a meane betwene good and bad.) The thirde is good for nothinge, ſaue that it cleareth the eyes and the face, if thriſe a day they be waſhte therin, morninge, noone and euening, but this vertue of the third water, perauenture is true, if the deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xx"/> be made with wine: but if it be with lies, as they be wonte with vs, it is not true. More ouer the ſtil muſt not be filled aboue .ii. parts, but that the third part may remaine emptye, and that the vapoures maye haue their ſcoupe and romthe. Hitherto <hi>Lullus.</hi>

Thou maiſt gather it thus, draw a fair linnen cloth ſprede abrode vpon the graſſe, til it haue dronken much of the dew, then wryng <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="xx"/> it out into ſome veſſell: and draw it again and fill it, euer wringing it out againe til thou haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred inough.

that firſt thou power on ſo much, that the herbes be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ouercouered with water: and againe twis ſo muche.

And becauſe it hath much heat, it expelleth what ſoeuer is vncleane, and therfore reſtoreth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat. For age is nothinge els then a leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and diminiſhing of natural heat, which is therfore diminiſhed, becauſe the mouinge is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: as I ſaide of fire: for there is like reaſon of this vnto that.
