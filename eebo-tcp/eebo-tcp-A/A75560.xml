            <title>A most noble speech spoken by the Lord Cambel of Lorne, one of his Majesties most Honourable Privie Counsell of Scotland. Moving the Lords House in Scotland, in his Maiesties presence, for the prevention of such advantages; whereby incendiaries may in the vacancy of Parliaments, any way extort from his Highnesse proclamations, to inforce the bringing in of innovations into the Kirke; or confirming of monopolies, that so all oppressions may be removed from his Majesties subjects of both kingdomes. As also, an honourable reply made by the Lord Lowden, against such, who objected against his former speech.</title>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat was more to bee wi≈øhed for on Earth, then the great happine≈ø≈øe, this day wee enjoy? <hi>viz.</hi> To ≈øee his Royall Maje≈øty, our Native Soveraigne, and his loyall Subjects of both Kingdomes, ≈øo really reconciled, and united: that his <hi>Maie≈øty</hi> is piou≈øly plea≈øed to grant unto us his Subiects, our lawfull demands concerning Religion and Liberties, and wee his Subjects of both Nations, cheerfully rendring to his <hi>Maie≈øty,</hi> that duty, affection, and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, which he hath ju≈øt cau≈øe to expect from good People, and each Nation concurring in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly amity, unity, and concord, one towards the other?</p>
            <p>O what Tongue is able to expre≈ø≈øe the Honour and Prai≈øe due to that great and good God, who in tho≈øe late
<pb facs="tcp:157514:3"/>
Commotions, ≈øuffered not the prudent Coun≈øels of either <hi>Kingdomes</hi> to de≈øpaire of the ≈øafety of either <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> but through his ble≈øsing to their painfull and prudent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, hath wrought ≈øuch a happine≈ø≈øe for us, that after the great toyle and trouble, wee have ≈øo long on both ≈øides endured, we may now each man, with his wife, children, and friends, under his owne Vine, and Figtree (and all under his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Gracious protection) refre≈øh him≈øelfe with the ≈øweet fruits of peace: <hi>which I be≈øeech the Lord of Peace make perpetuall to both Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now my earne≈øt de≈øire is, that our be≈øt ≈øtudies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, may be ≈øpent in contriving, and enacting ≈øuch whole≈øome Lawes; whereby (as much as in us lyes) the <hi>opportunity</hi> and occa≈øion of producing ≈øuch Calamities, as lately threatned to fall upon both <hi>Nations,</hi> may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if in any Age hereafter ≈øuch mi≈øcreants ≈øhall goe about to <hi>attempt</hi> it.</p>
            <p>It is notorious, that the late Incendiaries that occa≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the great differences, betwixt his Maie≈øty and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, tooke much advantage and courage, by the too long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termi≈ø≈øion of the <hi>happy Con≈øtitution of Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the vacancy of which, they by fal≈øe Information, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øed his Maie≈øty again≈øt his Loyall ≈øubiects; and by their vile in≈øinuations extorted from his Highne≈ø≈øe Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for obedience to their Innovations in the Kirk, and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for Proiects: whereby the poore Subiect was both <hi>polled,</hi> and <hi>oppre≈ø≈øed</hi> in his E≈øtate, and enthralled in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience.</p>
            <p>And thus by their wicked <hi>Practi≈øes,</hi> his Maie≈øty was di≈øta≈øted, and his <hi>≈øubiects</hi> generally di≈øcontented: in ≈øo much, that had not the great mercy of God prevented them, they had made an <hi>ob≈øtruction</hi> betwixt his Maie≈øty, and his liege People, and had broken tho≈øe mutuall &amp; indi≈ø≈øoluble bonds of <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Allegeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:157514:3"/>Whereby J hope his Maje≈øty, and his loyall ≈øubjects of all three Kingdomes, will be ever bound together: <hi>to which let all the ≈øubiects ≈øay, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> The di≈øta≈øte of his Maje≈øty, nor di≈øcontents of his Subiects, could never have growne to that height they did (<hi>nor con≈øequently have produced ≈øuch effects</hi>) had there not bin ≈øuch an interpo≈øition by tho≈øe <hi>Innovators and Projectors,</hi> betwixt his Maje≈øty our glorious Sunne, and us, his loyall Subjects: that his goodne≈ø≈øe could neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to us, nor their di≈øloyalty and our obedience to him.</p>
            <p>For no ≈øooner was that happy <hi>Con≈øtellation, the Parliament in England rai≈øed,</hi> and tho≈øe vaporous Clouds di≈ø≈øipated; <hi>but his Maie≈øties goodne≈ø≈øe, his ≈øubiects Loyalty, and their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery evidently appeared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Brethren of <hi>England</hi> finding the Intermi≈ø≈øion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, to be prejudiciall and dangerous to the State, have taken a cour≈øe for the frequent holding of them; who≈øe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Example, J de≈øire may be our Patterne: forthwith to obtaine his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Royall a≈ø≈øent for the ≈øame.</p>
