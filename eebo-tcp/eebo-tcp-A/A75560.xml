            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat was more to bee wiſhed for on Earth, then the great happineſſe, this day wee enjoy? <hi>viz.</hi> To ſee his Royall Majeſty, our Native Soveraigne, and his loyall Subjects of both Kingdomes, ſo really reconciled, and united: that his <hi>Maieſty</hi> is piouſly pleaſed to grant unto us his Subiects, our lawfull demands concerning Religion and Liberties, and wee his Subjects of both Nations, cheerfully rendring to his <hi>Maieſty,</hi> that duty, affection, and aſſiſtance, which he hath juſt cauſe to expect from good People, and each Nation concurring in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly amity, unity, and concord, one towards the other?</p>
            <p>O what Tongue is able to expreſſe the Honour and Praiſe due to that great and good God, who in thoſe late
<pb facs="tcp:157514:3"/>
Commotions, ſuffered not the prudent Counſels of either <hi>Kingdomes</hi> to deſpaire of the ſafety of either <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> but through his bleſsing to their painfull and prudent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, hath wrought ſuch a happineſſe for us, that after the great toyle and trouble, wee have ſo long on both ſides endured, we may now each man, with his wife, children, and friends, under his owne Vine, and Figtree (and all under his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Gracious protection) refreſh himſelfe with the ſweet fruits of peace: <hi>which I beſeech the Lord of Peace make perpetuall to both Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now my earneſt deſire is, that our beſt ſtudies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, may be ſpent in contriving, and enacting ſuch wholeſome Lawes; whereby (as much as in us lyes) the <hi>opportunity</hi> and occaſion of producing ſuch Calamities, as lately threatned to fall upon both <hi>Nations,</hi> may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if in any Age hereafter ſuch miſcreants ſhall goe about to <hi>attempt</hi> it.</p>
            <p>It is notorious, that the late Incendiaries that occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the great differences, betwixt his Maieſty and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, tooke much advantage and courage, by the too long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of the <hi>happy Conſtitution of Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the vacancy of which, they by falſe Information, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed his Maieſty againſt his Loyall ſubiects; and by their vile inſinuations extorted from his Highneſſe Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for obedience to their Innovations in the Kirk, and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for Proiects: whereby the poore Subiect was both <hi>polled,</hi> and <hi>oppreſſed</hi> in his Eſtate, and enthralled in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>And thus by their wicked <hi>Practiſes,</hi> his Maieſty was diſtaſted, and his <hi>ſubiects</hi> generally diſcontented: in ſo much, that had not the great mercy of God prevented them, they had made an <hi>obſtruction</hi> betwixt his Maieſty, and his liege People, and had broken thoſe mutuall &amp; indiſſoluble bonds of <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Allegeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:157514:3"/>Whereby J hope his Majeſty, and his loyall ſubjects of all three Kingdomes, will be ever bound together: <hi>to which let all the ſubiects ſay, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> The diſtaſte of his Majeſty, nor diſcontents of his Subiects, could never have growne to that height they did (<hi>nor conſequently have produced ſuch effects</hi>) had there not bin ſuch an interpoſition by thoſe <hi>Innovators and Projectors,</hi> betwixt his Majeſty our glorious Sunne, and us, his loyall Subjects: that his goodneſſe could neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to us, nor their diſloyalty and our obedience to him.</p>
            <p>For no ſooner was that happy <hi>Conſtellation, the Parliament in England raiſed,</hi> and thoſe vaporous Clouds diſſipated; <hi>but his Maieſties goodneſſe, his ſubiects Loyalty, and their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery evidently appeared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Brethren of <hi>England</hi> finding the Intermiſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, to be prejudiciall and dangerous to the State, have taken a courſe for the frequent holding of them; whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Example, J deſire may be our Patterne: forthwith to obtaine his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Royall aſſent for the ſame.</p>
            <p>By which meanes, his <hi>Maieſty</hi> may in due time, heare, and redreſſe the Grievances of his Subjects, and his ſubjects cheerefully (as need ſhall require) ayd and aſsiſt his <hi>Maieſty:</hi> and not onely the Domeſtique peace, and quiet of each Kingdome preſerved;</p>
            <p>But likewiſe all Nationall differences (if any happen) by the wiſedome of the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of both Kingdomes, from time to time, reconciled and determined, to the perpetuating of the happy Peace, and Vnion of both Nations.<gap reason="missing" extent="1+ pages">
