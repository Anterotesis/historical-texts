            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ATrifle of this kind is so little worthy your attention, that I know not how to make a fair way for its appearance, and beg you to give it audience. The Muses are become so prostitute, that every Enthusiast begets a work on'em; Plays are grown meer Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and generated so fast, that we find one or more laid at the door of every Noble-Man; and these impudent Begetters are not satisfy'd that you give their unlawful Issue a maintenance and reering, but have the Conscience also to expect a Reward for easing themselves on you of their ungodly burthen. Sir, I must confess I am little better than a lewd Sinner of this Order, but have so much Grace and Modef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y at least to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no Recompense where I ought to be begging Pardon for committing a slip of this nature. I am confident I cou'd not chuse a more indulgent Foster-Father; and tho' my very Name bears an accusation against me, yet I have the honour also to be related to the Muses by the Mothers side; for you your self have been guilty of Poetry, and a Family Vice is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more excusable in me, who am unluckily a Poet by descent. Poe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e is a Noble Exercise, and like a reserv'd Game seems intended wholly for the recreation of Learned Gentlemen, or such at least as have had libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Education, and these have still succeeded best in it: But we see the illiterate breaking in daily on the Quarry, and even those assuming, to themselves the name of Poets, who never had any other call to that Art
<pb facs="tcp:65969:3"/>
beside the hope of a third day. If one half of us who set up for making Plays, understood what <hi>Horace</hi> says in these Lines, it may be we should not vainly presume to think our selves what indeed we are not.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Shakespear</hi> among all the Writers of our Nation may stand by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a Phoenix, the first and last of his Order; in whom bounteous Nature wonderfully supply'd all the parts of a great Poet, and Excellent Oratour; and of whom alone one may venture boldly to say, that had he had more Learning, perhaps he might have been less a Poet. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the good nature of the Town suffers any thing for the sake of Novelty and Entertainment, however meagre, and the encouraging some miserable Writers, is to be allow'd more an act of Charity than Judgment; for tho' Poverty be generally the end of a Poet, I think it is but a very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable beginning. There is a large difference between those, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the itch of gaining empty applause, mispend their time in writing themselves into necessity, and such who spend their time in writing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of it; and where the Muse begins with the want of a Meals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat. The former might be any thing else better than what they chuse to be; the latter, because they can be nothing else, wou'd fain be Poets. 'Tis dangerous making a Pastime of any one thing so long, that at last we are glad to embrace it as a Profession; like those, who after they have melted all their Substance in search of the Philosopher's-Stone, are forc'd in the end to turn Chymists. But of this enough; for I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conscious to my self of deviating something from my Theme, and can only form this application out of what I have said, that you, Sir, have prudently known how to make the best use of your Excellent Talent in this kind, by applying it to your diversion, and the unbending your Mind. By these means, you have happily given our Country a great Poet in your Writings; and at the same time have not omitted the more necessary part of giving her a Great States-Man, and Heroe; to which Emi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ncy your Birth, Courage, and Capacity have equally rais'd you. And shou'd I enlarge on these Heads, I am confident the World wou'd not tax me of the least flattery, and I shou'd only be guilty of not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you your due; but you are reserv'd for a better Pen, and silence
<pb facs="tcp:65969:3"/>
therefore is a good fault in me. I have only now to beg pardon for sending so mean a Trifle so long a Voyage; 'tis so full of faults I know not how to give it the name of a Play. The Italians when they know not what to make of a thing, call it <hi>Un Pasticcio Inglese,</hi> what kind Complement they intend our Country in the Expression I know not, but I believe they mean no better than a Hotch-podge. 'Tis my first Poetical Cookery of this sort, and whatever it be, I humbly submit it to your Censure, but more to your Patronage; and with it,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> to his Son's Play.</head>
            <p>I Have thought convenient to acquaint the Reader with somewhat concerning this Comedy, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not worth his knowledge. It was sent me from <hi>Italy</hi> some years since, by my second Son, to try its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune on the Stage: And being the Essay of a young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd Author; to confess the truth, I thought it not worthy of that honour. 'Tis true, I was not willing to discourage him so far, as to tell him plainly my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it seems he guess'd somewhat of my Mind, by my long delays of his expectation: And therefore in my absence from the Town last Summer, took the boldness to Dedicate his Play to that Person of Honour, whose Name you will find before his Epistle. It was receiv'd by that Noble Gentleman with so much Candor and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity, as neither my Son nor I cou'd deserve from him. Then the Play was no longer in my power, the Patron demanding it in his own right, it was deliver'd to him. And he was farther pleas'd, during my Sickness, to put it into that Method in which you find it; the loose Scenes
<pb facs="tcp:65969:4"/>
digested into order, and knit into a Tale. As it is, I think it may pass amongst the rest of our New Plays; I know but two Authors, and they are both my Friends, who have done better since the Revolution. This I dare venture to maintain, that the Tast of the Age is wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deprav'd, in all sorts of Poetry, nothing almost but what is abominably bad can p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se. The young Hounds who ought to come behind, now lead the pack, but they miserably mistake the scent. Their Poets, worthy of such an Audience, know not how to distinguish their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters; the Manners are all alike inconsistent and interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with each other. There is scarce a Man or Woman of God's making in all their Farces: yet they raise an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural sort of laughter, the common effect of Buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and the Rabble which takes this for Wit, will endure no better, because 'tis above their Understanding. This account I take from the best Judges, for I thank God, I have had the grace hitherto to avoid the seeing or reading of their Gallimaufries. But 'tis the latter end of a Century, and I hope the next will begin better. This Play I dare assure the Reader is none of those; it may want Beauties, but the faults are neither gross, nor many. Perfection in any Art is not suddenly obtain'd; the Author of this, to his misfortune, left his Country at a time when he was to have learn'd the Language. The Story he has treated, was an Accident which happen'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> though he has transferr'd the Scene to <hi>England.</hi> If it shall please God to restore him to me, I may perhaps inform him better of the Rules of Writing; and if I am not partial, he has already shewn, that a Genius is not wanting to him.
<pb facs="tcp:65969:5"/>
All that I can reasonably fear, is that the perpetual good success of ill Plays may make him endeavour to please by writing worse, and by accommodating himself to the wretched capacity and liking of the present Audience, from which, Heaven defend any of my Progeny. A Poet indeed, must live by the many, but a good Poet will make it his business to please the few. I will not proceed farther on a Subject which arraigns so many of the Readers. For what remains, both my Son and I are extreamly oblig'd to my dear Friend Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> whose Excellent Prologue was one of the greatest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Play. Neither is my Epilogue the worst which I have written; though it seems at the first sight to expose our young Clergy with too much freedom. It was on that Consideration that I had once begun it otherwise, and deliver'd the Copy of it to be spoken, in case the first part of it had given offence. This I will give you partly in my own justification, and partly too, because I think it not unworthy of your sight. Only remembring you that the last line connects the sense to the ensuing part of it. Farewell, Reader, if you are a Father you will forgive me, if not, you will when you are a Father.</p>

                     <p>Sir <hi>John,</hi> I am oblig'd to you for the Summary you have been pleased to make of my present Condition; but methinks in the first part of your Discourse, where you take notice of the little or no Comfort there is to be had in Marriage with so small concern, you seem to forget that you your self are a marry'd Man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                     <p>Forget, say you, that would be more than any married Man in Christendom could ever do yet; but I remember it as seldom, and with as little regret as possibly I can: I have been married now these ten years, that is to say, I have served almost two Apprentiships to Matrimony, 'twere hard if I were not Master of my Vocation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lurch.</speaker>
                     <p>So it should seem indeed, by your advising me to allow my Wife that Christian Liberty which you say all wise Men allow theirs; 'tis a Heathen Liberty, a Crime Capital, the broad Road to Cuckoldom.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                     <p>I tell you, Neighbour, you talk like a meer Novice in Matrimony, give me leave to tell you, 'tis in vain to consine them; for the more Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are constrain'd and depriv'd of Liberty, the more eager they are in the pursuit of it; if you vex them, they'll cross you, 'tis an original per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness they inherit by Nature; why, I tell you once again they are the crooked rib of <hi>Adam,</hi> they love nothing like cross purposos.</p>

                     <p>'Tis well there are no Women here to hear you; but still I say no liberty; if I must be a Cuckold, I shall have this satisfaction at least, to be made one my own may.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis pity but your Wife should give it you; i am afraid, Neighbour, I am afraid you have <hi>Capricorn</hi> gloriously ascending in your Nativity, you have a very foreboding look with you.</p>

                     <speaker>Lurch. Sir John,</speaker>
                     <p>you that are so good at decyphering other Peoples looks, had best look at home; since I am provoked to speak my mind, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that there is a certain swindging two-handed well set black Doctor, who comes very often to feel your Lady's Pulse, I think they call him the Ladies Doctor in the Town, but he looks more like a Horn Doctor; I am of opinion your Lady is not so often indispos'd for nothing.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                     <p>You mean Doctor <hi>Lorman,</hi> that insignificant Fop Doctor, who has not the tenth part of the Learning of a Mountebank in <hi>Lincolns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Inn-Fields,</hi> a meer Crevat and Periwig one, who never knew beyond the composition of a Washball or a Pomatum, or how to prescribe a Clyster for my Lady's Lap-Dog. He is not the first Coxcomb that has pass'd with Women for a Man of Parts; but to confess freely to you, Neighbour,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65969:8"/>
I never yet suspected my Wife's Vertue with the Doctor; I know her to be humorous and fantastick, and therefore as she is often troubled with little indispositions, I am willing to let her have the Doctor she fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
