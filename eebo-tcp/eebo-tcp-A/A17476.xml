         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the comfort of your

            <head>Advice to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now many yeeres agoe, ſince
reading Hiſtorians, I fell upon
the ſect and manners of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Saxons, who finally were
vanquiſhed, and converted to
the Chriſtian Faith, by the Armes and wiſdome
of our <hi>Charlemaigne.</hi> I thereupon looked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuch Authors, as I could get; for beſides
<hi>Crantzius, Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Viterbe, Regino,</hi>
who ſpeake of thoſe people. I read the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>Fulde,</hi> the relations of <hi>Schaffenberge,
Evodius, Albinus,</hi> and other Records, from
whence I have drawne this Hiſtory, illuſtrating
it with many admirable paſsages, extracted from
ſundry Authors, to be preſented to his Majeſty
in the beginning of his conqueſts.</p>
            <p>At that time, having taken another flight,
and other imployments, I was diverted from
this labour, which I accounted as buried up,
had not a benigne hand drawne it out of its
<pb facs="tcp:7777:6"/>
Tombe, eſteeming it very fit to ſee day-light in
the goodly ſplendor of theſe times, and divine
Luſtres of the Kings Triumphs.</p>
            <p>If the ſound hereof ſeeme ſomewhat harſh and
rough, I beſeech the vnderſtanding Reader to
conſider, that the moſt part of Histories, of the
ſame Time, are of no other condition; that this
ſubject was conceived upon an occaſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee ought more to regard the delights of a
Royall Theater, then a Method, dry, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vique;
Finally that there is nothing ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
which cannot be verified by the relation
of ancient Hiſtories, and that he who will take
away the veile, ſhall ſee in the deſtruction of
Idolatry made by <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sects vnder the Armes of our moſt
Chriſtian King, whom God for
his glory preſerue, for the

obſerveth) was bloudy and barbarous.</p>
            <p>This was yet practiſed among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as
we ſhall ſee in the progreſſe of this Hiſtorie:
For it happened that <hi>Clodoaldus</hi> this diſtreſſed
Father having wandred over many Countreys,
perpetually in queſt of his Children, came to
reſide in <hi>Saxony,</hi> where hee had ſome alliance:
and ſeeking there for ſome entertainment to
ſweeten the ſence of his miſ-hap,<note place="margin">Hunting of <hi>Clodoaldus</hi> in the Grove of <hi>Jrminſul.</hi>
               </note> was greatly
delighted in hunting, wherein he uſed as much
fervour as dexteritie.</p>
            <p>Now it chanced one day, that he purſuing a
Bore very eagerly, entred into a huge thicke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
which much aſtoniſhed him to behold; for
verely it was a den of Devils, where they made
very many bloudy ſacrifices: and there was ſtill
to be ſeen a huge Idol of braſſe dedicated to a
falſe Divinitie, vnder which this Bore caſually
haſtned to ſheltor himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, I who at that time accompanied <hi>Clodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus,</hi>
fayled not to give him notice it was the
Forreſt and Idol of <hi>Irminſul:</hi> and that hunting
was forbidden in that place: But hee, whether
neglecting the ſuperſtitions of a Country wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee had not yet beene naturalized, or whether
charmed with the pleaſure of chaſe, forbare
not to paſſe further, and ſlew the Bore with his
owne hand, whoſe head hee cut off, and ſhewed
it in a bravery.</p>
            <p>In the meane while (it being very ordinary
with evil ſpirits to ſpeake by Idols, and to cauſe
ſterility of ſeaſons, and ſicknes of bodies) there

was heard to proceed from this ſtatue a voyce
frightfull, and menacing: which proteſted to
act ſtrange out-rages upon the perſon of this
poore Lord, and the whole Countrey, if hee
endevoured not to afford a ſpeedie ſatisfaction.
And that which made it bee thought theſe
threats would not bee without effect, was that
<hi>Clodoaldus</hi> felt himſelfe ſodainely ſtrooken with
a dimneſſe, which for a time tooke from him the
vſe of his eyes.</p>
            <p>This vigorous ſpirit of his was ſo overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with ſuperſtition, that caſting himſelfe at
the feet of a falſe god to begge pardon; hee
yeelded up humble ſupplications, which relli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

a ſtate to yeeld to any thing, required of him for
the recovery of his ſight, made him promiſe to
ſacrifice the firſt thing he ſhould chance to meet
withall as hee returned to his houſe: He quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found by experience the temeritie of his vow

the little <hi>Iacinthus</hi> beholding his Father blinde,

bee the cauſe of his miſ-hap: whereupon hee
wept ſo bitterly, that it drew much compaſſion
from thoſe there preſent, and made all the forreſt
reſound with his out-cries. Never was the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of <hi>Iephte</hi> ſeene better perſonated: This yong
innocent held himſelfe faſt fixed to the knees of
his father, humbly beſeeching him by all that
which was moſt religious and ſacred with him
in the world, to declare the remedy might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
for his recovery; or elſe to take revenge on
him, and kill him with a Bore-ſpeare, which hee
had in his hand, proteſting he would direct the
blow, and open his breſt to the point: which
could not but find paſſage enough into the heart
of a <hi>Parricide.</hi> But the unfortunate <hi>Clodoaldus</hi>
who then felt the moſt horrible convulſions may
be imagined, concealed his wound ſo much as
hee could, as one who more apprehended the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
then the evill it ſelfe: The father, and

            <p>In the end <hi>Clodoaldus</hi> retiring ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

accident: perceiving thoſe who were
very willing to transferre the ſtorme upon their
Neighbours field to free themſelves from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
became earneſt to perſwade him ſpeedily to

ſome of them haſtned to the eare of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthus,</hi>
who preſently underſtood the knot of

ſo much the more bound to preſerve a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which hee ſaw preſt to ruine it ſelfe for him,
ran to his ſonne: Love which is too cleere ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſupplyed the defect of his eyes, and made ſo
ſtrong chaines about him of his two armes, in
holding him ſtrictly embraced, that it ſeemed
death was not ſtrong enough to diſſolue the
knots tyed by ſo great a charity: He weeping,
ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacinthus</hi> (my moſt deare ſonne) thinke I am a
Father and not a rocke: That I have all thoſe ſenſible
apprehenſions which nature can give in the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
You know your eldeſt Brother, and your Siſter
have already beene ſtollen from mee in their tender
yeeres, to make up the meaſure of ſorrow which I
conceived upon the death of your Mother: You are
not ignorant that you onely remaine after this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
ſhip-wracke, and that holding you in my
armes it ſeemes to mee I poſſeſse a broken planke of
a veſsell which bare my Treaſures: I ſaw all the
hopes of my posteritie to flouriſh againe in you: I
ſaw a ſupport of my declining yeeres: Finally I there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7777:11"/>
there beheld my fleſh and bloud, and yet have I given
away your life to purchaſe eyes for my ſelfe: and do I
throw you alive into a Tombe, and make of your
bloud a plaister to enioy a cruell health, and a life
moſt infamous? No (my ſonne) let mee rather die
in my miſeries, for which now behold mee ſtanding
within the gates of death.</p>
            <p>The good blinde man ſpeaking this, ſought
to make a Bath of his teares for this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſacrifice, whilſt others prepared one of bloud
for him, nor was it poſſible to appeaſe him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>lacinthus</hi> had promiſed, that nothing ſhould
bee done without his conſent: The youth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſeeing himſelfe free, ſecretly ſlipt
aſide with a purpoſe to viſite the Prieſts of the
Idols, and obtayne his liberty of them. But <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doaldus</hi>
deſirous to hold him perpetually (as it
were) incorporated to himſelfe, perceiving hee
was gone, entred into the furies of diſconſolate
ſorrow.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the ſacrificers being dealt
withall in the cauſe of the ſuppliant (as praetexts
of devotion are ever the moſt inexorable) grew
very ſtiffe in the bloodieſt wayes, encouraged in
this affaire by a people timerous, and ſottiſh,
who entertaine no motive more violently then
that which ſuperſtition ſuggeſteth: the poore

came to caſt himſelfe at their feet, vehemently

wherein they underſtood hee had heretofore
beene a brave Soldier, and borne armes in <hi>Thrace</hi>
vnder one called <hi>Mammuchan</hi> whom hee much
commended: That after his death he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
into many countries, and that being taken
by chance, he was ſold to give matter of paſtime
to the people in a combat with ſavage beaſts, or
to ſerve as a ſacrifice for ſome Idol: That being

hee was led along to the altar with a great

as hanſome young men, and of great hope, much
diſſwaded this enterprize which hee iudged to
have in it moſt certaine perill, and a moſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
victory: but they ſeeming to make little
account of his reaſons, he added, they were not
onely to fight againſt men, but ſavage beaſts
which kept centinel about this profane <hi>Irminſul,</hi>
and that Lyons made not any differente between
the fleſh of Peaſants, and gentlemen: But that
which was able to ſtay the moſt adventurous,
more enflamed the young valour of theſe brave
Warriors, in ſuch ſort, that they retiring into a
poore Cabin which this Soldier ſhewed them,
there to paſſe the night: they concluded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the matter the next morning.</p>
            <p>This proiect ſeemed to them not raſh at all,
for they imagined they had nothing to doe, but
to force an aſſembly of Idol-Prieſts, aſſiſted by
certaine guards (wretched enough,) and that,
were the act done, they had ſufficient intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with the Nobility of the Country to
giue order for their ſafety.</p>
            <p>The Sun ſeemed to them on that day too tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">Preparation for ſacrifice.</note>
ſuch haſte made they to enter into the Liſt:
but as they caſt their eyes on every ſide in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7777:14"/>
of this goodly ſpectacle, they afarre off
beheld all the preparation of the ſacrifice which
came out of the Caſtle to enter into the forreſt.
All this much rather reſembled ſome aſſembly
of Sorcerers, then any pompe or ceremony of
religion.</p>
            <p>Certaine Children of an ill aſpect marched
before, and were cloathed in blacke Caſſocks,
carrying ſome of them Torches, others perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-pans
in their hands: After came a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
who held a round baſon full of water, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to notifie one of the moſt neceſſary elements,
Then two other bare on their ſhoulders a little
altar of ſilver, wherein there were croſſe-barres
which diſcovered the holy fire within.</p>
            <p>The poore <hi>Iacinthus</hi> deſtined to this office ſo
magicall, was in the midſt, and ſhewed in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
a countenance confident enough. They
had clothed him with a garment of white ſattin,
and ſet on his head a Coronet of flowers, which
made him appeare amongſt theſe miniſters of
<hi>Irminſul,</hi> as the day-ſtar over the ſhades of night.
Behind him a man veſted with a looſe garment of
fine litmen without ſleeues, ſhewed a naked
ſword, which was to cut off the head of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Two or three paces behind appeared the ſhee
Prieſt <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> endowed with an exquiſite
beauty, ſhee on that day being adorned with a
garment all over tiſſued with rich embroderies,
her haire diſcheveled, and the top of her head
crowned with a little myter: ſhe alſo caried a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7777:15"/>
great ſilver charger with golden Scyzers to cut
off the tops of his haire whom they were to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
When the rayes of the Sun reflected on
the golden treſſes, and the gloſſe of her garment,
ſeemed as a ſtarre crowned with lights: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
ſhe walked along with a careleſſe pace,
and a deiected countenance, which ſufficiently
witneſſed the horror her heart conceived at theſe
hatefull ſacrifices. Then marched the high
Prieſt with a moſt awfull aſpect, attended by a
very great number of bloody Prieſts, who were
to have a ſhare in this hideous office.</p>
            <p>The gallants putting themſelues in ambuſh,
failed not very ſeaſonably to fall like Eagles vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their prey,<note place="margin">

man away: Wherevpon certaine of the guards
which encompaſſed the high Prieſt for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſacrifice, made a ſhew of reſiſtance: but
finding themſelves from the beginning of the
Combat ſo roughly handled, that ſome armes
were ſeene to fly off, they retired being as ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their owne bloud, as prodigall of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents.
Hereupon confuſion fell aſwell in
their hearts, as into the order of this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
proceſſion, every one from thence forward
thinking rather to ſave his life by the helpe of
his feet, then to accompliſh his ſuperſtition. The
matter had beene diſpatched, had it not beene
that theſe enraged Prieſts threw themſelves on
the ſacrifice, crying out, and yelling in a moſt
hideous manner. But being not able to reſiſt
the valour of theſe two generous Lions, the high
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7777:15"/>
Prieſt very cunningly told them they ſhould get
no honour by taking this young man from them
in ſuch a manner, but if they deſired to be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in a brave warfare: they ought according
to the cuſtome of the Countrey to enter into
combat with the wild beaſts which guarded the
forreſt of the god. The gallants who feared
leſt preſſing any further they might ſtifle the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Iacinthus</hi> in their hands, and having an ardent
deſire not to refuſe any occaſion which might
honour their armes, they freely accepted the
conditions, ſo that the battell with beaſts was
concluded on, and deferred but till after Dinner:
It was an exerciſe ſo ordinary with this Nation,
that ſome were found, who voluntarily ſold
themſelves to give the people this contentment;
ſome others haſtned thereunto thorough a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ambition of glory, not conſidering the
danger.</p>
            <p>The bruit thereof being ſpred abroad, the Liſts
were encompaſſed with a great number of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
who were infinitely delighted to behold
the perill of thoſe ſtrangers, in the ſafety of their
owne perſons. The high Prieſt had his ſeat in
a very eminent place, and on the other ſide <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardis</hi>
appeared among the Ladies, as a rich Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
amidſt counterfeit ſtones: Shee began
from the firſt encounter to entertaine a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the worth of theſe two gallants. But
when ſhe ſaw the braue <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> to leape confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
into the Liſt, and to expect with a ſtable
foot the dangers, which others could not behold
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7777:16"/>
without trembling: even then ſhe felt moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
affections of his perſon, and there were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
obſerved during all this ſpectacle divers
alterations of her countenance, which one while
took the ſcarlet tincture, preſently became pale:
and ſtraight ſhee lifted up her eyes towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in ſuch manner that ſhe felt a fierce combat
in her ſelfe, for him, whom ſhe had never known.
Firſt of all, a huge Beare was let looſe, who rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelfe upon his feet, made a ſhew hee
would grapple with <hi>Iſchyrion:</hi> but the excellent
Champion deelining the firſt ſeizure with a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
agility of body: thought this beaſt being
very weake about the head, it were good to aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him, which he did, when nimbly leaping on
him, and beſtriding him as a horſe, hee gave him
many blowes, wherewith the Beare became ſo
enraged, that hee many times ran up and downe
the Amphitheater as ſwift as a tempeſt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
loud out-cries were made on every ſide, the
gallant finding himſelfe aſſured of his ſeat, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly
purſued the beaſt, which utterly aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
haſtned to hide himſelfe in a corner of the
Liſt: no man being able to pricke him forward
againe to undertake the like courſe.</p>
            <p>An other beare was diſpatched againſt <hi>Fauſtin,</hi>
whom he knocked downe with a clubbe hee held
in his right hand, a matter not difficult for his
valour: ſince many Beares haue beene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
killed with blowes of the fiſt, by wraſtlers
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Amphitheater.</p>
            <p>The high Prieſt extreamly offended, cryed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7777:16"/>
out a loud to the maſter of theſe Beaſts to put
out one of his fierceſt Lions in the face of the
Combatants, which made <hi>Hildegardis</hi> waxe pale
through feare ſhe conceived therat: This king of
beaſts ſhewed in the very beginning of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
he had not much deſire to aſſaile a man: For
he long time ſtood a good diſtance off, with his
eyes fixed on the ground, ſo that needs muſt <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyrion</hi>
provoke him, which he did, throwing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Iavelin at him to ſerve as an eatrance into
this perillous Duel: Then began hee to roare
very loud, and beating his ſides with his taile,
ranne upon the gallant, who offered a Iavelin at
him which hee had in his hand, but he avoiding
the iron, flew upon the wood, which he rent, and
pulled in pieces with his teeth, thundring out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
a hideous roare which caſt aſtoniſhment
among the ſpectators: The valorous <hi>Iſchyrion</hi>
putting himſelfe into a ready poſture, drew his
ſword out of the ſcabbard, on which the beames
of the Sun reflecting; made a luſtre to ſparkle ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lively into the eyes of his adverſary which at
that time began to amaze him, and hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
hee had heard this beaſt bare part of his
ſtrength in his ſight, tooke a cloake which hee
then had wreathed about his arme: and unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it threw it very ſucceſſefully upon the eyes
of the Lion, where with he found himſelfe much
diſturbed: ſo that watching his advantage, hee
transfixed his belly with his ſword which made
him fall downe, rowling and tumbling in his
owne gore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:7777:17"/>
Vpon this atchievement the clamours were
redoubled thoroughout the Amphitheater,
ſome crying out with ioy and applauſe, others
for rage: but the high Prieſt, who at any price
would have the life of theſe ſtrangers, very vche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
declared to the people.</p>
            <p>They had killed the nurſlings of god, thorough a
moſt inſolent bravado: and that if they inſtantly reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not his quarrell, nothing might bee expected all
this whole yeere but dearths, ruines, and extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.
As for himſelfe, hee was ſatisfied with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them advice, and that if theſe his counſels were
not followed, hee at leaſt waſhed his hands from the
pollution of ſacred bloud, vnworthily ſhed before their
eyes.</p>

and impoſſible it was otherwiſe to appeaſe
it, then by the murther of a Roman Soldier, who
by chance gave the blow, not thinking thereon.
Wherefore let no man eſteeme it incredible, if
the people enflamed by the orations of the high
Prieſt for the revenge of a Beare, and a Lion, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
raiſed ſo deſperate a ſedition, that almoſt
the whole Amphitheater, fell upon the poore
Gentlemen, no man daring to afford them helpe,
and there is no doubt but they had been torne

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7777:18"/>
and ſinceritie of true amities, to ſerve for a helpe
and guide in that which wee here purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate.</p>
            <p>The Soule according to the ſaying of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,<note place="margin">Diverſitie of Loves.</note>
is a ſhipp: the rowers thereof are loves, (as
the noble <hi>Maximus</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi> hath wittily obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,)
and as among rowers there are very many
conditions: for ſome are miſerable ſlaves, who
row of neceſſity, others doe it out of bravery, or
vertue: as the incomparable King S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who
ſcorned not ſometimes to take an oare in hand
to row in ſtead of a mariner whilſt he ſent him to
learne his Catechiſme. So may we truly ſay,
there are loves wholy carnall, baſe, and terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
which abſolutely adhere to ſlavery: others
ſpirituall, noble, and worthy, which wee rather
call by the name of amities.</p>
            <p>All love hath this proper in it, it goeth, it ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
and liveth out of it ſelfe in complacence of
the thing beloved: but taketh notable differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
according to the obiects to which it adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
For the carnall, reſembling <hi>Noe's</hi> Raven, is
wholly confined to carrion, and ends in bruitiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse.
The Spirituall tendeth to vertues, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
to the lively images of honeſty, which
have in them contentments, and delights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable.</p>
            <p>It is very true, this <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> who as yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in gentiliſme, could not imprint foot-ſteps
totally purified in theſe amities: yet was there
nothing carnall and groſſe in it, for ſhee felt her
heart worthily entertained with the image of a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7777:18"/>
great goodneſſe, and equall worth, which ſhe ſaw
reſplendent in theſe gallants, ſince they had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expoſed themſelves to death for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a perſon, who according to the iudgment
of all the world nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned them, &amp; had ſo
bravely carried themſelves in the field of battell.
Behold the way wherein ordinarily ſpirituall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
inſiſt,<note place="margin">Proceeding of ſpirituall amities.</note> they begin by admiration of ſome
excellency: which being a ray of the Divinitie
ſtriketh the underſtanding: and as the carnall
is taken in the ſnare which the fleſh ſtretcheth
foorth, ſo the ſpirituall eye is enflamed, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
with the obiect of a Spirituall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>This admiration is attended by another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
which is the conformity of the will, with
that good which is propoſed unto it, cauſing the
ſoule to begin to take fire, and force ſparkes of
deſire to flie out in courting that good, ſhee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
unto herſelfe. Then it gaineth another
degree, which is, that of ſharpe and ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence,
pleaſingly entertained with the
thoughts of its obiect: one while in hope to
poſſeſſe it, another while in feare to looſe it: and
with ſundry other paſſions which accompanie
this delectation, as yet painfull, and ſuffering:
From complacence one is tranſported to a
ſearch, where love aſſumeth wings to flie to the
boſome of its repoſe, therein imploying all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
meanes to content it ſelfe: and if it be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
in its purſuit, it commeth to mutuall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of wills, of affections, good turnes, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7777:19"/>
and preſence from whence finally ariſeth
another complacence no longer laborious,<note place="margin">Divers agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mind in <hi>Hildegardis.</hi>
               </note> and
embroyled, but ſatisfied, and pleaſed in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its obiect. This poore mayd not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, ranne thorough all theſe degrees in a
very ſhort time: For after her heart was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with admiration of the great and heroicke
vertues of theſe yong warriors: ſhe felt her faire
ſoule infinitely tranſported to wiſh them well:
and as ſhee ſaw their innocency unworthily op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
under the Tyranny of the high Prieſt,
ſo compaſſion comming to entermingle with
admiration, they emulouſly blew thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
flames, with which her heart was enkindled.
The entred ſhe into languors, which were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoft, nor effeminate, into ardours ſweet, and
ſpritefull, which gave to her heart an operation
perpetually labouring for accompliſhment of
the good ſhee propoſed to her ſelfe. Shee was
bent on this deſigne and reſiſted with animoſity
of imaginations, all the obſtacles which feare
did preſent her. It ſeemed to her, that ſhould
ſhe hew thorough mountaynes, paſſe thorough
thornes and burning ſerpents, ruſh among ſwords
and launces, her happineſſe would never bee too
dearely purchaſed: She had but one deſire, which
was to diſſolue her heart into him, who had ſo
gloriouſly gained it.</p>
            <p>When ſhe returned from the Amphitheater
to her lodging, ſhe took a ſingular contentment
to diſcourſe with her ſelfe what had paſſed, and
although the condition of affaires permitted not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7777:19"/>
freedome of ſpeech, ſhe notwithſtanding ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
diſcovered her ſelfe more to incline to pity,
then rigour: and if ſome one ſpake any word in
favour of the priſoners, ſhee began to hold
him in good eſteeme, as a faithfull ſervant, and
worthy inſtrument of her pretentions.</p>
            <p>But when ſhee retired into her chamber to
take ſome repoſe, (as ſolitude and night are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to foſter paſſions) that was the time thoſe
cares which were in the bottome of her ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to breake forth, and dilate themſelves in a
very long traine of confuſed and ill digeſted pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
            <p>All the combat which paſſed in the circuit of
the Liſts was renewed in the cloſure of her heart,
ſtil the brave <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> returned into her thoughts
one while how he chaſed the Beare, then how he
overthrew the Lyon, ſometime how hee was all
covered over with ſweat and bloud amongſt the
huge heapes of the dead, which fell under the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of his victorious hands: But when ſhe came
to conſider the fetters on his feet in this darke
dungeon, and that ſhee reflected upon this infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſacrifice wherein ſhe was to bee imployed in
the deſtruction of the moſt lovely creature of the
world; ſhee was engulfed in the horror and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment
of her thoughts. The mournefull
virgin a hundred and a hundred times deteſted
the day which deſtined her to this abhominable
condition; ſhe curſed to all the furies of Hell,
both Prieſt, altars, and ſacrifices to which ſhee
had hitherto offered her ſervice thorough a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7777:20"/>
which had therein as much infamy,
as credulity.</p>
            <p>It was the time, that all living creatures were
involved in the veyle of night, and charmed with
the naturall ſweetneſſe of ſleepe, when the ſad
<hi>Hildegardis</hi> like a ſick eie, did nothing but watch,
weepe, and tremble for her wel-beloved: One
while unable any longer to endure the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
of her bed, as if it had beene the cauſe
of her cares, ſhe walked up and downe her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
like a ghoſt; ſometimes ſhee opened the
window, and ſeeing Heaven enameled with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of ſtars: ſhee ſaid to herſelfe; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſo many eyes which watch in this great
Temple of God, is there not ſome one that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
the commiſſion of the events of the
world, which may command ſome ray to ariſe in
the confuſion of my affaires? Then remembring
within her ſelfe the contentment of her fathers
houſe, which ſhe had taſted in her moſt innocent
yeeres: her taking away, her fortune, her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
the tedious yeeres, which ſaw her
drenched in this miſerable ſervitude; ſhe breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
foorth ſighes, and moyſtened her boſome
with teares, which ſeemed, ought to be without
meaſure, as her evill was without remedy.</p>
            <p>Sometime it came into her thoughts, that
perhaps ſome divine power had ſent theſe two
young gallants for her deliverance, and that ſhee
ſhould not refuſe the good fortune which now
did (as it were) knocke at her dore, then inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhee ſmiled at her owne imagination, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7777:20"/>
thorough an infinite care ſhe had to preſerve her
virginity perpetually inviolable: it ſeemed to
her that her minde was too much employed on
the image of her deare <hi>Iſchyrion;</hi> her young heart
which had not learned to love any creature in
this manner, doubted her firſt flames, and feared
to truſt her ſelfe with her owne ſecret.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe blamed her owne ſimplicity as too
ſcrupulous, being perſwaded ſhee ought not to
reſiſt the inſpiration of ſo holy an amity, and that
this fire was not unlike the rayes of the Sunne
which enkindle the <hi>Phoenix</hi> his neſt.</p>
            <p>If in the agitation of her thoughts ſhe ſtrove
to ſhut an eye; her repoſe was preſently aſſailed
with affrightments, and fantaſies which figured
unto her hideous images of her calamity: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhee thought ſhe ſaw her beſt beloved cut
in peeces in this moſt enormous ſacrifice, and
that hee implored her aide with a dying voice:
One while ſhe brake priſon with him, and found
therein reſiſtance that hindered her deſignes: an
other while ſhee ranne thorough frightfull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
and wilderneſſes, in the company of her <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyrion:</hi>
another while ſhe ſayled vpon ſeas full
of Monſters, and Tempeſts, and in an inſtant, ſaw
her ſelfe ſurpriſed by the high Prieſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
her with ingratitude, and infidelity:
His menacing countenance purſued her as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of hell, it ſhut her up in dungeons, it put
fetters on her feet, and hands, it, in her opinion
condemned her to dye in flames, and to ſerue for
a ſpectacle of terrour to all thoſe, who had ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7777:21"/>
her as a Divinity. Amongſt all theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
ſhee had not any thought more ſweet than
death, which ſhee began to reflect on with an
amorous eye, as the Haven of the perturbations
of her minde. She perſwaded her ſelfe, that who
can no longer hope for ought, ſhould feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and that the moſt undoubted remedy of
all miſeries was the extremity of thoſe miſeries,
which ended in the laſt period of their violence,
ſince the divine providence hath not made an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
evill, for things mortall.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as ſhee ſaw the firſt rayes of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to breake forth, ſhe went to ſeeke out her
faithfull <hi>Araſpus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hildegardis</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her purpoſe to foſter-Father <hi>Araſpus.</hi>
               </note> who was at that time the only
creature of the world, into whoſe heart ſhe might
powre forth her thoughts with full ſecurity: He
was her foſter father, bred up formerly in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe, a man of extraction noble enough,
witty, and couragious, no whit degenerating
from his Nobility. Hee had ever bred the yong
Mayd with unſpeakable tenderneſſe, and being
in her company when ſhe was ſurprized, had put
himſelfe into defence, and received ſome wounds
which cauſed him ſtil to cary notable characters
of his loyalty. Afterwards hee being taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with her by theſe theeves: they ſeeing
the childe was in danger of death if ſhee loſt the
company of this man, thought it unfit to remove
him from her. And he being very diſcreet, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
got credit among the Barbarians, mannaging
with much dexterity the ſafety and repoſe of
his <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> untill ſuch time as God ſent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7777:21"/>
ſome fayre occaſion to worke her libertie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araſpus</hi> then ſeeing her enter into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
well perceived ſhe was not in any good tune,
and ſaid unto her: <hi>Daughter, what brings you hither?
Hee who ſhould behold your countenance would thinke
your mind were full of diſcontent.</hi> But ſhe at that
time laying aſide all complements, and thinking
of nothing but to empty her heart of what ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
it: demaunded of him, whither hee had
thoroughly obſerved all that paſſed in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of theſe gallants, and hee replying one muſt
be without eyes, if they were not open to behold
ſo prodigious valour. This word extremely
pleaſed the faithfull Lover, and gave her occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to enlarge upon their praiſe with diſcourſes
ſuperlative enough, which ſhe could not end, but
with compaſſion of their miſery: for ſhe bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bewayled to ſee ſuch eminent vertues under
the knife of furies. But <hi>Araſpus</hi> ſeeking to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her, and ſhewing that in a matter already
paſſed we have no better remedy then forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and in caſe of impoſſibility, no other power
but the acknowledgement of our infirmities, ſhe
wide opened her heart, and ſaid unto him,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Araſpus,)</hi> you know you have beene obliged to all our
family, and by how many titles I may account you mine:
Needs muſt I confeſse, ſince my misfortune hath enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
mee with captivity, I have ever caſt an eye on you, as
an Angel-guardian appointed by the gods for my ſafety.
I have made you the depoſitory of all my croſſes, counſels,
all my thoughts: and if in ſuch confuſion of affaires, I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7777:22"/>
have received any hope, I no ſooner felt it bud in my hart,
but have beene willing to make it bloome in your boſome.
You are not ignorant that ſince my captivity I have lived
on gall and teares, nor have found anything elſe then
thornes in an age, wherein Mayds of my condition uſe not
to walke but on roſes. How often have you ſeene mee in
the acceſses of ſorrow, ſo violent, as they were able to rend
my ſoule foorth, if my good <hi>Genius</hi> had not preſerved
it for a more proſperous fortune: you uſed to tell mee
I muſt bee patient, and that a happy day would come
which ſhould breake my fetters, and wipe away all my
teares. Now know (my deare <hi>Araſpus)</hi> that day is
come that if I once neglect my happineſse, it will paſse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
nor ever ſhall I againe ſo much as touch the tips of
its wings. It is moſt undoubted that Heaven ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſome pitty on my griefe, hath ſent us theſe two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
of whoſe ſtrength and valour you have had teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
enough, wherefore I am reſolved by ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſet them at liberty, and ſuffer them to take mee
from hence, that ſo I may bee reſtored to my Fathers
houſe. This is a plot which cannot bee condemned by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who have not utterly abandoned humane affection.</p>
            <p>And if you alleage, you therein finde very many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties;
I anſwere, good things are not otherwiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsed:
All muſt be hazarded to gaine all, at the worſt
I have nothing to looſe; but a moſt miſerable life. If
you will not expoſe your ſelfe to perill in this affaire: at
leaſt deny mee not your counſell. The ſubſtance of it I
put not into deliberation, I onely aske what courſe wee
muſt hold in the execution.<note place="margin">

bold proiect of this ſpirit, which had never beene
unfolded in ſuch manner, and aſſuredly iudged
this cogitation had gayned ſo deepe roots in her
heart, that it would be a matter very difficult to
oppoſe her reſolutions. Notwithſtanding he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:
<hi>(Moſt deare daughter) it were ſuperfluous to
entertaine you with diſcourſe of the ſervices I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to your noble Family: yea, much leſse on the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
and ardent affections which tranſport me to deſire
your liberty, wherein I behold mine owne engaged:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beleeve mee (ſweet creature) you ill deſire the beſt
thing in the world, and by making an attempt unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
you ruine all your endevours for the future. You
will not (as far as I can perceive) deſcend from your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but by precipitation, and once to preſerve your ſelfe
contrary to the rules of prudence, you reioyce to undoe
your ſelfe for ever, by the wayes of temerity. All that,
which ordinarily is uſed to deſtroy good affaires, is it
which now you employ to make yours ſucceſsefull Paſſion,
Diſorder, Haſt, Precipitation, hold counſell in your yong
heart, whilſt reaſon is exiled: You ſpeake of ſetting
theſe two young Gentlemen at libertie: how would you
give tha to others, which you have not your ſelfe? Is
there not a gaoler at the gates of theſe priſons? Are
there not guards in the Caſtle? Are there not centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
who watch on all ſides? And were all of them faſt
a ſleepe, what meanes will there bee to deceive a Prieſt
who hath <hi>Argos</hi> eyes perpetually open upon your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
nay, ſhould you break two iron gates, three others
would make reſiſtance. This whole Caſtle is (as it were)
nothing but a continuall priſon, wherein the birds of the
ayre would have enough to doe to ſave themſelves? But
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7777:23"/>
if it once happen you bee ſurprized in the act, (of which
there are very ſtrong apparances) you thruſt your ſelfe
into hazard, either to bee burnt alive, or to involve your
whole life in the deepeſt miſeries which may bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But (daughter) had you all you could deſire to
your hearts wiſh: can you thinke it were fit to put your
ſelfe into the hands of theſe young ſtrangers, who for the
moſt part have no more fidelity then the ſea, and winds?
Remember, you hitherto have preſerved the precious
treaſure of virginity, wherein the lawes of the Countrey
have infinitely favoured you, and that there needs but
one houre to looſe that in peace, which hath been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by ten yeeres warre. This vertue (if you know it
not) is all of glaſse, one unadviſed touch of the finger, is
of power to breake it in the brighteſt ſplendor of its
luſtre.</p>
            <p>Behold your ſelfe now in an eſtate wherein you have
gained reputation, and honours are done you as to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity:
Let time ſweetly ſlide away, and expect till the
fruit be ripe, which of it ſelfe will fall. We heare the
ſtandards of <hi>Charlemaign</hi> the prime Monarch of the
world, menace this Countrey: what know you whether
heaven have not put your freedome and happineſſe into
his hands. But (deare and moſt honoured Lady) if you
have heretofore made ſome account of my words, at this
time deſpiſe not my teares. Yeeld your ſelfe up to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſo to render you to your ſelfe. I have ever heard it
ſayd, that the counſels of youth have much promptneſſe,
but repentance which followes them, doth likewiſe finde
them out with ready wing: and never leaves them, but
with leaden feet.</p>
            <p>This Oration ſtrengthened with wiſedome,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7777:23"/>
and affection, ought to have made a powerfull
impreſſion on the heart of a veſtall: But we muſt
affirme it is one of the greateſt miracles in the
world to make a creature of this ſexe, which hath
given admittance to ſome violent paſſion, freely
to doe homage to a truth acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Affections are oft-times as eaſily put on,<note place="margin">Sticking paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> as a
ſhirt, but if we ſpeake of diſpoyling them, it is
found they ſticke much cloſer then the skinne.
Should you alleage a thouſand reaſons to a ſoule
ſurprized with ſelfe-love, you ſhall gaine but this
one concluſion: <hi>I know what I have to doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea it hath beene many times obſerved in the
experiments of humane life,<note place="margin">Proper iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be feared in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</note> that perſons who
make profeſſion of a life moſt eminent, and to be
purified, and refined in devotion, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things divine, if they be not fore-armed
with profound humility, doe eagerly ſticke to
their owne opinion, nay certainly you ſhall find
of them, who after they have overcome divels,
become divels to themſelves. <hi>Hildegardis</hi> was
in an age, and a degree wherein the words of this
good man had no longer that effect which they
formerly had in her education.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange to ſee how ſoone lovers and ſicke
folkes become angry: ſhee ſo with-ſtood his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that ſhe doubted not to ſay to poore <hi>Araſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prudence of <hi>Araſpus.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>That either hee was a coward, or a Traytor to
her fortune: and that notwithſtanding all this diſcourſe,
ſhee was reſolved either to flie, or die.</hi> Hee, who
ſaw this ſpirit like to a ſwolne ſea, thought it
was but to looſe words to ſpeak in ſo impetuous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7777:24"/>
aſtorme of paſſion: but not wholy to diſengage
her from his counſell, yeelding to the time hee
very gently ſaid, wee muſt then endevour to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
this buſineſſe with a ſoft touch, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
no part hereof to any, who is not worthy of
much truſt: for oftentimes too many Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and counſellers overthrow ſicke bodies, and
doubtfull cauſes: So much reioyced ſhe in this
conſent, that inſtantly caſting her ſelfe about his
necke, ſhe embraced him, craving pardon, and
promiſing that all this deſigne ſhould proceed
according to his intentions, that he alone ſhould
diſpoſe all things neceſſary for their departure:
and ſhee her ſelfe undertake the reſt.</p>
            <p>It is moſt true, her credit was not ſmall, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that theſe Barbarians honoured this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of virgins, whom they ſerved in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as a Divinity, <hi>Hildegardis</hi> by her ſweet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and obliging courteſies in the ſpace of
Foureteene or Fifteene yeeres, had with eaſe gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
good ſervants, who ſhee thought would not
faile her at her need: ſhee likewiſe had ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
a power to viſit priſons, to enter into dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many times at her requeſt to enlarge pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
as it ſeemed to promiſe her much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a project, which was otherwiſe impoſſible:
It alſo happened very fortunately, that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of offenders was put off till another day,
for certaine cuſtomes of antiquity, and religion,
that are ſtrong chaines among people, and which
gave her full ſcope to accompliſh her deſires.<note place="margin">Power of women.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Wee daily ſee among many occurrents of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7777:24"/>
that to be verified, which an ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſaid, who having made a large recitall of all
the naturall armes which God giveth creatures:
he affirmes a women eminently hath them all,
and that there is neither fire, nor ſword, which
yeeldeth not either to beauty, or cunning wyles
which with them are very frequent. She is able
to walke thorough a Corps-du-guard, to pierce
Rockes, and to ſeat her ſelfe in places, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can penetrate, but lightning. <hi>Hildegardis</hi>
ſo mannaged her buſineſſe in a ſhort time, that a
hundred iron gates were all-moſt ready to fly
open at her command.</p>
            <p>Shee having diſpoſed ſo many affections to
her ſervice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hildegardis</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteth the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</note> failed not to viſite the priſoners,
whom ſhe knew naturally, much to deſire their
liberty. Shee went about mid-night into the
dungeon, accompanied only with a truſty maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant,
and a page, who bare a Torch before
them: The poore gentlemen extremely weary
with the labours of the former day, and who after
ſo great a perplexity of thoughts, began to ſleep
upon their ſadneſſe, hearing the great dore to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
with a confuſed noiſe: they ſuddenly awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but when they beheld this heavenly face
which promiſed more day-light to their affaires,
then the torch could afford to their eyes, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
unto them ſome Divinity favourable to
their affections, was deſcended into the dungeon
to comfort them: but perceiving it was the ſhe-Prieſt
of the Temple, which had charge to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the ſacrifices, they were ſomewhat aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7777:25"/>
But the generous <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> cried out aloud,
<hi>(Madame) what is the matter, come you then to leade
us out to butchery?</hi> Shee deſirous to ſound them,
anſwered, <hi>(Sir,) trouble not your ſelfe, but as you
have fought valiantly, diſpoſe your ſelves to die bravely.</hi>
To which he replyed, he was already thoroughly
prepared, and asked her if it were ſhe muſt do the
deed? To which ſhe anſwered: That never had
ſhe learned the trade to cut mens throats, but
that ſhe was onely to aſſiſt in the ſacrifice: and to
cut off the tipps of the victimes haire, to throw
the firſt fruits into the flames.</p>
            <p>I, at the leaſt render thankes to my fortune
(ſaith <hi>Faustin)</hi> that we are fallen into ſo good a
hand: and that ſince wee muſt needes die, our
death ſhall be honoured with the eyes of ſuch a
beauty. Vpon this <hi>Hildegardis</hi> felt her heart ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
and ſtood ſome diſtance of time without
ſpeaking one word: caſting her eyes on the yong
<hi>Iacinthus,</hi> kept in the ſame dungeon: and who
notwithſtanding the light and voice ſtill ſlept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely.
Behold (ſaith <hi>Iſchyrion)</hi> how this child
doth allie the brother to the ſiſter, that is, ſleepe
to death? <hi>Why ſhould wee ſo much feare death, ſince
to ſpeake truly it is (as it were) nothing elſe but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
once for all, what</hi> Iacinthus <hi>now doth, and what
wee daily doe many times.</hi> Then turning himſelfe
with a ſmiling countenance to the veſtall, (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame)
ſaith he ſhould wee dare to hope a favour
from you, we would not beg life: For wee know
wee are accounted in the number of the moſt
wretched ſacrifices, and that the people muſt be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7777:25"/>
appeaſed by our death: Doe then but ſave this
little innocent, pardon the tenderneſſe of his age,
take pity on the ſorrow of his father: verely we
may vaunt even in theſe dungeons, hee is our
deare conqueſt, and that we have purchaſed him
in a ſharpe combat, at the price of our bloud:
which cauſeth his death to afflict us more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
then our owne.</p>
            <p>At this word <hi>Hildegardis</hi> breathed foorth a
deepe ſigh, which ſhee notwithſtanding ſought
to ſmoother: yet turning to her companion, ſhe
ſaid,</p>
            <p>Verely this heart is truly generous, what could
hee doe more, ſhould hee pleade his brothers

reſolution? <hi>It is fittest for ſuch to live, ſince they ſo
well know how to uſe life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therevpon drawing neere vnto him, (Sir ſaid
ſhee,) Doe me the honour to tell me your name,
and what you are: He replyed there needed in
him for ſacrifice, but body and ſoule, as for his
name, it ſerved for no other uſe. <hi>That all which
miſerable men can doe, is wiſely to conceale themſelves,
and that among diſaſters the moſt ſecret were ever the
beſt for generous ſoules.</hi> This anſwere more enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
the curioſity of the Lady to enquire after
that, which he was willing to diſſemble, ſo that
ſeeing himſelfe preſſed on all ſides, he ſaid, (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame)
I am called <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> ſince you muſt needs
know it, and I intreat you to thinke, I doe not
now begin to fight with Monſters; for my whole
life reſembleth thoſe pieces of Tapiſtry, where
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7777:26"/>
Dragons are ſeene among golden apples; It is a
perpetuall web of miſeries, and glories; there
was never any thing ſo various: I have beene
told I ſprang from regall bloud, but being
very young, and unknowne, was ſtolne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by Pirates, and then recovered againe by
ſhepherds; whereof <hi>Thoas,</hi> the moſt eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, was pleaſed to breed mee with his
owne ſonne <hi>Fauſtin</hi> here preſent; with whom I
have vowed a moſt faithfull and ſtrict amity:
After that, I had a vehement deſire to travell all
the world over with him, and to make enquiry
into my birth, which I have hitherto done: nor
is there any place of fame in the habitable world,
to which in this my youth I have not travelled,
and ennobled it with ſome conqueſt: wee toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have ſeene above a hundred times the gates
of death wide open to receive us; but ſtill our
good <hi>Genius</hi> found ſome way for our deliverance,
untill now I ſee no helpe at all: verely in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
death alone muſt ſhew mee the place,
where my parents are.</p>
            <p>He cut off theſe words very ſhort, unwilling
to ſeeme either vaine-glorious in recitall of
his owne adventures, or ſuppliant to purchaſe
life by the hiſtory of his travels: But ſhee who
conſidered theſe diſcourſes, like unto Pictures
which tell more then they expreſſe: not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any longer to diſſemble her heart, which ſhee
ſeemed to diſtill with her teares, having broken
ſome very deepe ſobs, ſaid unto him,</p>
            <p>Worthy ſir, and friend: God hath not created
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7777:26"/>
me a rocke to be inſenſible of humane miſeries:
I plainly ſee your atchievements very neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the fortunes of our houſe, and it ſeemes
the web of our deſtinies hath paſſed thorough
the one, and the ſame hand: For my father
had a ſonne taken from him when he was very
young; a while after the death of his wife,
(my thrice honoured Mother) which drenched
him into ſo deep a ſorrow, that thorough griefe
he expected death. Hee notwithſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
himſelfe in me, beholding me in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
yeeres, of a nature very cheerefull: and
doubted not but that I in time might bring him
a ſonne, on whom he might repoſe his decaying
age. But who is able to penetrate the turnes,
and winding wayes of this great Laborinth of
time? and the employments of worldly affaires:
In a ſhort ſpace I was ſnatched from him by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
theft; leaving him with a childe yet in
the Cradle, and after many adventures, I have
ſcene my ſelfe confined to this place of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres,
to become the moſt unfortunate creature of
the World.</p>
            <p>But now that I may ſpeake vnto you with an
open heart, I every moment die; and each day a
thouſand times abhor my wretched life, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
vnder the moſt infamous tyranny, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to a creature of my condition. Wherefore
(moſt heroicke and generous gentlemen) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure
you by your inviolable friendſhip, your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
your danger, and mine; take mee from
hence, to reſtore me to the houſe of my Father.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7777:27"/>
Save your owne lives to preſerve mine; and think
not you atchieve a ſlight conqueſt in redeeming
your owne ſelves, and making mee a paterne of
your triumph, for perhaps it may proove one of
the moſt glorious acts, which the Sun enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
or the earth ſuſtaineth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> well perceived ſhee had taken fire, and
that ſhe ſpake in a good tone, ſince ſhe ſeaſoned
every word with her tears: Notwithſtanding
to make her give more luſtre to this diſcourſe, he
ſaid unto her; Madame, it is to make triall of us,
and to ſound if in theſe images of death wee bee
capable of vaine hopes? If you wiſhed us ſo
well, as your words witneſſe; you might finde
men fit enough to yeeld you true ſervice. How
(Sir) replyeth ſhee, doe yee thinke theſe words
which I moyſten with the waters of mine eyes,
are counterfeit? I command in this place, and
have abſolute power to ſet you all at liberty, to
mount you on horſebacke, to arme you, ſo that
you employ the ſword which I will put into

            <p>The brave <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> became wholly raviſhed

their irons to be ſtrucken off; and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the houre of their departures, which was to
be the ſame night. Behold hopes in flowre, the
moſt ſweet and charming of the world: but they
were ſodainly blaſted by a furious ſtorm of haile.</p>
            <p>There was a certaine Damſell among the
virgins of the Temple called <hi>Geronda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hildegardis</hi> betrayed.</note> of an

ſhe conceived againſt the poore <hi>Hildogardis:</hi>
and this occaſion ſeemed unto her the moſt
happy opportunity, which might bee found for
her ends. It is a ſtrange thing, how the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
friendſhips of the world, oftentimes dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into the vehement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt enmities:<note place="margin">What worldly amities are.</note> and that
the moſt deſperate hatreds are ſuch as ſpring
from love ill mannaged. There are certaine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ill diſpoſed (ſay Phyſioians) that quickly
putrifie in balme, which is made to hinder cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
ſo are their hearts which draw corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from love; from whence they ſhould derive
immortality.</p>
            <p>Theſe two virgins had been bred together from
their moſt tender yeeres; and were ſo ſtraightly
linked in amity that they had but one heart
betweene them. <hi>Geronda</hi> ſprang from one of the
beſt families of the Countrey; being placed in
this Caſtle of <hi>Irminſul,</hi> to bee trayned up with
the virgins; and ſeeing ſhee came at the ſame
time, when the young <hi>Hildegardis</hi> was brought
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7777:28"/>
thither, ſhe was from her child-hood ſo taken,
with her worthy diſpoſition, that ſhee neither
had contentment, nor life, but in her converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The beame doth not more accompany the
Sunne, nor the ſhadow the body, then theſe
two creatures eſteemed one another; they equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhared all their ioyes, and diſcontents, all their
affaires, all their recreations, and ſeemed willing
to diſſolue their hearts, as one would melt one
peece of waxe into another.</p>
            <p>Behold, there is a certaine malignity in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
things, which ſo handleth the matter, that
they never are ſo neere declining, as when they
arrive at the higheſt period of their happineſſe:
nay, the ſame is obſerved in the loves of the
world, which inſenſibly wither away, when they
are mounted to the higheſt point of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
which nature can expect. The great
fervours of theſe two companions changed firſt
into a coldneſſe; from coldneſſe, into diſtaſte;
from diſtaſte into averſion; from averſion into
enmity. It is true the ſpirit of <hi>Hildegardis</hi> was
too free and generous to give occaſion that ſuch
effects ſhould grow from her: but the other was
double, crafty, malicious, ayming at particular
ends; and walked in the way of not loving any
body; in that ſhe was too much fixed on the
loue of her ſelfe. Theſe fractions began by
petty jealouſies, which in that ſexe are very
frequent: For many with paſſion deſire to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
beloved, and courted; thinking a great
affront is put upon them, when they are ſet in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7777:28"/>
number of things indifferent. The worthy and
eminent quallities, which our <hi>Hildegardis</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from nature, as a dowry: and comming to
ſprout with yeeres, as flowers which ſpred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the rayes of the Sunne; was the cauſe
that courtſhips, ſervices, and admirations ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely to be made for her. <hi>Geronda,</hi> who was
entertained in her affection, thought to divide
her happineſſe with her, as ſhe did her heart: grew
very angry to ſee her too much courted, and
thought the honour done to her companion, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to her diſadvantage. From this jealouſie,
envie was created, which diſcoloured her face,
caſt poyſon into her veynes; withered her up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live:
and made her to behold all the proſperities
of this admirable mayd with the ſame eye, the
Owle doth the Sunne.</p>
            <p>When for merit ſhe was choſen out to be the
Princeſſe of virgins; this envious heart was
wounded to the quicke at this election, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not to condemne her diſcretion, and cariage:
rayſing a great ſtorme of fruitleſſe words, like to
a cloud; which growne big with flames and
tempeſt, cracks it ſelfe in vaine upon the top of
the higheſt rockes.</p>
            <p>It happened the innocent <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured
to cure this envenomed ſpirit; having
diſcovered ſome paſſages, where-into ſhee very
far had proceeded, reproached her with it, which
in the proud ſpirit of the other, not able ſo eaſily
to digeſt it; bred a mortall hatred, which never
ceaſed to hatch the vengeance in her boſom, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7777:29"/>
was in the end diſcovered in this miſchievous
occaſion. It is evidently to be ſeen in all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
that affections which are truly naturall,
not ſpeaking of the fire, which enflameth Angels
in heaven, and the moſt purified hearts on earth,
are clouds without water; which rent aſunder
with the leaſt ſhocke: and bring nothing foorth,
but winde.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen ſome who have taken much paines
to decide in what ſexe the moſt conſtant amities
may bee found:<note place="margin">Amity in what ſexe moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note> nor am I ignorant that divers
Ladies of honour have by all meanes endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to draw the palme of victory to their ſide, (as
we have ſeene examples very ſingular of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act

<hi>Blaunch,</hi> who deſpiſing the love of <hi>Actoline,</hi> that

the hands of Soldiers, that ſhe might haſten to
breathe out her life on the Tombe of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
to whom ſhe at firſt had reſigned her
heart.</p>
            <p>On the other part we may likewiſe produce an
infinite number of men, who have done wonders
unheard of; and not to be imagined in matter of
amity; as that <hi>Dandamis</hi> (of whom <hi>Lucan</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,)
who paſſed over a huge River by ſwimming
among haile-ſtormes of <hi>Tartarian</hi> arrowes, which

begin fervently, proceed with fury, and
end with ingratitude. Women alſo conſidered
in the infirmities of nature; they being full of
imaginations above all the creatures of the
world (ſaid an ancient) have beene tranſported,
and have entertained affections very variable,
eaſily ſticking on all ſorts of obiects; and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

to be enſnared with novelties; to grow paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

there are no conſtant friendſhips, but thoſe
which are honeſt, and watered with the ſources
of grace; from which this <hi>Geronda</hi> being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

            <p>The high Prieſt having received notice of that

the Priſon, attended by his gards, where he found

under her feet, even to the <hi>Abyſse,</hi> ſo much was ſhe
oppreſſed with griefe, and confuſion. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
being very diſcreet, ſhe in ſuch a ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
forgot not the ſubtilties of her ſexe: for ſhe
proteſted that by the duty of her charge, ſhee
came to ſound theſe priſoners, of purpoſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
whither they were pure, and perfect enough
to bee ſacrificed, but that by relation of their
lives ſhe found they were ſo deſpicable, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
vagabonds, that it were but to put a ſcorne
upon the great <hi>Irminſul,</hi> to yeeld ſuch an oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And as for the fetters taken from them, they
had begged to get this releaſe, ſo to gaine one
houre of repoſe, which ſhe had granted them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a good and ſure guard. The high Prieſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7777:30"/>
out aloud hereupon. <hi>Behold a ſhameleſſe creature,
ſhall wee then beleeve that ſhe is a virgin?</hi> It is the
golden lockes of this young ſtranger, that hath
woven nets for her profane heart; It is thoſe
eyes, which have enkindled ſo many flames in her
affections, and made her put on a reſolution to
to forſake god and his Temple, to follow an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer.
Shee very ſenſible of reproach in the
point of honour, entred upon his ſpeech into a
deſperate mood; calling the high Prieſt Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
Raviſher, Bloud-ſucker, crafty cheater,
with all the iniurious words which paſſion could
ſuggeſt: Whereupon hee cauſed her to be layd
hold on with her truſty friend, and to be put into
a dungeon apart: loading the priſoners with
more irons, and changing the guards.</p>
            <p>The miſerable <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> forgetting his priſon,
and chaines, ſighed out all the reſt of the night
for his deareſt <hi>Hildegardis;</hi> he complained, that
it being once in his power to die, hee would
needs live to the prejudice of a ſoule ſo precious:
he asked a hundred bodies of the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to ſuffer in a thouſand and a thouſand
members, if it were poſſible; and to ſatisfie the
cruelty of theſe <hi>Tartarians,</hi> ſo they would ſpare
her, who (it ſeemed to him) was worthy to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue
all ages.</p>
            <p>The next morning a bruit was ſpred thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Towne,<note place="margin">Paſſions of the high Prieſt</note> that the Veſtall had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to betray the Temple: that ſhe was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and that they went about to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her. And verily the high Prieſt, who for a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7777:31"/>
long time obſerved ſome coldneſſe in her, and
had lately beene ſo touched to the quicke, was
reſolved to ſatisfie his paſſion, under colour of
ſervice of the gods, and to ruine this poore
maid, to ſubrogate another in her place; whom
he thought would prove more plyant to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds.
For this cauſe he called together an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of Prieſts, Iudges, and Magiſtrates,
whereof divers had already ſold themſelues, to
become the inſtruments of his vengeance; Hee
likewiſe willed the mournfull <hi>Hildegardis</hi> to be
brought forth in the quality of an offendor, ſhe
having manacles on her hands, which made her
a ſpectacle of pitty to all thoſe who had ſeene
her tryumphant in the glorious Liſt of Honors
rendered her by this Nation.</p>
            <p>When they went about to handle the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fact; and that they moſt ſeverely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogated
hereupon all which had paſſed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Maid, who reſolved never to begge life

               <hi>(Sirs,)</hi> There needeth neither flames, nor tortures
to evict from me the truth, thereof I have ever made ſo
ſingular an account; and which I would not in any ſort
falſifie, though with the hazard of my life. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
my ſelfe to have deſerved death for two crimes,
whereof the firſt is, That I have lived in this place
longer then was ſit for an innocent; and much more then
was expedient for a miſerable creature: I ſhould have
done that ſooner which I performed too late: but the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7777:31"/>
feare to die once ought not ſtill to have extended my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe
ſo farre, as to make me die daily.</p>
            <p>The ſecond crime I have committed, is to have ſo ill
mannaged a glorious action; ſo that now to day my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and thoughts muſt be accuſed, which ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have been knowne before the execution of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes:
if heaven had affo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rded mee more happineſſe, or
them fidelity, who moſt baſely have diſcovered my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
            <p>Behold, all which burdeneth my conſcience, and which
makes mee hate the life I have ſo ill employed. As for
the reſt of the accuſations, they are built on ſo slight
foundations, that as mine enemies cannot propoſe them
without confuſion; ſo may not I refute them, without
arrogating to my ſelfe that glory, which I now affect not.
Have I not (I pray) committed a goodly crime in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
liberty, and ſtudying a leſsen which publike voice
teacheth us, which lawes approve, which all men practiſe,
which nature distateth to little Nightingales even in
their cages? Had I beene taken in the wars, my unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſse
would not have deprived me of my right, which is
to ſeeke for the comfort of its being, to unloſe the chaines
of captivity; and to diſsolue by vertue (as much as we
may) the miſeriès of evill fortune. And who ſees not that
by a more juſt reaſon, being taken from my father's houſe,
(a Prince illuſtrious) by a moſt uniuſt and thrice vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
attempt; and being confined in a place of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres,
and to doe worke, which is ſutable to none but fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that I aſsay by all the meanes I can to free my

with one hand, that which you build with the other,
and how you publiſh lawes, which at this time ſeeme not
to be made for any other purpoſe, but to condemne your
owne actions.</p>
            <p>But I ought to content my ſelfe (ſaith one) with my
liberty, and not breake priſon to enlarge others. To that
I anſwere, they were the inſtruments of my deſignes, and
being tyed to my intereſts, they were neceſsarily to waite
on the condition of my fortune. I anſwere their detenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was moſt impious and nujuſt: and not to be tolerated
by a ſoule, that hath any leaſt ſparke of zeale to religion,
or love to equity: For if it bee now a fit time to ſpeake
truth, ſince the plot is laid not to ſpare my life; who can
approue theſe ſacrifices of humane bloud, unleſse hee will
proclaime open warre againſt nature?</p>
            <p>The wiſeſt among you confeſse, God is a ſpirit moſt
pure, and moſt independent on matter, and ſhall we ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinke wee muſt ſacrifice bodies unto him? Would
we haue him flie up and downe like a vultur to the maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
of men? would we have him ſucke bloud, like flies?
Is not this to entertaine thoughts moſt unworthy of the
Diuinity, and were it not better to bee wholy ignorant of
the gods, then to know them in this manner?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:7777:32"/>
The moſt ancient Divine lawes (which you have daily
in your hand) teach us that God is the Father of nature,
and that he produced man, making uſe of himſelfe for a
modell: how can we then thinke he will be pleaſed in the
deſtruction of the moſt perfect peece of his workes; and
that he hath leſſe affection towards a living man, who bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
ſo noble characters of his glory, then a wretched ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer
would have for an Idol, made by his owne hands?</p>
            <p>It will be anſwered, theſe bloudy ſacrifices are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the lawes of the countrey: But is there a Civill
law, which ought to preiudice the great, and infallible
law of nature, which commandeth us to love our like, the
law of Nations, which decreeth to entertaine ſtrangers
with all courteſie, the policy of humane converſation,
which willeth us to obſerve covenants, and promiſes? Did
you not give theſe ſtrangers aſſurance to affoord them
life; and the liberty of young <hi>lacinthus,</hi> if they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame
Lions, and Beares, which you breed up for the
ſlaughter of men? Why then after ſo many acts of valour,
which draw admiration from the moſt ſtupid, love from
the moſt unnaturall; will you cruſh them under their
proper triumphs?</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ruines, wherein I wiſh to bee buryed;
and ſincè there onely needs my death to give you full
ſatiſfaction of your deſigne; I now to day most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
die, having already lived but too long, at

made me to be preſented before your eyes bound with
chaynes that have never hitherto beene employed; but on

            <p>All this ſeemed very conſiderable to the moſt

            <p>

it for a god betrayed, a Temple polluted, for a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
proſtituted at the will of Pirats, and not for a ſilly
brazen face, who braveth us even in fetters. Had you no
other proofe to condemne her, but her owne apologie, you
would be juſt enough to chaſtiſe an inſolent creature, who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7777:34"/>
no longer having an heart for the gods, hath ſhewed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſhameleſse towards men. She ſpeakes in chaines
as if ſhe were in Thrones, and if wee will beleeve her, her
diſcourſe is more rationall then ours, múch wiſer then
our lawes, more religious then our Temple, and more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſsant
then our gods. She will teach us leſsons of piety,
and juſtice; as if they were moſt proper in the mouth of
her, who was never willing to know them, but to violate
them; ſhe alleageth nature, againſt the Maſter of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſhee dares maintaine ſhe did well to flie away,
as if ſhee had been in a priſon, not in a Temple, bound,
not with fetters of iron, but with the bonds of her vowes,
and her owne promiſes, framed and contrived by her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
lips, whilſt ſhe enioyed full liberty: If you will
have nature prevaile againſt reaſon, there is not any
crime for which ſenſuallity findes not more excuſes, then
lawes can create puniſhments. It hath been too great
an honour for her to be ſtolne away, thereby to make her
reverenced here as a Divinity; nor is it ſtrange that
ſhe complaine of iniuries, ſince ſhe takes the moſt ſolid
benefits in evill part.</p>
            <p>It is her great zeale to holy things which moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her to ſet men at liberty, who by her owne confeſſion
are the moſt wretched, and forlorne creatures of the
earth; and for this cauſe (forſooth) ſhee is pleaſed to
play the Divine, condemning our lawes, and ſacrifices,
as if we were to give an account to a ſilly Maid, of the
beliefe of our anceſtors, which is common to us with ſo
many other Nations: and as if it were a matter unjuſt
to ſacrifice offenders againſt juſtice, who are unworthy to
live in the world, which they ſo often have polluted with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7777:34"/>
their wickedneſse. That ſhe no more accuſeth our lawes,
to ezcuſe her paſſion; it is knowne well enough, love hath
cauſed her to attempt theſe goodly tricks. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if ſhe betray Temples, who hath betrayed her chaſti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
tie, and that ſhe ſeparate her ſelfe from the gods, ſince
ſhe hath ſeparated; that, from her body which ought to
ſticke to the body, as faſt as her ſoule. Never is ſhe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
enough, of whom it may be doubted whether ſhe bee a
virgin or no: Is it not a goodly buſineſse for a Maid of
a Family, to cauſe her ſelfe to be ſtolne away by men, who
have in the whole world no greater innocency, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauſh
virgins? We found her in the night time ſhut up
with young ſtrangers, we know not what ſhe did, but if we
conſider what ſhe might have done: we can find no other
proofes of her honour, then thoſe we may derive from the
lips of theeves and lovers, to whom ſhee hath given thoſe
hands which ſhe ſo many times hath offered up to altars;
I here accuſe not ſimple deſires, I condemne moſt wicked
effects; which neither ſexe, nor age can excuſe, which the
gods avenge, which religion condemneth, which lawes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and which can never be expiated, but by fire.</p>

accident, order, nor meane in this contexture
of ages, enchayned one within another, which
can eſcape the vivacity of his eye, and extent

appointed all the bleſſings of nature, graces, and

they ſhould be of him, or by him, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

making ſo ſweet a mixture of armes, and lawes,
that innocency, and valour which very ſeldome
accord; found in his perſon a moſt worthy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.
Hee had a heart large as a ſea, which

too high for his courage; ſo was there not
any thing ſo low in his Empire that was exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Hee was religious in the exerciſes of piety, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in the decrees of Iuſtice, innocent in court,
holy in purple, and although the love of women
ſet ſome ſpots upon this glorious Sunne, yet
pennance wiping them away; hee fayled not to

and to ſee in Heaven Altars conſecrated to his

            <p>This is to ſhew what kinde of man God is

            <p>All ſeemed ſufficient enough to ſtay the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes

times did the ſtrange deſolation of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
deveſting the weeping fields on all ſides,
invite them to peace? Yet theſe Barbarians
when <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> held his foot on their throat,
thorough a diſſembled piety demaunded Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:
but ſo ſoone as they ſaw themſelves the
ſtronger ſide, they forraged the Countrey with
moſt deſperate hoſtilities; they killed the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
they maſſacred the Prieſts, they burnt
the altars, to which they fled for refuge; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did theſe <hi>Anteuſse's</hi> bow downe their heads
before our <hi>Hercules,</hi> but to derive from thence
new forces to his diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>They renewed wars afreſh ſixe or ſeven times,
wherein neceſſarily hee was enforced to cruſh
them as Serpents, and bury them in their totall

their Captaine, and the leader of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries,
weakned by ſo much effuſion of
bloud; and vanquiſhed in ſundry battailes, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eed
himſelfe to the clemency of the King, and
made a notable converſion to the Catholique
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7777:39"/>
faith, which was followed by his Nobility, and
people, who commonly are tyed with long
chaines of neceſſitie, to the fortune of great
ones. Then was it that the City, and Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
of <hi>Ereſhourge,</hi> (wherein all the deteſtable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices

ſubjected to the Armes of this brave Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who overthrowing the worſhip of falſe
gods; planted there the ſtandard of the Croſſe.
<hi>Charlemaigne</hi> entred into this Caſtle, as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell

by the Victorious ſtandards of <hi>France,</hi>
preſently fled, no more able to endure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of this Prince; then the night-bats can
ſuffer the rayes of the Sunne.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the miſerable <hi>Clodoaldus</hi>
comfortleſly bewailed his little <hi>Iacinthus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clodoaldus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to <hi>Charlemaigne.</hi>
               </note> whom
hee held for already ſacrificed: and having
once ſhut up his eyes from the light, he perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
opened them to teares; which ceaſed not
to diſtill from them, become blinde. When he
underſtood of the arrivall of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> hee
came to caſt himſelfe at his feete, to begge
revenge for his ſonne's bloud, being out of
hope hee was yet alive, and verily beleeving
all was told him touching certayne gallants,
that had endevoured to hinder this bloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was but an invention of his friends, who
were willing to affoord him this charity to ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his torments. The King ſeeing this grave
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7777:40"/>
comely man ſo disfigured, and overwhelmed
by the violence of ſorrow, was ſtrucken with
great compaſſion, and conſidering hee could
not ſpeake but thorough broken ſobs, which
choaked all his words: hee truly iudged this
ſoule was infinitely afflicted; whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
him, hee ſaid, <hi>Hee ſhould give ſome
truce to the ſence of his griefe, and that if fortune
had made him miſerable, hee ſtood before a Prince,
who was able to make him happy.</hi> The poore Lord
replyed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Sir,)</hi> Why doth your Maieſty entitle mee miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and not rather the true anatomy of miſerie: For
the evils I ſuffered, mounted to ſuch a height, that
they admit no compariſon among the ſtrangeſt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of this age. Heauen having granted mee a
fortune rich, and eminent enough in the World, made
me alſo a father of Three Children: Two whereof
were taken from mee in their tender yeeres, which I
thought would have cost mee my life, (ſo much haue
I deplored them night and day without intermiſſion:)
but in the end (as time is a wiſe Phyſitian for our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
not ſuffering our dolours to bee everlasting in a
life ſo ſhort;) my wound which for ſo long time had
beene freſh, and bleeding, began to become a ſcarre; and
on a ſodaine brake out againe, by reaſon of a cruelty
without example. I ſetled my ſelfe in this wretched
Countrey to ſee if I might diſcover ſome marks of my
loſse, when one day afflicted with ſo many anxieties,
as inceſſantly tormoyled my poore heart: I had a
deſire to hunt, wherein extraordinarily eager I ſought
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7777:40"/>
to kill a Bore, retyred to the foot of a ſtatue of a god of
of this Countrey, erected in the woods.</p>
            <p>I had no ſooner diſpatched him, but behold a voyce
dreadfull and menacing came out of this Idoll, which
condemned me to blindneſse, and the whole Countrey
to a moſt meager ſterility: if this fault were not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
repaired, and verily I in an inſtant became
blind, and my companions ſaw the graſſe dryed and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up under their feet, whereat I being much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
moſt humbly proſtrated my ſelfe at the feet of this
god, beſeeching to know of him what ſatisfaction he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
of me, he then appointed I ſhould offer that thing
in ſacrifice which first preſented it ſelfe unto mee in my
returne homeward, which I moſt willingly aſsented unto,
not thinking on the ſequell of this unhappy promiſe:
When behold poore <hi>Iacinthus,</hi> mine onely ſon, whom I
with ſo much care had bred, and who alone was able to
comfort me in all my loſſes: vpon the report that I was
hunting in the groue of <hi>Irminſul,</hi> came out to meet
me with unſpeakable ioy. So ſoone as I heard the voyce
of this tender lambe, I was ſo ſurpriſed in all my ſences,
that I knew not what to ſay; he on the other ſide bemoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
my blindneſse, and enquired with all his endevours
ſome remedy for my diſaſter, when by chance having
underſtood the knot of the buſineſse, this imcomparable
ſonne haſtned to preſent himſelfe at the altar of <hi>Irmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,</hi>
where I verily am perſwaded, the ſacrificers, who
will not mittigate any thing of their cruelty have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up, and torne in pieces this little body, as fleſh in the
ſhambles.</p>
            <p>But <hi>(Sir)</hi> at the leaſt, revenge the bloud of my poore
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7777:41"/>
victime, ſince you are the worlds arbitrator, and if there
yet remaine any part of his aſhes, or bones, I beſeech your
Maiestie they may be reſtored me, that I may bury
them in my boſome, and powre out my ſoule upon them.</p>
            <p>The King bitterly wept when hee heard
theſe Tragicall accidents, and promiſed to
affoord him all poſſible comfort; for which
<hi>Clodoaldus</hi> lifting his hands up to Heaven, gave
thankes to the gods, and when a Biſhop there
preſent told him hee muſt take away this plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of gods, and beleeve in one God, ſoveraigne
Monarch of Heaven, and Earth; who had
ſanctified the world by the incarnation of his
Word, hee required to bee inſtructed in our
Religion, which was quickly granted; and ſo
ſoone as his minde was enlightned with the
rayes of faith: this miſt which the Devills
had cauſed, was diſſolved, to the admiration of
all the World; and foorth-with hee diſpoſed
himſelfe to prayſe, and thanke God, never
leaving the King, from whom he began to hope
much, and that beyond all expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> entring into the Caſtle, ſaw the
gods of the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gods of the Saxons.</note> and among other, the Idoll
of <hi>Crodon,</hi> whom Hiſtorians thinke to bee the
Saturne of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> which verily was an
Idoll of bloud, and maſſacres, and to which
they offered in many places, ſacrifices of men
and children, as wee underſtand from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pagan Antiquities. There likewiſe ſtood
<hi>Irminſul</hi> all armed from head to foot, holding in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7777:41"/>
one hand a ſtandard with a roſe figured in it, and
in the other a ballance, having beſides a Beare
engraven on his Cuiraſſe, and a Lion on his
Target: Wherupon <hi>Crantzius,</hi> and other Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
give ſundry explications, eaſie to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Moreover there was a ſtatue of <hi>Venus,</hi> which
ſhewed it was no extraordinary matter for theſe
Idolaters to ad homicides and ſlaughters, to the
ordures of the impurity, whereof this <hi>Irminſul,</hi>
bare the figure.</p>
            <p>This brave Monarch breathed out a deepe
ſigh ſeeing theſe prodigious deities, which had
hitherto amuſed this miſerable people, and as he
was about to cauſe them to be demolliſhed, one
came to tell him there were priſoners of note in
the dungeon, reſerved to be very ſpeedily ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed:
Wherevpon hee in all haſte appointed a
commiſſary with guards about him to bring
them foorth, and to bee informed of the crimes
wherewith they were to be charged.</p>
            <p>The poore <hi>Hildegardis</hi> buryed in this deepe
darkneſſe,<note place="margin">Sorrow of <hi>Hildegardis.</hi>
               </note> expected nothing but the pile and
flames, fearing the high Prieſt, factious, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
would draw to himſelfe a reputation of
honour, ſigned with her bloud: Wherevpon
ſhe wholly reſolved for death; but it extremely
troubled her, that together with life they ſought
to bereave her of the reputation of honor, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
and endevoured to ſtamp an infamy on her
Tombe, (If aſhes which fly away with the wind,
may expect the funerall rites of a Tombe,) ſhee
complayned that having ſo charily preſerved her
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7777:42"/>
virginity, of which fire it ſelfe had rendred a
moſt ſolemne teſtimony, yet did the rage of her
enemies handle her as a harlot.</p>
            <p>Shee deplored that her aſhes ſhould remaine
in a barbarous Countrey, her ſelfe to bee buried
in oblivion, as the moſt unknowne, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
creature of the World; and that of ſo
much kindred; and allies, there was not one
would come to ſtrew ſome ſilly flowers on the
place impreſſed with the prints of her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as wee are free in our deſires, ſhee in
thought wiſhed, that ſome one at the leaſt would
one day carry the remainders of her aſhes to her
father, and ſay unto him.</hi> Behold here the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
reliques of that daughter whom you ſo much
ſought, ſo much haue bewailed, never giving end to
your ſearch, or teares. The poore creature is dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
moſt cruell torments, leaving her life, and memory
in the flames of a burning pile prepared by her enemies,
but ſhe is dead as a child of honour; and hath not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
the example of her Mother, nor the vertue of her
anceſtors.</p>
            <p>Wee all of us retaine ſome love for the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and eſtimation of poſterity; which is a
great note of the immortality of our ſoules. It
ſeemed to her, if ſome one would promiſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of this deſire, ſhe ſhould die with
much ſatisfaction, that her father would bee
comforted therewith, and willingly affoord the
laſt obſequies to this ſlender portion of her
body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:7777:42"/>
Having dreamed ſometime thereupon, ſhee
bitterly bewailed the death of her deare <hi>Iſchyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
of little <hi>Iacinthus,</hi> and <hi>Fauſtinus,</hi> fearing
leaſt this unhappy ſurpriſall might redouble
their puniſhments, ſhe deſired yet once againe
to ſpeake with them before ſhee dyed, to aſſiſt,
comfort, and fortifie her ſelfe with them for this
laſt paſſage: ſhee intreated ſhe might bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſpeake one word to her foſter-father
<hi>Araſpus,</hi> but it was told her, hee was lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted,
as being held guilty of the conſpiracy
ſhee had plotted, which redoubled her ſorrow
with the more violence, conſidering this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
old man was involved in her ruines. In the
end, the diſaſtrous Maid mourned in the dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wholy abſorpt in deepe miſeries, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deprived, the ſplendor of the day, ſhe ſaw
in her imagination all the confuſions of fortune,
and a million of the images of death which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled
her repoſe, when ſhee deſired to ſhut up
her eyes for ſleepe:</p>
            <p>Then hearing the priſon doore open, ſhe cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out aloud, <hi>Let us goe, behold here the houre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Heaven; which muſt give an end to ſo
many miſeries as inſtantly turmoyle thee.</hi> But one
comming, who opened a little window to give
day-light to the darkeneſſe of the dungeon, ſhe
(much amazed) to behold other countenances
of men, then ſuch as ſhee had knowne; plainly
diſcovered them by their habits, and faſhions to
be ſtrangers: They commanded her to follow
them, wherevpon ſhe replyed, <hi>(Sirs,) whither will
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7777:43"/>
you lead mee,</hi> and inſtantly ſhee underſtood ſhee
was no longer to give anſwere, to a company of
Prieſts, who had forſaken the place, but before
the throne of the prime Monarch of the world.
This newes made her conceive at firſt, great hope
of liberty, imagining with her ſelfe, ſhe ſhould
plead her cauſe before a benigne Prince, who
would give ſentence with all equity.</p>
            <p>But hearing ſome to murmure round about
her, who ſpake what fame publiſhed, that ſhee
muſt bee burnt as a ſorcereſſe; and that it was
ſhe, who had lent her hand to ſo many enormous
ſacrifices committed in this curſed place, this
greatly amazed her: But forgetting her proper
danger, for the love ſhee bare to <hi>Iſchyrion,</hi> ſhee
asked whither thoſe gentlemen ſhut up in the
next priſon were already put to death, or no; to
which it was anſwered, they were alive, and
ſhould bee ſentenced with her, and even at the
ſame time they were taken out of priſon to bee
brought before the King, who called for them,
and it happened they both met upon the way.
Verily, this was a very heavy meeting; for the
noble <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> perceiving his deareſt <hi>Hildegar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>
led along enchayned,<note place="margin">The meeting of <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> and <hi>iſchyrion.</hi>
               </note> and knowing ſhee had
no other crime, but for obliging him, felt his

yeeld up the ghoſt betweene the armes of <hi>Fauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and <hi>Iacinthus;</hi> who ſupported him (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
bound) as well as they could: So ſoone
as he a little had recovered his ſpirits, and got
liberty of ſpeech, he cryed out,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:7777:43"/>
What (Madame) am I then the inſtrument of
your death? There needs no queſtion be asked
whither I be criminall, ſince I ſee my ſelfe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with bloud, and am guilty of the murder of
a perſon, in whom nothing may bee deſired, but
immortality. Where ſhall I find limbs enow in
my body, to expiate ſuch a guilt. I from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
defie, Wheeles, Gibbets, keene Razors,
and flames; and if it bee true which is ſaid, that
the burning pile is already prepared for us, I
will mount to the top of it, without bands, or fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I wil firſt of all try the violence of the fire, I
wil render an honorable payment before the eyes
of Heaven, and earth: I moſt faithfully promiſe
when my ſoule ſhall bee ſeparated from my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it ſhall every where waite on your moſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
ſpirit as the ſhadow of it, but if it muſt be
condemned to darkeneſſe for eclipſing ſo divine
a light, I will onely begge of thee (oh great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence)
that from the ſphere of ſplendors
due to thy merrit, thou wilt ſome times deigne
to ſend forth a ray of thy clemency to enlighten
the dusky nights of my miſeries, and offences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hildegardis</hi> anſwered this ſpeech, with her
weeping eyes, the dart whereof was not ſo blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by teares, but that they made impreſſion on
the heart of her beloved, and ſo much as her
voyce might cleaue a ſunder the ſharpe ſighes of
her heart, ſhe ſaid, (Sir) accuſe not your innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

become ſo unfortunate, that even meere benefits
have power enough to make mee criminall. If

may perhaps unite our aſhes, and that wee ſhall
preſerve the immortality of our affections, in the

the cauſe of their happineſſe, but that the
father diſtilling ſome teares of gladneſſe, ſpake
thus, <hi>Oh my ſonne! It is a worke of God;</hi> and then
perceiving he had done an act of a man tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

            <p>This matter for a long time entertained the

this novelty, untill <hi>Hildegardis</hi> was brought forth

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7777:45"/>
her eyes dull, her haire negligently diſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled,

            <p>The King wondred at the conſtancy of this
virgin, joyned to her charity towards theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and was curious to know what ſhe did in
this Caſtle, which ſeemed moſt of all to trouble
her minde: Wherevpon caſting her eyes downe,
and colouring her face with a modeſt bluſh, ſhe
beſought his Majeſtie to diſpence with her the
relation of a thing which bred in her ſo much
horror, and that it was enough he ſaw her reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to expiate all her crimes by fire.</p>
            <p>But the King powerfully vrging, and giving
her all manner of aſſurance, ſhe profeſſed ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creciſed
the function of a Prieſt in the ſacrifices
of <hi>Irminſul,</hi> and that ſhe was preſent at the death
of men, who were ſacrificed; and further being
asked touching the cauſes which brought her to
ſo hatefull a profeſſion, ſhee told how ſhee had
beene taken away by a ſtrange misfortune at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
yeeres of age; and after many adventures
tranſported into this Caſtle, where by maine
force ſhee had beene conſtrained to execute the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7777:46"/>
office of a veſtall of the Temple, ſhe being a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and of very noble extraction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clodoaldus,</hi> who was there preſent, hearing
ſpeech of the taking away of a childe of a noble
houſe, felt his wound to open a freſh, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that at the ſame age ſhee was of, his owne
had beene taken from him, and conferring the
yeeres, the feature, lineaments of face, hee ſayd
within himſelfe, <hi>ſuch ſhould my deare Hildegardis
be now, were ſhe yet alive. Charlemaigne</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his diſcourſe, ſaid unto her; being ſtolne at
this age (as ſhe ſayd,) ſhee might well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the name ſhe then had, the houſe of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and other markes of her race. To which
ſhe replyed, ſhee could well call to mind her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> heretofore governour of
an ample province, and that hee was called <hi>Clodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus:</hi>
As for her ſelfe, ſhe bare ſtill the name of
<hi>Hildegardis,</hi> which was given her at her birth.
Therevpon the father, who hearing theſe words,
had beene ſtrongly aſſailed with an ebbe, and
floud of imaginations, cryed, as if hee came out
of an extaſie. <hi>Ha (ſir)! This creature is my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is my loſt daughter, whom I have ſought for, the
ſpace of fourteene yeeres in ſo great, and painefull voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages;</hi>
then turning himſelfe towards his little
<hi>Iacinthus: (Son) this is your ſiſter, and as he ſpake this,
both ran to imbrace her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſhee who during all this diſcourſe, ſtood
immoveable as a ſtatue, ſeeing her Father drew
neer to kiſſe her, and doubting leaſt there might
be ſome practiſe, ſhee ſtept backe, and ſaid <hi>(ſir,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7777:46"/>
excuſe mee if you pleaſe) I cannot without further
proofe more evident acknowledge you for my Father. Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doaldus</hi>
ſeeing this refuſall, asked if <hi>Araſpus</hi> were
not yet with her, ſhe anſwered, he was, therevpon
he prayed the King hee might bee called ſoorth,
which was ſpeedily done. <hi>Araſpus</hi> avowing his
maſter received him as a man fallen from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
gave him many ſingular welcomes, and
ſaid to <hi>Hildegardis, Madam, approach confidently,
it is my Lord your Father.</hi> The virgin remained
in a ſtrange rapture, and the father not ſpeaking,
but by broken ſighes which iſſued from his
heart, as from a furnace of love, held her faſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and bedewed her with his teares. All
there preſent were amazed at this ſight, as men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed,
or charmed; the King himſelfe could
not abſtaine from teares, and calling <hi>Hildegar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
tooke her by the hand, and demaunded
whither ſhee would forſake the ſacrifices of
<hi>Irminſul,</hi> and embrace her fathers religion, which
was Chriſtian: She anſwered, ſhe had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
and a thouſand times abhorred this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
impoſture, and that with all her heart
ſhee deſired to bee a Chriſtian. Therevpon the
King turning toward <hi>Araſpus,</hi> asked him how
this creature had beene taken, he relating that
ſhee ſporting in a wood in ſome childiſh maner,
a troupe of wandring Griphons aſſailed her, well
diſcovering their aime was at this young virgin,
but he having kept her in this ſtorme (as a veſſell
wherein all the treaſures of his maſter were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed)
defended her with all his power till
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7777:47"/>
ſuch time as oppreſſed with wounds hee was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with her. Hee added that ſhee had lived in
this miſerable place in ſuch languors and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
as cannot bee imagined, expecting the
much deſired day which ſhould breake her fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and wipe away theſe teares.</p>
            <p>Well goe to then virgin (ſayd the King) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the day, which you ſo long have looked for,
is come: But why were you thruſt into this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
dungeon? What meane theſe chaines,
and burning pile you ſpake of even now? The
generous Lady (almoſt) forgetting her owne
happineſſe, faithfully to aſſiſt her deare <hi>Iſchyrion;</hi>
related with an atractive grace all that which
had paſſed, as well in the perſon of <hi>Iacinthus,</hi> as
in the combat of Lyons and Beares, extolling as
much as ſhe could, the rare proweſſe of theſe two
gentlemen: Then ſhee added the advice ſhee
tooke to free them, the accident which befell
her in this difficult affaire, her impriſonment,
her condemnation, and the deſperate ſtate of
her fortune. Here the Father embracing her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
long time wept over her, ſaying, <hi>(My
poore daughter) It is well you are pulled out of the pawes
of Wolves, and I pray what had now become of you
without the Kings protection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Hildegardis</hi> amongſt theſe notable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ever bearing her deareſt <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> in mind,
vrged <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> ſaying, <hi>(Sir) my father is ſtill
poſſeſsed but of the one halfe of me, whilſt this noble gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
is in fetters.</hi> Bee your Majeſty pleaſed to
finiſh what you ſo proſperouſly have begun.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7777:47"/>
Forthwith the King cauſed <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> and <hi>Fauſtine</hi>
to be fetched,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſchyrions</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note> commanding their chaines to bee
taken off. <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> feeling himſelfe unfettered,
lifted his hands to Heaven, and ſaid, Now is the
time (oh Heavens) I render you thankes, that I
once againe have my hands at liberty to die in
ſome battaile, if you ſhall pleaſe to deigne
me this favour: we at the leaſt ſo farre as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
have eſcaped from theſe bloudy ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
where wee were to looſe our lives, not illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
our deaths with one ray of honour: but
now if we needs muſt make an end, wee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
on the theater of Kings in ſome glorious
piece of ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> hearing this yong Eaglet ſpeake
with ſo much generoſity, enquired his name,
race, employment, courſe, and progreſſe of life:
But hee making a low obeyſance, ſaid to the
King,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Sir)</hi> I beſeech your Majeſtie to excuſe me, if I give
you not upon this queſtion that full ſatisfaction I could
wiſh, For fortune hath created me an imperfect man,
without Father, or Mother, kindred, allyes, Countrey,
houſe; or riches, caſting me as an abortive of the ſea, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of the waves to arive on ſome unknowne ſhore.
All I can ſay of my extraction, is, that I was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in ſo tender yeares, that I could not have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
either of my ſelfe, or mine.</p>
            <p>It onely was told mee, that Pirats ſtealing mee away
from I know not what Countrey came to eaſt anchor in a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7777:48"/>
a part of <hi>Affrick,</hi> where they were ſo hotly aſsayled that
one of their veſſels was left behind, in which I was, and
every one running haſtily to the pillage of this booty, the
ſhepherds ſought alſo to have their ſhare in it, whereof
one of them ſeeing me, whither mooved with compaſſion,
or whither he thought mee a childe of ſome good family,
and that one day reſtoring me, he might gaine ſomewhat
by it, he reſolved to lay hold on me, and bred mee up with
his ſon <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> here preſent.</p>
            <p>We both grew up under his wings, like two yong Aſhes,
planted by the favour of Heaven neere a rivers ſide; and
although I had then no other opinion of my ſelfe, but that
I was the ſon of <hi>Thoas,</hi> my foſter-father; yet being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
little Countrey boyes of my condition, I played the
Prince, and was infinitely delighted to practiſe warres,
and combats, wherein I almoſt everhad the upper hand,
from whence it came to paſſe the name of <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> was
given mee, which is a tite of valour, and glory.</p>
            <p>The ſhepherd <hi>Thoas</hi> loved me tenderly, as his owne
ſon, and plainely perceiving I was not borne to reſt in
ſheep-coats all my life; Being now upon the degrees of an
age more vigorous, he tooke me apart, and ſaid,</p>
            <p>My deare <hi>Iſchyrion,</hi> I muſt now at this time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold
a ſecret unto you, which I have hitherto been willing
to conceale from you, fearing leaſt the greatneſse of your
courage might prove your ruine in theſe greener yeeres;
but now when at this preſent you are come to more matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and ſtrength, I would have you know you are no ſon
of mine; I found you in a ſhip of Pyrats, and ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
did ſecretly whiſper, you were ſtollen away from a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7777:48"/>
certaine port, and that your Father was a great Prince,
whereof I could never learne any further. Perhaps your
good ſtarres will ſhew you more, I onely intreat you to
take care of your perſon, which ſhall be moſt deare to mee
whilſt I live, and if you one day arrive to any fortune
worthy your ſelfe, forget not your poore foſter-father: not
(ſon) that I beg ought of your abilities; for God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded
us contentments in our little Cottage, but much
it ſhall pleaſe me to be continued in your remebrance,
as one who greatly have deſired to breed you well, and if
any thing were defective in your education, excuſe our

               </gap> ſuch as you ſee, full of

            <p>This diſcourſe drew teares from mee, and ſo farre pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated
my heart, that in few daies, I reſolved to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
thoroughout the world, and enquire out my birth.
But <hi>Fauſtin</hi> (knowing what paſſed) prayed me by all that
I held moſt pretious, not to forſake him, but to make him
the companion of all my dangers, which was the cauſe I
beſought his Father, to grant it mee, which hee aſsented
unto, although the Mother very much oppoſed it.</p>
            <p>Since, we continually have lived together, as one ſoule
diuided into two bodies.<note place="margin">True lawes of Amity.</note> For our amity having taken
roote in a mutuall temperature, and great correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

Diſſimulation, and contradiction could no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

together the leaſt impreſſion of inconſtancy, diſtaſte, or
coldneſse in our affections, but wee loued with the ſame
ferver, as if we daily began, never to end.</p>
            <p>When wee had travelled over ſome Proninces of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi>

            <p>The King well ſatisfied to heare this whole
narration, asked him, whither whilſt hee was in
the Pirat-ſhip, any marke were upon him, which
might one day diſcover his birth. Thereupon he
drew forth a little jewell, that had been found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his necke, and which <hi>Thoas</hi> having faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept, reſtored him at his departure. The King
taking it into his hand to ſee what it was, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
many out of our ioſity lifted up their heads,
and caſt their eyes upon it, and among others
<hi>Clodoaldus,</hi> who ſaid in his heart. Ah, what if the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7777:49"/>
deſtinies bee pleaſed, I this day recover all my
loſſes, good haps ſometimes comes by heapes, as
well as bad. The God whom I now worſhip, is
much greater then all my deſires. As he pauſed
on this imagination, and came ſo neere as hee
could; Behold (ſaith <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> a very rich
jewell) I here among other things diſcover an
Agat, which beareth two javelins croſſed one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
another. At theſe words <hi>Clodoaldus</hi> fetched
a deepe ſigh, and ſaid (Sir) theſe are my Armes
from all antiquitie; thereupon his ſpeech was
ſtopped by the deep reſentments of his heart, yet
ſtill his voyce reſiſted the obſtacles of paſſion,
and ſaid, <hi>Oh God! what meaneth this? my heart is ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled
with hope and feare, that it forgetteth whither it
be a heart, or no, (Teares) ſtay a while, till I behold this
Agat.</hi> The king having ſhewed it him, he ſtood
a good ſpace without ſpeaking one word, rather
reſembling a ſtatue of Marble, then a man; but
when hee came againe to himſelfe, hee could not
ſay any thing but with a confuſed voice, <hi>This jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
comes from my houſe, it is my ſon, I am his Father.</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyrion,
Hildegardis, Iacinthus were on the
other partall in an extaſie, as if they had been
tranſported into Heaven, and thorough all the
aſſembly there was a marueilous ſilence: when
<hi>Clodoaldus,</hi> recovering ſpeech with ſome more
readineſſe, ſaid to the King,</p>
            <p>(Sir) <hi>It is ſtrange, that the male Children of
our Race, at least the eldeſt, bare on their bodies theſe
Iavelins engraven by a naturall character. As for my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7777:50"/>
I have it on mine arme which here behold, and I well
remember, my ſon had it on his right ſhoulder: I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beſeech your Majeſtie, that part of his body may bee

acknowledging the marke, ſtooped downe to

<hi>Clodoaldus,</hi> at the ſame time, <hi>Hildegardis</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthus</hi>
likewiſe fell upon him, and all ſpake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by imbracements, ſighes, and teares of
joy, unable to utter a word. The King had
much a doe to expreſſe himſelfe, ſo much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
poſſeſſed him, when lifting up his eyes to
Heaven he ſaid, Behold moſt ſecret paſſages of
the divine providence.</p>
            <p>In the end, this happy Father beginning to
come out of his extaſie, ſaid to his ſonne <hi>Clodoal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
oh my ſonne, oh my pleaſing light! now is
the time when the eclipſe of ſo many yeeres hath
ſuffered you to appeare in your brighteſt luſtre;
I verily thought the waves of the ſea had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
you, for which cauſe I erected a Tombe
unto you on the ſhore, (the monument of my
unhappineſſe, and title of my ſorrowes). How
often did I moyſten it with my teares? How
often did I ſtrew it with flowers? I likewiſe
planted Cypreſſes, and other trees, on the
barkes whereof I wrote my diſaſters, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
I tooke delight to ſee them grow to
the proportion of the plant's increaſe. When I
beheld any Tempeſt ariſe on the Sea, I ſaid to
the Nimphs, appeaſe (a little I beſeech you)
theſe windes and ſtormes, keepe my young <hi>Clodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:7777:50"/>
in peace; I know he hath no Tombe, make
him a hearſe of the Chriſtalls of theſe waves; It
ſeemed to me the Sea underſtood my griefe, and
tooke pleaſure to ſwell with my teares: It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the rockes lamented my dolours, to eccho
them agayne to ſhippes, and ſaylers: and now
where are my ſorrowes, and torments? Children,
you to day are borne. To day properly I begin
to be a Father: To which <hi>Iſchyrion,</hi> who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been wholy abſorpt in a deepe rapture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p>Moſt deare Father, with how many travels do I
on this day purchaſe the right to call you by that
excellent title? &amp; by how many wandring paths,
and trackes have I found out the right way?
Yet notwithſtanding there is not any thing
done, nor ſhall I ever be pleaſed, till I ſatisfie the
eſtimation you have made of mee, avowing mee
for your ſon in the preſence of the King, and all
his Court. Then caſting himſelfe about the
necke of his ſiſter <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> and his brother
<hi>Iacinthus,</hi> hee embraced them with openneſſe of
heart, and profuſion of love, which ſeemed as if it
would have diſſolved the three ſoules, and make
them evaporate into affection. Hee ſaid ah! it
was a great chance the altar of <hi>Irminſul</hi> had not
beene moyſtned with the bloud of three. Let us
give thanks to the Chriſtian's God, who by the
victorious hand of this Monarch, hath vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us from the gates of hell.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was ſaying this, the Father proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelfe againe with them at the feet of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7777:51"/>
               <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and ſpake thus, (Sir) you this day
have created a family, giving it being; and the
perfections which attend it. If the Father and
his children gaine one day the honour to beare
your enſignes, they ſhall flie from one pole to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
like Eagles, and never pretend to any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in the world, but to obey your commands,
To which the King anſwered; That, man was
but a little veyne of water, that, God was the
ſource of Eſſences, and goodneſſe, to whom we
ought to render immortall honors. And ſaying
this, He commanded them to honor the Croſſe,
and invited them all to the deſtruction of Idols,
which was performed with unſpeakable ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,
Heaven ſo favouring this deſigne, that as
the Hiſtory expreſly telleth, miraculous croſſes
were ſeene on the clothes of thoſe who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in this ſo glorious a worke.</p>
            <p>Thus doth God conclude enterpriſes underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the glory of his Name, and I praiſe the
holy providence, that having begun the deſigne
of this poore labour in the beginning of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
which our great Monarch hath gained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Subjects; I finiſh it in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>His voyages, which alwayes ſeeme long to
thoſe, who ſo paſſionately cheriſh the honour of
his preſence, are found in the end very ſhort in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the great things which God is pleaſed
to worke in ſo ſmall a time by his victorious
hands; the mighty workers of wonders.</p>
            <p>Behold him here returned from the <hi>Alpine</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:7777:51"/>
ſnowes, and ſcorching heats of the utmoſt limits
of his Kingdome, like to thoſe great mountains
which at one, and the ſame time; bare Winter
and Summer, ſhewing himſelfe as invincible in
valour, as indefatigable in labour.</p>
            <p>Speake no more of that ancient <hi>Timothous,</hi> into
whoſe nets fortune caſt ſome ſilly Townes. The
great hand of the God of hoſts hath put Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and people (in a moment) into that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
golden ſnare of the Kings love, and clemency,
reducing under obedience all thoſe rebellious
places, that opened their eyes to their owne tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
which they ſo many times had ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
reaſon. This great king peacefull in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and warlike of diſpoſition, is become the
peace-maker of <hi>Europe,</hi> plainely diſcovering, he
loveth not warre, but to bring forth peace, and
that all his intentions have no other aime, but to
build up for his ſubjects the Temple of Repoſe,
ſo oft cimented with his ſweats, and exalted by

            <p>I here willingly end, not purſuing the events

Saints, and intelligences, to command over the
heads of Emperours, who have perſecuted his
Saints in all the parts of the world! What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
of Angels, what glory of bodies raiſed
againe, what City of peace, what kingdomes of
the Elect?</p>
            <p>Then ſhalbe the time when fathers &amp; mothers,
who haue had the happineſſe to become of the
number of the bleſſed, ſhall embrace their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſo much deſired, and deplored, not as this
<hi>Clodoaldus</hi> to deſire, and bewaile them once more
againe, but to ſee them for ever triumphant over
death in that glorious immortallity, which ſhall
cauſe all our torments to die, to make all our
glories ſurvive.</p>
            <p>Then ſhall be the time when chaſt lovers, who
have affected each other ſo entirely in conjugall
amities, and who were ſeparated by deaths ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous,
that they (as it were) forced their eyes to
diſſolve with their hearts over the Tombes of
their deare conſorts, ſhall recover their loſſes, and
ſhall behold thoſe perſons they ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7777:52"/>
encompaſſed round about with ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
glory: what embracements then! what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
of hearts! what entertainments! what
diſcourſes! when all that which we ſhall ſee of
the earth, (we being ſeated over thoſe vaſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of ſtarres, lights, and intelligences) ſhall
ſeeme little and unworthy to poſſeſſe a heart
made for eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There it is (great Counteſſe)</hi> where I hope we

ſhall ſee that brave Duke of <hi>Frons;ſac</hi> iſſuing out
out of his Tombe, as out of the enkindled pile
of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> out of a chariot of glory, from an
Altar of immortality. The bloud of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
houſe of <hi>Orleans</hi> which ranne in his

ſpirit imprinted on his forehead, that grace
of ſpeach which dwelt on his lips, that valour
which poſſeſſed his heart, that piety which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
all the powers of his ſoule, all thoſe
gifts of God, which waited on his perſon, ſhall
bee much fairer then ever, ſince they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

hath taken away from us this <hi>Ionathas</hi> yet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall;

the glory of God, the ſervice of the King, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

fit to die, but the moſt glorious. At this great
day, he ſhall impreſſe on the firmament of lights
which ſhall iſſue from his body, the excellent
beauties of his ſoule, and ſhall appeare to our
eyes more luſtrous, then the brighteſt of ſtarres.
Lift up the eyes of hope, and faith above all that
is mortall, to behold him now in this ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
Prevent your joyes by the ſtability

            <p>And, that we may leave the mind ſatisfied in

the divine providence with a moſt humble

thereof, to it's direction, and to condemne the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7777:53"/>
vanity of thoſe who are ready to maintaine
this Hiſtory was an effect of the ſtarres.</p>
            <p>We have now a dayes in the World too many

impute theſe great viciſſitudes to Heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations,
and to appoint the ſtarres to be as the
diſtributors of all the fortunes in the world.
Theſe diſcourſes were tollerable among Pagans,
borne with a yoake on their necks, under the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
of Divels; But to ſee Chriſtians dig in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſepulchres of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to draw from thence

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7777:54"/>
are two things of like nature, they are fit to
entangle flies, not ſoules well grounded in the
ſincerity of ancient beliefe.</p>
            <p>They who undoubtedly promiſe themſelves
vain haps from their <hi>Horoſcopes;</hi> &amp; thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, are ſo much unfurniſhed of reaſon, as
diſpoſed to a coldneſſe in Religion. And of this,
there are cleere pertinent proofes: For firſt of
all, thoſe who deale with ſetting <hi>Horoſcopes,</hi> as
much underſtand the great <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Heaven,
and the pretended ſignification of ſo many ſtars,
as we know the <hi>Canadois,</hi> ſince we find their moſt
knowing maſters are (as it were) involved in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
contradictions, not upon articles indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
but things meerely eſſentiall, upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as it appeareth by the writings of <hi>Ptolomy,
Albumazar, Abenezra, Cardan,</hi> and others much
later. In ſuch ſort, that theſe contradictions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
all experience which notwithſtanding is
the onely foundation of judiciary Aſtrologie.</p>
            <p>Theſe great Temples of light are now reſerved
to God, and Angels; the ſoveraigne Creator hath
ſpred over a Cypres of night and darknes, to caſt
a veyle on our curioſity. He who cannot perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the ſlip of an hearbe, nor the leaſt little
creature which creepeth on the ground, how can
he boaſt not onely to underſtand the courſes, and
meaſures of ſtars, but the moſt ſecret impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they may have over the objects of this lower
world? Moreover, although theſe ſtars had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over bodies, over humours, and inclinations,
where would their command be over a ſoule im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7777:54"/>
created to the image of God, called

               </note> that wiſe men ſway over
ſtars, thinking it vnreſonable to impute the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of life, to the influence of celeſtiall bodies,
ſo to bereave them, the effects of prudence? In
the third place, Let us put caſe the ſtars governe
us, and that according to their diverſe aſpects
we may devine upon the chances of men, that we
may inferre ſuch a child borne under ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of planets, had heretofore ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
and therefore the other which followeth
in his birth the ſame tracks, ſhall have the ſame
hap. I demand what meanes have they to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
this <hi>Maxime,</hi> and to make a ſcience in ſo
great uncertainty, ſince thoſe ſtars never returne
againe to the ſame point, or if they doe returne,
it wilbe in the revolution of almoſt innumerable
ages, which no man hath ſeene, not ever ſhall? It
may be ſaid, the planets finiſh their courſes in a
very ſmall number of yeeres, which is the cauſe
we may the more eaſily obſerve them, but who
will dare to affirme the planets alone have part in
my nativity, and that ſo many other unknowne
ſtars are idle in Heaven; without having any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon mortall things? This is it which
<hi>Seneca</hi> condemned in the Aſtrologers of his
time. They confine us (ſaith hee) to a very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
quantity of ſtarres, and ſee not that all theſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7777:55"/>
great celeſtiall bodies which are over our heads,
are able to make great mutations.</p>
            <p>In the end, who knowes not that according
to S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> reaſon, the motion of Heauen,
is ſo ſwift, that to goe about to write downe the
good happ of man in this great booke, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
characters on the water? Experience is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to theſe reaſons: Some predictions of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers
are produced, which are ſaid to have
beene true, and it is no wonder, ſeeing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their truths being ſo ſmall, it will bee no
very hard matter to reckon them, but hee that
would ſumme the lies and impoſtures, may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
them with the ſands of the ſea.</p>
            <p>Well now I aske, if ſo many wits who labor to
turne names, and make Anagrams ſometimes by
chance, happen right, as he who found upon the
name of one <hi>Andrè Paion Pendis a Rion,</hi> that
which afterward happened unto him, muſt wee
conclude thereupon that the skill of Anagrams
is divine and infallible? Every good judgement
will hold this propoſition ridiculous, and who
ſees not that Aſtrologers confounding ſtarres,
times, and celeſtiall houſes, make of our lives,
that, which Anagrammatiſts do with our names,
ſhall we then beleeue them? The <hi>Arabian Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumazar</hi>
held as an Oracle of learning amongſt
them; having once attributed the advancement
of Chriſtianity to the good concurrence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations,
went about out of madneſſe to take
the meaſure of its progreſſes, to which God hath
appointed no limits: He left in writing two moſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7777:55"/>
notable falſhoods upon this point, the firſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, that after the revolution of three ages, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Empires ſhould bee made in the world, as
for example (ſaith hee) three hundred yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>Arelazor</hi> advanced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
who conquered the <hi>Perſians,</hi> which is moſt
untrue, and never heard of thorough all hiſtories.
Hee proceedeth and ſaith, that three hundred
yeeres after this <hi>Arelazor,</hi> Chriſt the Meſſias is
borne, which by his account ſhould have beene
ſixe hundred yeeres after <hi>Alexander,</hi> although
according to the ſupputation of the moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
this Monarch lived, but three hundred
and fifty yeeres before him. But let us paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this Parachroniſme, the ſame man addeth,
that according to the courſe of ſtarres, he found
Chriſtian religion ſhould continue, a thouſand
and foure hundred yeeres, and (God be thanked)
it hath already exceeded thoſe, more then two
hundred, and ſhall laſt to the world's end. Who

            </p>
            <p>Great ones ſhould at the leaſt have regard to
the experience of ſo many Princes, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

diſpoyled, and put into an iron cage.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſay with St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that all this
ſuperſtition is not only vaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Inſtruction concerning amitie.</note> but pernitious, and
that there is ſome apparance it is ſprung from a
wicked alliance between men and divels.</p>
            <p>The ſecond leſſon ſhall be, well to purifie your
amities, for as thoſe perſons whom we have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto you, loving one another very chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yea with in the bonds of love purely humane,
have in the end reaped much contentment, and
glory from their charitable offices: So there is
no doubt but that amity elevated by a divine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
beſides, that it is one of the moſt delicious
charmes of humane life, muſt of neceſſity bee of
much merrit before the divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Verily, wee affirme thoſe ancients ſaw much,
when they ſaid love was a deſire of immortality;
For every creature neceſſarily loveth its Being,
which is the foundation of all good and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which alone maketh Being to bee deſired,
and the ever Being, which is the accompliſhment
of well being. But as each thing created procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from nothing, tendeth inſenſibly to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7777:56"/>
and cannot have from its ſtock this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Being, it ſeekes to revive, and produce it
ſelfe it ſome kind of immortality by the meanes
of love, which makes alliances, and productions
in all nature.</p>
            <p>But the deſire of a brutiſh immortality, is a
thing very low, and abiect in compariſon of the
conditions of the ſpirit, which looke towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
life, another ſtate, above all the wayes of
nature.</p>
            <p>How much thinke we, do our ſoules (which are
noble, intelligent, and divine) deſire not ſimply
to be immortallized; for they already are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
but to be eternized in a fulneſſe of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by the helpe of love, which maketh us live in
the thing we love.</p>
            <p>Theſe poore ſoules naturally deſirous of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
tie themſelves by love to many obiects, to
find out the contentment they purſue; but, as all
creatures are neceſſitous, they ſtarve, and deceive
them, teaching them in the end by their proper
hunger, and deceit, that there is but one onely
meanes to make them happy, and eternall, which
is to enter into the heart and love of a Being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame,
&amp; independent. Notwithſtanding God
though inuiſible, traceth on the lights of the
Heavens, on the enamell of flowers, on the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall
of fountaines, and upon ſo many other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Beauties, and Vertues, which are viſible
characters of his divinity, and if we learne to uſe
holy, the bleſſings he powreth upon eſſence crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to apply them wholy to the eſſence increate,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7777:57"/>
wee very ſoone ſhall arrive to the perfection of
love.</p>
            <p>But in ſtead of following theſe pathes which
the Saints tracked out unto us, the moſt part of
men, brutiſh of ſence, and benummed in Reaſon
ſhut up the maieſty of love, in a caytive, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
paſſion, wherein they commit as great a
crime, as thoſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idolaters, who lodged
their Divinities in the bodies of Rats, and rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice.
The loue which now adayes beares ſway
in the world with ſo much fury, is the houſe of
ſtormes, a ſweet poyſon, a golden ſnare, a pleaſing
cut-throat, an ungoverned feaver, a perpetuall
folly, A <hi>vertigo,</hi> a loſſe of wit, which having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
man unprofitable to all things, maketh
him unable for love it ſelfe: It entreth into the
heart, as the <hi>Indian Rat</hi> into the belly of the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile,</hi>
where after it hath left impreſſions of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
moſt maligne, and infectious, it parcheth
up all the flowers of it, it vilifieth all that which
is generous, and perverteth what is Religious.
What man is there who (as yet) having ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
wiſedome, and underſtanding, would make
himſelfe a ſlave to ſuch a paſſion, to deliver his
ſoule over to ſinne, his body to infection, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to opprobry, and his life to a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
bondage?</p>
            <p>If we muſt love, (as one cannot live without it)
let us goe to this chaſte loue, the altar whereof
alwayes pure, ever burning, is ſupported by foure
Columns, which are Intention, Diſcretion, Faith,
and Patience: Intention, that one may love to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7777:57"/>
the honour of God, and have an object, wherein
vertue may be exerciſed: Diſcretion, that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may be guided, and contained in duty and
decorum: Faith, that promiſes may be kept, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
and rights of amity, inviolably obſerved:
Patience, that one may conſtantly perſevere in
loving, notwithſtanding all oppoſitions which
may interpoſe to diſſolve this vnion.</p>
            <p>But when ſhall we finde theſe qualities in the
amities of the world? Is not intention effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and mercenary, diſcretion inconſiderate, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
moſt unconſtant, patience uncertaine?
There needeth but one word ill underſtood, but
a cold countenance, but an ill tale, but a bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
to breake amities that were thought moſt
ſtrong, wherein they plainly ſhew themſelves to
have been never what they profeſſe, ſince they ſo
ſoone deſiſt, to be what they proteſted.</p>
            <p>If we ſpeake of amities between ſexe, and ſexe,
and that in thoſe we obſerve any to be moſt pure,
and ardent, as ſome ſuch may be found, they are
Angels, which exeeciſe it in mortall fleſh, and
howſoever the matter goes the approaches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, are ever fearefull, ſince vertues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(as ſaid St. <hi>Auſtine)</hi> cannot be loved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger.</p>
            <p>The ancients beleeved women by their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
had transformed their gods into beaſts, to
teach us, men might therein become ſomething
worſe, and that there was not any ſanctity ſo
ſtrong, which had not ever in theſe amities a
ſlippery foot; if it tooke not the feare of God,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7777:58"/>
and diſcretion for companions. If we conſider
the amities of youth among the ſame ſexe they
are for the moſt part inconſtant, inconſiderate,
without weight, without reaſon, without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
They often begin by chance, proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſlights, and ſhiftings, and conclude upon
neglect. If they be amities of men tied to eſtates,
fortunes, and conditions of the world, they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon their owne intereſts, and have not that
ſpirit of community, which is the ſoule of good
will.</p>
            <p>Finally all worldly loves reſemble the ſtatue
of the god <hi>Moloch,</hi> which had outwardly good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſemblances, and inwardly emptineſſe, and
flames; how pleaſing; and gentile ſoever they
ſeeme exteriorly, they are hollow within; they
are burning, troubleſome, and having poſſeſſed
a heart, leave it nothing but ſmoake, and barke.
Let us then learne the love of God, and in God,
and for God, deriving our affections from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and perpetually making them reaſcend to
their ſource.</p>
            <p>In the end (for a third conſideration) ſtrive by
imitation of our great <hi>Charles</hi> to deſtroy Idols,
not of Temples, but of hearts, to render that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the true God which creatures uſurpe, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing
with ſuch baſeneſſe, that, which they ſtole
away with ſo unbounded arrogance.</p>
            <p>That groſſe Idolatry which ſet gods on altars,
which wee now would take for Monſters, is no
longer in vogue of this world wherein wee live,
but another is ſlipt into the place thereof much
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7777:58"/>
more ſubtile, and ſpirituall, which maketh men
and women, who live in ſome eminence of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to adore riches, beauty, and other gifts,
much eſteemed by the world.</p>
            <p>All is ful of idolaters, in the ſecular life, all is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed
with flatterers, who reverence the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of great ones, and ſpeake of them in ſo bold
tearmes, that after they have left ſhame, they put
themſelves in hazard to looſe Religion. A Lord,
or Lady, is not now adayes prayſed if we ſay not,
<hi>It is a creature to be adored.</hi> It is a Divinity ſent on
earth to make it ſelfe knowne, and beloved in
mortall members, that its ſpirit begins, where,
that, of the moſt ſupreame intelligencies ends;
that it is the prime of faces ſo renowned amongſt
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> That it hath nothing common with
others, but birth, and death. That there needs the
life of a <hi>Phoenix,</hi> to make up ſuch another maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece,
and ſuch like vaine complements, intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
even to thoſe who are moſt greedy of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes.</p>
            <p>Is it not to fill the world with idols thus to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed?
and to make cannonizations grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Capritches of a giddy ſpirit, who deſire to
make the dreams of lovers to paſſe into <hi>Maximes</hi>
of verity?</p>
            <p>Let us learne to looke on all the greatneſſes of
the world, as things mortall, and on all theſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of vanity as gliding ſhadowes, which have
nothing ſolid in them. Let us looke on them, as
eggs, which make a faire ſhew outwardly, but
have oft-times an Aſpicke within: Let us looke
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7777:59"/>
on them as enchanted apples, which invite all
the world to taſte, and poyſon all that eate them.
Let us look on them as thoſe pieces of Tapiſtry,
which on the beſt ſide ſhew countreys and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and on the backe ſide, ſeames, ſtitches, knots,
and vgly ſhapes.</p>
            <p>When we ſee ſome proſperity which ſmileth
on us, let us think it reſembles thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> reeds,
which grow not without knots, and windings.</p>
            <p>If we behold ſome good in the creature, let us
preſently lift up our eies to the Creator, and give
thanks to this ſpirit of lights, this moſt pure Act,
this intelligible ſphere, fountain of <hi>Idaeas,</hi> ſource
of Eſſences, the chiefe of beauties, to whom
I conſecrate my heart, and pen in this
little peece, beſeeching him to
continue his bleſſings over
my deſignes, and
workes.
