            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Remember that which was once taught you upon that place, by your owne holie, and heauenly preacher M. Rollock in his powerfull manner. That the wisedome of the world looketh to the present estate, and condition of things; if with it Christ, and the puritie of religion may subsist, then will they embrace Christ, &amp; religion, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they bidde them farewell. But the wisedome of God (saith he) layeth Christ, and the puritie of Christian religion for a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16687:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ground, and sinne closeth her eyes to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents whatsoever for Christ, and religion should not be servants to policie, but poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and this whole world should serue Christ, and religion. The Iewes preferring their estate to Christ, and fearing ruine, if Christ should liue, they kill him to saue their nation, but the same was the cause, that in the justice of God the Romans came, and destroyed their nation. The Lord hath moe waies then your town hath ports, to bring in his wrath, and for magnifying his owne wisedom, and snaring of men in their wisedome, manie times judgment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth by the port, that pollicie hath locked fastest. They wanted not in those daies their owne pretexts, none of them was so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as to set himself against God, as God, they had their owne cunning to colour the matter, and pulled forth their eyes least they should see, that God, against whom they fought, as men deale now with Christ, and the puritie of religion. The more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the lesse conscience we finde in anie age, we may look for the fouler errors, and the fairer covers. Oppose also to that the Christians text Matth. 16. 26. and with elevation of heart think seriously, what hath a man profited, if he should gaine the whole world, and lose his owne soule? or what can
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16687:5"/>
a man giue in exchange for his soule? 1. the immortal soule of man may be losed. 2. the gaining of the world is the ordinarie cause of the losse of the soule. 3. it is extreame follie to loose the soule for gaining of the world: for first it is an unprofitable gaine, what hath a man profited? and next it is an unreparable losse, what can a man giue in exchange for his soule, so that the losse of one soule, is the eternall losse of that which is more worth then the whole world. 4. he maketh themselues judges, and demandeth them for their farther conviction.

then is adulterie to a jealous husband, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is committed before his eyes. Now it is known to us all, that in our confessions and covenants we haue abjured al Antichrist his rites, and ceremonies added to the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true sacraments without the word of God (of the which sort, this knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was esteemed to be one, and cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape this censure more then other popish rites) &amp; it is as certaine, that all the fetches, and fingers that haue beene busied about this knot haue not loosed it.

But upon the other side Christs gesture of sitting at the communion is free of the fear of both these rocks.
