            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in Chriſt, Sir Iohn Brockette and Sir Iohn Cuttes
Knights, and M. Charles Moriſon Eſquire,

thorovv Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Sende vnto youre
worſhips, ſome few
lines and leaues of
mine, long agoe
written vppon the
Canticles of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
for the deareſt
friende that I had
amongſt men, whil
he was liuing vpon
earth: and lately publiſhed, for the profite of
Gods people, at the earneſt requeſt of ſome
of my very Godly friendes. For mine owne
part I was vtterlye purpoſed, either to haue
buryed the same (as diuers other things that
I haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon other books of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
in perpetuall darknes, that they ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:20644:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neuer haue beheld the light of this ſunne, or
els to haue ſuffered them to periſh amongeſt
wormes &amp; moaths, as the common prouerb
is. Wherevnto I was the rather ledde, not
for want of good will to benefite the church
of Chriſt, (all whoſe cauſes and euerye one of
them, ſhal thorow Gods goodnes be ſo deare
vnto me, as mine owne life) but partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the great ſinne and inſufficiencie, that
I find in my ſelfe, to perfourme that dutye in
action, wherevnto in affection I will alwayes
be readye, and partlye alſo by reaſon of the
great learning and light, that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vppon this laſt age of the worlde, but
moſt eſpecially by reaſon, of that wonderfull
waywardnes, and curiouſneſſe, that I ſee the
ſpirites of ſundrye men to be poſſeſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
whom nothing can pleaſe, but that which
they them ſelues affect. For if a man bring
new thinges, they are diſcontented, for that
men walke not in former antiquity. And if a
man, tread in the ſteps of the auncient, their
ſtomackes loath it, &amp; they count it coleworts
twiſe ſodde. And yet theſe men that are ſo
diuerſly conceited, hatch or bring foorth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their owne, either new or olde. For
mine owne part I will not denye, but that in
this poore worke that I now publiſhe, I haue
beene greatlye holpen, by the light of other
mens workes vpon the ſame booke, both old
<pb facs="tcp:20644:3"/>
and new writers I mean: But moſt of all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
therein by the writings of men, thogh
of late, yet of worthy memorie, who hauing
receiued more knowledge in tongs, &amp; more
light in the word, by reading, hearing, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and meditation therein, haue more
ſoundlye interpreted the ſame, than ſuch as
went before them in the fleſhe. And yet
I haue not ſo ſworne, into all their wordes,
but that vppon reaſon, I hope I maye both in
tranſlation and ſenſe now &amp; then with their
good leaue ſwarue from them. Whatſoeuer it
be let the church iudge, and take it I beſeech
your worſhips, into your hands fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hands
of him, that wiſheth you all and euery one of
you, al good in Chriſt. In the penning whereof
I can ſimplye confeſſe, that I haue neither
ſought gaine nor glorye to my ſelfe, but in all
ſimplicity and ſhortnes after my maner, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to come to the true meaning of the holy
Ghoſt, and the obſeruation of ſuch neceſſary
doctrines, as the Lorde made mee able to ſee
for the time. The courſe that I haue taken
therin, is plaine and profitable if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.
Firſt connecting the chap. togeather,
then diuiding them into their ſeuerall partes
and portions, afterwardes giuing the ſenſe of
them verſe by verſe, and laſtly obſeruing ſuch
doctrines, as moſt fitlye agree with the place.
If any man ſee more or better, I pray him, not
<pb facs="tcp:20644:4"/>
only not to contemn this that is, which is but
to publiſh that which maye more edifie. And
as for your worſhips, I beſeech you to accept
it, as at the hands of one that doth vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both loue &amp; reuerence you all in the truth,
and for the truth. And ſith it principallye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treteth
of the church, let it be a whetſtone to
ad an edge to your care &amp; loue, for the church
&amp; the cauſes therof: and the rather becauſe of
the practiſes of the wicked againſt it, both at
home &amp; abroad, that ſith they doe what they
can to vndermine it, thogh it be to their iuſt
condemnation, you maye doe your vttermoſt
to the vpholding of it, ſith in the peace &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing

paſſe betweene them, making as it were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
the betrothment, otherwhiles declaring, the
mutuall duties one of them towardes an other,
but ſpecially that ſame great loue of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome
to his ſpouſe, which is neuer remooued,
but alwayes abideth conſtant, how oft ſoeuer

to forſake her huſband. If any think this kinde
of dealing, to be ouerlight for ſo graue, &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a matter, let them take heed that in the height
of their owne hartes, they doe not ouer prowdly
cenſure God and his order, who in many places
vſeth this ſimilitude or parable of mariage, to
expreſſe his loue to his Church by, and the dutie
of the Church towardes him: one or two places
ſhal ſerue, as <hi>Hoſchea. 2. 19. I will mary thee
vnto me for euer, yea, I will marry thee vnto

by this meanes Chriſtes loue is expreſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
his Church, maye appeare, Epheſ. 5. 25.
<hi>Husbandes, loue your wiues, euen as Chriſt
loued the Church.</hi> And the obedience of the

ver. 22. 23. 24. Concerning the time when
this Booke ſhould be written, nothing can bee
ſayde of certainty out of the ſcriptures. Wiher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leauing coniecturall geſſes, let vs cleaue to
the certeinty, Gods ſpirite hath penned it, and
by the prouidence of our almighty God it hath
beene eſteemed in all times, to the end that we,
vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ends of the world are come, might
reap and receiue profit and comfort thereby: and
yet ſee ſomewhat thereof hereafter.</p>
               <p>1 This firſt Chapter I doe deuide into three
partes. The firſt comprehendeth the tytle
or inſcription of the worke, together with
the authors name, &amp; this is in the firſt verſ.</p>
               <p>2 The ſeconde ſetteth out the wiſhes of the
Church, derſiing effectuallye to be ioyned
with her head and ſpouſe Chriſt. And this
is from verſe 2. to the end of the 7.</p>
               <p>3 And the third conteineth Chriſts ready offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of himſelf to his church, with a mutual
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation one of an other: vz. of Chriſt &amp;
his Church, from ver. 8. to the end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chap.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 1. <hi>A ſong of ſonges</hi>
                  </hi>) That is to ſay, a moſt
excellent and notable ſong. For by dubbling of
the wordes, the Scripture vſeth, if it ſpeake of
good thinges, to vnderſtande moſte excellent
thinges: as Deut. 10. 17. <hi>The Lord your God
is God of Gods, and Lord of Lordes.</hi> That is
to ſay, moſt high Lord and God. Whereas if it
ſpeake of baſe thinges, it doth then on the other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20644:7"/>
ſide by dubbling, debaſe them as much, as Gen.
9. 25. It is ſayd of Ham, <hi>A ſeruant of ſeruants
ſhall he be.</hi> That is to ſay, a moſt vile ſlaue or
ſeruaunt. <hi>Which is Salomons</hi>) That is to ſaye,
which <hi>Salomon</hi> made: putting the time preſent
for the time paſt. And this is the generall title
of the whole Booke, and conteineth as a man
would ſay, not onelye the writers name, but the
verye chiefe matter, it beeing a moſte excellent
mariage ſong, as you would ſay, beeween Chriſt
and his church. That <hi>Solomon</hi> ment, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

if which you may ſee, Pſal. 45. thorow out, but
alſo to aſcend on high, vz. to the ſpirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
betweene Chriſt and his church, I take it
to be ouer plaine, then needeeh to be ſtood vpon.</p>

                  </hi>) The Church deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
the vnfained loue and continuall preſence

teſtimony of loue. ſee Geneſ. 31. 28. Geneſ. 45.
15. Luke. 7. 45. 2. Cor. 13. 12. So that he putteth
the ſigne of the thing for the thing it ſelfe. <hi>With
the kiſſes of his mouth.</hi>) The church meaneth by
kiſes in the plurall number the aboundaunce
am continuaunce of his loue, and by the worde
<hi>his mouth,</hi> his preſence: euen as it is ioyfull to
parties affiaunced, not onelye to ſee one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

profitable, ſweete, pleaſant, and as it were

change of the perſon: for heere the Church ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of Chriſt in the ſecond perſon, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhee had ſpoken of him in the third. <hi>Before
Wine,</hi> that is to ſay, if they are better then
Wine: if they may be compared therewith: that
men had <hi>Wine</hi> in great account, and took it as a
ſingular bleſſing from God, may appeare Pſa.
4. 7. But by wine heere he meaneth, a very fine,
ſumptuous, and wel furniſhed feaſt, a part of the
feaſt, or ſome of the thinges vſed in the feaſt for
the feaſt it ſelfe: ſee Heſter. 5. 6. Prou, 21. 17.

The Church commendeth Chriſt for the great

yea, more excellent then all oyntments. This is
vſuall by oyntmentes or annoynting to ſignify
Gods graces, and benefites, they being ſygnes
thereof, put to the thing it ſelfe: as, 1. Ioh. 2. 20.
Pſalm. 133. 2 <hi>Thy name ſprade abroade</hi> (that is

<hi>Damſelles</hi> or <hi>Virgines,</hi> the Church meaneth her

particular Congregations: who are alſo called
<hi>Damſelles,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins,</hi> becauſe their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation

                  <hi>Verſ. 4. <hi>Drawe mee.</hi>
                  </hi>) Theſe are ſtill the
wordes of the Church, acknowledging her own
weakneſſes, and crauing, not of deſert, but for
free good will, that ſhe may come to her ſpouſe,
which without his aſſiſtaunce, ſhe cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourm,
as Ioh. 6. 44. alſo Iohn. 15. 5. <hi>We will
runne after thee.</hi>) This may either bee a ſodaine
change of the number, a thing often vſed in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20644:9"/>
Scripture, paſſing from the ſinguler to the
plurall: or els the church ſpeaketh it in her own
name, and the name of her damſels and virgins:
which though they be many in reſpect of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
congregations, yet are they but all one,
in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body, and the word of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
noteth the willingnes and readines of the
church, in following God and his calling. The
inſtruments that God doth vſe to draw her by,
are his word outwardly, and his ſpirit inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
the ready running of the church, conſiſteth in
ſpirituall and holye affections, and in care and
conſcience, euen in outwarde conuerſation to
ſhew themſelues ready to ſtriue to ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Now the church addeth a promiſe of praiſe and
thankſgiuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be yeelded and performed,
when the Lorde ſhall in great plentye powre
foorth his graces vppon her, ſaying: <hi>When the

Sauiour, the king that God hath appointed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his Church, as Pſal. 2. 6. <hi>Shall haue brought
me</hi>) vz. of his meere mercy and grace, for there
was neuer any thing in the Church, to procure
Chriſt to loue it before he loued it, as Epheſ. 5.
25. 26. 27. <hi>Into his inner chambers</hi>) that is to
ſay, into moſt ſure and ſafe places, ſpeaking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the maner of men, who hide their moſte pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

reſerued, for the treaſures them ſelues, that is
for the excellent aboundance, and riches of his
graces, as of the knowledge of his miſteries and

to the particular members of her body, whereby
ſhee preuenteth that, that either her enemies
might obiect againſt her, or her friendes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

wordes, either ſimplye thus, that the Church, by
reaſon of the afflictions that ſhe indured, ſhould
be blacke and deformed, euen as the verye tentes
of the <hi>Arabians</hi> were, that by the heat of the ſun,
by tempeſtes and ſtormes, and the mutability of
the ayre, were maruailouſlie defaced as it were:
or els, that by the figure <hi>Metonomy,</hi> he putteth
the tentes, for the people dwelling in the tentes,
which I rather encline vnto, by reaſon of that
which is written, Pſal. 120. 5. <hi>Kedar</hi> was the
name of one of <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> Sonnes, as appeareth
Geneſ. 25. 13. who togeather with their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

for the people inhabiting the ſame, as <hi>Hieremie.
2. 10. Hiereme.</hi> 49. 28. that the people dwelt in

this reaſon me thinketh is ſufficient to proue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were gyuen muche to trauell from

it came by ſome other meanes: as firſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

vz. thy flockes. For ſhe compareth Chriſt to a
good ſheepheard, that prepareth meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
food for his flocke. ſee Pſalm. 23. 1. &amp;c.
Iohn. 10. 14. <hi>Where thou careſt that thy flock may
lie downe at noone tide</hi>) The church here expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
the great care and loue that Chriſt hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his people, which he calleth by the name of
flocke. as Luke. 12. 32. Actes. 20. 28: and alſo in
what a quiet ſtate and condition they are in
which follow Chriſt. True it is, that he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
this vnder a parable, of the flockes taking
their reſt at noone time in the heate of the daye,
but by ſuch manner of earthlye ſpeeches, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the Lord many times in his word to ſet out
ſpirituall and heauenly matters. <hi>For why ſhould
I be, as one that ſpreadeth the tent, amongest the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20644:13"/>
flockes of thy companions.</hi>) The church noteth in
this ſpeech two thinges: the one is if ſhee finde
not the ſpouſe, ſhee is in daunger of falling into
manifeſt and manifold corruptions. The other
is that it greeueth her to be conuerſant, though
it were neuer ſo ſmall a while, with counterfeit
hipocrites, and vngodly perſons. <hi>q. d.</hi> what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſhall come vnto thee, or profit to me, by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thy ſelfe from me, and I by falling thereby
into ſocietie and familiaritie with others? For
the church vſeth ſpreading or pitching of tents,
for familiaritye and felowſhip, ſpeaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the people of <hi>Arabia,</hi> who as is
ſayde before, dwelt in tents. And when ſhe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>Thy companions,</hi> ſhee ſpeaketh thus, not as
though ſhee made theſe ſtraunge ſheepheardes,
good ſhepheards, or anye waye comparable with
her ſpouſe. but rather according to that that they
them ſelues, gaue out of them ſelues, and as in
name and outwarde ſhew they woulde ſeeme to
be, when as they had nothing in deed and truth.
See 2. Cor. 11. 14. 15. In a word this me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
is the ſenſe, the church beeing as it were in
daunger wandring vp and downe to ſeeke her
ſpouſe, feareth, leaſt if ſhee ſhoulde not haue the
place ſhewed her, where ſhee might find him, ſhe
ſhould runne aſtray, and ioyne her ſelfe to other
congregations, that do boaſt them ſelues to bee
Chriſts companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and friends, &amp; reioyce in the
name of the church, and yet are neither ſo nor ſo.</p>

                  <hi>Verſe. 8. <hi>Seeing thou knoweſt not.</hi>
                  </hi>) This is
Chriſtes aunſweare to the church, ſhewing that
he is nigh to them that ſeeke him, as Pſal, 145.
18. and it conſiſteth of two partes, firſt hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweareth
her, and inſtructeth her, and then hee
teſtifieth his good will and kindneſſe towardes
her. <hi>Seeing thou knowest not</hi>) vz. ſo fully as thou
ſhouldeſt, but in part onelye, (as all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the church in this lyfe, is no other. 1.
Cor. 13. 12. And therefore deſireſt further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
I will teach thee. <hi>O thou the fayreſt
of women.</hi>) Chriſt adorneth his church with this
title, whereby we may ſee that the church is not
as men account of her, but as ſhe is eſteemed by
her ſpouſe. <hi>Goe out.</hi>) vz. from that companye of
counterfeit ſheepheardes and ſheepe, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by that which hee addeth, follow now the
ſteppes of that flocke, for their feete tread not in
the right path to life, but lead the way to eternal
deſtruction. And by that worde, <hi>goe out,</hi> he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
not onely the ſpeedy departure from them,
but that the church ſhoulde not communicate,
with them nor with any thing that was theirs.
See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52. 11. which alſo he noteth by that
phraſe, follow not the ſteps of that flocke. <hi>And
feed the kiddes</hi>) I take this particle, <hi>and</hi> heere to
be put for, but, as in other places of ſcripture <hi>q.
d.</hi> this is it that thou muſt do, not onely ſhun o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens euils &amp; corruptions, but do thoſe good
thinges that thou art appoynted vnto. And by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20644:14"/>
kiddes, he meaneth the flockes of faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and euery particular one, noting alſo vnder
that manner of ſpeech the tenderneſſe of the
Church, and euerye particular member thereof.
<hi>Aboue the tents of other ſheepheardes</hi>) That is to
ſaye, with more excellent paſture, both for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce
and forme, then theſe ſheepheardes with
their tents are conuerſant in. He meaneth that
he would haue the church, by the food of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye
doctrine, to lift vp the faithfull people,
far aboue the earth, and earthlye thinges, as 1.
Cor. 2. 14. 15. <hi>And he calleth them here ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes

called them verſe. 7. Chriſtes companions.</hi>

                  <hi>Verſe. 9. <hi>I do compare thee.</hi>
                  </hi>) The ſpouſe, after
inſtruction of the church, entereth into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
thereof. verſe. 9. 10. 11. And when he
ſayth that he doth compare her, the meaneth not
onely that he doth reſemble her, no cauſe thereof
beeing in her, why ſhee ſhould be reſembled, but
that he doth and will inable her by his graces e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the beſt thinges, for that he meaneth by
horſes ioyned to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chariots. This we
know that Pharaoh was a name common to all
the kinges of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> This we know further,
that the horſes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were in great regarde
and eſtimation, not onely in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but in other
countries alſo, as 1. King. 10. 28. 29. Neither is
it without force that he ſpeaketh of troupes, and
multitudes, &amp; of chariots, for for all theſe things
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20644:14"/>
                  <hi>Aegypt</hi> was very commendable, as Exod. 14. 7.
9. All which layde togeather maketh much, for
the credite, glory and renowne, that Chriſte gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vnto his church, &amp; for the excellency therof.
<hi>Verſ. 10. <hi>Thy cheeks are comely.</hi>
                  </hi>) The ſpouſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth

that are moſt to be ſeen, becauſe if they be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
&amp; fayre, inquiry is not made of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and fayreneſſe of the reſt. And when he ſayth,
that they are comelye, as though they were ſet
with rowes of ſtones, hee alludeth no doubt to
the maner of the Eaſterne princes, who vſed to
trimm their bridles, and other furniture for the
fore part of their horſes, with ſundrye kindes of
ornaments, as golde, pearle, precious ſtones. &amp;c.
See Iudges. 8. 21. meaning that there was no
greater glorye nor comelines in theſe thinges.
then was in the outwarde partes and members
of the church. And to that ſame end muſt that be
referred, when he ſayth. <hi>Thy necke as it were with

Iudges before alleadged. Now to enquire ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſhoulde be put for ſhamefaſtneſſe, modeſtye

Saffron. Sure it is that there was diuerſ ſortes
of it. One ſort is called <hi>Nardus celtica,</hi> which the
French men call <hi>Lawand,</hi> and we in a terme not
far from theirs, call Lawander. An other ſort
was called <hi>Nardus Aſſiria,</hi> which I take to be
that that the Euangeliſtes, Marke. 14. 3. Ihon.

that neither the whole, nor the partes of the

<hi>Thine eyes be like the doues eyes</hi>) that is, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

not onely in reſpect of inwarde affection, but of
outward appearaunce alſo, ſo that the church
hath no vnchaſt lookes or countenaunces, (of
which we read ſomewhat Pſal. 44. 17. 18. 20.)
but contenteth her ſelfe with her onely huſband

when ſhee hath choſen a match, keepeth her ſelfe

(as a man would ſay) as the Philoſophers write

their houſe, but their ſeuerall houſes (which alſo
ſerueth for their great magnificence) for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
and wonderfull commodities thereof:
as for the ſtrength of them, and the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and pleaſures thereof. Their ſtrenght is
noted, in that the beames thereof are ſayde to
be of Cedar trees, which wood, as ſome write,
will neuer rotte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their excellencie and ſtately<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

it is, they were a certayne kinde of Wood,
which yeeldeth a moſte ſweete ſauour: and the

there is nothing meant thereby, but the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
excellency and pleaſantneſſe of the church,

                  <hi>Verſe. 1. <hi>I am the roſe of Sharon.</hi>
                  </hi>) I take theſe
to be the wordes of the ſpouſe,<note place="margin">Senſe.</note> commending him
ſelfe, for his moſte excellent ſweete vertue, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to all, but ſpeciallye to his church, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
his ſpirite vnto it. If any man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
that the Bryde and the Brydegrome, doe
commende them ſelues both heere and in other
places, let him know, that in olde time this was
not vnſeemely, as it is now accounted. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they did not flatter them ſelues in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
neither extolled them ſelues more then was
meet. Thirdly, that the Brydegrome in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
could not offend, becauſe there was neuer
any ſinne founde in him, as 1. Pet. 2. 22. That
<hi>Sharon</hi> was a plentifull place, maye appeare. 1,
Chr. 27. 29. Alſo Iſaiah. 53. 2. One reaſon of the
fertility therof may be giuen, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moderate warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the ſun in that place, in which places alſo
roſes doe moſt delight and flouriſh, &amp; are alſo by
that means, as the Philoſopher ſuppoſeth, more
ſweet of ſauor. So that when Chriſt reſembleth
him ſelfe to the roſe of <hi>Sharon,</hi> hee meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els, but that he was well coloured, fruitful
and of very good ſauor, able inough thorow his
ſweetneſſe, and the aboundance of his giftes and
graces, to allure and drawe his Churche to him
ſelfe. And the ſame I ſuppoſe he meaneth by
comparing him ſelfe in the nexte part of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20644:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
verſe, to the Lilie of the vallies. How glorious
and excellent the Lilie is, our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
beareth witneſſe Math. 6. 28. 29. And
when the Lorde will aſſure his people of a great
bleſſing, hee promiſeth them that they ſhall
grow as the Lilie, Hoſea. 14. 5. Much more
excellent ſhall it be, when it groweth in a moſte
fertile place, ſuch as the vallies are that lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two hilles, which in all reaſon can not
chuſe, but bee verye fruitefull and plentifull.
Chriſte therefore by this manner of ſpeech, not
onelye noteth his great glorye and excellencye,
but alſo ſetteth foorth the aboundaunce of fruite,
that theſe ſhall yeeld, which ſhall bee ingrafted
into him, as the true vine. For which ſee
Iohn. 15. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 2. <hi>As a Lilie among Thornes, ſo is my
loue amonge the Daughters.</hi>
                  </hi> Theſe are ſtill
Chriſtes wordes, not commending him ſelfe as
before, but the Church, ſhewing heereby, that
the Church in dignitye and honour ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth
other companyes and aſſemblyes, as the
Lilie in beautye and ſauour ſurmounteth the
Thornes. He meaneth not that Lilies grow
amongeſt Thornes, but ſpeaketh it by the
waye of compariſon: <hi>q. d.</hi> there is euen as
much oddes betweene the Church and other
counterfayt congregations, as is betweene
Lilies and Thornes, or as we would ſaye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20644:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Golde and Droſſe. What hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by the terme <hi>Loue,</hi> is playne by that
which is Chapter 1. verſe 9. And by <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
he meaneth all thoſe that were and are out
of the boſome of the Church: and I thincke it
ſhoulde not bee amiſſe, for the more plaine ſenſe
of the place, to ioyne to the worde <hi>Daughters,</hi>
theſe wordes, of men. As Geneſ. 6. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 3. <hi>As an Apple tree.</hi>
                  </hi> Heere begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the ſeconde parte of this Chapter, which
as I take it, contayneth three eſpeciall points.
The firſte is a declaration of the excellencie
of the Spouſe, and of the great deſire that the
Church hath towardes him, and that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in this thirde verſe. The ſecond is a
declaration of the duties of mutuall loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and that reacheth from verſe 4. to
the ende of the 15. And laſtlye, ſhee deſireth
of her Spouſe, a perpetuall feeling of the frute
of this loue, and that is in the twoo laſte ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Now, in that ſhee reſembleth her Spouſe
to an <hi>Apple tree,</hi> ſhee myndeth thereby to ſet
out his pleaſauntneſſe to the ſight, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the taſte, and his profitablenes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in reſpect of his frute. Now when ſhee
addeth, <hi>Among the trees of the Forreſt,</hi> ſhe
meaneth eyther Trees altogeather barren,
or elſe ſuch, as, though they yeelde fruite, yet
is it not good for menne. And when ſhee
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20644:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaith: <hi>So is my welbeloued among the ſonns,</hi> you may
ad for more playne ſenſe, of men, as Pſalm. 45. 2
yea though they be neuer ſo good and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of in the Church, meaning that hee is
moſt fruitfull and ſweete, both in ſhadow and in
fruite, as the wordes following in this verſe, doe
playnly expound it. True it is, that he is not
ſo eſteemed of among worldlings, by reaſon of
his baſeneſſe: but yet his owne haue him euer in
that account and regard, howe baſe &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
ſoeuer he be in the world. Read Iſaiah, 53
thoroughout. It followeth: <hi>I doe very greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſit in his ſhadow.</hi> Here the Church expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
the earneſt affection that ſhee hath to bee
kept vnder Chriſtes prouidence, from the heate
of perſecution, affliction, ſinne, &amp;c. for ſo I take
the word <hi>Shadow,</hi> to be vſed heere, as Pſalm. 91.
ver. 1. or elſe as ſhe her ſelf ſpeaketh it verſes 16
17. of this chapter, that ſhe might he his, and he
hers for euer, or elſ as our ſauiour himſelf ſaith,
Ioh. 7. <hi>I in them, and them in mee, that they
may be made perfect in me, &amp; that they may
be there, euen where I am.</hi> ver. 23. 24. And by
ſitting, ſhe meaneth continuall abode and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
<hi>His fruit,</hi> that is, that that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from him and his worde. For as Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and fruite and apples are acceptable to the
faint and wearied, Iob. 7. ſo all thinges that
come from Chriſte, are to his moſte ſweete and
comfortable, if they ſtay vppon him and cleaue
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20644:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely to his word, yea his very yoke and burthen
ſhall be eaſy and light to them, as Math. 11. 28.
29. 30. 1. Iohn. 5. 3 <hi>is ſweete to the roofe of my
mouth.</hi> He putteth one part of the man, for the
whole, and namely that part which is moſte apt
for taſting, vnderſtanding thereby, not only how
delightfull Chriſte was to the outwarde man,
but ſpecially and cheefely to the inward, vnder
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> outward part alſo comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the inward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 4. <hi>He brought me vnto the place of wine:</hi>
                  </hi>
Theſe are ſtill the churches wordes, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the aboundant kindneſſe and loue of his
ſpouſe. By <hi>place of Wine,</hi> ſhe meaneth the places
of delicate fare and feaſting, as before, chap. 1. 2
but all this muſt bee ſpiritually vnderſtoode, to
wit that our Sauiour brought the church to
life and ſaluation, by the exerciſes of the worde
and ſacraments, Whereunto the parable of the
mariage. Math. 22. doth in ſome ſort appertain
<hi>And his banner towards me was loue,</hi> (that is, hee
had loue towards me inſteed of a ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner) Thoſe
that are ſkilled in warre know, that by banners
and Enſignes the ſouldiers are called together,
and kept in awe vnder their owne capitaines,
Whereunto it ſhould ſeeme that the church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth,
meaning, that the huſbande of his onely
loue towards the church, did by his fauour, as it
were by a banner ſet before her eys, draw her as
it were vnto him. Or elſ it may be thus. Sundry
people, and namely the Turke, when hee beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20644:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any place, doth the firſt day ſet vp a banner

it: the next time a red banner, betokening the
execution of the cheefeſt: and the laſt time a
black one, ſignifying all one and other muſt to
the ſworde and fire. But Chriſte the ſpouſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſetteth vp a banner of loue, grace, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor,
howſoeuer we little deſerue the ſame at his
hands. The firſt ſeemeth to me to bee the more

are the wordes of the Church, ſpoken vnto her
Damoſels or virgins, of whom ſee before chap.
1. 3. and ſhee ſeemeth to be ſo inflamed with the
loue of Chriſt, that ſhe is ready euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the banquet, to ſinck down, or to ſwoone,
as you wold ſay for loue. But ſhe hath two aides
and comfortes in this her weakneſſe: one expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in this verſe: the other in the next verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
That in this verſe is, that thoſe that
attend vppon her by the Bridegromes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is, the Prophetes, Apoſtles and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes
of God (See for this purpoſe Epheſ.
4. from verſe 11. to the ende of the 16) doe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
vnto her at her requeſt, the ſpiritual
Treaſures and good thinges of her Huſband,
which I take to bee noted, and that very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
and playnly by theſe wordes: <hi>Proppe mee
vp with theſe flagons: beare me vp with theſe apples,</hi>
as it were appointing ſome certain aides, which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20644:25"/>
if they were neglected, all the reſt that coulde
bee vſed, were worth nothing. And by <hi>Flagons,</hi>
no doubt ſhe meaneth, by the figure Metonimie,
the thing contayning, for the thing contained,
that is, the ſweete. Water and drinke of life,
of which ſee Iſaaih, 55. 1. which Treaſure
alſo wee haue in earthen Veſſelles, or Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonnes,
as 2. Corinthians 4. 7. and is indeede
nothing elſe but the ſweet promiſes of Chriſt
vnto euerlaſting life. And though by Apples
layde vnder her as it were, ſhee meane the
ſelfe ſame thinge: yet there is another order
of it. For hee alludeth to the cuſtome of men,
who, when other are ſwooning or faynting,
are wont to put ſtrong ſmelling, thinges vnto
their Noſtrelles: ſo the Church meaneth, that
for her comforte and refreſhing, and reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
her agayne as it were from death to
life, ſhee woulde haue well ſmelling Apples,
fette out of Chriſtes Treaſure, both helde and
applyed to her, that by that meanes ſhee maye
bee, as it were recouered: <hi>For I am ſicke with
loue: <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> I ſhall neuer ceaſe, nor bee in quiet, till
I perfectly enioy my Huſbandes companye,
feeling in this life, the aſſured Teſtimonye of
his continuall fauour, and poſſeſſing the ſame
eternally in the heauenly glory. See 2. Corin.

                  </hi>) Theſe are ſtill the
wordes of the church, contayning as I ſayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the ſeconde comfort in her fainting: and
that is, that ſhe had her ſpouſe, not onely preſent
with her (who alone is able effectuallye to heal
the church) but ſhewing ſingular loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
cowardes her: ſtaying her vp with the one
hand that ſhee fall not downe, and comforting
her with the other by lauing imbracing her. I
know that ſome put the right hand for length of
dayes, and the left hande for glory and riches, as
Prouerb. 3. 16. But this is the more ſimple, and
agreeth better with the circumſtaunce of place
&amp; perſon, to wit that Chriſt by vſing the geſtures
of thoſe that do imbrace their friendes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and eaſe them in their infirmities, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
thereby, the ſingular loue he hath to his

her.</p>

                  <hi>Verſe. 7. <hi>I charge you and that by an oth.</hi>
                  </hi>) Theſe
are ſtill as I take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the wordes of the church,
and not of Chriſt (as ſome ſuppoſe) reſting in the
imbraſing of her ſpouſe, of which we hearde im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlye
before verſe 6. ſtraightlye charging
thoſe to whom ſhee ſpeaketh, that no manner of
waye they bee troubleſome or diſquietous to her
ſpouſe, that reſteth him ſelf and taketh pleaſure
in the imbracinges of her. And there is a double
reaſon that leadeth me to thinke, that theſe are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20644:26"/>
the churches words rather then Chriſtes. Firſt,
becauſe that ſhe by reaſon of the authority ſhee
had, might commaunde, as ſhee doth verſe 15. of
this Chapter. Secondly, becauſe all the wordes
that followe till you come to verſe. 15 are the
Churches wordes. When ſhee ſayth that ſhee
<hi>chargeth them by an oth,</hi> ſhe meaneth that ſhee
doth very hardly and ſtraightly charge them,
and as it were in conſcience binde them. For
the wordes, <hi>Daughters of Ieruſalem,</hi> ſee chapter
1:5. ſhe meaneth no doubt ſuch, as wiſhed well
to the church, and had ſomewhat to doe therein.
<hi>Tarry ye abroad with theroes, or with the hindes of
the field.</hi> That is, get you abroade for a while,
take your pleaſure, and do what you will, onely
diſquiet not, neyther vexe my ſpouſe. And all
this is ſpoken by the church, as though the feaſt
had beene kept abroade in ſome country towne
or Village abroade: alſo it is vttered after the
manner of men and their wiues, who when they
will talke of ſecrete matters, or take their reſt
and ſleepe quietly together, will bid their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and ſeruaunts auoyde, and get them abroad
to recreate them ſelues whether they will for
a while. <hi>Stirre not vp, neyther make,</hi> That is, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
him not any manner of way. And this the
church ſpeaketh both of her hearty loue that ſhe
beareth towards her ſpouſe: and alſo of good wil
that ſhe carrieth towards her ſelfe, who earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſheth and deſtreth to inioy the continuall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20644:27"/>
preſence, and company of her ſpouſe. <hi>This loue,</hi>
vz. of mine, meaning him, whom ſhe moſt dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and tenderly loued: which thing is alſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and playnlie expreſſed by the article, this.
<hi>Vntill he will himſelfe.</hi> The Church referreth all,
to the good will and pleaſure of her ſpouſe,
onely this ſhe taketh care for, that he may not be
prouoked or diſturbed by her, or any of hers, by
anye occaſion or offence though neuer ſo ſmall,
but ſheweth herſelfe louing and obedient to him
in all thinges. See Epheſ. 5. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 8. <hi>It is the voyce of my Welbeloued.</hi>
                  </hi> The
Church in the verſes before going, and namely
verſ 4. 5. 6. had ſet out one notable duty of our
ſauiour towards her, and that was of life and
ſaluation which he brought her, figured vnder
the ſhadow of a banquet and healing. Nowe ſhee
recokneth vp another kindneſſe ſhewed, to wit,
the giuing of her pleaſure, peace and all good
thinges neceſſary for her: and this he ſetteth out
vnder the figure of the ſpring time, and of all
greene and flouriſhinge thinges, offering them
ſelues as it were to the ſight and ſeruice of the
church, &amp; this reacheth from this verſ to the end
of the 15. And this ſpeech may be deuided into
two partes. One is, that Chriſt offereth all good
thinges to the church, and refreſheth her, beeing
deliuered from the winterly tempeſtes of ſinne:
&amp; this reacheth vnto verſe 14. The other is, that
he putteth back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, al euil &amp; hurtful things,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20644:27"/>
and this is compriſed in ver. 15, both which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Chriſt performeth to his church, by his word
&amp; the miniſters thereof, who are his ſeruants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purpoſe: as 2. Cor. 4. 5. But let vs
come to the words as they lie. <hi>It is the voice of my
welbeloued.</hi> Theſe wordes are ſpoken, as though
while the bride ſlept, the bridegrome had gone
abroad ſome whither, and as though ſhe had bene
ſodainly waked, &amp; made meruellous glad, by the
voice of her ſpouſe returning backe againe, <hi>q. d.</hi>
Certainly it is my ſpouſes voice, wherin I much
reioyce, al this while I did but dream it, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it ſo to bee: as when ſtraunge thinges and
vnlooked for come to paſſe, we can hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
at the firſt that they are ſo, as Pſalme.
126, 1, But now I perceiue of a trueth, it is not
his voice indeed. <hi>Behold him. <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> I woulde haue
you that are my freendes and welwillers, to bee
perſwaded of this, as well as I: for I take that
ſhe ſpeaketh theſe wordes to them. <hi>He commeth
leaping vpon theſe mountaines, skipping vppon theſe
hilles.</hi> Theſe wordes of leaping and ſkipping, do
not onely note his great ſpeede and hair, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and comforte his churche, which is alſo ſet
out in the nexte Verſe, by the ſimilitude of <hi>Roes</hi>
and <hi>Hindes:</hi> but the other wordes alſo of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes</hi>
and <hi>Hilles,</hi> doe meruelouſly expreſſe his
ſingular loue, as though the Churche ſhoulde
ſaye: the daunger of the iorneye, the hardneſſe
of the waye, neyther anye thing elſe as mans
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20644:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power, aydes and ſuch like, can hinder him from
comming to me, to comfort mee in my diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And that mountaines and hilles are ſo vſed,
may appeare. Iſa. 40. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 9 <hi>My beloued is like a Roe, or a hindes
calfe..</hi>
                  </hi> The Church meaneth by theſe wordes, to
declare how ſwift and ſpeedy Chriſte is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and ſuccour her. We our ſelues knowe by
experience that <hi>Roes</hi> and <hi>hindes</hi> bee very ſwift
footed: but beſides our owne knowledge, wee
haue the warrant of the word: as Pſalm. 18. 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>beholding him ſtanding behinde our wall.</hi> As though
the church ſhould ſay. It is a wonderfull thing,
be ſtandeth by mee, and is preſent with me ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then I can ſpeake. And when ſhe ſayth, <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
behinde our wall,</hi> I thinke by <hi>Wall,</hi> ſhe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
Gods goodneſſe, and the promiſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes
of his word, with which the church in the
time of the croſſe and triall, armeth and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
her ſelfe: behind which, Chriſt may be ſaid
to ſtand, when the perfourmance thereof, is not
plainly ſeene to his children, and yet hee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
nigh vnto them in the trueth thereeof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to helpe them, as ſhe afterwards addeth.
For the worde <hi>Wall,</hi> ſee Iſaiah. 26. 1. <hi>Looking
foorth of the windowes.</hi> I take, that by all theſe
ſpeeches, the church meaneth nothing elſe, but
Chriſtes fauour towards her. This ſpeech may
be borrowed from great perſonages and ſtates:
as kings, Queenes and ſuch like, who do many
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20644:28"/>
times ſhew themſelues at windowes to be ſeene
of their people: which thing alſo the people take
as a teſtimony of great fauour, ſpeciallye when
out of the windowes, they ſhew them pleaſaunt
and delightfull countenaunces. <hi>Springing out of
the gates.</hi> This ſpeech is ſomewhat darke, and
yet ſo it is in the Hebrue text: and is a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore</hi>
taken from floriſhing trees and flowers,
to which Chriſt was reſembled before verſes. 1.
3. The church meaneth nothing by this maner
of ſpeech, but to ſet out, the moſt flouriſhing and
pleaſant countenaunce, that her ſpouſe gaue her.
In ſumme, all comes to this: that the churches
wordes do by certaine ſteppes, as it were, ſet out
the wonderfull worke of Chriſte towardes her:
as firſt, ſhe heareth his voice, verſe 8. Next ſhee
ſeeth him comming, verſe 8. alſo. And laſtly,
ſhee doth preſently behold him preſent. verſe 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 10. <hi>My welbeloued ſpeaking faire vnto me</hi>
                  </hi>)
In this verſe, the church taketh vpon her the
perſon of her ſpouſe as it were, declaring what
wordes he vſed to her, who as yet calleth her, not
to the full and abſolute enioying of thoſe good
thinges that are layd vp for her in heauen, but to
the moſt aſſured ſeales and pledges, of thoſe good
thinges that are to come, which Chriſt woulde
haue communicated vnto his Church, both in
word and deed by his eternall ſpirite. <hi>Ariſe my
loue, my fayre one, and come.</hi> When our ſauiour
calleth the church <hi>his loue,</hi> hee ſheweth in what
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20644:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great regard he hath her, and how tenderly hee
fauoreth her: and when hee calleth her, his <hi>fayre
one,</hi> he ſheweth how much he doth account of her.
For ſo much is the church in deede, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
members therof, as it pleaſeth the ſpouſe
to eſteeme of them. And when he ſaith <hi>ariſe and
come,</hi> he meaneth that he woulde haue her come
out of the ignoraunce, darkneſſe, and ſinne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhe was, to the pleaſantnes of righteouſneſſe
and holy conuerſation, wherin he taketh delight,
and ſo you ſhall finde the worde <hi>ariſe</hi> vſed Rom.
13. 11. and the word <hi>come.</hi> Math. 11. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 11. <hi>For loe winter is paſt: the raine is paſt,
it is gone away.</hi>
                  </hi> This is a reaſon that the ſpouſe
yeeldeth, why the church ſhoulde ariſe and come
vnto him, &amp; it is taken (ioyning this 11. 12. and
13. verſ. following togeather) from a comparing
of the time before her calling, with the time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her calling. The former time was winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and ſtormye altogeather, and then was the
Church ſtraunge from the common wealth of
God, and wallowing in ſinne: but the time ſince
her calling, is altogeather greene, flouriſhing,
pleaſaunt, ſweet fruitful, and ſuch as ſhould moſt
plentifully repleniſh her heart and all her ſenſes,
and this I take to be the meaning of theſe three
verſes 11. 12. 13. togeather, to wit that by <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
raine, &amp;c.</hi> he meaneth ſinne, errour, ignorance
and all croſſes either inwarde or outward layde
vpon the church, as perſecution, reproch, &amp;c: and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20644:29"/>
by <hi>floriſhing thinges, ſinging of birdes, the voyce of
Turtles, the figge tree and her young ones: The
Vine and her firſte grape, &amp;c.</hi> which are all eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
tokens of ſpring time and Sommer, hee
meaneth aſſured teſtimonies of Gods grace: as
forgiuenes of ſinnes, knowledge, and light of the
truth, and all outwarde bleſſinges of the Lorde,
as peace, plentye, proſperitie, &amp;c. And that by
<hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>raine,</hi> ſhoulde bee ſignified ſinne and
ignoraunce, it is not without proportion. For
as in the winter ſeaſon, all is ſtormy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> turbulent,
and darke: ſo ſinne bearing ſwaye, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but diſorder and ignoraunce. Now, let vs
more particularlye, conſider the wordes of the
12. &amp; 13. verſes, which I take to be ſo excellent
a diſcription of the ſpring time, and ſo forward,
as none either hath beene, or can be more liuely
giuen. For in the ſpring time floriſhing things,
that is, flowers ſhewe them ſelues, and Byrdes
ſing, to the great comfort of men, and the figge
doth ſende foorth her greene figges, and the
Vine her tender grape, whereas other trees for
the moſte part, doe ſhewe them in flowers firſte,
and afterwarde in fruite. For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of this place, ſee that which our
ſauiour ſayth, Mat. 24. 32. of the fig tree. And
when he ſayth <hi>The Figge tree it ſelfe,</hi> and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
addeth <hi>the Vines them ſelues,</hi> hee ſpeaketh
this as a ſure proofe that the ſpring is come.
For the fig tree and the vine, be two of the laſt, trees
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20644:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as we know by experience) that make ſhew of
their fruit, <hi>q. d.</hi> If you will not beleeue, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the flowres on earth, by hearing the
byrdes and turtles ſing (all which are euident
ſignes of the ſpring time): Yet beleeue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the figg tree and the vine which are more
late then other trees, haue alſo yeelded out their
fruit. And when he ſayth, <hi>Euen in the firſt grape,</hi>
he meaneth not that the vine yeeldeth fruit twiſe
a yeare, as one grape firſt, and an other after: but
that this was the firſt appearance of the grape,
and that yet notwithſtanding the vine it ſelfe
did yeeld, a ſweete ſmelling ſauour, both in the
leaues and fruite. As for that which followeth
in this 13. verſe, <hi>Ariſe my loue, my fayre one and
come,</hi> is expounded before verſe 10. of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 14. <hi>My doue, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> The church ſtill repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the wordes of her ſpouſe, begun before ver.
10. And in that he calleth her <hi>doue,</hi> he meaneth
not onelye thereby her beautye and fayrenes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Doues bee commonly white: but alſo hee
meaneth her chaſtitie, as before chap. 1. 15: Alſo
her ſimplicitye and vprightnes, togeather with
freedome from bitternes. See Math. 10. 16. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Pſal. 74. 19. Wryters alſo affirme, that the
doue hath no gall. He alludeth alſo further to the
nature of a doue in the next wordes, when as he
ſayth, <hi>Liuing in theſe cliftes of the rocke in a denne
all to broken.</hi> For they that wryte of the nature of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20644:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
creatures, affirme, that the doues doe ſpeciallye
delight to be ſeen in rockes, and to lye hid in the
Holes and cleftes: but by theſe thinges he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
as I take it, the modeſtye or ſhamefaſtneſſe
of the church, who ſomtimes thorow the feeling
of her ſinnes, ſometimes for the grieuouſnes of
perſecutions, is glad to get her into the rockes,
which are taken to be places of ſure defence, and
therefore he addeth particularly <hi>in theſe clefies of
the rocke,</hi> In which reſpect the faithfull manye
times call their Lord their rocke, as Pſal. 18. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſomtimes to be content with places of leſſe
aſſurance as dens all to broken, to the end that
for a while ſhe maye hide her ſelf there from the
rage and cruelty of the enemy, <hi>Shew me thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces,</hi>
that is, ſhew thy ſelfe in my preſence
and come vnto me. Neither lacketh it ſome force
that he ſpeaketh in the plurall number, as that
he woulde haue her to leaue none of her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
congregations or members behinde her.
<hi>Make me to heare thy voyce,</hi> that is to ſay, ſpeake
to me, walke continuallye with me, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaunt
with me. O ſingular loue of Chriſt to
his church, that doth thus earneſtly ſeeke for and
deſire the preſence and company thereof: and O
wonderfull ingratitude of the church, if ſhe ſhold
contemne it. <hi>For thy voyce is ſweete, and thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
comelye.</hi> All this hee ſpeaketh of the
church, not that ſhe is ſo of her ſelfe, but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
her ſpouſe ſo to accept of her. For therefore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20644:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath hee giuen him ſelfe for the church, that hee
might make it glorious vnto him ſelfe, &amp;c. as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
5. 25. 26. 27. And theſe wordes containe
alſo a reaſon, why Chriſte ſo much deſtreth the
preſence and company of his ſpouſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 15. <hi>Take for vs the foxes.</hi>
                  </hi>) I take theſe
wordes ſtill to bee ſpoken by the church, in the
perſon of Chriſte, as though that hee ſpake vnto
his friendes, not onely willing but commanding
them earneſtly to endeuour the remoouing of all
thinges great and little, that might hinder the
groweth of his church, which is a peculier inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce
vnto him ſelfe, whether it were in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
doctrine, or in corrupt conuerſation. See
Tit. 2. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <hi>Take for vs,</hi> he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that hee hath as great loue to the church as
to him ſelfe, which if it be ſpoyled or hurt, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth
alſo to him ſelfe. By <hi>foxes,</hi> he meaneth
not onely euill men, as heretickes, diſſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
&amp;c. that woulde hinder the groweth of the
church: but all other thinges whatſoeuer, how
great or how little ſoeuer they be: which alſo
he ſignifieth by the next ſpeech, in that he calleth
them <hi>little foxes.</hi> And when he addeth, <hi>corrupting
the vines,</hi> hee meaneth marring and deſtroying,
yea bringing as it were to vtter corruption and
deſtruction the churches of God. That Gods
church or the particular churches, are reſembled
to vynes, maye appeare by ſundrye places of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20644:31"/>
Scripture, as Iſaiah. 5. 1, &amp;c. Pſalm. 80. 8. 14.
Math. 21. 33, &amp;c. And that foxes are hurtfull to
vines, our verye proouerb ſheweth, the foxe will

the firſt grape,</hi> that is, while they are tender and

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 16. <hi>My welbeloued is mine.</hi>
                  </hi>) Theſe are
the wordes of the church, ſpoken in her owne
perſon, and is the concluſion of the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
made in this chapter by her: wherein ſhe
firſt reioyceth for the moſt excellent fellowſhip
that ſhee had with Chriſte: and next ſhee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
as it were, his continuall preſence all the
dayes of her lyfe, promiſing to remayne his, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſhee be perfectlye ioyned with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Now when ſhee ſayth, <hi>My welbeloued is
mine, and I am his,</hi> It is as much, as if ſhee
ſhoulde ſaye: he will haue no other for his wife
but me, neither will I acknowledge any other
for my Spouſe but him: wee will eyther of vs
delight one in an other, and bee contented to
take and loue one an other onelye. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
<hi>That feedeth amonge the Lilies.</hi>

I know theſe wordes are diuerſlye interpreted,
and I thinke it ariſeth, becauſe the Hebrue word
may be taken either paſſiuely or actiuely. Some
expound it thus, <hi>that feedeth among the lilies,</hi> that
is, that is moſt ſweet, <hi>and by the good ſmell of his
ſauors,</hi> that is by his goodnes, &amp; the ſweetnes of
his promiſes calleth &amp; allureth me vnto him. I
will ſpeak what I thinke, I had rather expound
it thus: <hi>that feedeth</hi>) vz. his flockes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as chap. 1.
7. <hi>among the lilies,</hi> that is, in ſweet pleaſant, ſoft
and well ſmelling paſture. <hi>q. d.</hi> He that plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye,
pleaſantly and ſweetlye handleth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth
thoſe that are his. And to this ſence
ſeemeth to agree, Pſal. 23. 1. 2.</p>

                  <hi>Verſe. 17. <hi>Vntill that day ſhall come, and theſe

                  </hi> Theſe are ſtill the
wordes of the church, and muſte bee ioyned to
the latter end of the other verſe, wherein ſhee
promiſeth that ſhee will remaine to him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and euer. For though the worde <hi>vntill,</hi> doe

here it is vſed for a perpetuitie and euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of time, as it is alſo in other places: as 2.

Which may alſo appeare in that ſhe ſaith ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly,

that ſame great and laſt day of iudgement,
which is vſually pointed out, by that maner of

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20644:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>

of this life, and al vanityes whatſoeuer, that are

in this world: or els we may vnderſtand by <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,</hi>
all thoſe thinges that may ſhadow out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, the hope of eternall life and glorye: which
may be called ſhadowes, not that they are ſo of
them ſelues, but beeing compared with others,
that do lead vs vnto thoſe, and when ſhee ſayth,
<hi>ſhall flye away,</hi> he noteth the ſuddaine vaniſhing
of the ſame. <hi>Returne.</hi> The church ſpeaketh this,
as though her Spouſe were departed, and as
though ſhee coulde not indure and abide his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
though it were neuer ſo ſmall awhile. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like
(O my beloued) to a roe, or to a hindes calfe,</hi> that
is, make moſt haſte and ſpeede to come vnto me,
as before in this chapter verſe 9. And depart not
any whit at al from me, <hi>running on mountains, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one of them are ſundred from an other.</hi> He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
no doubt the mountaines of <hi>Gilead,</hi> which
the riuer of Iorden did ſeperate from the reſt of
Iudea. See 2. Sam. 2. 29. Now, he rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth
theſe mountaines then others of the
country of Iudea, becauſe they were notable &amp;
commodious for hunting, and well ſtored with
game, and therfore much haunted. For at what

out the great deſire that ſhee hath to take
holde of Chriſte, and to poſſeſſe him, which
appeareth in this, that by daye &amp; by night,
at home and abroad, in the countrey and in
the citie, ſhe is wonderfully inflamed with
his loue, and this reacheth from verſe 1. to
the end of the 5.</p>
               <p>2 In the other ſhe doth as it were correct her
ſelfe, deſiring rather that hee ſhoulde take
hold of her, and that ſhe might abyde with
him, than he with her, where vpon ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
into a commendation of his glorye,
ſweetnes, &amp;c. not onely comparing it with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20644:36"/>
Solomons, but preferring it before it, and
that by manye degrees, and this reacheth
from verſe 6. vnto the end of the chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 1. <hi>In my bedde</hi>
                  </hi>) Theſe are the churches
words, teſtifiyng her hunger and thirſt after her
ſpouſe, that in theſe places, and at theſe times,
wherein menne giue them ſelues to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and reſt, her ſoule was toſſed and troubled
with ſeeking, yea and longing after him, whom
his ſoule loued. And it woulde be marked, that
ſhe ſayth not onely one night, but ſundry nights:
teſtifiyng her continuance and earnellneſſe, in
this holy hunger, and moſt aſſured loue: to which
alſo appertayneth the dubbling of the word <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him,</hi> expreſſing thereby her earneſte affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Theſe wordes, <hi>whom my ſoule loueth,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
before, chapter 1. 7. In ſum, the church
vſing this <hi>Periphraſis</hi> inſtead of a proper name,
doth nothing els but expreſſe the force of his
loue, and the earneſtnes thereof. Now where
ſhe addeth, <hi>when I had found him,</hi> that is, when I
did not ſufficiently perceiue him, to bee preſent
with me according to my hartes deſire (for els
Chriſt is neuer abſent from his church, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
preſent therewith, as appeareth Math.
28. 20.) True it is that in our vnderſtanding, &amp;
to the iudgement of the Church, Chriſt ſeemeth
either to be altogeather abſent, or els not verye
nigh: but howſoeuer it be, this is the truth, that
<hi>He that keepeth Iſraell, will neither ſlumber

Solomon prepared for him ſelfe.</hi>
                  </hi> Euery word heere
tendeth to the magnifiying of the mariage bed of
Chriſte and his Church. As firſt in that it was
better then a kings bed, who for his ſtate and
riches was commendable thorough the worlde
and wonderfull. 1. King. 10. 27. Thirdly, in that
it was better then that, which hee had prepared
for himſelfe. We know what good thinges men
make for themſelues, ſpecially when they haue
wherewithall to do the ſame. Yea, the very word
which is here rendred <hi>Bed</hi> tendeth to the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
hereof, becauſe it ſignifieth a fruitfull and
flouriſhing bed, of which ſee before chap. 1. 16.
Yea and the wordes following make alſo to
that purpoſe. When ſhe addeth, <hi>of the trees of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi>
which was a place farre from Ieruſalem,
the wood alſo whereof was very excellent and
good, as which for the worthineſſe of it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to the beſt thing, namely the building of
the Temple, as appeareth 1. King. 5. 6. So that
it was commendable, becauſe it was charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as being farre fet, and alſo becauſe it was
a notable and famous kinde of wood.</p>

                  <hi>Verſe. 10. <hi>Whoſe pillers are made of ſyluer.</hi>
                  </hi> As
ſhe had before ſpoken generally of it: ſo now ſhe
commeth to diſcribe it by peece meale as it
were, affirming that the pillers were of ſiluer.
We knowe that ſtanding beddes haue pillers
and poſtes to vphold the Teſters: now whereas
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20644:41"/>
other mens were made of wood, his pillers were
of ſiluer, which ſhould not ſeeme ſtrang vnto vs,
ſeeing the holye Ghoſte ſayth, he gaue ſiluer in
Ieruſalem, as plentifull as ſtones. 1. King. 10.
27. <hi>And that that was layd vpon it of gold,</hi> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by that which was layde vpon it, the bed it
ſelfe, as we ſay, vnderſtanding alſo by <hi>golde,</hi> that
it was moſte precious, becauſe nothing we haue
is commonly more deare then golde. <hi>Whoſe coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

they do any thing to grieue or diſpleaſe the
Lorde Chriſte, and to cauſe him to depart for a
time, either from the whole church, or the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
members thereof: for beſides that it is a
grieuous tranſgreſſion to contemne him, and ſo
great graces as he bringeth with him: it carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

and ſhould be, alwayes willing and contented,
to depart from all thinges for the gayning of
Chriſt. For if they make more account of the

he him ſelfe plainely telleth vs. Math. 10. 37.
Reuel. 14. 26. Secondlye, that howſoeuer the
thinges that God gyueth vs in this life, are of

they hinder vs from approching to our ſauiour,
and that therefore we ſhould ſo vſe the world, as
though we vſed it not. 1. Cor. 7. 31. and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and that we ſhoulde not be deceiued with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20644:43"/>
a vaine ſhew of thinges, appearing to bee that
which they are not. See Phillip. 4. 8. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that ſtrength of bodye and courage of hart,
is a thing not to be diſpiſed, but greatly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
rather, as a notable meane, that the Lorde
hath beſtowed vppon men, both for the iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

Prouided alwayes that they doe not as Lamech

hath therefore ordayned them, and their eſtate
(wherevnto likewiſe the Lorde hath aduaunced

preferment commeth not from the Eaſt, nor
from the Weſt, but that it is the Lord that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
ſome low, and aduanceth otherſome whom
he will: the Lorde by that preferment ſheweth,
that it is his purpoſe, that mightye men ſhoulde
haue the moſte large and liberall allowaunce of
all his creatures, becauſe he hath as it were put
them in poſſeſſion of the ſame, and indued them

vnder which and from amongſt which, as it were

<hi>They brought foorth twinnes.</hi> But vnder
ſuch aboundant ſpeeches, the holye Ghoſte min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to note, the moſte aſſured certaintye of the

Rom. 9. 1. Now in all this reſembling of the
teeth of the church, to ſheepe of equall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

ſee that there is a threefolde commendation of
the teeth, namely a iuſt proportion of them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
them ſelues, as amongeſt ſheepe, and
goates, of one breed or ſtature: cleanneſſe and
whitenes of them, as there is in the flockes that
are waſhed, and a meruailous fruitfull increaſe,
as there is of thoſe, that bring foorth twinnes.
And when he ſayth, that <hi>There is none barren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
them,</hi> he meaneth as a man would ſaye,
that there is no tooth wanting in their order and
place, but euen as ſheepe yeelding twinnes haue
alwayes their young by them, one aunſwering
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20644:48"/>
another: ſo hath the Church her teeth. And no
doubt but by <hi>teeth</hi> heere, the holy ghoſt meaneth
the ſame that before he did by eyes, vz, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and preachers of the worde, who muſt
as it were champe and chawe the ſame with
their teeth, that the people may the more eaſily
eate it: and all theſe are equall, not onely in that
they are or ſhoulde be all of one minde, all alſo
preaching and profeſſing one doctrine, but euery
man gouerning by one rule, that part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lords
flocke, that is committed vnto him: and they are
all waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt, and all made
fruitfull thorow the Lords bleſſing, by gaining
a multitude of ſoules vnto God, thorow the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes
of preaching, as the world accounteth it.
If any man thinke it is not wel to reſemble one
matter to diuerſe things, let them take heed how
they ſaucely controull the Lord, who to the end
that we might the better conceiue of the things
themſelues, and he the more effectually expreſſe
the excellency of them, hath vſed it often both in
the old and new teſtament. See Iſaiah. 10. 15.

commendation of the lippes. Where alſo wee

meaneth thereby, that it was fayre and comelye,

ſith it pleaſeth the holy Ghoſte to ſtrammer as it

hereby, the Preachers and Miniſters of

take it, that ſpeaking of ſpirituall thinges after
the maner of men, and particularly of louer, he
doth deale therein according to their maners.

See Prouerb. 5. 19. Whatſoeuer it be,
this me thinketh ſhould be plaine and certaine,
that all that hitherto hath beene ſpoken of the
comelines &amp; beauty of the church, doth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
ſhew her to bee moſte abſolute and perfect,
which alſo may appeare by verſe 7. following:
neither need we to doubt, but that the ſame alſo
may be vnderſtood ſpecially by the waye of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
euen of all the members of the ſame, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from the head, if you will, vnto the ſoales of

and euery one of them, haue their ſeuerall func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſo may theſe thinges that be ſpoken of the
ſeuerall members, be applyed to euery one ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:
but howſoeuer in ſome we haue dealt ſo,
becauſe we haue the warrant of the worde, and
the proportion of faith, as a ground for the ſame,
yet to ſtand vpon them all, ſpecially where ſuch

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church promiſeth to remayn w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt
for euer, &amp; here Chriſt promiſeth to abide with
it continually. As Math. 28. 19. Otherwiſe the
ſenſe and meaning is al one. And in this and the
two verſes following, ther is contained Chriſts
anſwere and promiſes, vnto the petitions that
the church made before, chap. 3. where ſhee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
and ſeeketh for his preſence, &amp; other good
graces in him, Chriſte promiſing as before is
ſayd, his preſence vnto the Church, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
members therof, ſo long as in this world
they wander as pilgrims from the Lord. 2. Cor.
3. 6. and afterwards verſ. 8. 9. of this chapter.
He promiſeth that the weariſome dayes of this
pilgrimage being finiſhed, hee will bring the
church, euen into his owne houſe, which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
in the heauens. <hi>I will go into the mountaine
of myrrh, and into the hill of incenſe.</hi> Becauſe the
church had before exhorted him, to go to the plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſant
mountains: chap. 17. he ſayth here that hee
will perfourme the ſame: It is vncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were mountaines of myrrh, and hils
of incenſe in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> country yea or no. But whether
there were yea or no, the meaning is ſpirituall,
namely that as in reſpect of the church militant
he would get him to the moſt pleaſaunt places,
euen to the mountayn of <hi>Moriah,</hi> vpon which it
is certain the temple was builded, as appeareth
2. chro. 3. 1. which mighte rightly bee called the
mountaine of myrrh, and the hill of incenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20644:51"/>
of the great ſtore, that there was offered
vp and burnt to the Lorde. Whereof alſo this
may ſeeme ſome reaſon, that the word here vſed
for <hi>Incenſe,</hi> differeth not much from the name,
wherewith that mountayne is called: ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the church triumphant, he wold get him
to the heauenly Ieruſalem, which is in heauen,
where alſo ſundrye of his freendes are preſent
with him, and whoſe duties perfourmed vnto
him, are moſte ſweete and pleaſant for this and
other things, ſee Reuel. 21. 20.</p>

Chriſte. Iſaiah. 1. 19. 20. As in reſpect alſo of
that ſolemne and bleſſed daie, that the Lorde
hathe appoynted for oure eternall marryage.
<hi>Thou ſhalt come.</hi> It is a promiſe as I ſayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
euen of eternall life. <hi>With me,</hi> to wit,
my ſelfe. Chriſt meaneth by this, not onely his
continuall preſence with the Churche, both in
this life and in the life to come: but alſo that he
will ſo wholly and thoroughly gather it, that
none of thoſe that come vnto him, ſhal eyther be
taken out of his handes, or periſh. &amp;c. See Iohn
17. 12, &amp; other places. <hi>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lebanon.</hi> He meaneth
hereby a moſt pleaſant and fruitful place, where
there were many ſweete, tall, and excellent
trees, meaning hereby that none of thoſe things
ſhold let the church from being coupled with hir
huſband Chriſte. Of this place wee haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of before: It was a mountain vpon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Lande of promiſe, or Iudea. <hi>Thou
ſhalt come with me from Lebanon.</hi> It is doubled,
both for the more vehemency of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſpeaketh
as alſo for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more certaintye of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced:
<hi>q. d.</hi> Nothing ſhall ſtay thee, but thou
ſhalt indeede come with me, and enioy my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
preſence. <hi>Thou ſhalt looke from the toppe of
Amanah.</hi> Some thinke it to be a mountayne in
that part of Cilicia, that bordereth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the land
of Iſrael. Some of the Rabbins hold it to bee a
mountaine, in the borders of Iury, lying on the
north ſide thereof. I ſhame not to ſay, that for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20644:52"/>
the particuler I knowe not what to affirme,
howbeit this is the meaning, that from all the
quarrers of the worlde, they ſhall beholde the
eternall kingdom of God. <hi>From the top of Shenir
and Hermon.</hi> The holy ghoſt Deut. 3. 9. ſeemeth
to meane by both theſe names one mountain.
Wherefore it maye bee thought ſtraunge, that
Solomon in this place, maketh them diuers.
For the clearing whereof this would bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that at the firſt one and the ſelf ſame thing,
might be called by many names, as in reſpect of
diuers people, dwelling nigh vnto the ſame, and
the ſeuerall proprieties of their tongues, which
ſeemeth indeede to be the moſte naturall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Deut. 3. 9. and yet notwithſtanding in
proceſſe of time, and multitudes of people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing,
ſome of thoſe names applyed to the
whole, might be attributed to ſome part of it.
And this we ſee both by ſcripture, examples,
and otherwiſe. In old time the riuer <hi>Danubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was indifferently named <hi>Danubius</hi> or <hi>Iſter,</hi>
whereas at this day, it is onely called <hi>Iſter</hi> at
that place, at which it entereth into the Ocean.
So likewiſe theſe wordes <hi>Horeb, Synai, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
are moſt commonly in the ſcriptures taken
for one and the ſelfe ſame mount, whereas wee
knowe that theſe words are ſo vſed, eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the mount <hi>Synai</hi> was very large, and ſo
according to the diuers partes thereof, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
names: or elſe they were mountaynes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20644:53"/>
one nigh to an other. The like maye we ſaye of
Hermon, that part that lay towardes <hi>Sydon,</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called <hi>Shirron,</hi> as Moſes ſayth, and that part
that the Amorites had gotten, being called <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nir:</hi>
and that howſoeuer they ſeemed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in the dayes of Moſes, yet afterwardes
they were diſtinguiſhed one from an other, as
appeareth not onelye by this place, but alſo 1.
Chro. 5. 23. <hi>From the dens of the lions, and from the
mountaynes of the Leopardes.</hi> Theſe places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
as moſte commonlye mountaines and ſuch
ſolitarye places, abounded with wilde, noyſome,
and hurtfull beaſtes, by which Chriſt noteth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that he woulde ſet his church free from daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
This then is the meaning, that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
to bring the church out of Lebanon, and
to effect this much for her, that from the top of
moſt high mountaines, ſhee ſhall beholde, to her
moſt ioyful contentment, who be malicious, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
and fierce, ſubiected vnto her. And heere we
muſt know, that in all this, he alludeth to thoſe
places of the lande of promiſe, by which the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
firſte entred into the ſame, and from
whence they might beholde that goodly cuntry.
<hi>Shenir</hi> and <hi>Hermon,</hi> were very high mountaines,
on the farther ſide of Iorden, from whence they
might behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land of promiſe. <hi>Lebanon</hi> as alſo
<hi>Amanah,</hi> as it ſhould ſeem, was on this ſide Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but yet in the borders of the land of Canaan
towardes the north. Now we muſt vnderſtand,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20644:53"/>
that many tymes in the ſcriptures, vnder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblaunce
of theſe thinges, that were done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
the old people, there are ſet out vnto vs
ſuch thinges, as Chriſt ſhould doe for his, vnder
the new Teſtament. For as much therefore, as
in all this ſong, Lebanon is taken for a pleaſant
and plentifull place, as alſo in many other ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
beſide, for which ſee Deut. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 25. and on
the other ſide the Amorites and other enemies
dwelt in Hermon, and Shenir: the holy Ghoſte
vnder theſe ſhadowes meaneth, that as from Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus
and other mountaynes ſcituated on the
borders of the land of promiſe, they did beholde
the whole country, and at the laſt, come into the
land of promiſe: ſo when they come vnto Chriſt,
they ſhould haue a gappe layde open vnto many
miſteries, and by Chriſte at the laſt bee brought
vnto the knowledge of God, and life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
from the attaynment whereof neither the
pleaſures of Lebano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dens of Lions &amp; wild
beaſtes, ſhould hinder them, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the midſt of
perſecutions &amp; tyrannus oppreſſions, they ſhold
haue free acceſſe and enteraunce thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 9. <hi>Thou haſt wounded my hart,</hi>
                  </hi>) or as the
word alſo may import, <hi>Thou haſt caught my hart,
or taken it from me,</hi> meaning by both theſe termes
of loue, one thing, to wit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt was euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
rauiſhed as it were, with the loue of the
church: and ſo he beginneth now to come again
to the praiſes of the church, ſpeaking notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20644:54"/>
as it were a man, burning with moſte
earneſt loue, for all theſe thinges are ſet downe,
to expreſſe Chriſtes ſingular loue to the church,
which when he hath declared with a maruailous
earneſt affection, &amp; ſet out with graue &amp; waighty
exclamations in this &amp; the next verſe following,
he proceedeth to praiſethe church, for the graces
before rehearſed. <hi>My ſiſter my ſpouſe.</hi> Chriſt gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the church both theſe names, his <hi>ſiſter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe is the daughter of the heauenly father,
and as fellow heyre of eternal glory with chriſt:
and his <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> becauſe he hath betrothed her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him ſelfe in mercye, truth and righteouſneſſe.
Hoſea. 2. and accounteth of her as a moſt deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloued wife. <hi>thou haſt wounded my hart.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth
the former wordes, the more ſtill to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the earneſtneſſe of his loue. <hi>With one of
thine eyes, <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> I need not to beholde both, thy
beauty is ſo great in one, that I am euen taken
therewith. Thus he ſpeaketh of ſpirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as earthly louers do, of the outwarde partes
of thoſe, whome they affect: meaning no doubt
by this, not onelye the excellent wiſedome, and
foreſight of the church, but alſo the beauty ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for euen in the eye there is beauty. <hi>And with
one chaine of thy necke: <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> not all thine orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but euen one of them alone, hath drawne
me to loue and like thee: by which we maye ſee,
what account the Lorde hath euen of the beſt of
the graces, that he hath beſtowed on the church,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20644:54"/>
and here ſtill he ſpeaketh, as though the church
had beene decked after the maner of coſtly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
with chaines, iewels, and ſuch like orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the beautifiyng of her.</p>

                  </hi> that is, how
glorious and excellent, yea and full of delight,
are thoſe ſound affections of a good minde, that
thou carryeſt towardes me, by which I am alſo
moued, euen to loue thee againe: and hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of them in the plurall number, not onelye
thereby to expreſſe the multitude of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the
excellency alſo. <hi>My ſister my ſpouſe.</hi> Theſe words
are interpreted before verſe 9. of this chapter.
<hi>How good are thy loues before wine,</hi> that is, they
are better and more delightfull by much, then
very good wine. See chapter 1. 2. where the
church ſpeaketh the ſame wordes of Chriſt, that
Chriſt ſpeaketh here of her, rendring as it were
like for like, which is an vſuall maner among
louers, and particularly in their words and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
one of them to an other. <hi>And the ſauour of
thine oyntments,</hi> that is, the ſweete and pleaſaunt
ſmell of ſuch graces as thou haſt receiued. For
it is vſuall in the ſcriptures, by oyle, oyntment,
annoynting, &amp;c. to vnderſtand, the graces of God
beſtowed vpon his children. See Pſalm. 89. 20.
Alſo 45. 7. 1. Iohn. 2. 20. 27. And yet no doubt

                  </hi> The wordes of the
Church, intreating graces of her head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
Chriſt, to make her fruitfull withall. It is
a notable turning of her ſpeech, to the windes
and quarters of the world, attributing ſence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thinges without life: which alſo is common
to Poets and louers, ſpeciallye in their loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonges.
He meaneth firſt the north quarter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is cold and moyſt, as beeing farre remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

is hot and drye, hee ioyneth them togeather, that
ſo there beeing a good mixture made of them
both, extreemity of cold, or continuance of heat,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20644:57"/>
might not worke barrenneſſe. And no doubt but
vnder theſe quarters, and a good and equal mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of them both, ſhe meaneth Chriſt and all the
members he hath, and vſeth to make his church
fruitfull, who graunteth the vſe of ſuch ſundrye
ſortes of ayre, to make his garden fruitfull, and
withall manye times by the contrarye courſe of
the windes, purgeth the ayre, and giueth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

as it were by blaſtes or blowing from ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
quarters, worke that which thou ſeeſt to bee
good and profitable for me, For it is a requeſt
hauing a regard to the former compariſon of the
windes and Chriſt togeather. It is ſomewhat
darke, in that the church calleth the church her
<hi>garden:</hi> but ſhee doth it not as hauing any thing
of her ſelfe. For whatſoeuer ornaments, flowers,
plants, &amp;c. ſhe hath, ſhee hath it from Chriſte: but
by reaſon of the nigh coniunction which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Chriſt and his church, ſhee beeing fleſh of
his fleſh, and bone of his bones. Epheſ. 5. 30. yea

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20644:58"/>
ſeuerall ſortes hee meaneth ſtill, the ſweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt,
and profitable fruites that the church did
yeelde vnto him, declaring heereby, that he did
moſte fauourablye accept the woorkes of his
church: and that hee was much more delighted
therewith, than any man is or can be in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
moſt ſweete ſmelling herbes and ſpices, or
in eating hony, yea though he eat it ſo greedely,
that he do with all deuour the combe: or in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the beſte wine and pureſt milke, by which
no doubt he meaneth, the worde of God, and the
doctrine of the church, (as we haue heretofore
noted the ſame) becauſe that as wine, ſo it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the hart merry, and as ſincere milke, it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth,
yea and ſtrengtheneth the infirme or

comb. <hi>Drincke,</hi> vz. of my milke and wine. <hi>And be
filled therewith O welbeloued,</hi> that is, drincke plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
of the ſame, by which we ſee, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
the fellowſhip and coniunction, that is
betweene him and the church, vnto a banquet or
feaſt: <hi>q. d.</hi> take the ſame fruite that I haue of
the church, and be delighted therin and ſatiſfied
therwith, as it were with moſt ſumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
or daintie diſhes. So plentifull and kind
harted is the lord, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he can not keep his ioy with
in himſelfe, but ſtirreth vp his friends &amp; compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
to eat and drincke, and reioyce with him,
meaning thereby ſpeciallye the miniſters of his
word, becauſe God vſeth them as his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20644:59"/>
in the aduauncement of the worke of mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and generally all the faithfull, who ſhall
be fellow heyres with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. Teacheth vs, that as the beauty of the
church generallye, ſhoulde cauſe vs to loue and
like the ſame: ſo particularly the faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
performing their dutie, and the holy mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Gods people, they ſhould make vs moſt
to affect and commend the ſame. For if Chriſt
the head and ſouſe thereof, bee carried away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the loue and liking, yea and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
thereof alſo; with the beholding of
thoſe graces, who yet notwithſtanding as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of him ſelfe, needeth not them or to regard
them: how much more ſhould we do it, who need
not onely theſe things for our owne ſtay, but by
commending the church, or imbracing it doe
greatly prouide for our owne good thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. Teacheth, what a iuſt compoſition and
order there ought to be obſerued in the church,
and the holye gouernement thereof, and that to
theſe two endes eſpecially, namely that Chriſte
might take a ſingular delight and pleaſure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
all thinges beeing there perfourmed decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; in order, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall rule of the
Apoſtle. 1. Cor. 14. 40. and that his people by
the ſame, might be builded vp in all holines and
righteouſneſſe euerye day more then other: and
in all reuerend regarde of that holy fellowſhip,
that maintayneth ſo right and good a courſe of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20644:59"/>
holy gouernment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. Teacheth vs, that there is nothing in
the church, that may or ought, to make vs more
in loue with the ſame, than the holy exerciſes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
there, and particularly the exerciſes of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and prayer. For as by the one God beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs againe to him ſelfe, thorow the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
ſeed of the word. 1. Pet. 1. 23. which is his
effectuall inſtrument, to ſaue all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
Rom. 1. 16: ſo by the other rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
he prouideth for his own glory, while he is
called vpon in faith. Rom. 10. 14. And for our
good, giuing vs the meanes and grace to vſe the
ſame, whereby we are to lay our needes before
him, and to obtayne ſuch things as we ſhal aſke,
according to his will, in the name of his ſonne
Chriſt. Iohn. 16. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 4. Doth notably paint out vnto vs, the
great glorye and wonderfull ſtrength of the
church of God: which we are to ſet, as on the one
ſide againſt all weaknes of our owne, ſo againſt
all malice and power of the wicked, our ſauiour
telling vs, that <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
againſt it.</hi> Math. 16. 18. And the Apoſtle
naming it the piller and ground of the truth. 1.
Timot. 3. 15. what meane weake ones then, for
feare or ſauour, in the dayes of perſecution to
fall away from it? Or the wicked in ſuch rage
&amp; fury to ſet them ſelues againſte it, ſeeing that
al their labor is loſt, that they ſpend there about?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:20644:60"/>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. Teacheth vs, that euen euerye thing in
the church, maye kindle in vs an vnfayned affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to loue and like the ſame. So that he that is
not, or can not be mooued therewith, is altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
benummed and ſenceles: for if outwarde
comelines, do worke delight in outward things:
how much more ſhould inward beauty, draw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to ſpiritual &amp; diuine graces. True it is,
that we walke heere by faith, &amp; not by ſight, and
therefore we muſt haue other eyes, than the eies
of our bodie, to beholde theſe ſpirituall matters
withall, or elſe wee ſhall neuer thryue thereby,
which alſo we may ſee by daily experience. For
what is the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſo few regard the church,
and the graces of God giuen to the ſame, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they meaſure it according to the rule or
yarde of their owne vnderſtanding?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. Teacheth vs two thinges: firſt that
Chriſt the head of the church, graciouſly graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the petitions of the church made vnto him,
and yeeldeth to her ſuit: which as it excellently
expreſſeth his wonderfull mercy, and great libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
towardes his owne people: ſo is it, yea and
it ought to be a notable incouragement vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
by prayer to repayre to him, that is continually
and at all times more readye to giue, than they
are at anye time prepared or diſpoſed to aſke.
Secondlye, that the continuall and perpetuall
preſence of the Lord with his church, hath been,
is and euer wil be vnto his people, both general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
and particularlye, a notable argument of no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20644:60"/>
ſmall comfort and incouragement to them. See
for this purpoſe. Exo. 3. 12. Act. 18. 10. For if
Gods people ſhould regard, either the malice of
the wicked on the one ſide: or their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
on the other ſide, they might eaſely be caſt
downe; but when they conſider, that hee that is
with them is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then al, they take courage
and bee, as it were men reſtored from death to
life, and in him become more then conquerours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Containing an excellent commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holines of the church, teacheth vs to
be rauiſhed as it were, with the holy loue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
for Chriſt doth not ſo highly extoll the ſame
for his owne cauſe onely, but to teach vs both by
his wordes of prayſe, and example of practiſe, to
do the like. Secondly, the whole church, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular member thereof, learneth thereby,
what ſtrife there ſhould be in them, to attaine to
an excellent meaſure of holines and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that might be acceptable to the Lorde, who
delighteth in the ſame: profitable to our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who therby may be drawn to performe the like:
&amp; comfortable to our ſoules whil we ſee, that by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful fruits of a ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mind, God hath diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vs, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prophane &amp; wicked of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 8. Teacheth vs, that howſoeuer wee
maye haue great ioye, and contentment in that
part of the Church, that warre-fareth heere
vpon earth, and in the great and ſingular beauty
of the ſame, by reaſon of the graces that God
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20644:61"/>
graunteth thereto, as his worde, the prayers of
his people, and manye ſuch like: yet that we
ſhould not alwayes ſtay our ſelues heere below,
but by fayth and patience, bee lifted vp and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
euen to the full fruition and poſſeſſion of
all heauenly ioyes, ſpecially ſith that Chriſte as
you ſee, draweth his church in this place, to the
vnfayned beholding thereof, which thing, if it be
rightly planted in our hartes, let vs aſſure our
ſelues of this, that no lawfull either pleaſures
or profites of this lyfe, nor no tyrannus perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the enemies, ſhall drawe vs awaye, from
the obedience of our God: for why, the loue of
heauen ſhall haue ſuch hold in our hartes, that it
will make vs in regarde thereof, to account all
thinges but loſſe and donge, ſo we maye gaine
Chriſt, and the fruition of his preſence. 1. Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.
3. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 9. Propoundeth vnto vs Chriſtes loue
towardes the church, to the ende that all men
might by his example, be taught to doe the like,
that is, in an vnfayned affection to loue and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the ſame. Secondly, that the graces of the
church, how great or ſmall ſoeuer they bee, are
accepted of Chriſte, euen as ſufficient to drawe
his loue towardes the ſame: for if Chriſt loued
vs, when we were his enemies, how much more
ſhall he loue the church, that is adorned not with
graces of her owne, but with gyftes of goodnes
from him, which ſeeing they are his owne, hee
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20644:61"/>
will not refuſe, though the glory of them may be
ſomewhat darkened, thorow our corruptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. Teacheth vs, not ſlenderly, but in a
moſt large meaſure, to loue the Lorde Chriſte,
that loueth his ſo bountifullye and ſo tenderlye,
forgyuing vs ſo great a debt, and infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of tranſgreſſions, that ſo hee might make
our loue more plentifull, faſt and ſure vnto him.
See Luk. 7. 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 11. Teacheth vs to eſteeme aboue all
thinges in the church, that treaſure of the word,
that God hath committed to it: and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
becauſe the worde it ſelfe is as it were the
life and ſoule of the church, from which if the

the Lorde taketh in the ſeuerall fruites of

and aboundaunt in all good workes, and in
the ſeuerall ſortes and varietie of the ſame, and

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. Teacheth vs: firſte that the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that Chriſt giueth vnto the church, ſhold not
make the church, either careleſſe of good works,
or proud in the ſame; not careleſſe, becauſe they
haue not as yet attayned vnto perfection: nor
proude, becauſe they haue nothing but that
which they haue receiued from him, but rather
to regard Chriſts purpoſe in prayſing, y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> church
which is to prouoke her thereby, ſpecially ſith
he taketh delight in her goodneſſe, more and

church ſo good, but it may be ſtill bettered, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20644:62"/>
though they haue proceeded well, yet the Lorde
hath ſomewhat to ſay againſt them, as Reuel. 2.
4. 14. &amp;c. Secondly, that the fulneſſe of all good
thinges are in Chriſt, and none other, and that
therefore they doe the church great iniury, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that they deface Chriſt him ſelfe,) that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
woulde vtterly ſpoyle the church of him, or

that the church ſhould neuer ceaſe prayſing and

dwelleth the fulnes of all heauenlye graces, yea
the very Godhead it ſelfe bodily. Colloſ. 2. 9.</p>

waſhed their feete, are vnwilling to foul them, &amp;
many times alledge theſe thinges for excuſes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ſo they may y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more ſafely neglect their duties:
euen ſo doth the church here. Thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
by <hi>putting of her garments,</hi> the renouncing of the
old man, &amp; by <hi>waſhing of her feet,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
her affections, are greatly deceiued: for the more
ſhe had either of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one or of the other, the nearer
ſhe was to Chriſte, and the more ſoon ſhe might
haue entertained him: but the true and naturall
ſenſe is as before. In ſum, ſhe meaneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
to &amp; fro in her hart, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her faith did gretly
wauer, ye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her own weaknes did ſo far preuail

bowels were mooued touching him,</hi> vz, after that he
was gone, meaning that then ſhe begun to bee
moued in her minde, and troubled in her ſelfe,
and after a ſorte to repent her of it, but then it
was too late. All which tendeth ſtill to amplify
her tranſgreſſion, in that ſhe had no better grace
to regard and receiue the acceptable time of her
viſitation. See Luke. 19. 42.</p>

The church ſpeaketh this, as though ſhe
ſuppoſed that Chriſt had not yet bene gone, for
all the iuſt occaſions that ſhee had giuen him of
departure from her, but it was all to late. <hi>And
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20644:67"/>
my handes,</hi> vz, laying holde of the places of the

left ſuch a plentifull and pleaſant ſmell behinde
him, that euen ſhee comming after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had ſuch aboundaunce of it, as if ſhee had
had ſuch ſtoore of myrrh, as woulde haue made

her drowſineſſe, leaue before the dores ſuch
ſweet ſmelling ſteps and pathes of his comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
comming, as were fit, to furniſh her with

ſtirre vp the church, beeing drowſie and dull, as

ſauour of his goſpell, that I my ſelfe but onelye
touching the ſame, was euen therewith perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and made ſweete, yea called backe and put
in minde, to thincke vpon the vnworthye fact
committed. <hi>And my fingers,</hi> vz. dropped downe
myrrh, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paſſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the handles of the lock, that
is, thin &amp; pure myrrh, which the ſpouſe had left

to commend the excellency of the graces, as he
had done before the aboundaunce of them.</p>

                  <hi>Verſ. 5. <hi>I opened, vz. my dores to my welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,</hi>

vz, ſuppoſing that he had tarryed there ſtil:
<hi>but my welbeloued withdrawing him ſelfe,</hi> ſecreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; quietly, particularly alſo putting vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great
iniury of refuſall, that I had offered him, <hi>paſſed
by,</hi> vz, my dores and ſo went his waye. <hi>My ſoule
departed,</hi> vz, out of my body as it were, meaning
that ſhe was in a ſowne as it were, or halfe dead
for the time, <hi>while he was in ſpeaking,</hi> or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his ſpeech to me, which I had neglected:
for howſoeuer the Hebrue wil beare both, yet I
think this latter moſt agreeable with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, which as we haue heard before, is to
aggrauate her offence, &amp; in this place to ſhew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the miſeries that ſhe fell into, for ſo great neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.
<hi>I ſought him,</hi> vz, after his departure from me,
<hi>but I could not find him,</hi> vz, for all that trauail and
toile that I could take: ſo it pleaſeth God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
not onely the wicked, in the contempt of his
graces offered,<note place="margin">ſee Amos. 8. 22.</note> but euen his owne people, in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the ſame. <hi>I called him, but he aunſwered me
not.</hi> She meaneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame thing that before,
namely, that ſith ſhe neglected his call, he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not hers. And in this verſe the church begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nneth
to declare, the miſeries and calamities that
fel vppon her,<note place="margin">See Pro. 1. 38.</note> for her negligence and idlenes or
ſloth. And in this ver. ſhe reckoneth vp two chief
ones. The firſt is, that Chriſt her head &amp; ſpouſe,
did for a time withdraw himſelf from her: not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Chriſt is at any time abſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his church, (for
Chriſt is no partaker with nonreſidents) but that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20644:68"/>
then he ſeemeth to be ſo, when he doth withdraw
the former teſtimonies of his free &amp; ful fauor for
a time: which he doth not, as thogh he loued not
his church ſtill, but either therby to try the faith
&amp; patience of his people, or to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently
to regard his excellent mercies beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon them. The ſecond miſery is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the church
it ſelf is in great danger euen of death, becauſe
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thorow her default, ſhee had after a ſort prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpouſe to depart, which iudgement alſo ſhe
had iuſtly pulled vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her for ſo great wickednes.
<hi>Verſ. 6. <hi>The watchmen that go about the city found
me.</hi>
                  </hi> It is to be noted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe ſaith not ſimply, <hi>watch
men,</hi> but with an addition, <hi>that goe about the city,</hi>
wherby ſhe noteth, as vnder the word <hi>watchmen,</hi>
their painfulnes, ſo vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word <hi>going about,</hi> ther
diligence. ſee 1. Pet. 5. 8. This alſo is expounded
before chap. 3. 3. where y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſelfe ſame thing is put
down, ſauing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of their
abuſing of her, but only of her demand, who ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
could tel where he was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her ſoul loued. <hi>They
ſmote me, they wounded me.</hi> In that ſhe ſpeaketh ſo
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a particle to ioin the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which maner of ſpech
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Rhetoritians cal <hi>Aſyndeton</hi>) ſhe doth it both to
ſhew her own vehemency, &amp; the quick diſpatch, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the enemies made in ſo ill intreating of her: &amp; in
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe addeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word <hi>wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding</hi> after <hi>ſmiting,</hi> ſhe doth
as it were by a gradatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, paint out their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and her miſery, becauſe many maye faint
and be ſmiten, and yet not wound or bee woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<hi>The watchmen of the wals.</hi> She meaneth thoſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20644:69"/>
that had a continuall ſtanding allowed them,
both to deſcrye the enemies, and to repell them
alſo if they can: <hi>q. d.</hi> neither the running watch,
nor the ſtanding watch fauoured mee, but both
ſortes cruelly intreated me. Now what it was
that theſe men perfourmed againſt her, is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the wordes following. <hi>Tooke my vaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from me.</hi> She ſayth not tooke it awaye from
her, but as it were for the time pulled it off her:
which they did not onely the better to ſee her, or
with an vngodly eye to behold her, for which ſee
the ſtorye of Suſanna verſ. 32. but also to bring
her thereby the more to the diſobedience of her
huſband: for vailes, as it doth appeare by many
places of ſcripture, were giuen vnto marryed
women, both to expreſſe the authoritye that the
huſbandes had ouer them, and alſo to put them
in minde of their obedience and ſubiection. See
Geneſ. 20. 16. Alſo Geneſ. 24. 65. 1. Cor. 11. 5.
6. 10. Such a like phraſe is that that is vſed.
Ruth. 3. 9. of ſpreading the winge of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ouer her. The word that is here turned
<hi>vaile,</hi> is in the Hebrue tongue deriued from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and I ſuppoſe verelye that it was made of
the fineſt and pureſt linnen that coulde be gotte.
What ſhoulde bee meant by it, we are not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to ſeeke. This I ſuppoſe may be ſafelye
ſayd, that the church falling in the abſence of her
ſpouſe, into the handes of corrupt and falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
they labour to depryue her of that ſame
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20644:69"/>
puritie and ſoundnes of doctrine, that hee hath
committed vnto her, as a meane to hold her in
the dutie of all holy obedience and faithfulneſſe
towardes him. And more then this, I ſee not.
If any bee more quicke ſighted, I pray them in
Gods name to reueale it to the benefite of the
Church. In a worde there is in this verſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the third calamity of the Church, vz, that
Chriſt her head, beeing abſent from her, and ſhe
labouring to ſeeke him, ſhee falleth into ſundrie
daungers and diſtreſſes: yea all became noiſome
and hurtfull vnto hir, yea euen thoſe who ſhould
haue kept and preſerued her, from all violence
and iniurye, they did bounſe and beat her, yea
cruelly wound her, and dealt moſte vilanouſlye
with her, as the particulars ſhewe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 7. <hi>I charge you.</hi>
                  </hi> to writte very ſtaightly
as it were by an othe which form alſo the church
vſeth, both to teſtifie her vnfeined loue, towards
her ſpouſe, and to prouoke them, with whome
ſhee dealeth to deale faithfullye in doing her
meſſage: <hi>O daughters of Ieruſalem.</hi> Shee was il
intreated of her enimies, as appeareth verſe. 6.
Therefore now ſhee ſpeaketh vnto her friendes,
looking to finde fauour and curteſie amongeſt
them. See theſe words expounded before. chap.
2. 7. alſo chap. 3. 5. and at this verſe beginneth
the ſeconde part of the chapter, containing as
is ſaid before, a dialogue betweene the Church,
and the damſells or daughters of Ieruſalem in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:20644:70"/>
her freendes. <hi>If ye finde my beloued,</hi> ſhee meaneth
Chriſt whom ſhe loued, as he likewiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> church,
Eph. 5. 25. <hi>That ye tell him.</hi> In hebrue, <hi>what ſhold
ye tell him?</hi> interrogatiuely, which ſhee ſpeaketh
ſhortly, as many times louers doe, and yet the
interrogation conteineth more vehemency in it,
and ſerueth to beautifye the ſpeeche alſo. <hi>q. d.</hi>
Would you know, what you ſhould tell him? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that which followeth. <hi>That I am ſicke of loue,</hi>
She can not conceale the heate and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of her loue, but euen after the manner of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
bewraieth the ſame, who the more they are
abſent one of them from another, the more their
loue increaſeth, and the greatlier doe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be ioyned together. The meaning of the
wordes is, that the church is ſo far of, from kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
cloſe her loue, that ſhee doth not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
it to them, but intreateth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather freely
to open it, and to declare the ſame ſpeciallye to
her beloued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 8. <hi>O thou the faireſt amongſt women.</hi>
                  </hi> This
is the title that the faythfull attribute vnto the
church, in whoſe iudgement indeede ſhee is ſo,
not ſo much for anye beautye in her ſelfe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe is adorned, with the ſinguler gifts and
excellent graces of God. <hi>What hath thy welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
more then another welbeloued?</hi> They double
the Queſtion, for the more vehemency, as alſo
for the ſtrangeneſſe of the matter. <hi>That thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſo charge vs:</hi> vz. ſo hardly and ſtraightly, &amp; euen
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20644:70"/>
as it were, by the vertue of an oth. <hi>q. d.</hi> Some
thing there is, that thou laieſt ſo hard a burden,
and ſtraight a charge vppon vs, or elſe thou
wouldeſt not doe it. And this is the firſt queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
mooued to the church, concerning the perſon of
hir ſpouſe, they maruelling as it were, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing ſhould be in him, that ſhee ſhoulde
ſo highly eſteeme him by occaſion of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
ſhe entreth into a notable deſcription of
Chriſt, in the verſes following, firſt ſetting him
out generally, verſ. 9. and afterward particlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by ſingular recitall of his partes and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
euen ten in number, beginning as you
would ſay, from the higheſt, &amp; ſo comming down
to the nethermoſt: the church perfourming that
here for her head and ſpouſe, both in a general &amp;
particuler commendation of him and his parts,
that he had done before for her chap. 4, 1. 2. 3. &amp;c
Which alſo is vſuall amongeſt earthly louers,
to requite one kindneſſe with another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
no doubt the churche had ſpeciall regarde,
though ſhe could not perfourm any ſufficient du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 9 <hi>My beloued is white.</hi>
                  </hi> Shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to anſwere their demaund vnder many
allegories, commending her ſpouſe: as firſt in
this verſe ſhee dothe prayſe him, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente
hewe and liuelye coloure: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the verſes following, ſhe commendeth
his particular parts. And firſt ſhe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioneth his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20644:71"/>
whiteneſſe or his fayreneſſe, which amongeſt
earthly louers is a thing much ſet by, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt be much more glorious, in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
huſband. And <hi>ruddie,</hi> that is, red and as you
would ſaye, of a ſanguine complexion, and this
colour of <hi>ruddines</hi> is commended in Dauid. 1.
Sam. 16. 12. And note that the holy Ghoſt ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
both theſe togeather, the whiteneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
the ruddyneſſe more freſhe and fayre,
and the ruddineſſe diſcerning the whitnes from
paleneſſe of face, or flegmatick complexion: both
which colours if they concurre in an earthlye
creature, ſpecially ſuch as be yong (for theſe are
colours belonging to them,) make the ſame to
be liked: how much more then ſhoulde they, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
ſpiritually in Chriſt, (in reſpect of whom
all the good thinges of this lyfe, are not ſo much
as a ſhadow) not onelye be excellent in him, but
draw vs on vnfaynedly to loue him alſo. <hi>Euen a
ſtanderd bearer aboue ten thouſaand.</hi> She vſeth a
metaphor taken from the warre, as alſo putteth
a number certayne for an vncertayne, to expreſſe
the commendation of her loue. Commonly ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd
bearers are moſt tall and mighty men, and
amongſt tenne thouſand men, a man maye finde
manye comely countenaunces, but yet ſaith ſhee
for ſound and naturall moyſture, and for a moſt
temperate and fit colour, looke amongſt infinite
numbers of people, you ſhall not find one or any,
any way matchable with my beloued: ſhe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20644:71"/>
alſo by this diſcription of him, that he is of
a moſt ſound and ſure health, as thoſe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
are, that are of ſo good complexions and
conſtitutions: but all this muſte bee vnderſtood
ſpiritually, as before hath been ſayd, and no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
or earthly thought muſt be conceiued here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 10. <hi>His head is excellent gold, yea moſt pure
gold,</hi>
                  </hi> She entreth into the deſcription of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
partes of her ſpouſe, whoſe head was not
of gold, as the wordes may ſeeme to import, but
that in a certaine proportion, ſhee reſembleth it
thereto. Gold for the excellency and purity of it,
is a mettall highly extolled &amp; regarded amongſt
men: ſo the ſpirituall beautye of Chriſt, and his
excellent puritye, is to bee preferred aboue all.
Neither doth ſhe ſimply compare him, to euerye
kind of gold, but to that which is moſt pure and
fine, if anye one be better then an other, as in
truth we know by experience there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and all is done to this ende, that vnder
the ſame ſhee might ſet foorth the moſte perfect
purity, ſoundneſſe and excellencye of her ſpouſe.
<hi>His lockes are curled,</hi> or the word alſo may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thicke, both of theſe tending to expreſſe his
might and ſtrength, and not to approoue, either
of curling or criſping of hayre in men or women
which is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. 1. Pe. 3. <hi>And blacke as a rauen,</hi>
that is, comelye and ſightlye: for blacknes of it

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20644:72"/>
to the people, inhabiting the land of Iury,
which is meruailous hotte ouer ours is: and by
theſe wordes, <hi>As a Rauen,</hi> ſhee meant that it
was a naturall and pure black of it ſelfe, which
is farre more excellent, both in blacke and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
colours, than anye of theſe that be made by
art.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 11. <hi>His eyes are like doues eyes.</hi>
                  </hi> She now
deſcribeth his eyes, by the ſober comelines and
beauty of them, they beeing full of all innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
ſinglenes, and chaſtity, which he meaneth to
expreſſe by comparing them to doues eyes. The
church attributeth it here vnto Chriſt, which he
before attributed vnto her, cha. 1. 15. Alſo chap.
4. 1. where looke for the more full expoſition of
the ſame: neither doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, ſimply compare
them to <hi>Doues eyes,</hi> that is, to euery ſort of doues
eyes, but to ſuch doues as be moſt beautifull and
cleare, which may appeare by the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>By the riuers of waters,</hi> that is, like the eyes of
ſuch doues as haunt and abyde by the riuers of
waters, where they haue ſtore inough of water,
to waſh them ſelues and their eies, to make them
cleare &amp; freſh, we knowing alſo by experience, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
euery running water is good to freſh and cleare
the ſight. <hi>Waſhing them ſelues in milke: <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi>
If that bee not ſufficient to reſemble him and
his eies to Doues, haunting the cleare ſtreames,
let them be compared to ſuch, as for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and freſhing of their eyes, waſh themſelues
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20644:72"/>
in milke, that ſo they maye appeare, and bee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
white and comelye, ſhyning with cleare
brightneſſe, <hi>And remayning by fulneſſe.</hi> Theſe
wordes haue beene diuerſly interpreted, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſame, ſeuerall ſenſes haue beene
gyuen. I will onely rehearſe two, leauing the
godly reader to imbrace that, which hee ſhall
finde to be moſt agreable to godlynes and truth.
Some thinke, that by this ſhould be meant, that
as the doues bee full of moyſture, that remayne
and continue by full veſſelles: ſo is Chriſte the
huſbande of the church, of whoſe fulneſſe we all
receiue euen grace for grace. Otherſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the word which is here tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated <hi>fulnes,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
a thing ſometimes, that is fitted for anye
hollow place or roome, as the precious Stone
in a ring is made meete and fitte, to fill vp the
hollow place of the ring, doe therefore interpret
it of the eyes, fitted as it were, for the holes of
the heade: <hi>q. d,</hi> As the Stones that are ſet in
ringes, are fitted for the place, and ſo make a
comely ſhew: ſo are the eyes of the Spouſe, none
of them ſtanding too farre out of the head, for
that is full of ſtaring, neyther anye of them
ſincke in, for that is piteous to beholde, (both
which thinges are vnſeemelye and deformed in
the eyes, as we ſee by experience, and do after a
ſort diſfigure the countenance) but more fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a thouſand degrees, than precious ſtones
are to ringes, for the beautifiing therof. And this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20644:73"/>
I take to be the more ſimple ſenſe, but as I ſaid
before, I leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader to his own holy choyſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 12. <hi>His cheekes are a bed of ſpice,</hi>
                  </hi>
that is, comely and pleaſant to the ſight, and
ſweete to the ſmell. The comlineſſe thereof is
contayned in the worde <hi>bed,</hi> and the ſweeteneſſe
thereof in the worde <hi>Spice.</hi> For beds, as we ſee,
ſet out the gardens, and ſpices we knowe, ſmell
well then, when they haue bene long gathered,
no doubt alſo but they are ſweete then when
they growe. <hi>And as the flowers of ſpices,</hi> I take
it that hee meaneth by this ſpeeche, they are
moſt ſweete and pleaſant to looke vpon. For the
flowers of good things, as we ſee by experience,
are for the time, more delightfull to looke vpon,
and more ſweete to ſmell too, then the bodies
themſelues yeelding the ſame. <hi>His lippes are as
Lillies,</hi> that is, glorious and beautifull, and faire
to beholde, for that flowre amongeſt others, is of
a goodly colour, and fayre to looke vppon. This
flowre is commended in many places of this
book, as wherunto ſomtimes the church it ſelfe
is compared for the beauty of it cap. 2. 2. And in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame cap. ver. 16. it is attributed to Chriſt. Se
alſo cap. 4. 5. Neither is this flowre only beauti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full,
but of a pleaſant ſmell, and of good and tall
growth, al which tendeth ſtill to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> expreſſing of
the glory and beauty of Chriſt, and to the ſweet
and pleaſaunt ſmelles, that are to bee founde in
him, whereunto alſo no doubt, but he alludeth in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20644:73"/>
the words following, ſaying <hi>dropping down pure
myrrh.</hi> This is expounded before verſ. 4. of this
cha. In all this, as alſo that which goeth before
and followeth after, we muſt mark, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghoſt meaneth not to mooue men to wanton
loue (for beſides that he knoweth our ouer great
inclination thereto, wee beleeue according to
trueth, that no vngodlineſſe dwelleth with him)
nor inſtructeth men to paynt out their louers,
according to their fleſhly liking: but vnder theſe
figuratiue and borrowed kinde of ſpeeches, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the comlineſſe of the creatures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
our ſelues are well acquainted with, as alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
other porportions in them, hee doth liuely paint
out the excellent graces in Chriſt, which as in
reſpect of themſelues cannot well bee expreſſed,
and by reaſon of our weakneſſe, can not better
be declared: yea, he paynteth out vnder the ſame,
the ſpirituall and heauenly loue of the Churche
to Chriſte, which doth not nor cannot ſatiſfy hir
ſelf with any words or compariſons, to expreſſe
both the moſt excellent maieſty and glory of her
loue Chriſte, and the holye cauſes in him that
ſtirre vp her affections of loue towardes him.
Allegorically to handle all theſe thinges, is not
in my purpoſe or power, and yet mee thinketh
this much maye bee ſayde according to trueth,
that by his <hi>head,</hi> mentioned verſ. 10. and there
reſembled to gold, yea to moſt pure golde, there
may well bee ment, his eternall diety or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20644:74"/>
or if you wil his whole perſon, which doth
as farre exceede all thinges, both in colour and
glittering, and all manner goodnes, as gold, yea
moſt fine golde, all other metalles: and by his
<hi>locks</hi> mentioned in the ſame verſe may be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
the innumerable &amp; vnmeaſurable graces of
God beſtowed vpon him, euen as the hayres of a
mans head, are without account: to proceede, by
the <hi>curling</hi> of them, may be ſignified not only the
faſt twiſting and twinding of them one within
another, they beeing tied together as it were
with a chaine, but alſo the preuailing ſtrength
of the ſame: as alſo there maye bee meant by the
<hi>blacknes,</hi> that excellent comelineſſe, beauty, and
glory thereof. And whereas verſ. 11. ſhe maketh
mention of his <hi>eyes,</hi> thereby may well be reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the quickneſſe of ſight, as you woulde ſay,
that is in Chriſte, or his vnderſtanding or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of thinges, that beeing more excellente
in him, then our eyes in vs, becauſe our ſight
maye bee deceiued, but hee can not. For hee
ſeeth and beholdeth all thinges, as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
affirmeth in many places, as Prouerbes
15. 3. Zecha. 4. 10. Heb, 4. 13. And whereas ſhee
reſembleth them to <hi>Doues eies, ſitting by the riuers
of waters. &amp;c.</hi> No doubt but thereby ſhe meaneth
the purity and cleanneſſe of Gods ſighte, who
as hee loueth no wickedneſſe, neyther will
haue euill to dwell with him. Pſalme. 5. 4.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20644:74"/>
So hee cannot abide to beholde it, in whiche
reſpect Abacuck ſayth notably of him chapter 1.
13. <hi>Thou art of pure eyes, and canſt not ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
thou canſt not beholde wickednes.</hi> And
whereas in this verſe 12. ſhe mencioneth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
cheekes, lips &amp;c. no doubt, but by the <hi>cheekes</hi>
ſhe meaneth his comely and fauourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
as by comparing the ſame to <hi>ſpices,</hi> the
ſweetneſſe and pleaſauntnes thereof: as alſo by
the <hi>lippes</hi> &amp;c, the ſweetnes of his word and truth,
full of all maner of ioye, and reioycing the heart,
as the Prophet ſaith Pſalm. 19. 6. ſpreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
the ſweetnes therof euen farre and wide,
after the maner of the pleaſaunt lilies, and moſt
precious, pure, and ſweet myrth. For the worde
<hi>lippes,</hi> ſee before chapter 4. 3. alſo verſ. 11. attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
there by Chriſte, to the church. Thus the
ſcripture vſeth to reſemble diuine thinges to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
though it be true, deuine thinges can by
no humaine, either wordes or matters, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
expreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 13. <hi>His handes as ringes of golde,</hi>
                  </hi> that is,
glorious and precious, for ringes were counted
in thoſe dayes, great ornaments and deckinges.
Iſaiah. 3. 21. Luke. 15. 22. neither doth ſhe ſaye
ſimply <hi>ringes,</hi> but <hi>ringes of gold,</hi> adding yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more in the wordes following, to expreſſe
his glory. <hi>Set full of Tarſhiſh,</hi> that is, of precious
ſtones ſo called, which what they were, is not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20644:75"/>
certaine, and that maketh the interpreters to
turne it diuerſely, ſome vſing heere the worde
<hi>Chriſolite,</hi> other ſome turning it, <hi>Beril</hi> of the ſea.
If it bee a Chryſolite, ſome take it then to bee
a very rich precious ſtone, that came out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi>
gliſtering as gold (whereof it ſeemeth
alſo in the greek tongue, to take the name) ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
as fire, but yet as ſome thinke ſomewhat
greene, or as other report hauing the colour of
the ſea in ſome ſort. If we read it <hi>Beril,</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
ſtone, that groweth (as ſome holde) in
India, <hi>Berill,</hi> it ſelfe, beeing as they ſuppoſe an
indian word, and giuen by the people as a name
to that ſtone, in greene colour it reſembleth the
ſucaradge as ſome ſuppoſe, and was wonte to
be cut of the Indians ſixe ſquare, which they
did to make the dimme or dull colour to ſhewe
better, for otherwiſe, as ſome affirme, it did not
ſhewe, becauſe it was of a colour like oyle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome, or like water in the ſea, after other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.
Some write, that in former times, this
ſtone was moſt vſually ſet, in ſuch rings as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
did vſe to giue one to another, or in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
rings, becauſe of the power that was thoght
to be in it, to procure and continue loue and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
one of them towards another. But to come
to the worde it ſelfe, that the holy ghoſte vſeth
here, I finde it in the ſcripture to be vſed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the name of a man, as Geneſ. 10. 4.
ſometimes for the name of a citye or place in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20644:75"/>
                  <hi>Cilicia,</hi> as Iona. 1. 3. which it ſhoulde ſeeme to
take from them, it is mentioned in Geneſ. chap.
10. 4. And this place was famous by Paules
byrth, as appeareth Act. 21. 39. Sometimes it
is vſed for the name of a precious ſtone, as here,
which the interpretors in other places where it
is mentioned, haue not yet agreed vpon what it
ſhould be, ſometimes they turning it, a Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,
an other while a Carbuncle, an other while
a Hyachath, an other while an Onix, &amp;c. ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
there is. Other ſome will haue it to be a
ſtone of a blewiſhe colour, or of colour like the
ſkie, or blackiſh or darke as water beeing deep,
which they cal by the name of Turkes, this and
the name of <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> not much differing. Some
of the Iewiſh Rabbins, take it to be a precious
ſtone, whoſe colour commeth nigh to the colour
of <hi>Hyacinth</hi> or <hi>Iamith,</hi> which ſome take to bee
purple coloured. All this is put downe, that the
godly reader may chuſe that which he ſhal iudg
moſt agreeable to the truth. For mine own part
I think ſhe meaneth, that ther is nothing in her
ſpouſe, but moſt rare, deare, precious, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thinges: vnderſtanding alſo by his <hi>handes,</hi>
not onely his ſtrength and power, which is alſo
vſuall in the ſcripture, but alſo al his workes,
becauſe Chriſtes power in the perfourmaunce
of them, is the ſame that mens handes are to
them, meaning hereby, that the workes of God
are pure and beautifull, yea moſt precious, yea
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20644:76"/>
then gold or precious ſtones, yea as numbers of
ringes filled with all maner of coſtly ſtones; by
which alſo vſing the worde <hi>ringes</hi> in the plural
number, no doubt but ſhe meaneth to expreſſe the
varietye and great ſtoore of theſe wonderfull
workes, of which Dauid ſayth, Pſalm. 40. 5. <hi>If
I would declare and ſpeake of them, they are
more in number than I am able to expreſſe.</hi>
It followeth. <hi>His belly,</hi> vz, or <hi>his breaſt.</hi> She put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
part of him for the whole bodye. <hi>Like the
whitenes of Iuorye.</hi> Shee meaneth that he was
as comely and cleare as the Iuorye, which is a
thing well knowen vnto us, to bee verye white
and bright, made (as ſome ſaye) of an Elophantes
tuſke, which kinde of beaſtes are onely in Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
naturally as ſome hold: neither doth ſhe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
compare it to <hi>Ioury,</hi> but addeth, <hi>couered with
Saphirs,</hi> that is, that hath moſt ritch and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
coſt beſtowed vpon it. <hi>Iuory</hi> of it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a thing rare, and farre brought, muſte
needes be very coſty, how much more then, when
it is beſet wholly with precious ſtones, yea with
moſt coſtlye precious ſtones, ſuch as Saphirs
are, of which we can hardly ſaye anye more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
than before of Tarſhiſh. Some, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the Iewiſh wryters, take it to bee of the
colour of the ayre: ſome a white ſtone, ſome a
red ſtone, ſome take it to bee an adamant: ſome
thinke it to bee of a blewiſhe colour, intermixed
with purple, hauing certaine ſparkes, like golde
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20644:76"/>
as it were, in the ſame: and this laſt ſeemeth in
my mind, to be the liklieſt iudgement. In <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
or amongeſt the Medes, is the beſt ſort of
them, and yet none of them all, are very cleare.
Whatſoeuer it bee, this I take to bee the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the church, to ſhewe, that Chriſte her
ſpouſe, was not onelye moſt comely adorned, but
alſo moſt ſumptuouſly and coſtly, euen as Iuory
beſet with pearles and moſt precious ſtones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 14. <hi>His thies, are as pillers of marble.</hi>
                  </hi> She
proceedeth in the commendation of his partes:
and in that ſhee reſembleth his thies vnto pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
ſhee meaneth thereby his ſtrength, which
yet is more ſet out, in that ſhe ſayth they are
<hi>of marble:</hi> by which ſhee doth not onelye note as
before, the ſtrength thereof, but alſo the comely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the ſame. For <hi>marble</hi> (though there bee
ſundrye ſortes thereof) are counted ſuch ſtones,
as are commended for ſeueral colours and ſpots
in the ſame, and hath his name in the Greeke
tongue, as it ſhould ſeeme, for a certaine greene
kind of glittering greene. <hi>Set vpon ſockets of fine
gold.</hi> She meaneth by this ſpeech, that they haue
not only a fayre &amp; fine foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but euen a ſure
one alſo. For as thoſe pillers are glorious, that
are ſet vpon fine gold, and lyke long to laſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
golde hardlye ruſteth or cankereth, ſo is it
with Chriſte: the Church noting by all theſe
thinges, the aſſured ſoundes, ſtrength, conſtancy,
and durablenes of her ſpouſe: becauſe as amongſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20644:77"/>
ſtones, marble, ſo amongſt mettall, golde, is moſt
ſtrong and durable. <hi>His countenaunce as Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
that is, pleaſaunt and delightfull: for Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
as we haue heard before, was a pleaſant and
fruitfull place. <hi>Excellent as the Cedars,</hi> that is,
as glorious and as much to be eſteemed, as the
high and mighty Ceders of Lebanon. So we
read, as the Laurix tree, which is a tree hauing
leaues lyke a Pine tree, the wood and timber
whereof, is very fit for building, not onelye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is eaſie to worke in, but becauſe it will
hardlye or not at all periſhe, either by rotting or
wormes, yea if that be true, which ſome write of
it, it will not eaſely be conſumed with fyre, but
there is a long ſpace, before the fire can either
take hold of it, or burne it to coales. By which
no doubt alſo, there may be well meant, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
durablenes of Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of
God, who though he bee a fyre to conſume the
wicked, and though the wicked thinke by flames
as it were, to burne him, yet they ſhall not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to annoy him.</p>

Shee meaneth by one inſtrument of nature,
wherewith the voyce is formed, to wit, <hi>the roofe
of the mouth,</hi> euen the voyce it ſelfe, &amp; the words
vttered therewith: and by <hi>ſweetneſſes,</hi> which ſhe
vſeth in the plurall number, ſhe meaneth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the pleaſantneſſe of his worde, which as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
ſayth, is more ſweete vnto his taſte, than the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20644:77"/>
hony and the hony combe. Pſalm. 19. 10: but alſo
the great aboundaunce, and wonderfull plentye
thereof. What a ſweet voyce is this: <hi>Come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mee all yee that labour, and be heauie
loden &amp;c.</hi> Math. 11. 28. And this: <hi>So God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the world, that he gaue his onelye begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Sonne &amp;c.</hi> Iohn 3. 26. See for this Phraſe
alſo, Pſal. 45. 2. <hi>And he himſelf is wholly delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, there is nothing, neither within him,
nor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out him, but it may moue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
delight &amp; pleaſure in him: ſhe affirming y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
we are of him whollye and together, which ſhee
had before declared in euery part of him almoſt.
And how can this chuſe but be true, both in the
whole, and in euerye part, ſeeing that God was
in Chriſte, and reconciled the worlde vnto him
ſelfe. 2. Cor. 5. 19. and that in him dwelleth the
fulneſſe of the godhead bodely, God beeing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in the fleſhe, and iuſtified in the ſpirite.
Colloſ. 2. 9. 1. Tim. 3. 16. So that whoſoeuer
doubteth of this, or denyeth it, may as well call
the truth of God him ſelfe into queſtion. <hi>This is
my welbeloued,</hi> vz, that I haue deſcribed vnto you
<hi>And this is my louer O daughters of Ieruſalem.</hi> As
though ſhe ſhould ſay: he is ſuch a one, as I haue
painted him out vnto you, in this excellent ſhew
and beautye, that yee maye eaſelye know him in
and amongeſt others. And this dubbling of the
wordes, that ſhee here vſed, was not onely profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to expreſſe her earneſt affection towardes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20644:78"/>
him, but alſo to mooue them, with whom ſhe tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
both to the earneſte louing, and liking of
him, whom ſhee had deſcribed, and alſo that they
might be the better able, either to do her meſſage
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned verſ. 7. of this cha, to chriſt, or to bring
her, wher he himſelf was. And in calling him <hi>her
welbeloued</hi> and <hi>louer,</hi> ſhe meanneth to expreſſe, that
as Chriſte had carryed vnfayned good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, ſo ſhe did in ſome meaſure, of a ſound
mind vnto him, as her dearling &amp; beſt beloued,
on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, ſhe could find in her hart, as we ſay,
to beſtow her whole loue, her ſelfe and all. To
be ſhort, in ending thus emphatically, ſhe giueth
vs to vnderſtand, that not beeing able by any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
phraſes, metaphors, ſimilitudes, words or
ſpeeches to deſcribe him to the full, ſhe would in
a worde as it were, ſhut vp all, that he him ſelfe
within and without, both generallye and euerye
part of him, was altogeather amiable, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
indeed to be affected, both of her and alſo of
all thoſe, that either ſhoulde heare of him, or ſee
him.</p>

<hi>Whither is my welbeloued.</hi> This is the ſecond
queſtion of the Damſelles and friendes of the
Church, as we haue noted before, which they
propound not, as of euill wil towardes her or her
ſpouſe, but of a good minde to imbrace him, as
appeareth by the wordes, and to goe with her to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20644:78"/>
ſeeke him. <hi>Whither is thy welbeloued,</hi> (vz, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou
haſt ſo notably painted out vnto vs, and ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
opened,) <hi>Turned a ſide,</hi> vz, from thee, and yet
it ſhoulde ſeeme, that they meane by the worde,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is not gone far, nor will be long abſent. <hi>That
we ſeek him with thee.</hi> They ſhew the end of their
aſking, that ſo they may remooue all doubt, and
ſuſpition out of the Churches heade, that they
aſke not otherwiſe, than of an vnfayned minde,
and harty good will, both towardes Chriſte and
her, in that they offer them ſelues as it were, to
be companions with her in ſeeking him. All
commeth to this, that after the Church had
liuelye painted out the perſon of her loue, to the
Daughters of Ieruſalem, that is, to the friends
of the church, and had deſcrybed his complexion,
members, ſpeech, and other excellent vertues,
qualities and graces in him, that if they had but
either ſeen him, or heard him ſpeake, they might
haue knowen him, the holy Ghoſt ſheweth what
effect this tooke in their heartes, namely it ſo
inflamed them, with an vnfayned loue towardes
him, that preſently they will be companions
with her in ſeeking of him. Theſe queſtions
do the faythfull, and elect people of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
labouring thereby to fetch from the
mouth of the Church, a profitable inſtruction,
and profeſſing that they are deſirous to ſeeke &amp;
find him, euen as ſhe. If this ſeeme ſtraunge, we
muſt know &amp; vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without the church,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20644:79"/>
Chriſt can neither bee ſought for as he ſhoulde,
neither indeed found.</p>

The churches anſwere to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> former demand,
for ſhee hath nothing in her, but ſhe wil acquaint
her children and friendes with the ſame. And in
that ſhe vſeth the word of <hi>going downe,</hi> ſhe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it not onely as hauing reſpect to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe talked for their
good and inſtruction, but as hauing regard alſo,
to the ſcituation of the city it ſelfe, from whence
they could not paſſe to their gardens of pleaſure
without the city, but they muſt of neceſſitye goe
downward, becauſe the city ſtood vpon the hill,
and they planted their gardens in the lower pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
becauſe they were more plentiful and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
and what ſhee ſhoulde meane by the worde
<hi>garden,</hi> ſee before chapter 4. 17. <hi>To the beddes of
ſpice,</hi> that is, to comely and ſweete ſmelling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the ſame: this Phraſe is expounded verſe
12. of this chapter. <hi>To feed in the gardens.</hi> The
church noteth the endes, wherfore Chriſte is
gone downe into the gardens, that is, to eate and
to drincke there, and to take therein his pleaſure
and refreſhing. <hi>And to gather lilies,</hi> that is, ſweet
and good flowers. Men goe to ther gardens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
(as we ſee by experience amongſt vs) ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make merry as we ſaye, or els to gather
ſuch fruites, as grow there: that doth the church
applye in a ſpirituall ſence, vnto her head and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20644:79"/>
ſpouſe Chriſt, meaning that Chriſt is come into
that place, where his worde is purelye preached
and hearde (for there in deed is the ſeate of the
church) that is Chriſt his garden, ſet with diuers
ſortes of plants, and decked with excellent flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
this was called before a garden incloſed,
chapter 4. 12. thorow the beds of ſweet ſmelling
ſpices, which he as a good gardiner treadeth out,
planteth watereth and doth all in all, namelye,
the heartes and conſciences of ſuch as he hath
regenerated, repleniſhing them with ſundrye
gyftes and graces, as of prayer, thankeſgyuing,
obedience, &amp;c, which are vnto him as it were
ſweete ſmelling ſpices or flowres: yea he fedeth
in his gardens, that is to ſaye, particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
for it is as it were food vnto him, to haue
churches, in which he maye be confeſſed and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
yea it is his meat and drincke to him, either
to doe him ſelfe, or to haue others doe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will. Iohn. 4. 32. 34. And he gathereth ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and other flowres for them, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them to doe good workes, which is an odor
that ſmelleth ſweete, and a ſacrifice farre more
acceptable and pleaſaunt to him. Philip. 4. 18,
then all the pleaſant flowres in the world, can be
to any man earthly.</p>

                  </hi>) This is the concluſion of the whole
chapter, and of all the ſpeech that the church
hath with her Daughters and Damſels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20644:80"/>
the church openly profeſſeth that whatſoeuer
may bee either ſtaied or done againſt her, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee
is and will be of a ſtayed and vnmoueable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards Chriſte, and will be continuallye
ſtrengthened in an aſſured perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his good
will towards her, and ſo by this meanes ſhee fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtereth
and foodeth her affection and good will
towards him: for ſhee meaneth by this ſpeeche,
that ſhe belongeth ſo to Chriſt, and Chriſt ſo to
her, that there can bee no ſeparation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
good cauſe why ſhe ſhould continually loue
and like him: we had the ſame before chap. 2. 16
Ther being no difference in the meaning, thogh
as in reſpect of the order of the words, there is
ſome that being put ther in the firſt place which
is here in the latter, &amp; that there in the latter,
which is heere in the firſt, the meaning beeing
thus, As he will not haue an other but whollye
delighteth in me, ſo I will not haue another lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
but hold my ſelf wholy and onely contented
with him. <hi>Who feedeth among the Lillies,</hi> That
is, who liueth moſt pleaſantly and ſweetely: <hi>q. d.</hi>
as they that eate there me at among the Lillies,
and other ſweet ſmelling flowers, can not chuſe
but liue in delights, pleaſantneſſe, and ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
ſo doth Chriſt in his church, and thoſe that
ther liue with him. And the church propoundeth
this, not only for the ſingular commendation of
Chriſt her ſpouſe, but alſo thereby as it were by
a forcible argument, to moue all the faithful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20644:80"/>

they haue learned to weep with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> weepe, &amp;c.

Satans ſubtletie woulde be waighed in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
who if he can not puffe vs vp in pryde of
the thinges we haue not, woulde caſt vs downe,
in ſuppoſing a want of the thinges we haue, So
hard a matter is it to bee wiſe according to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
as the Apoſtle willeth vs. Roman. 12. 3.
Thirdly, we may learne, for the better feeling of
our ſinne, and the working of a more ſound dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of it in vs, to aggrauate the ſame vnto
our ſelues, in all the circumſtaunces and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof: howbeit in a iuſt meaſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,

fleſhe and bloud can finde, to put the Lorde from
them in his gracious calling of them, with the

they alleadging, that it is no conuenient

we do not onely prouoke him to depart, and pull

to beſtow it vpon them that will thankfullye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

our ſauiour ſayth Math. 21. 43. It is a doctrine
much vſed in the old and new Teſtament, both

as in regarde of him ſelfe, ſupplying his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
with the ſweete graces that hee hath left

                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 10 Teacheth vs, not only to be greatly

the wicked againſt the godly, vz. hardlye to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
them and to deale moſt cruelly with them
which the Churche of God, and the particuler

times, which thing alſo the holy ghoſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not onely here but in many other places of
ſcripture, not as to diſcourage vs from entringe
into the race and courſe of godlineſſe, but to fore
tell vs before hand, what we muſt looke for, and
to forewarne vs alſo to bee furniſhed with the
graces of conſtancy and patience in the trueth.
And as we ſee the perſecutions of the church put
downe in the worde, and foretold there, as acts.
14. 22. 2. Timoth. 3. 12. and other places, ſo we
haue notable places, containing the terrors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wicked, and the ioyes of the faythfull, as Philip.
1. 28. In nothing feare your aduerſaries, which
is to them a ſure token of deſtruction, but to you
of ſaluation and that of God. And 2. Theſ. 1, 6.
7. &amp;c. It is a righteous thinge with God to
recompence trybulation to them that trouble
you, (which what it is he declareth verſ. 8. 9.)
and to you which are troubled reſt with vs:
by which we ſee, that the ſufferinges of the
Saintes, ſhall not be in vayne, and that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly

they imagine or ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Teacheth vs in the daies of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe

or keep it cloſe, for then it wilbe as a fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume

vs, but to laie it out to the Godly, that ſo
from them we may receiue according to Gods
good pleaſure, inſtruction and comfort, and by
doctrine and praier: according to Saint Iames
his rule. Acknowledge your faultes one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and pray one for an other,. Iames 5. 16.

laying our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s before them that are

knowledge of ſuch thinges as we haue ſmall, or
no ſkil at all in, finally &amp; aboue al the knowledg

yet we muſte labor agayne to remooue

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 9. Teacheth vs, firſt if we know anye
thing, the manifeſting whereof maye tende to
Gods glorye, and the good of his children, we
ſhould ſimply propound it, for God hath not gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
men talents to the end, that they ſhould lapp
it vp in napkins, and digg &amp; hide the ſame in the
ground, as the vnprofitable ſeruaunt in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Math. 25. 25. Luke. 19. 20. Neither yet
that in a proud conceit of their own eſtimation,
becauſe they alone would be counted wiſe, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

laye it out for aduauntage to them ſelues by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the ſame, and to Gods glory, who ſhall
haue praiſe in their weldoing, and to the good of
his children, who can not chuſe, but reape profit
thereby. Secondly, that howſoeuer we would
that Chriſt ſhould be glorious amongſt others,
and tenderly beloued of them, that yet we ſhould
alſo haue a care, that he might bee deare and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20644:84"/>
precious in our eyes aboue the reſt, and that we
might (if it were poſſible) more vnfaynedly loue
him than all others.</p>

griefe and ſicknes, for her negligence and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe
towardes him, hee comforteth her and
aſſureth her, that notwithſtanding the ſame, ſhe
is and ſhall be as deare vnto him, as euer ſhee
was before: which thing alſo that ſhee mighte
be the better perſwaded of, he doth yeelde her a
large and vnfained commendation, and this is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> contained in the ſeuen firſt verſes. In the ſecond
he ſetteth out the earneſt and vehement deſire
he had, to haue the mariage betweene him and

laſtlye a promiſe made to the churche, for the

beeing ſayde, both for the connexion and diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the chapter, into his cheefe partes &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
we come nowe to the ſenſe of the wordes
of the text, as they lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 1. <hi>Thou art beautifull my loue.</hi>
                  </hi> Chriſt mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the church that laboured and ſought
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20644:88"/>
to finde him, doth after the maner of louers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying
his great affections, maruailouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Churche, for her excelent beutie: All
which things, as they muſt be ſpiritually vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
ſo wee muſt know, that all the glory ſhe-hath,
how great or how litle ſoeuer yt bee, ſhee
hath it from Chriſt her ſpouſe. So that he doth
nothing as it were, but commend his own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in her, &amp; yet theſe thinges are not deliuered
without cauſe, whether we reſpecte Chriſt, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Church it ſelfe or others. If we reſpect Chriſt, it
propoundeth vnto vs, the manifeſtation of his
vnfained and continual loue towards the church
if we regarde others, it is done to make them in
loue and lykinge towardes the Churche, which
Chriſt himſelfe loueth ſo tenderly, and ſo highly
commendeth: if we reſpect the Church, it is don
for her comfort. <hi>q. d.</hi> Thinck not that that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beuty of thine is decaied, or that I haue caſte
from mee thy loue and lyking, by reaſon of thy
former diſcurteſies and negligences, I am not
ſo ſcornefull and dyſdainfull, as to thincke thee
deformed for that ſpottes ſake, thou haſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
waſhed it a waye, with thy teares and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce.
Wherefore as I ſaid before, chap. 4
1. 2. &amp;c. So euen nowe I affirme the ſame
ſtill, thy fauoure and beutie is moſte accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and delightfull to mee. And Chriſte dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
this, becauſe it is hard for the Church, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20644:88"/>
the members thereof, to beleeue the Worde
at the firſt, and ſpecially the worde of promiſe,
and then chiefely, when wee regarde our euill
dealing with the Lorde, and oure multiplying
of it againſte him. <hi>As tyrtzah.</hi> It is the
name of a moſte pleaſaunt Citie in the coaſtes
of Iſraell, ſcituated vppon the riuer Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,
where, after that the kingdome of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell
was rent from the houſe of Dauid, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam
placed as it ſhoulde ſeeme, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pallace. Of this Citie you maye reade 1.
Kinges. 14. 17. alſo 15. 21. and 16. 6. &amp;c. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubt I, but that it had the name giuen it
of pleaſauntnes (beeing deriued of a worde that
ſignifieth to accept or like of) becauſe it did by
the pleaſauntnes and beutie thereof, drawe all
men as it were to the lykinge thereof. <hi>Comely
as Ieruſalem.</hi> For the beautie and glorye of this
Cytie, beſides that wee haue the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word, it being called therin, the praiſe
of the worlde, Iſaiah. 62. 7. See alſo Pſalm.
122. 3. Yt did euen as forraine wryters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde,
not onelie in beautie and comelyneſſe
contende with the Cytties of the Eaſt, but
as ſomme of them doe report, was the moſte
famouſe of them all. See PLINIE lib, 5
CAP. 14. Thus wee ſee the pleaſauntnes,
Gorgeouſnes and bewty of the Church ſet out
vnto vs by earthlye ſimilytudes. And though it
bee true in deed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none of theſe can ſufficiently
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20644:89"/>
declare the ſame vnto vs, yet we may perceiue,
that the Scripture hath taken not only the moſt
excellent thinges of the lands of Iudah and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
but of the whole world to ſet forth theſame
vnto vs, that ſo vnder theſe earthly reſemblaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he might the better make vs, (who are very
groſſe and dull) to conceiue of heauenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
thinges. It followeth. <hi>Terrible is an army
with many enſignes.</hi> One woulde thinke, that this
ſhould be no great commendation, ſpeciallye
ſith reſembling the church to a woman, neither
doth it agree to that ſexe, neither is it prayſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
in them (as ſome ſuppoſe) to ſtrike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
into others. But we ſay, firſt euen for woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
that it is, and ſhall be no ſmall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
vnto them. If with their grauitye and
maieſty, they ſtrike terror and fear, into impure
fellowes, euen by ſobriety and ſeuerity of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce,
driuing ſuche from them, as woulde
make them diſloyall to their huſbands. Which
thing alſo, maye notably agree to the Churche,
in a double reſpect, to witte, firſte, when as in
reſpect of her excellente maieſtye, ſhee ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
her aduerſaries, eſpeciallye falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who woulde defile her with corrupt doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that they dare not ſo muche, as touche
her, otherwiſe or further, then as GOD per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
and appoynteth: Secondly, when as in
regard of her diſobedient children, ſhe woundeth
them by the worde and Diſcipline for a while,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20644:89"/>
that by repentaunce they may bee healed and
holpen for euer, againſt the ſubtilty of Sathan,
and the ſtrength of ſinne, ſhee not ſtriking them
thereby, to confounde them no more then God
doth ſtrike his children, by his roddes to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
them for euer, but to reconcile them to
their eternal comfort &amp; ſaluation. Neither doth
the Lord meane this onely, by reſembling his
church <hi>to armies with many enſignes,</hi> but alſo to
ſet out vnto vs thereby the good order &amp; inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
force of the ſame. For euen as in greate
armies, the more good militarye orders there
are eſtabliſhed and practiſed, &amp; holye courſes
kept, the greater is their glory and comlineſſe,
and the more do they flouriſh &amp; proſper: euen ſo
is it with the church. And as it is an impoſſible
thing to preuayle vppon an army, conſiſting of
innumerable and valiant people, ſo is it as hard
yea, altogether impoſſible, to preuayle againſte
the Churche, ſithe it is of ſuche ſtrength, power
and fayth, as, though it may bee aſſaulted, yet it
can neuer be ouercome. See the like phraſe to
this, verſ. 7. of this chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 2 <hi>Turne thine eyes ouer againſte
mee.</hi>
                  </hi> That is, looke vppon mee aud regarde
mee, <hi>q. d.</hi> Though thou bee paſt, yet turne
thine eyes backe againe, that thou maieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
mee, <hi>That they may lift mee vp,</hi> that is,
that ſo I maye receyue comfort in the ſighte of
thee. Thus Chriſte ſpeaketh to the churche,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20644:90"/>
that hee mighte giue her to vnderſtande, that
he would render to her like for like. She had
twiſe before declared, that ſhee was as it were
faint and ſick thorow loue, for which purpoſe ſee
chap. 2. 5. &amp; alſo chap. 5. 7. The very like ſtrength
and power of loue, to be in him towards her, doth
here Chriſt declare, both that ſo ſhe might know
there was no loue loſte: and alſo that ſhe might
be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, in the heauines ſhe was in. I know
that others do otherwiſe turne this parte of the
verſe: as thus: Turne awaye thine eyes, from
me, for they are ſtronger than I, or they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
me, giuing alſo this ſenſe, that chriſt wold
haue the church, to caſte her eye from him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could hardly keepe himſelfe from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againe moſt manifeſt tokens of his loue &amp;c.
But the other in my minde is moſt ſimple and
plaine, not onely agreeing beſt with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunces
and occaſion of the place, and purpoſe
of Chriſt, but alſo ſtanding well with the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Hebrue worde, which maye and doth
as wel ſignifie to turne to, as to turne from, and
in this verſe rather to turne to, becauſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
in this chapter alſo verſe. 10. The Lord
calleth the Church vnto him. This is then the
meaning, that I take this firſt part of the verſe,
to containe in it, the wordes of comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.
<hi>q. d.</hi> bee of good comfort, and in an
aſſured fayth looke vp to me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo I my ſelf alſo
whoe am in ſome ſorte caſte downe with thy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20644:90"/>
heauines, may receiue both comfort and glorye
by thy faith and conuerſion for no doubt but ſith
ther is ſo great &amp; ſtraight a coniunction betwixt
Chriſt &amp; his church, as the apoſtle ſpeaketh of 1
Cor. 12. 12. There is alſo a ſympathy &amp; fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
feeling, or ſuffering together as it were,
Chriſte beeing ſeaſed with ſadneſſe (as a man
would ſay) in the greefe of the church, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
again in the gladſomneſſe and ioy thereof.
<hi>Thine haire is like the flocke of goates, which looke
downe from Gilead.</hi> This is alreadye expounded
before, chapter 4. 1. Spirituallye by this may
bee meant, either the multitude of beleeuers, or
the aboundance of Gods graces beſtowed vpon
the church: or elſe he meaneth that the beauty of
the church, is ſtayed and ſure, and cannot decay
by any infirmity of hir own, becauſe it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
ſtayed and vphelde, by the grace and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Chriſt. For as it coulde not fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
but that the flockes in Gilead, muſt thriue
and proſper: ſo it could not otherwiſe bee, but
that the church, and graces of God in the ſame,
muſt needes continue and increaſe, becauſe it is
vnderpropped and nouriſhed, with the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunte
bleſſinges of Chriſte, the heade and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 3 <hi>Thy teeth are like a Flocke of Sheepe,
which goe vp from the waſhing,</hi>
                  </hi> that is, white, pure
and clean: <hi>All which bring out Twinnes,</hi> That is,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20644:91"/>
they are alſo euen &amp; equall, as commonly twins
are: <hi>And there is none barren amongeſt them.</hi> He
meaneth that they were all full, and none wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as I take it: for as teeth aunſwearing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
one to an other, as in reſpect of the vpper
and nether iawe is comely: and as when either
inche one iawe or in the other, one ſtandeth not
further out then an other, but all are of an equal
height or euennes, it is ſome beuty many times
to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> countenance, ſo was it in the church. See al
this expounded before chapter 4. verſe. 2. where
Chriſte ſpeaketh euen the ſame thinges of the
church, vſing it here, not as a vaine or idle repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
but as hauing regarde to the church, and
that in a double conſideration. The firſt is, to
ſhew her, that notwithſtanding her offence hee
loueth her ſtill as before, which alſo cauſeth him
to vſe the ſame wordes here that there. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe he knew how hard a thing it was for
the church, to beleeue the promiſes, and therfore
for the ſtrengthening of her weakneſſe, he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
them and trebleth them, as you woulde
ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 4. <hi>Thy temples,</hi>
                  </hi> vz, of thy head, <hi>betweene
thy lockes,</hi> he ſpeaketh of the church, according to
the manner of women, who were wont to laye
their lockes out, yet ſo that their temples not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the ſame, and the beauty thereof,
might be ſeene. <hi>Are as a peece of pomegranate,</hi>
that is, of a ruddy and beautifull colour, and that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20644:91"/>
ſo as no doubt, but there was holines and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
meant vnder the ſame. All this is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before chap. 4. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 5. <hi>Though there be threſcore Queenes.</hi>
                  </hi>
As before Chriſt had commended the church, for
ſingular beautye in her ſelfe, ſo now hee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to commend her, by comparing her with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<hi>q. d.</hi> put the caſe that euen there were
innumerable Queenes, for he putteth a number
certaine for an vncertaine, and thoſe moſte fayre
and beautiful, as Queenes were wont to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
in that reſpect. See Heſter 2. 2. 3. 4. <hi>And
foureſcore concubines,</hi> that is, innumerable, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
number for an vncertaine as before. The
Hebrue worde turned here <hi>concubines,</hi> doth as
the learned note, ſomtimes ſignifie wyues, thogh
not iuſt and lawfull wyues, which were maried
without any ſolemnity, or betrothing of matry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
And no doubt but he ſpeaketh this accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the corrupt cuſtome, both of the age
wherein he liued, and of former and ſubſequent
times alſo, manye taking it as a thing lawfull,
(whereas it was indeed altogether wicked and
vngodly) not only to haue many wyues, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines
alſo, as we maye ſee by the continuall
practiſe of the fathers expreſſed in the worde,
though not commended, but condemned therein
rather, as Malach. 2. 15. Some maruaile why
Solomon mentioneth onelye <hi>threſcoore Queenes
and foureſcoore concubines,</hi> whereas 1. Kin. 11. 3.
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:20644:92"/>
It is ſayde that he had ſeuen hundreth Wyues
that were queenes, &amp; three hundred concubines,
wherevnto though we might aunſwere, as ſome
learned men do, namely that it is likelye that he
wrote this, before he burſt foorth to take ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
number as it were, yet me thinketh the more
plaine ſenſe is as before, that he putteth a number
certaine for an vncertaine, which is not onely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
in other ſcriptures, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this book al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
chap. 3. 7. where he maketh mention of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
mightye men of Iſraell, that ſtand about
Salomons bed. Some allegorize here one way,
ſome an other. Some think that by the queenes,
there is ment the famous peoples of the world,

the glory of the church, but alſo her great glory
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20644:93"/>
it ſelfe, which is inlarged not only becauſe it is
deſired, yea greatly wiſhed and looked for, euen
as watch men looke for the day breake, of which
ſee Pſal. 130. 6. but alſo becauſe it is reſembled
to the morning, which, as we know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is not onelye freſhe and comfortable, but
glorious alſo and beautifull, as in reſpect of the
liuelye and cleare colours thereof, and deth as a
man woulde ſaye, more and more increaſe in

that ſhee is not reſembled, neither to the night,
nor to the dawning of the day, or day breake, but
euen to the glorye and beauty of the morning it
ſelfe. <hi>Fayre as the moone,</hi> vz, in her full, or moſte

ſo in Chriſtes tranſfiguration it is ſayde,
that his face did ſhine as the ſunne. Math. 17. 2.
and Reuel. 1. 16. it is ſayd, that his face ſhonne,
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſun ſhineth in his ſtrength. In a word vnder
theſe ſpeeches, the holy Ghoſt woulde not onely
note the growth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, by comparing it to
the morning, but the excellency &amp; glory of it, by
reſembling it to the moone, yea to the ſunne, the
moſt excellent and glorious of all the heauenlye
creatures that we doe beholde. <hi>And terrible as an

of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hebrue word (as good expoſitors note) &amp;
alſo more agreeth with the circumſtance of the

clearing of the ſenſe, this is to bee noted, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that heere beginning the ſeconde parte of
the chapter, in which Chriſte laboureth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
his church, he ſayth, that he did not of loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe
or wrath, depart from her, but rather of
a very earneſt deſire that he had to finiſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
moſt holy mariage, &amp; that therefore indeede hee
went away for a while, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo he might be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more
aſſured of the time. And in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he reſembleth the
church to a <hi>fayre dreſſed garden:</hi> he ſpeaketh after

prune, purge &amp; dreſſe ther gardens, &amp; orchards, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ſo it may bear more fruit: &amp; when he ſaith, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
down to the ſame, he ſpeaketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alſo according
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of men, who in the ſummer time come
to ſee how their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy works thriue and proſper:

wordes he meaneth one thing, namely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as men

for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage were come, wherof alſo he had
forerunning ſignes, euen as the flouriſhing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpring paſt, &amp; of the ſommer comming on. See

The Vine to flowriſh, the Pomgranate to bud,
&amp;c. Which are mentioned ver. 8. meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that when he perceiued the time of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was not yet come, as men know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſummer
is not come, when theſe thinges ſprout not out:
to which alſo may be added, that when hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
howe greeuouſly the churche tooke his
abſence then. <hi>My ſoule,</hi> my louing affection and
tender hart: for now hee goeth about to declare,
what councell hee tooke, when he perceiued that
the long looked for time of mariage was not yet
come, namely that he made great haſt backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
as it were, to comfort his Church, which
he expreſſeth by the metaphors following. <hi>Set
mee vpon the chariots,</hi> that is, yeelded mee good
and ſure meanes to bee caried: neither doth hee
onely note hereby, the meanes of his comming
to the Churche, but in the wordes following, the
ſpeede that he made. <hi>Of my free people. <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> As
they they that be willing and free hearted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
do the things that they doe cheerefully, and
therefore alſo with more expedition and ſpeede
then others: ſo came I cheerefully, and with a
readye minde, after I had once reſolued vppon
the matter, to ſee &amp; comfort the churche, for this
free harted and willing people, ſee. Pſal. 110. 3
I know other giue other ſences of theſe words,
but me thinketh this is moſte plaine and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>So that I ſayd.</hi> As before hee had declared his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20644:95"/>
purpoſe and reſolution of his returning to the
church, to the great comfort of the ſame: ſo now
hee ſheweth what hee ſpake when hee came to
her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 10 <hi>Returne, returne.</hi>
                  </hi> Theſe are the
wordes of Chriſte vnto the Churche, who in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of him, had as a man wold ſai, gone beyond
him. And this calling of her backe again, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
vnto vs vnder the ſimilitude of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, who as it were a farre off, whooteth and
ſhouteth euen as lowd as he can, by wordes and
ſpeech, to bring ſuch back, as wander out of the
right way. <hi>O Shulamite.</hi> No doubt but vnder
this terme, hee meaneth the church: which ſome
thinke ſignifieth, made moſte perfect, thorough
the eternall purpoſe and calling of her, by God
to himſelfe. Me thinketh alſo it may be deriued
of <hi>Salem,</hi> by which name Hieruſalem was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in former time as appeareth. See Pſal. 76.
2. Genſ. 14. 18. Heb. 7. 7. 1. 2. and though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may rather bee ſayde <hi>Schelemite,</hi> than
<hi>Schulamite,</hi> yet it may be of another forme, as
in the ſcripture we reade <hi>Schunanite</hi> of <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem.</hi>
2. King. 4. 8. 12. And the rather I would
referre it to Hieruſalem, becauſe that worde is
often vſed in the ſcripture for the church it ſelf.
<hi>Returne, returne.</hi> This is no vayne repetition,
but profitable to expreſſe Chriſtes earneſtneſſe
and vehement loue twardes the Churche, and
the ſaluation thereof, as alſo to note, howe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20644:96"/>
euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church it ſelfe is reclaimed from ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> muſt haue ſo many &amp; ſo earneſt cals to pul
her back. <hi>That we may behold thee.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaketh
this in his owne name, &amp; the name of his friends
whom he had mentioned verſe. 9. before: for hee
woulde haue them alſo to bee partakers, of the
beauty and glory of the church, this beeing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
alſo according to earthlye cuſtomes, as the
bridegrome hath his friends, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wold make
partakers of the glory of his Bryde, ſo the bryd
hath hers, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe would be glad to haue behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of hir excellency &amp; glorye likewiſe. The
brydes friends may be ſayd to be all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſound par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the church whom ſhee woulde
gladly haue not onely to behold, but to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the maieſtye and magnificence of Chriſt
her head and ſpouſe. The Bridgromes friendes
maye be ſayde to bee the ſame, not that they are
friendes to Chriſte or his churche of nature, but
by grace, whome he would haue to beholde the
infinite riches, and inward beauty of his church,
that they might in the holy loue of the ſame, liue
and dye therein. Others thinke the friendes of
Chriſt to be the holy angels, but me thinketh the
former ſhoulde bee better, becauſe Chriſte ſaith
Iohn. 15. 14. 15. that the faithful are his friends.
<hi>What ſhall you ſee in that Shulamite?</hi> Chriſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his ſpeech vnto his friendes, by aſking of
whom this queſtion, he mindeth not to bewraye
in him ſelfe anye ignoraunce, or doubting of the
great graces, that were to bee founde in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20644:96"/>
Church: but the rather thereby to ſtirre them
vp, to bee faythfull beholders and witneſſes of
that great glorye, which is in the church, and
which hee coulde not otherwiſe expreſſe, but by
a wondrous demaund made of it. See verſe 7.
of this chapter. <hi>Euen as a company of tentes.</hi> It
is an aunſweare to the former queſtion: which
whether Chriſt make or his friendes, we will
not ſtand much vpon, though we rather thincke,
that as Chriſte propounded the queſtion, ſo hee
was beſte able for his ſkill, as beeing beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the graces of the church, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt
alſo for his good will to aunſweare, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie
the ſame. The meaning is to ſet out the
excellent order, glory, and power of the church,
comparing the ſame to a comelye order of pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of tents, &amp; innumerable &amp; inuincible peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the ſame: others turne it as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> company of
Mahanaim: <hi>q. d.</hi> you ſee how glorious the church
it ſelfe is, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which hath beene ſpoken before,
but if you woulde beholde with what a notable
troupe it is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied, you ſhall doe well to cal
to mind that notable number, and that ſame ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
day alſo, wherin the people returning to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
did receiue him with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great ioye &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of
them all, as he did comfortably entertaine them,
and all this was done at Mahanaim, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
2. Samuel. 19. but I leaue it to the godlye
to approue, whether hee liketh and liſteth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:
in truth they both tend to one end.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:20644:97"/>
Chriſt reioyceth at this comming of the church,
nigh vnto him, and his approching to her, euen
as one, tht would ſay to his freend, whome her
hath not ſeen of a long ſeaſon. O howe good and
excellent are theſe feete of thine, that broughte
vs now at the length to the beholding one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
For the phraſe, ſee Iſai. 52. 7. alſo Rom.
10. 15. And heere hee beginneth in a liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to commend the church, in euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
member, euen as a man woulde ſay, from
the ſole of the foote, to the top of the heade. <hi>With
theſe ſhewes,</hi> which thou meaneſt, and which no
doubt Chriſte as a loue-token beſtowed vppon
her. This may be referred, eyther to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the word, or elſe to the ſound affections
of the Church, which are ſometimes ſignified by
<hi>Feete.</hi> as Eccleſ. 4. 17. or to the good workes,
which the thurch is inabled to perform through
Chriſte. <hi>O thou Daughter of the Prince,</hi> That
is, thou moſt noble and excellent Damoſel, who
art as it were ſprong from a moſte famous and
honourable ſtocke: Thus Chriſt compareth the
churche to ſuche, becauſe ſuche eyther are or
ſhoulde bee according to their highe place,
more excellent, then thoſe of more baſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And thus wee ſee, that the Church is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
Chriſte become the Daughter of God
almighty, who gouerneth the whole earth, and
who maketh her famous, noble and glorious, by
the giftes and graces of his holye ſpirite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20644:97"/>
vppon her. <hi>The ioynts of thy thies.</hi> From
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feet he aſcendeth vpward, meaning as it may
appeare by that which followeth, that they
were very cunningly and artificially made. We
muſte imagine heere nothinge but ſpirituall,
namely, that there was &amp; is a moſt cunning fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and making of the whole churche, and
all the partes of the ſame, euery part hauing in
it, comelineſſe, beauty, glorye, ſtrength, Other
turne it thus: <hi>the compaſſing of thy thyes,</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> girdle wherwith ſhe was girded,
which they did vſe to weare in old time, lower
by much then we do, euen vpon their thighes, as
it ſhould ſeeme, Pſal. 45. 3. Or about the Loyns,
as Math. 3. 4. But I thinke that the former (ſo
it bee ſoberly and chaſtly read and regarded,)
is better and commeth neerer to the purpoſe of
Chriſte, who maketh heere as it were a ſpeciall
enumeration or recital of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parts of the church,
<hi>Are like Iewelles,</hi> That is, very fine and coſtly: if
wee reade it as referring it to the girdle, which
in deed Brydes were wont, and are yet accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to weare, very ſumptuous and fine: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
neat and comely, if we referre it to the
thighs, <hi>The worke of the hand of a cunning work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
This is added to note the excellencye:
<hi>q. d.</hi> moſte workmanly or cunninglye made, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20644:98"/>
this of that ſpirituall begettinge of children,
which the churche continuallye bringeth foorth
vnto Chriſte by the miniſtery of the worde, and
working of the ſpirite, but I rather referre it
to the ſtrength, beauty, &amp; comlineſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church
it ſelfe, &amp; the particuler members thereof.</p>

Some vnderſtand hereby the Preachers of the
word, who indeed are aloft in the church, and are
in the ſame inſteed of watch towres, or towres
of defence, they beeing of notable equalitie, and
wonderfull concorde among them ſelues, in
whoſe doctrine alſo, there is nothing but that,
which is vpright and euen, nothing but that
which is well poliſhed, and nothing but that
which is ſweet and pleaſaunt. Some think, that
amongeſt other notable workes which Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
made, he builded a towre of Iuory, and that
hee ſhoulde reſemble the church thereto in this
verſe. But for as much as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtandeth, vppon no
ground of the word, and it ſeemeth in reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
for where ſhoulde men prouide ſo much
iuorye, I rather approoue of the former ſenſe.
<hi>Thine eyes are like the fiſhpooles in Heſhbon, by the
gate of Bathrabbin.</hi> In that he reſembleth the
eyes of the church, to <hi>fiſhpooles,</hi> yea to the the <hi>fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooles</hi>
in Heſhbon, he doth not onely note out the
pleaſauntneſſe of the ſame, as in reſpect of the
colour and beautye, but alſo commendeth them
for the neceſſarye vſe of them, euen as fiſhpondes
or pleaſaunt waters were in thoſe hot and drye
countries. For Heſhbon was a citie beyonde
Iorden, in the country of Sihon king of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites,
wherein Sihon him ſelfe raygned as

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20644:99"/>
and is put downe for the more certaintye of the
thing, I ſuppoſe that thereby hee meanethe the
multitude that ſhoulde repayre to the church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as great numbers came to theſe fiſh pondes,
which yet I am more confirmed in, becauſe hee
vſeth the worde <hi>gate,</hi> alluding no doubt to the
cuſtome vſed in thoſe dayes both of the Iudges
and people, who did ſit in the gates, and repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

places of ſcripture. Others read it otherwiſe,
but for as much as in other places of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and namely verſ. 1, he reſembleth the church
to certaine beautifull places, yea and in the ende
of this verſe alſo he doth the like, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

Lebanon it ſelfe, and therfore the houſe &amp; towre
builded there, lay as it were ouer againſt Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſec,

that he ſpeaketh not of an vncertaine, or of an

By the <hi>noſe,</hi> ſome vnderſtande as before by the

them, noſes, euen after a ſort, to ſmell and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide

And one thing more is to be marked here, that in
theſe commendations &amp; praiſes attributed to the
church, the holy Ghoſt choſe to compare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
her, by ſuche places of the lande of Iuda
and Iſraell, as had ſome excellent and notable

her glorye reſembled by the ſame, the greater:
and therefore alſo we ſhould not thinke them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that euen to this ende likewiſe, he taketh vppon
and laieth out the affections of louers, who choſe
for the expreſſing of their affections, towardes
their louers and friendes, great and excellent
things, as who would ſay, that they are of mind,
that the beauty &amp; good qualities of ſuch as they
affect, can neuer be ſufficientlye commended or

This was the name of a very high mountaine in
Phenicia. Now becauſe that this was moſte
fruitfull (for the worde commonly is taken for a
place full of paſtures, ſet alſo with trees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is lykely too, that this place had his name)
hee doth therefore reſemble the heade of the
Church, (which indeed properly is Chriſte him
ſelfe, Epheſ. 1. 22): or it maye bee heere vſed,
for the graces, wherewith hee hath adorned the
Church, to Carmell: which as it is excellent
for the heyght, ſo are the graces beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20644:101"/>
in great aboundaunce powred foorth vppon the

coſtly and full of maieſty, as that colour is,
but mee thinketh the other ſhould bee more
ſimple, both becauſe Chriſte had compared the
church to places before, and alſo becauſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after hee maketh mention of purple,
which ſome thincke doth not much differ from
ſcarlet, many affirming ſcarlet, to be a kinde of
purple, in which reſpect alſo they reconcile the
Euangeliſtes: Math. Affirming chap. 27. 28.
that they put vpon Chriſt a ſcarlet robe, &amp; Iohn
chap. 19. 2. as alſo Mar. 15. 17. calling it a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

and the church giueth this title of loue to Chriſt
before. chap. 2. 7. <hi>In theſe pleaſures,</hi> vz, reckoned

wholly, and euerye part and peece of her, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all her ornaments and attayres, or what
ſoeuer did generally or particularlye belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

being remoued, it ſtandeth ſtraight again as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For this we know, both by experience and
the wrytinges of authors, that haue vndertaken
to declare the natures of thinges, is the nature
of the palme tree: ſo that in reſembling the ſtate
of the church, to a Palme tree, ſhe meaneth that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20644:102"/>
it is ſtraight and vpright (which alſo is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable

that he meaneth in a word, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the church was of a

Alſo if any liſt to read of the nature of the palme

He meaneth by this ſpeech, that he will bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with his church, whom before verſe 17. he
had reſembled to a palme tree. <hi>I will take holde of
her bowes:</hi> hee meaneth by this ſpeech, that hee
will purge it, and ſo not onelye perceiue, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
notable fruites of her, euen as in Palme
trees the teader braunches, are ſpecially pruned
and trimmed, becauſe that they yeelde flowres
and Buds for fruite. By which it ſhould ſeeme,
they were not ſuch trees as ours are. He that liſt
to read more then this, ouer and beſide all that
which is ſpoken before, let him ſee <hi>Plinie lib. 13.

which we call Dates and of this mind are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,

And by the worde which is turned heere <hi>bowes,</hi>
which properlye ſignifieth the higheſt bowes in
the tree, and is not vſed in any other place of the
old Teſtament but heere, this may yet appeare,
becauſe the palme tree, that the Philoſophers

the fruite it ſelfe groweth. In ſumme, this is
Chriſtes meaning, that ioyning him ſelfe vnto
the church, and beeing preſent with her, he will
doe it to this ende, that hee maye ſee, how they
thriue in the fruites, that is, in the graces and
bleſſings he hath beſtowed vpon them, and that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20644:103"/>
he may gather the ſame, and ſo enioy them, and

of the ſame, becauſe where Chriſt is indeede he
is not in vaine: <hi>q: d.</hi> I will not onely be preſent

the commending of the Wine for the goodneſſe
thereof, tend al the words following, <hi>which goeth
ſtraight to my welbeloued. <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> It is ſuch excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
wine, as I woulde wiſh it, or ſend it euen to the
deareſt and beſt freend I haue, euen to her that
I loue, as my ſelf, if not before my ſelf. <hi>And cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the lips of the ancient to ſpeake.</hi> Another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of the wine. Old folks many times
be dull and heauy of ſpeeche, but this wine hath
ſuche force in it, that it will euen open theire
mouths, and cauſe them vtter a voice as a man
would ſay, whether they will or no. The worde
that is here turned <hi>Ancients,</hi> may alſo in the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue
tong, be deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a worde that ſignifieth
to ſleepe: <hi>q. d.</hi> the wine is ſo ſtrong, that it ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vp the heauy ſenſes, and doth after a ſort as
it were, refreſh the mind, in ſo much that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them that ſleepe to ſpeak. Which manner
of ſpeeche, though, as we reſpect the ſimilitude,
it may ſeeme hiperbolicall, or verye exceſſiue,
yea, more then true, yet if wee reſpect the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
meaning we ſhall finde it is the trueth
it ſelfe: For what is Chriſtes purpoſe heere,
but amongeſt other Graces giuen to the
Churche, to ſhewe, that this is one excellent,
that hee will indue her with ſuche power,
and delightfulneſſe of ſpeeche, (which hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth
by <hi>Roofe of the mouthe,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20644:104"/>
without it nothing canne bee vttered, it beeing
one of the principall inſtrumentes of nature,

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 1. Dothe teache vs that there are
many thinges in the Churche, that may make
vs in an vnfeigned affection to loue and to like
the ſame, as the ſpiritual &amp; inward glory, beauty
and comelines thereof. Yea, it ſheweth vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
Lord hath furniſhed the ſame with maieſtye and
might, not only for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comfort and defence of the
ſound members thereof, but alſo both for the
correcting of ſuch as wold be ſtraying and ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
from that ſame holy fellowſhip, as alſo for
the withſtanding and ouercomming, of ſuch as
wold without aſſault anoy theſame. O the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the riches both of the wiſdome &amp; mercy of
God: of his mercy towards his own ſonnes and
ſeruaunts, and of his wiſdom, in intrapping the
vngodly in his own ſubtilties and force. If the
Churche hadde beene beautifull and amiable
onely, howeſoeuer many of her owne children
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20644:105"/>
might in a reuerent regard of her, haue dutifully
behaued them ſelues towardes her: yet ſome
Nimrodes of the earth, woulde haue ſuppoſed,
with their giantlike force, to haue defloured and
defaced her, but the Lorde hath gratiouſlye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
meanes againſte both extreames, that as
there is in her many thinges to mooue her vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
friendes to loue and like her, ſo there is alſo
many things in her againe, to terrifie either her
counterfeited friendes, or her open and knowne
enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 2. Teacheth vs in Chriſtes example
ſpeaking comfortablie to the church diſtreſſed,
not onely his great loue towards the ſame, who
as a man woulde ſaye, can not endure the heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and griefe thereof, which ought to bee no
ſmall conſolation to the church, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
members therof, ſith he that is both able and
willing to helpe them, doth pity their caſe. (See
Heb. 2. 17. 18): but alſo teacheth vs kindneſſe of
hart, and tendernes of affection, towards the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
for which ſee Rom. 12. 15. 16. yea to vſe
comfortable ſpeeches, towardes thoſe that are
diſtreſſed. See Iſaiah 40. 1. 2. &amp;c. leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
we adding bitterneſſe of wordes to griefe
and anguiſh, eyther of the body, or mind or both,
we doe not onelye adde to their affliction, but to
our owne tranſgreſſion alſo, the Lorde condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vs iuſtly, not onely for hardnes of hart, but
for churliſh wordes alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:20644:105"/>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 3. Teacheth, that the often repetition of
one, &amp; the ſelf ſame thing in the word of God, is
not only idle or ſuperfluous, as ſome curious ears
deeme, but profitable, pleaſaunt, and altogeather
neceſſary, whether we reſpect the Lorde him
ſelf, who therby teſtifieth the wonderful hunger
and thirſt as it were, that he hath of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
while hee doth ſo often vrge it vpon vs, or we
regarde our ſelues, who are not onely heauie to
learne good thinges, but dull and ſlow of hart to
beleeue the ſame, and maruailouſly backewarde
to performe them, or conſider the poſteritye, who
by that meanes are put in minde, of their owne
corruption to good thinges, which alſo maye
mooue them, more and more to fight againſt the
ſame. See for this doctrine, and the proofe
thereof. Phillip. 3. 1. Alſo 2. Pet. 1. 12. where he
ſayth, that though they haue knowledge, and be
eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth, yet hee will not
be negligent, to put them alwayes in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 4. Is no warrant for women, to lay out
their lockes, howſoeuer ſome out of this place,
and ſuch like, haue gone about to iuſtiſie it. Firſt
becauſe that this is to be ſpiritually vnderſtood,
and not in the letter, and therefore they do iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſo to abuſe the word. Secondly, becauſe the
holy Ghoſt hath condemned it in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as 1. Timoth. 2. 9. where he condemneth
broidred hayre: as alſo 1. Pet. 3. 3. where the ſelf
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20644:106"/>
ſame thing is forbidden, but eſpecially 1. Cor.
11. where he will haue a woman eyther to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
or hide her haire, or elſe if ſhee graunte not
that, to yeelde to this, to haue it ſhorn or cut off.
And thirdly, becauſe the manner of laying out
of hayre in thoſe dais, was much more modeſt, or
at leaſte nothing ſo gariſhe, as it is now. And
therefore comparing vnequall thinges toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they muſt learne to conforme them ſelues,
to the ſobrietye and modeſtye of holy matrons,
and ſuche as haue vnfeinedly profeſſed godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. 6. Teacheth vs, that the inward glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and beauty of the church, is highly to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
before all the outward pompe and glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the world whatſoeuer: for the outwarde
thinges, bee not onely tranſitory and vaine, but
many times are baits layde by ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
both to deceiue vs in this life, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
vs in the life to come: whereas the glory of
the church, is not onely pleaſaunt and profitable
for this preſent world, giuing vs directions alſo
howe to walke in the ſame, both towardes God
and men, but an inſtrument and a meane, to
bring vs to the hauen of Heauen, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
bleſſedneſſe at the laſt, Godlineſſe it
ſelfe being profitable vnto all thinges, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the promiſe of the life preſente, and of
that that is to come. 1. Tim. 4. 8. By this alſo
wee maye ſee, that the Church it ſelfe is to be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20644:106"/>
diſcerned, by better eyes then theſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yea, by better iudgemente then the lighte of
reaſon. For if our reaſon not reformed bee ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye
generallye to all religion, why not alſo to
the Churche it ſelfe, the mother and Nurſe of
all ſounde Faythe: and that is it alſo wee ſaye
in the Confeſſion of our fayth, that we beleue
there is a holye Vniverſall Churche, which is
the companye of all Gods elect, which alſo is
ſometymes Viſible, and yet then rather to bee
deſcerned, as in reſpecte of vs, by the eye of a
ſounde Faythe, and yet in reſpect of it ſelfe,
by the holye exerciſes thereof, as the Worde,
Sacramentes, and Diſcipline, than by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitye,
Vniuerſalitye &amp;c, Or anye other
Marke which the Papyſtes canne giue. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
wee learne by the ſame Verſes, that
the LORDE will haue euen the mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
of the People, that ſhall ſubmitte them
ſelues vnto the CHVRCHE, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
extoll and commend the ſame. See Iſaiah.
Chapter 60. Verſe 10. Alſo Chapiter 49.
Verſe 23. Wherein alſo GOD prouideth,
as on the one ſyde for the comforte of his
owne, while hee giueth them Kinges and
Magyſtrates, not onelye to mayntayne them,
but alſo to profeſſe the Truethe togeather,
with them for theire better incouragemente:
So on the other ſyde hee meeteth with the
mallyce of the wicked, who manye tymes
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20644:107"/>
ſpare not to thinke, but to ſpeake alſo, that the
Churche is but the raking of the earth, and the
off-ſcoure of the whole world, which yet appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
falſe by this practiſe of the Lorde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Doth not onelye ſet out the inwarde
glory and beauty of the church, vnder many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
earthly ſimilitudes and compariſons all
which ſhold make vs as it were inamored with
the ſound and holy loue thereof but alſo ſheweth
the glory and excellency of it to be ſo great, that
it cannot wel be either reſembled by any thing
but in part, or expreſſed by wordes but in part.
And therefore we may ſee that they are fowlye
out of the way, that either conceiue baſely of the
church, or ſpeake contemptuouſly of it, as a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of prophane people do, who going no further
then their outward eye, or carnall reaſon, will
leade, do with Eſau preferre baſe and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
things, before the glory and beauty of the
whole earth. See Iſaiah. 62. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. Teacheth vs not only Chriſts great
care towards the church, he dreſſing it and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, as a good huſbande doth his Orchard &amp;
garden, of which our ſauiour himſelfe ſaith, that
the father purgeth euery braunche that beareth
fruite, that ſo it may bring foorth more fruite.
Iohn. 15. 2. By which alſo wee maye ſee,
that the Church without Gods manuring and
huſbanding of it, yeeldeth not, nor bringeth
forth fruite: See 1. Corin. 3. 6. 7. 8. 9: But alſo
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:20644:107"/>
that he will come to viſite the vine, that his own
hand hath planted, and to ſee what fruite it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
Iſaiah. 5. 1. 2. &amp;c. And that therefore the
church had need alwayes to be fruitfull, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe the Lord will certainly come, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he will come ſodainely. See Math. 25. in
the parable of the virgins, and ſpecially verſ. 13.
Alſo Math. 24. verſe. 44: and ſo forwarde to the
end of the chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. Amongſt other thinges, deliuereth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs this doctrine, that in all duties that we are
to performe, whether we reſpect God or men, we
ſhould alwaies do the thinges that we doe, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and cheerefully. The Lord was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the dulneſſe and lumpiſhneſſe of
our hartes, which maketh him ſo often in his
worde to vrge this, and we know amongſt men,
how ſlenderly we regarde thoſe thinges that are
done for vs, yea though they be done for vs, with
an heauie and vnwilling minde, many men wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
that ſuch vnchearefull doers, ſhould rather
ſurceaſe doing, then performe the ſame. But
ſpecially before God, this is a foule fault, as we
maye perceiue by manye places of ſcripture, and
particularly in that the Lorde appointeth a free
will offering by his law. See Leuit. 22. 23. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus.
35. 5. 29. Alſo Exod. 25. 2. Alſo 2. Cor. 8.
3. 12, and many other places where he requireth
cheerefulneſſe of vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. Where Chriſt ſo earneſtlye ſeeketh
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20644:108"/>
the conuerſion of his Churche, and laboureth in
the ſpirite of gentleneſſe, not onely to reclaime,
but alſo to receiue the ſame, after hir error to
fauour, we do not only ſee the great and tender
loue of our Sauioure to penitent ſinners, who
ſayth, <hi>Come vnto me all ye that labour &amp; be
heauy laden, and I will refreſh you,</hi> Math. 11.
28. And who alſo therfore came into the world,
that hee might ſaue ſinners, yea, the cheefeſt of
ſinners. 1. Tim. 1. 15. But alſo he by his owne
example teacheth vs, in the ſpirite of loue, to
reſtore ſuch as are fallen Galath. 6. 1. and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
their conuerſion, vnleſſe they bee hardened
in their iniquities, rather by meekneſſe then by
extremity, and ouer hard handling of them. But
as this belongeth vnto all generally, ſo doth it
particularly concerne the Churche gouernors,
and amongeſt them, eſpeciallye the miniſters,
who of calling and conſcience ought to doe it.
Luke. 15. 4. 1. &amp;c. Alſo Ezech. 34. 4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. Setting out vnto vs the glory, comlines
and ſtrength of the church, teacheth vs, to ioyne
our ſelues in an vnfeined affection, to that holy
body, that is indued with ſuch excellent graces.
For though it be true, that theſe thinges are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the churh, as ſeruing for the ſinguler
prayſe of the ſame, yet the end whereat the holy
ghoſt aimeth, is to draw men by the ſame, euen
inſeperably to be ioined thereto: to which end alſo
tend al the particulers, afterward and reckoned

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. Commending vnto vs the continuall

alſo an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t very effectuall, &amp; as a man wold
ſay, framed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humor of mans nature, to moue
men to loue &amp; like of the church. Nothing many

things then to ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are or ſhal bee left poſt
alone as we ſay, which though it ſhold fall forth,
we ſhold yet labor notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to ouer come y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

we meant, the multitude of the church, or glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
increaſe of the number thereof, to be ſo great
(no though the Lord do extend it, from one ende
of the earth to the other) as though it were able
to match and compare with the wicked, for we
know Gods number to be the leaſt, as appereth
in the generall floud, wherein only eight perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
were reſerued. See for this purpoſe alſo Iſa. 41
14. Math. 7. 13. 14. Luk. 12. 32. By which alſo
we may ſee, that multitude or vniuerſalitye of
perſons, as they ſaye in poperye, is no good,

Firſt, the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the miniſtery, in that
it is reſembled to eyes, fiſhepooles &amp;c. the Lord
by the meanes of them, conuerting men vnto
him ſelfe, and bringing foorth moſte notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes,
both for his owne glorye, and the good of
his ſeruauntes, of which we may read in manye
places of the ſcripture, and particularly. Rom. 1.
14. 15. &amp;c. 2. Cor. 2. 14. 15. &amp;c. Epheſ. 4. 11. 12.
13. 14. So that whoſoeuer they are, that doe not
verye highly eſteeme the ſame, they offer great
diſhonor to almighty God, and tread vnder foot
the meane of their owne ſaluation. Secondly, in
that hee reſembleth the church, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

eſpeciallye, to the towre of Lebanon, that
looketh Damaſcus in the face; we learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:20644:110"/>
that Damaſcus was an vtter enemy to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
people of God. Whereof alſo wee may yeelde
this reaſon, that if the good children of godlye
parents, ſhall not bee aſhamed nor afrayde to
ſpeake to their enemies, either in the gates of
the City, where magiſtrates ſit in iudgement,
or in the gates that enimies do beſiege, of which
Dauid ſpeaketh, Pſal. 127. 5. Much leſſe ſhall

and aboundance of Gods graces beſtowed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the church, is another argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t propounded
by the holy ghoſt, to drawe vs on more and more
to loue the ſame. Al which is put down, not only
for the high &amp; exceeding commendation of the
church of God, as which is indued with al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of louely graces from the Lord: but alſo that
ſo he might win that at our handes, eyther by
ſome one of theſe ſundry reaſons, or by all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ioyntly together, that otherwiſe coulde not bee
gayned of vs. We learn alſo, that not mean men
onely, but euen the mightieſt of the earth, ſhould
make this their ſpeciall crowne and glorye, to
delight in the church of God, yea to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the very ſtones therof, as Gods ſeruants
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20644:110"/>
are ſaid to doe. Pſalme. 102. 14. For what could
it or can it boote them to liue, and not to liue,
as the principall members or at the leaſt ſound
members thereof, ſithe all of them muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.
that without the church there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation?
And the rather they aboue others ſhould
ſtriue hereto, becauſe their examples, are manye
times forcible, to fetch that from men, eyther for
feare or fauour &amp;c. that other mens works can
not winne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. Deliuereth vnto vs this doctrine:
namelye, that the Churche contayneth in it, not
only more glory and beauty, then can bee ſeene
with the outward eie, but than can either be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued
in heart, or expreſſed with mouth. Which
alſo ſhold moue vs vnfeinedly to affect the ſame.
Wherof alſo me thinketh we may yeelde a dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reaſon: the firſt becauſe of the narrowneſſe
and ſtraightneſſe of our owne vnderſtanding,
we being not able ſufficiently, either to thinke
or ſpeak of the leaſt of Gods graces, much leſſe
of the church, vppon whome the Lorde hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
euen the very treaſures of his goodneſſe:
ſecondly, becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellency of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graces the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues, whether we conſider them generallye or
particularly: they beeing as in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
euen of his nature from whom they flow,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, altogether infinite &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible.
<hi>Ver.</hi> 17. Teacheth vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> howſoeuer the church,
both in the whole and in the partes thereof, may

be greatly, by the burthen of afflictions oppreſſed
for the time, that yet notwithſtanding it ſhall
riſe vp againe, doe the wicked what they can.
Which as we know to be truelye performed in
Chriſt our ſauiour the head therof, whom it was
impeſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſorrowes of death ſhold altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hold down. Act. 2. 24: ſo was it alſo verefied
in the Apoſtle, and other beleeuers, who ſayth of

yet not in diſtreſſe, perſecuted, but not forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

which indeed ariſeth in them, from the ſtrength
of Chriſtes ouercomming, we being in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more then conquerors, Roma. 8. 37. Oh
whom would not this comfort and incourage to
ſuffer any thing, yea euery thing, for the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. Teacheth vs, that the greateſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ioy to the church, ſtandeth eſpecially vpon
theſ two points, to wit Chriſtes continuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and his making of the ſame fruitefull, in
the ſeueral duties, that the church is to perform,
to God and men. One of theſe maye not, nor can
not bee ſundred from other: becauſe where
Chriſte is, hee is not there idelly or in vaine,
(though we muſte confeſſe alſo, that the force of
Chriſts grace appeareth not a like at al times,
becauſe it is darkned many times, with the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
&amp; cloudes of our owne corruption) but dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20644:111"/>
in their harts by faith, he maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in all good workes, and inableth them to
comprehend with all ſaints, what is the bredth
and length, and depth and height, that is, all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
as it were of fayth and obedience. See for
this purpoſe Epeſ. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. Doth notably commend vnto vs, the
excellency &amp; gracious effects of the word of god.
Whereof, who ſo liſteth to read, may ſee a large
diſcourſe pſal. 119. And if they ſuppoſe that to be
to tedious, they maye more ſhortly ſee it compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Pſal. 19. verſ. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. which the holye
Ghoſte doth ſo much the more highly extoll, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men are wont to haue it in very ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
&amp; accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſing of it, he doth
not as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (who to win men to the loue &amp; liking
of ſuch things as they propoſe) giue exceſſiue or
vnture commendations thereof, but in all truth
and ſimplicitie, exalteth the ſame: &amp; if he come
ſhort any waye, it is becauſe the Lord is too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in it, not that hee wanteth wordes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the praiſe of it, or that the thing it ſelfe is
not moſt high &amp; excellent, but becauſe hee is for
our weakneſſe ſake contented to ſtoupe downe,
commending it ſo farre foorth, as we are able
thorow his ſpirit to conceiue of it, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Is it not then a pitifull thing, that this
word ſhall receiue ſo great a commendation, and

1 The firſt is, that the church doth generallye
declare her good minde, towardes Chriſte
her Spouſe: and this is contayned in the
firſt verſe.</p>
               <p>2 In the ſecond, (becauſe there are two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
members of this church that is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection

the church of the Iews, doth declare
that ſhee did very earneſtlye wayt for her

manifeſting what great good the comfortable
ſpeeches of Chriſt, mentioned in the other chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
did her, and declaring what aſſurance and
certaine perſwaſion ſhee had of his holy graces
towardes her and in her, and of her conſtauncye
and continuaunce, in all ſounde affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
him. <hi>For his deſire is towardes me,</hi> that is,

and as I belong to none, but to him alone, ſo hee
belongeth to none other but to me onely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I haue amongeſt manye other graces, this as
a ſingular pledge, that he loued me, when I was
his enemy, that when I was ſtraying awaye, he
called me backe, that hee forgaue mee when I
had ſinned, and did continuallye powre his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites

his dealinges in the other chapter) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can not chuſe but loue him, and belong
vnto him alone. So that wee ſee, that the
Church, maketh the teſtimonies and tokens of
Chriſtes fauour, ſure proppes vnto her owne
continuance in good thinges, and obedience of
his holy will.</p>

                  </hi> Here beginneth
the ſecond part of the chapter, in which the
church, but ſpeciallye that of the Iewes (which
in the dayes of Solomon was in flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate)
doth by turning her ſpeech vnto Chriſte,
(whereas in the former verſe he had ſpoken, as it
were to ſome others) ſtirre him vp by common
affection as well as ſhee, to wayt for and obſerue
the time of their holy mariage, and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
in this and the third verſe. Secondlye,
ſhee yeeldeth vp all the good thinges that ſhee

verſe 4. yea euen her ſelfe, for the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

and ſo on forwarde to the ende of the chapter.
So that theſe wordes, <hi>Come my welbeloued,</hi> are
woordes of exhortation, and prouoking as it

Chriſt, more effectually to perſwade the

but let vs both togeather imploye our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

that ſo hauing his continuall preſence and fell<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowſhip,

<hi>Let vs remaine in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illages.</hi> This part of the

                  </hi> that is,
to viſite and looke vpon the vines. The church
ſheweth what commodity ſhe and her ſpouſe ſhal
get, by remayning or lodging all night, in the
country villages, or amongſt the ſweet Cypres
trees, out of the citye, namely that they ſhall bee
ready earelye, to make triall of that, that they
come and look for. <hi>Let vs ſee whether the vine flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe,</hi>
that is, what likelyhood there is, of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
of the time of mariage, for to this ende
tendeth this, and all the ſimilitudes and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
following. <hi>And whether the ſmall grape,</hi> or
as you would ſaye, <hi>The firſt grape:</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
firſte, becauſe of the firſte ſprowting thereof,
and ſmall not onely becauſe of the littlenes, but
alſo becauſe it wareth greater and greater. <hi>Hath
opened it ſelfe,</hi> that is, hath declared it ſelfe vnto
men, that it is now become a grape and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20644:116"/>
which at the firſt appearing of it, or as it
were in the bud, can hardly be diſcerned. <hi>And
whether the Pomgranates flouriſh.</hi> The budding
of this fruite, (wherof alſo there was good ſtore
in thoſe countries) was a ſigne of the ſpring
nowe, and the flouriſhing thereof, as it were of
the ſummer at hand. By all which as hath bene
ſayd before, the church laboureth to come to the
vndoubted ſignes of the daye of her marriage
with Chriſt. I know others otherwiſe expound
it, as though the church ſhould intreat Chriſte,
and ſtirre vp her ſelf, to looke vpon the ſignes of
ſaluation, and Gods grace amongeſt his owne
people, which are manye times compared to
Vines. Indeede I deny not, but that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is Gods vine, and that the bringing foorthe
of flowers and fruites, may well reſemble good
works, and the outward manifeſtation of Gods
graces, wherewith he inwardly adorneth his
Seruauntes, and that they may well bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Pomgranates, which fruite is of it
ſelfe, moſte pleaſaunte and delightfull to the
taſte alſo: but yet me thinketh the former ſenſe
is more playne and ſimple, except wee will
ſaye thus, that the more aboundaunce of good
fruite, that Gods people yeelde and bringe
foorthe the more nighe is the marriage, but
becauſe the perfection and fulneſſe of oure
Fruite, cannot bee in this life, but in the
lyfe to bee reuealed, that therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20644:116"/>
and conſummation of the marriage,
ſhall not be till then. It followeth. <hi>There will I
giue thee my loues,</hi> that is, there will I make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
and open declaration of my vnfained affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towardes thee. And ſhee ſpeaketh of <hi>loues,</hi>
in the plurall number, thereby to ſet out, both
the excellency of the ſame, and the aboundaunce
or plenty thereof likewiſe: which indeed moſte
properly is to bee referred, to the great and laſte
daye, at what time we ſhall not onelye by ſignes
moſt certainly perceiue, that the marriage daye
draweth nigh, but ſhall in moſt perfect loue, bee
moſt perfectly knit, vnto our head and huſbande
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 4. <hi>The mandrakes haue giuen a ſmell.</hi>
                  </hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſpeake anye thing of the ſenſe of this
verſe, we will a little looke vppon the wordes.
The worde that is heere turned <hi>Mandrakes,</hi> is
not vſed in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old teſtament, but onely in this
place, and Geneſ. 30. 14. 15. in which almoſte
all interpretours both Iewes and Chriſtians,
doe turne it <hi>Mandrakes:</hi> but if the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
eyther of that place of Geneſ. or this heere
maye be waighed, it will be found, not to bee ſo
rightlye tranſlated. For the place of Geneſis,
if we weigh Rubens childhood, we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that he was drawen and mooued towards
them, rather by ſome pleaſaunt ſhew, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of them (the Her boriſtes agreeing, that the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20644:117"/>
leaues of the Mandrake, ſpeciallye of the male,
are of a whitiſh greene colour, and the apples of
it fayre, yellow and round) then by any vertue or
ſtrength, he either thoght or knew to be in them.
Beſides that they ſhould not be Mandrakes, me
thinketh there are yet two circumſtances more,
the one taken from the place, where it is ſayde
Reubens flowres did grow, namely in the plain
and open field as it were, wheras they that write
of Mandrakes, affirme that it groweth moſte
gladly, in darke &amp; ſhadowie places: an other is
from the time, vz, that theſe flowres were ripe in
the dayes of wheat harueſt, wheras the Herbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtes
affirme, that Mandrakes can not be ſo
ſoone ripe: whereof alſo this maye bee one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
becauſe they delight in darke and colde pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
we knowing by experience and reaſon, that
thinges growing there, can not be ſo ſoone ripe,
as they that grow abroad, and haue the power of
the ſunne to ſet them forward. Concerning this
place it ſelfe, mee thinketh there is one ſpeciall
reaſon to lead me, why it ſhoulde not bee turned
Mandrakes here: namely becauſe a ſweet ſmel
and ſauour is attributed vnto it, whereas they
that be experienced in Mandrakes, wryte and
affirme, that they haue no good ſent or ſauour at
all. Me thinketh rather, that both in Geneſis,
and in this place, the circumſtances being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidred,
and namely that Rahel was there drawn
to a liking of them, by the ſight of them, rather
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20644:117"/>
than by their vertue: and heere preparation is
made and offered in the ſweeteſt maner that can
bee, to entertayne the Brydegrome, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſhoulde be turned, as Immanuel turneth
it well (<hi>Theſe louely flowers, yeelding a ſauour</hi>) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
by louely flowres, the delight that
for their colour and pleaſaunt ſhew, they offer to
the eye: and by <hi>yeelding a ſauour,</hi> meaning the
ſweet ſent they giue to ſmelling: <hi>q. d.</hi> Chriſte
ſhould haue all ſweet thinges to ſmell to, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt
to looke vpon, prouided for his intertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and yet me thinketh I am more confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in this iudgement, becauſe the word here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
is deriued from a worde, that ſignifieth loue
or to loue. If anye man ſee more, or better, let
him humbly thanke God for it, and laye it out to
the benefite of the church, <hi>And in our gates are all
ſweet thinges.</hi> The word ſignifieth precious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
And when the church ſayth, <hi>They are in the
gates,</hi> ſhe meaneth not onely that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
but alludeth alſo vnto cuſtomes and orders,
obſerued on mariage daies, men beeing went to
ſtraw the houſes, entries, doores, yea and ſtreets
and all, with ſweet ſmelling herbes as we ſee, in
vſe amongſt vs. <hi>New and old. <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> There is great
ſtoore and plentye of them, for this is an vſuall
thing, by theſe termes to expreſſe aboundaunce.
See for the phraſe Math. 13. 52. where Chriſte
affyrmeth that the Scribes which are taught of
God, bring out of their treaſures new and olde
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20644:118"/>
thinges. <hi>I haue kept them foorth.</hi> The church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth,
that as ſhee had carefullye reſerued theſe
thinges againſte the marriage daye, ſo that time
beeing come, ſhe will plentifully powre them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that ſo Chriſt her ſpouſe maye take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the thinges, that ſhee willinglye offereth
for his intertainment. Many miſtically expound
theſe thinges, for the ſweet ſauor that the godly
yeelde in the churche by their good workes, and
holy conuerſation, and I doubt not but it maye
bee ſo taken: how be it I ſuppoſe this to bee the
more ſimple meaning, that the church, alluding
to the outward maner of men in worldly marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
doth meane thereby, the great preparation
that both ſhe had in former tymes, and preſently
made againſt the marriage day, and would then
plentifully powre the ſame abroad, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
manifeſtation of her vnfayned loue towardes
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 5. <hi>Oh that ſome would giue thee.</hi>
                  </hi> The church
hauing ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe had made
for the marriage daye, beginneth to declare the
earneſt affection ſhee had towardes Chriſte, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
(as many doe in the earneſtneſſe of their
minde, ſpecially when they eyther feel the want
of good thinges, or are moued with the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
thereof) that ſhee might continuallye enioye
him, as a moſte faithfull friend. Now in that
ſhee mencioneth none, to whome ſhee powreth
foorth this wiſhe, ſhee meaneth not that euerye
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20644:118"/>
one could graunt this, or that ſhee did at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures
ſpeake it, but knowing that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in God to graunt the ſame, ſhee doth vnder
this exclamation or wiſh, expreſſe the feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
ſhe had to haue this performed vnto her. See
Iere. 9. 1. <hi>To be as a brother vnto me,</hi> that is, moſt
faithfull, friendlye and louing, ſee Geneſ. 13. 8.
Alſo Pſal. 133. 1. <hi>That ſucked the breaſtes of my
mother.</hi> She is not contented onely to haue him
as a brother, but as a moſt naturall &amp; kinde bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe many times it falleth out, that bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
alſo are at great iarres, thorow the neglect
or forgetfulnes of thoſe bondes, wherewith they
ſhould be tyed moſt ſtraitly together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe wiſheth
that ſhe might finde Chriſt, as louing towardes
her, and as continual with her, as one moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and kindharted brother is to &amp; with another,
that ſo ſhe might both continually, and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
alſo, enioye his loue &amp; comfortable both
preſence and ſpeech. <hi>Though I found thee in the
ſtreet,</hi> that is, in ſo open and publicke place as it
were. See Luk. 14. 21. <hi>I would kiſſe thee,</hi> that
is, I woulde neither be aſhamed nor afrayde, to
performe the dutyes of a holye loue, and ſound
good will towardes thee. See chapter 1. verſe
2. Alſo Luke 15. 20. <hi>Neither would they despiſe
me,</hi> vz, that knew what it meant, otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
there might be miſiudging. We know it is
an immodeſt and vnſeemly thing, to kiſſe women
and maydes openly, as many do: but if thou wert
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20644:119"/>
my brother (as though ſhe ſhoulde ſaye) no bodye
would diſlike me for it, though I did it openlye,
becauſe of a holy affection I carry towards thee.
So here we ſee, that as ſhee propoſed her wiſhe
and deſire, ſo here ſhee beginneth to ſhew, what
ſhe would do, if that might be graunted, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in reckoning vp of other thinges that ſhee
ment to performe, meaning onelye heere, that in
the performance of thoſe holy dutyes, ſhee would
ſet feare and ſhame aſide, and not regarde the
ſcornes and reproches, wherwith the wicked are
wont to exerciſe her, and will ſtill exerciſe her,
till the mariage day indeed come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 6. <hi>I woulde lead thee, I woulde bring thee.</hi>
                  </hi>
Shee doubleth the worde as it were, to note not
onely the ioyfulneſſe of her hart, to thinke vppon
this (which if it were ſo delitfull now, that ſhee
coulde not tell with what wordes to expreſſe it,
what would it be then, beeing performed in full
meaſure) but alſo the certaine purpoſe, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſhee had to execute the ſame, binding her
ſelfe by the means of this maner of ſpeech, more
ſtraightly to the performaunce thereof. <hi>Into the
houſe of my mother.</hi> Shee alludeth no doubt to
the cuſtome in thoſe dayes, which was to bring
the Bryde and the Brydegrome alſo into the
houſes of eyther of their parents: ſee chap. 3. 4.
and Geneſ. 24. 97. where Izhac is ſayde to haue
brought Ribkah, into the tent of Sarah his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And no doubt but here vnder the name of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20644:119"/>
                  <hi>mother,</hi> the whole vniuerſal church, which riſing
vp togeather into one body, ſhall in good time as
a pure virgin, be preſented glorious, and vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chriſt. See 2. Cor. 11. 2. Ephe. 5. 27. For
the better vnderſtanding of this point, we muſte
well weigh two thinges: the firſt is, the maner
of the Hebrues in their ſpeech, which vſe to call
ſome whole thing or body, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of father or
mother, and the partes deryued from the ſame,
by the names of ſonnes or daughters, whereof
alſo there is ſome reaſon, becauſe as children be
as it were chippes hewen from their parentes,
ſo are other things, when they are diſioyned one
of them from an other. The ſecond is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
that wee muſte haue of the church,
which in the holye ſcripture, is to bee conſidered
after two ſortes, to wit, either generallye or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.
The church generall or vniuerſall, is
likewiſe to be conſidered after two ſortes. For
ſometimes there is contayned, vnder the name
or word of the church, Chriſt with all his elect
people, which therefore by reaſon of the ſtreight
and narrow coniunction, that is betweene him
and them, is alſo called the Brydegromes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as ver. 9. of this chapter: and in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
alſo, the church is called his ſiſter chapter
4. 9. and alſo chapter 8. 1. Sometimes vnder
the ſame word, there is ſignified the elect onely,
as in this place, and before in this booke. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
3. 4. alſo chapter. 6. 6. and ſuch like. Where
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:20644:120"/>
we muſt marke, that the very ſelfe ſame diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſte bee obſerued in the new Teſtament
alſo, where the church, conſidered together with
her heade Chriſt, is called Chriſt. 1. Cor. 12. 12
Eph. 3. 4. that is to ſaye miſticall Chriſt, as the
Fathers were wont to ſay, or Chriſt in a miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye:
but when wee conſider the church, ſeuered
from Chriſte, then it is called Chriſtes church,
or his bodye. Now concerning the particular
conſideration of the church, or the regarding of
it in ſome part, it is to be waighed, either as it
is diſtinguiſhed by occaſion of times or of place.
In reſpect of times, it is diſtinguiſhed thus,
that one part is called the old Church, and that
is it which was before Chriſtes comming: the
other is named the new, and that is that which
hath beene reuealed ſince Chriſte was manfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in the fleſhe, he caſting downe the partition
wall, and making of the olde and the newe, but
one ſheepfold. See Epheſ. 2. 14. 15, &amp;c. Alſo
Iohn. 10. 16. In reſpect of place, thus: the
Church of Ieruſalem, the Church of Antioch:
the Church of Corinthe, of Rome, &amp;c. Now
which way ſoeuer wee conſider it, as in parte, it
is indeed Chriſtes Siſter, euen as if it were
the Daughter of one and the ſelfe ſame mother.
But all this is performed and brought to paſſe,
thorow the election of God, <hi>Which teacheth me,</hi>
vz, all godlyneſſe, and euerye good thing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20644:120"/>
in my duetyes towardes thee, and how
to intreat thee, and behaue my ſelfe towardes
thee, in all ſuch thinges, as maye pleaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
thee. <hi>I woulde cauſe thee to drincke ſpiced
Wine,</hi> Shee meaneth ſuch Wine or Wines,
as we call Ipocras, which beſides the nature
and ſtrength of the Wine it ſelfe, hath by the
compoſition and confection of menne, mingling
manye Spices with the ſame, great power in
it, and pleaſauntneſſe alſo by the ſmell of the
Spices, that as the heart is ſtrengthened, and
warmed thereby, ſo the ſent might bee ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
with the pleaſaunt ſmell thereof. <hi>Yea
ſweete Wine made of my Pomegranate.</hi> The
worde turned heere <hi>ſweet Wine,</hi> ſignifyeth muſte
or newe Wine, yea generallye all moyſture,
which eyther by expreſſing or treading, is fet
from anye fruite: For it is deriued of a worde,
that ſignyfieth to expreſſe or tread downe, but
becauſe hee addeth Pomegranates, we maye
ſee that he meaneth ſpeciallye the mayſture,
iuyce or liquor, that is or maye bee wronge
from them. In a worde, ſhee meaneth that
if ſhee might indeede bee partaker of him and
his graces, ſhee woulde moſte comfortablye
and ioyfullye intertayne and receiue him. For
vnder theſe metaphors, taken and borrowed
from an earthly banquet, ſhee meaneth nothing
els, but the ſpirituall intertainement of him.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20644:121"/>
Some thinke theſe to bee the wordes of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh
ſynagogue, wiſhing for Chriſtes comming
and manifeſtation in the fleſh, and promſing a
meruellous intertainment of him: but I extend
it more largely, that it ſhould be the voyce both
of the olde and new Churche, wiſhing the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
coniunction of Chriſt her ſpouſe with her,
that ſo ſhee might neuer bee pulled from him,
which indeede ſhall bee fully performed in the
life that is to come, but yet ſo farre foorth, as it
is lawful, ſhee deſireth to haue it perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in this life, that ſo they maye neuer bee
ſundred one of them from another, that in that
holye coniunction alſo wherein ſhee cleaueth
whollye and altogether, to CHRISTE
her heade and ſpouſe, ſhee maye freelye and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
ſerue God, without the feare of tyrantes,
or the infamy and ſlaunder of worldly men. See
Luke. 1. 74. Neither is this to be taken, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that which was ſayde before in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
of this chapter, touching the church of the
Iewes, becauſe that the verification of it in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is no hinderaunce, to haue it verified likewiſe in
the church of the Gentiles, and ſo by conſequent
alſo in the whole bodye of the Churche, and ſo
muſt we vnderſtand that, which is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the next chapter: namely that look what
the Gentiles were vnto the Iewes, in as much
as the Iewes were called befor them, the ſame
are they that are of the Churche, and are not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20644:121"/>
yet called as in reſpect of them, that are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
called, but of this matter, more in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the next chapter.</p>

As before ſhe had ſet out how ſhe would receiue
and entertayne him: ſo now for the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her ſelfe in the aſſured perſwaſion of his
vnfayned loue towardes her, ſhee ſheweth howe
he woulde comfort her, namely that for her eaſe,
he woulde put his left hande vnder her heade, as
men commonly do, to ſicke and infirme perſons.
<hi>And his right hande ſhoulde imbrace me,</hi> vz, moſte
comfortably and louingly as deareſt friendes do

before chap. 2. 6. there beeing no other difference
but this, namelye that there ſhee affyrmeth the
thing in preſent action, and heere by waighing
the earneſt loue of Chriſt towardes her, ſhe ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vp her hope, aſſuring her ſelfe, that if ſhee
may enioye his comfortable and continuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
it ſhall be done indeed.</p>

not carried away with a fond affection, thinking
that it will be good for you and him, that hee

                  </hi> The church going about to
declare the loue ſhee carried towardes her head,
and huſbande Chriſte, both in this verſe, and in
the firſt part of it, by the way of a demand, ſpeak
of her ſelf: and in the latter part, taking vpon her
the perſon of Chriſt, ſhe ſheweth what great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhe had receiued from him. <hi>That commeth out
of the wildernes,</hi> vz, of this wide worlde, and her
owne corruption. <hi>Leaning vpon her welbeloued.</hi>
She vſeth this ſpeech, not onely to note her loue
towardes him, men vſing to leane vppon them
whom they like. See 2. King. 5. 18. but alſo to
ſet out the ſtrength and comfort ſhee had from
him, without whome by reaſon of their owne
weakeneſſe, ſhe had neuer beene able to get out
of the wilderneſſe: and all this is ſpoken by the
way of compariſon: <hi>q. d.</hi> was there euer anye
Bryde, that tooke ſuch great paines, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
ſo many dangers, for the obtayning of him
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20644:122"/>
whom ſhe loued? Take therefore theſe thinges
following, as aſſured teſtimonies, and pledges
of my vnfayned good will, namelye that I haue
laboured to laye aſide the olde man, denying my
ſelfe, &amp; the whole world alſo, which ſomtimes in
ſcripture, is called a wilderneſſe. Iſay. 4. 3. and
by fayth haue ouercome all difficulties, that ſo I
might at the length come to the heauenly houſe.
Hebr. 12. 22. Neither ſpeaketh ſhee this as
boaſting of her ſelfe, for ſhe confeſſeth that ſhee
was fayne to leane vppon Chriſte, and he as it
were to vphold and vnderproppe her in all good
thinges. Yea and by the wordes following
ſhee ſheweth that ſhee had the beginninges: by
laying both which togeather we maye ſet, that
ſhee gyueth all vnto him, euen as the Apoſtle
doth. Phillip. 2. 13. ſhee beeing but the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods power and goodneſſe in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formaunce
of the ſame. <hi>Vnder the apple tree Irai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thee vp,</hi> that is gaue thee life, and being, euen
as men that are in a heauye ſleepe, and are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
waked, ſeeme to be rayſed vp from death
to lyfe. And by the <hi>Apple tree,</hi> he meaneth here
not onely Ieruſalem, from whence the Lorde
brought foorth a people vnto him ſelfe, but euen
all the places of the worlde, in which it pleaſed
God to beget and bring forth a people vnto him
ſelf: all which and euery one of which, may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be compared vnto an Apple tree, not onelye
becauſe vnder the ſhadowe thereof, there is
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20644:123"/>
comfort and refreſhing, but alſo becauſe that the
good, profitable, and plentifull fruit of that tree,
may very aptly reſemble, the good workes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obedience, that the faithfull yeeld to the Lord,
in which reſpect alſo the Prophet calleth them,
the trees of righteouſneſſe. Iſaiah. 61. 3. <hi>There
thy mother conceiued thee.</hi> How and in whatſenſe,
the church is called a mother. See verſ. 6. of this
chapter. <hi>There ſhe conceiued thee that bare thee.</hi> A
deſcription of a mother, and this is repeated, not
as a vaine word, but to ſhew that the church, can
not bring forth ſpirituall children to God, but
with as much both paine and daunger, if not
farre greater, than earthly and worldly mothers
bring foorth theirs.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> As thogh
the church ſhould ſay. Seeing thorow thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſtrength, I haue vndertaken and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
all theſe labours and toyles to attyre
thee, I beſeech thee, let me not be caſt off, or loſe
my labour, but let the remembraunce and loue
of me, take a deepe impreſſion in thee, yea euen
in thy hart and minde. <hi>And as a ſignet vpon thine
arme,</hi> that is, let mee bee as deare and precious
vnto thee, as the ſignet that thou carryeſt about
thee: which how precious it was, and highlye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed,
may appeare, in that Zerubbabell, hath
a promiſe made him, that the Lorde will make
him as a ſignet. Hagg. 2. 24. and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

were as the ſignet of Gods right hande, yet the
Lord woulde plucke him from thence. Iere. 22.
24. The ſumme is, that it is a requeſt full of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and earneſtneſſe, which the church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vnto Chriſt. <hi>q. d.</hi> Seeing I haue yeelded
thorow thy goodneſſe ſuch teſtimonies and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of an vnfaygned heart and loue, I beſeech
thee againe on the other ſide, to carry me conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
in thy mind to haue mee alwayes in thy
ſight, and in thy handes, euen as men weare iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
about their neckes, and vpon their breaſtes,
and put ringes, ſpecially their ſignets and ſeales
vppon their fingers, both to haue them alwayes
in a readineſſe, and to ſhew the ſpeciall account
they make of them. <hi>For loue is ſtrong as death,</hi> that
is, the loue that I carry to thee, is moſt earneſt,
vehement and mightye, and will ouercome all
thinges, ſo it maye bee partaker of thee, euen as
death it ſelfe. Others expound it thus, that ſhee
had rather chuſe death, than want him that ſhee
loued: but the former ſenſe is moſte plaine and
ſimple in my minde, ſhe vſing this &amp; the wordes
following, as reaſons to perſwade him to loue
hir againe, and to continue with her for euer,
ſeeing ſhe had ſo earneſtly ſet her minde and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
vpon him. <hi>Iealouſie is hard as the graue.</hi>
By <hi>iealouſie,</hi> ſhee meaneth not an ill humor of
ſuſpition, but the ardencye and feruencye of her
loue towardes him, who coulde not abyde as it
were, that he ſhould loue any but her. For iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20644:124"/>
of it ſelfe is not euill (ſpeciallye ſeeing
the Lorde ſayeth hee is iealouſe ouer vs. Exod.
20. 5. But when it is carryed into the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitye
of a ſuſpicious minde. And when he ſaith,
<hi>It is hard as the graue,</hi> ſhe meaneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it wil not be
conquered no more then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> graue which as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth
all bodyes caſt into it, whereof alſo it
hath the name: ſo doth ſhe deuour all difficulties
&amp; diſtreſſes, that might hinder her from her loue.
<hi>The coales whereof are coales of fire.</hi> Shee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
her vnfayned loue to an other thinge,
namelye to fire, not onelye becauſe it warmeth
and maketh hotte, but alſo becauſe it kindleth
and increaſeth, yea and is the meane to conſume
and purge, the church meaning by this, that the
fire of vnfayned loue in her hearte towardes
him, ſhoulde not onelye be euerye daye more
and more increaſed, and ſhyne foorth as
light vnto others, but alſo conſume all cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
corruptions, that might hinder her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towardes him, euen as fire ſhould licke
vp ſtraw or ſtubble before it: and that is the
reaſon alſo, why ſhee addeth, <hi>And as a flame
from the Lorde,</hi> or as it is in the Hebrue, <hi>a flame
of the Lorde,</hi> meaning by that a moſt excellent
fire, for the Scripture is wont to aſcribe great
and excellent thinges to God, as Pſalme 36. 6.
<hi>Thy righteouſneſſe is like the mountaynes of
God:</hi> Others take it as a flame of fire ſent
foorth from the Lorde, to deſtroye the wicked:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:20644:124"/>
but no doubt ſhee meaneth to magnifie the
greatnes of it, as which God, by the moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
light of his ſpirite, doth not onelye begin in
thoſe that bee his, but alſo ſo kindle and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
that it endureth euen for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Many waters can not quench this loue.</hi>
                  </hi>
Shee proceedeth in ſetting foorth the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of her affections towardes Chriſte: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſith her loue was as a mighty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
fire within it, it coulde not bee put out,
but with manye troubles, afflictions and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.
It is an vſuall thing in the Worde,
to compare both the troubles of the godlye, and
the troublers of them alſo, to Waters, ſee for
this purpoſe Pſalme. 69. 1. Alſo Reuel. 17.
15. <hi>Neyther can the Flowdes ouerflowe it.</hi> Thogh
ſhee meane the ſame thinge in other wordes
yet it is no vain repetition: for it is as much, as
if ſhee ſhoulde ſaye, no perſecution, no not the
greateſt, ſhould preuayle vppon mee, to quenche
out or drowne vp my loue towardes mee. And
that the worde <hi>Floudes</hi> is ſo vſed in manye pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſcripture maye appeare, by Pſalme
124. 5. 5. Alſo Math. 7. 25. 27. By which hee
meaneth as the apoſtle ſayth, that neyther try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
nor anguiſh, nor perſecution, nor famin
nor nakednes, nor peril nor ſword, ſhall ſeparate
vs from the loue of Chriſte, as Romans 8. 35.
<hi>If a man woulde giue all the ſubſtance of his
houſe for this Loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:20644:125"/>
Shee meaneth that though a man woulde giue
al that he had, either to buy this loue of her, or to
get it from her, it were nothing, it were but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
loſt, and therefore ſhee addeth, <hi>In contemning
they would contemne him,</hi> that is, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
contemne him, and all that he offered to,
making no account neither of him, though hee
were neuer ſo great, nor of the thing offered,
though it were neuer ſo precious. For this the
maner of the Hebrue tongue, when they highlye
praiſe, to duble the word, and when they greatly
diſpraiſe, to duble the word likewiſe. See chap.
1. verſ. 1. In ſumme, this is it that ſhe meaneth
by this verſe, namelye to declare, that her loue
was ſo firme and faſt to him, that it could not be
rent or pulled from him to anye other, either by
anye force, or by anye fraud, or by any flattery, or
fayre promiſes, which are not onelye the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
but the onely way alſo, that the Deuill and
his inſtruments vſe, to pull men away, from the
loue and obedience of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. Teacheth the whole church, and euery
particular member of the ſame, to be thorowly
aſſured and perſwaded of Gods election, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
fauour towardes them for euer and euer.
For if it be true in the whole, as againſt which
the gates of hell ſhall neuer preuaile, why ſhould
it not be true, in euery part and peece of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame.
The knowledge whereof, is not onelye comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the dayes of a diſtreſſed conſcience, we
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:20644:125"/>
hauing nothing ſo ſtrong to leane vppon, as the
mightye foundation of God, which remayneth
ſure, hauing Gods ſeale ſet vpon it: but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to beat back, that point of Popery, which
teacheth men to doubt of their ſaluation &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce
in good thinges, euen vnto the ende.
Neither ſtandeth the ſtrength and ſtaye of this
perſwaſion vpon our ſelues, for then how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhould we forgoe it, ſith our firſt parents kept
not their excellent eſtate, in the time of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
nor vpon any good thing either within vs, or
without vs, for all our righteouſnes before God,
is as a filthye and ſtayned cloath, but vppon the
vnchaungeable nature and purpoſe of the Lorde
our God, as alſo vppon thoſe infallible and ſure
notes that he hath giuen vs of his fauour, in
which reſpect alſo we ſee, that the church heere
vpholdeth her ſelf, becauſe ſhe was aſſured of his
ſound and vnmooueable affection towardes her.
Indeed if we looke into our ſelues, and into our
great ſins and manifold vnwoorthines, who can
then finde any hope, either of ſaluation, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good grace? but if we will feele and beholde
this, we muſte caſt our cogitation from our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and by the eye of faith, regarde the Lorde in
his eternall loue and mercye, chuſing vs alſo in
Chriſte his ſonne, and that vnto eternall life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundations of the world were layde. As
for that which is obiected by Papiſtes againſte
his truth, namely that it fauoureth of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:20644:126"/>
is moſt falſe, not only becauſe we renounce
all thinges in our ſelues, and diſclaime from the
ſame, both in whole and in part, but alſo we
cleaue vnto God in the truth of his promiſe, in
not abuſing his mercye, nor turning his loue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wantonneſſe, but making them more forcible
meanes, to holde vs alwayes in the awe of a
good conſcience, and ſtrength of fayth towards
him. And if anye doctrine, ſauor of pride, and
be intollerablie preſumptuous it is that of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
which teacheth men to truſt in the vertue
and goodneſſe of the thinges they haue perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as auaileable and ſufficient, not onelye for
them ſelues, but for others alſo: and yet we may
ſee the iuſte iudgement of God further vppon
them, not onely while that they them ſelues are
iuſtly tainted with that cryme, which vniuſtlye
they caſt vpon others, but while they are founde
faulty in croſſing their owne aſſertions: for how
can that doctrine of doubting which is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in their wrytinges, and mayntained in their
Schooles, ſtande with the matter of mens mery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and deſeruing: becauſe if there bee deſert,
and that not only of congruitie, but of condigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and worthines as they ſaye in their ſchooles,
yea and that there be works of ſupererogation
alſo, what need they to feare clayming onelye of
fauour, but of that they haue deſerued. But
this we ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lorde hath ſo ſtriken them
with the ſpirite of giddineſſe, that as they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:20644:126"/>
ſwarue from the truth, ſo they agree not with
them ſelues. As for vs, we doe ſo according to
truth and godlineſſe, remooue doubting from
men, that we eſtabliſhe no preſumption before
God, but rather teach them ſtayedneſſe, and
ſtrength of perſwaſion, and that not ſtandinge
vpon them ſelues, but vppon God, the author of
all certainty and truth, and vpon that infallible
verity of his will, which he hath reuealed in his
word. For which ſee Iohn 13. 1. Alſo Iohn. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 2. Teacheth vs, in the ſpirite of all holy
loue, to exhorte and prouooke one an other, and
that by all the argumentes and reaſons we can,
to the perfourmaunce of good and holye duties.
Wherevnto that we may be the better drawen:
it ſhall be good for vs to conſider, that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
is not onelye ſanctified vnto vs in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of good people, but alſo by the verye
commaundement of God in his worde, and by
that duty of charity which is layde vppon vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
other, as towardes our ſelues, we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
their ſaluation by all meanes poſſible
and lawfull: and if there bee anye other reaſon
or reaſons beſides theſe rehearſed, to vſe them al
alſo, as knowinge that all is little inough, both
by reaſon of our owne corruption, as alſo by the
peruerſneſſe of them, that wee are to deale
with. See for this: Leuiticus. 19. 17. Math.
18. 16. Coloſſians 3. 16. Heb. 3. 13. Secondlye,
we learne by that verſe, not onelye with ſpeed
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:20644:127"/>
and earneſtnes to purſue good thinges, but euen
as a man would ſay, to preuent the time. It is
ſtraunge to ſee, the quickneſſe and liuelineſſe of
men, about atchieuing of worldlye thinges, how
they toyle and moyle very ſore, and breake their
ſleepes as we ſay, and how dull and heauie they
be in and about ſpirituall and heauenly thinges.
No doubt but this carefulnes in the one, which
are matters of nothing in compariſon, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe
in and about the chiefeſt thinges, ſhall
not onely make them voyd of excuſe before men,
but pull vppon them more heauye iudgement, in
the lyfe that is to come, in ſo much as they haue
beene buſilieſt occupyed about ſuch thinges, as
they them ſelues know to haue no durablenes,
and haue neglected others, of whoſe perpetuity,
they could not chuſe but be perſwaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. Teacheth the whole church, and euery
particular member thereof, euen with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to looke for, and hearty deſire to wiſhe. the
glorious appering of the ſonne of God, for the
perfecting of that betrothing &amp; mariage, which
is begunne betweene him and vs. We ſay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tymes in the Lordes prayer, <hi>Thy kingdome
come,</hi> but who ſpeaketh it, eyther with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
or a feeling heart? By an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
heart, I meane one, that conceiueth
and perceiueth the true ſenſe and naturall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that petition. By a feeling heart I
meane ſuch a one, as in an earneſt deſire that hee
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:20644:127"/>
hath of eternall glorye, or of holye loue, that hee
hath to al wel doing, &amp; to ceaſe from ſin, wiſheth
euen the glorious appearing of our Lord Ieſus,
and the ending of the dayes of theſe miſeries. It
is lamentable to conſider, that neither the glory
of God, nor the loue of our owne ſaluation, nor
the ending of our miſeries, nor the attayning of
vnſpeakable ioyes, nor the practize of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
can bring vs on vnto the performance of
this duty, but as though we were glewed to this
world, in a perpetuall obliuion of eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe,
or as though the cordes of our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
were ſtronger, than all the graces of
God, or examples of good men, ſo we ſpend the
dayes of our pilgrimage here, and are very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo to ende them, to the hazarding of our owne
ſoules. See 2. Cor. 5. 1. 2. &amp;c. Alſo Phillip. 1. 23.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. Teacheth vs, euen carefully to imploy
all that we haue to the entertainment &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of Chriſt. And therefore looke what graces
ſoeuer God hath beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
the continuaunce and increaſe of the ſame
in vs: for they alone, are the thinges that make
Chriſte to take delight to come vnto vs, and to
dwell with vs. See Reuel. 3. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 5. Teacheth vs, in heartye ſort and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
alwayes to intreat the Lorde for the feeling
of his wonderfull fauour and rich mercye. No
doubt, but if we vſed this meane of prayer often
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:20644:128"/>
times &amp; earneſtly, drawing nigh alſo vnto the
Lord in the faith of his promiſes, for he that wil
come to God, muſt beleue that God is, &amp; that he
is a rewarder of them that ſeeke him Heb. 11. 6.
and in vnfayned repentaunce for our former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
for God heareth not them that continue in
ſinne. Iohn. 9. 31. See alſo Prouerb. 15. 8.
and Prouerb. 28. 9. no doubt I ſaye, but if we
perfourmed theſe dutyes as before, God that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
liberallye to all men, and reprocheth none.
Iames. 1. 5. woulde giue vs his ſonne Chriſte,
&amp; together with him all good things alſo. Rom
8. 32. yea euen his holy ſpirite. Luke 11. 13. to
lead vs into all truth and weldoing. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
we ſhould be ſtirred vp, as well by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
ſenſe and feeling of our preſent wants
both bodely and ſpirituall, as alſo by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencye
of the graces to be found in God, which
reacheth not onelye to this preſent life and
worlde, but to that alſo which is to bee reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the ſonnes and ſeruauntes of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we maye learne out of that verſe, for no
ſhame in our ſelues, nor yet for no miſiudging
or euil ſpeech of the wicked, to neglect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formaunce
of any dutye, that may teſtifie either
our loue, or obedience towardes Chriſte: for if
we will doe ſo, we ſhall not finde the want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
lettes in our ſelues, nor lacke ſtumbling
blockes caſt in our wayes by the wicked to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vs therein, but we muſte by honour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:20644:128"/>
by euill report and good report, yea in all
thinges approoue our ſelues, as the ſeruauntes
of God. 2. Cor. 6. 48. vnto God and men, and
doe as our Sauiour him ſelfe hath done before
vs, that is, for the ioye that was ſet before him,
he hath indured the croſſe, and deſpiſed the
ſame, and is ſet downe at the right hande of the
throane of God, that ſo wee conſidering him
that indured ſuch ſpeaking againſte of ſinners,
maye learne not to bee wearied and faint in our
mindes. Heb. 13. 2. 3. aſſuring our ſelues that
if we ſuffer anye thing with him, or for him, we

Timoth. 2. 12. for the perfourmaunce of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinges, touching our owne pleaſures or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitees,
yea that though ſometimes they bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
we neither are aſhamed nor afrayde of
men, and why ſhoulde we bee ſo in the doing
of ſpirituall dutyes, and that to our God? It
is worthye the noting, that manye that will
not bluſh at any thing before men, will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to performe holye duties to God, either of
Prayer, confeſſion of faith, Catechiſing or ſuch
like: and on the other ſide manye afrayde to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

Let theſe latter people make much of this work
of the ſpirite in them, and labour to increaſe in
the ſame before God and man, that it maye bee a
notable and continuall pledge vnto their fayth:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:20644:129"/>
but let the other feare and tremble, who haue a
dubble note of great vngodlineſſe in them, the
one that they are not aſhamed of euill before
God and man: the other that they are aſhamed
of good dutyes, in the preſence of God &amp; man:
and let them labour the amendment of it, or els
it will goe hard with them both before God and

to eſteeme the Church, becauſe there is in

furniſh vs in the execution of our duties both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
God and men, and to make vs able in al
ſweet and delicate ſort, to entertayne the Lorde
of life, to his glorye and our eternall comfort
The prophane and worldly people, cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
behold theſe thinges, becauſe they looke no
further, than the eye of fleſh and bloud directeth
them, or the line of their owne reaſon, will lead
them: they onelye the eyes of whoſe vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
God hath opened by his worde and ſpirite,
perceiue theſe excellent miſteries, for it is the
ſpirituall man that diſcerneth all thinges, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the deepe thinges of God. 1. Cor. 2. 10. 15.
which is not onely true in the miſteries of faith
and religion, but euen in diſcrying and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the church of God alſo: for if a man haue
no beter loades man, than the light of his owne
witte, it is more likely that he ſhall imbrace the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:20644:129"/>
ſynagogue of Sathan, by reaſon of the outward
glory, and glittering of it, inſteed of the church,
than the Lordes church indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. Teacheth vs, that we can neuer haue
ſpirituall eaſe, nor ſpirituall comfort, till we be
aſſured of, and doe effectuallye feele Chriſte and
his merites, and doe plentifullye taſte of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
kindneſſe and fauour of God towardes vs
in him. They that are diſtreſſed in body &amp; ſoule,
and looke for reſte and conſolation elſe where,
than in him, we may perceiue by this, are fouly
deceiued, as they alſo that haue their onely ioye,
felicity and contentment in the outwarde, either
pleaſures or profites of this life. Notably ſayth
Dauid, Pſalm 4. 6. <hi>Many ſay who will ſhew vs
any good? But Lorde lift thou vp the light of
thy countenaunce vpon vs. Thou haſt gyuen
me more ioy of hart, than they haue had, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. Teacheth vs, not onelye to haue care
and conſcience in our ſelues, to do nothing to the
annoyaunce or diſpleaſing of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Chriſte: but alſo to labour what we can,
that others doe not diſquiet him. By which we
maye ſee, that the loue and care we carrye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
him, ſhoulde not bee contayned within
the compaſſe of our owne boſome, but bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:20644:130"/>

wel to, but further and aduance to the vttermoſt
of our poore powers, the ſaluation of other men.
Secondly, we may learne to beware of preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
any thing or time to the Lord, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it argueth intollerable preſumption and

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may hinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that excellent race,
caſting away euery thing that preſſeth downe,
and the ſinne that hangeth faſt on. Hebrewes
12, mortyfiyng the old man continually, with
the luſtes and concupiſcences of the ſame, that
ſo Chriſt may take delight and pleaſure to dwel
in vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer graces we haue, either
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:20644:130"/>
outward, or inward we haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
by chriſt: who is not only the mean to conuey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ouer vnto vs, but to continue, increaſe &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the ſame in vs, <hi>for in him are hid all the
treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge:</hi> Col. 2. 3
<hi>And of his fulneſſe haue wee receiued euen
grace for grace.</hi> Ioh. 1. 16. So that we may ſee
heereby, that not onely preuenting grace (as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
ſay) is his, but euen all graces ſubſequent
or following the ſame. <hi>For what haue we that
we haue not receiued.</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 7? Speciallye
ſith we are not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to think a good thought.
2. Cor. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Verſe. 10. <hi>Teacheth vs, that the thing wee
ſhould eſteeme moſt precious, yea pray and wiſh
for, is the aſſured feeling of Gods fauoure and
loue towardes vs in Chriſt. Of this ſome thing
hath bin ſaid before. verſ. 7. of this chapter: And
this is that alſo which our ſauiour ſpeaketh in
Luke vnto his diſciples: Chapter.</hi> 10. 20. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
not in this, that the ſpirits are ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto you, but rather reioyce becauſe your
names are written in heauen. <hi>Ieremy alſo
ſpeaketh excellentlye of it chap.</hi> 9, 23. 24. Let
not the wiſeman glory in his wiſedome, nor
the ſtronge man in his ſtrength &amp;c: but
let him that gloryeth, glorye in this that
he vnderſtandeth and knoweth me ſayth the
Lord: For I am the lorde which ſhew mercye,
iudgement, and righteouſneſſe in the earth:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20644:131"/>
for in theſe things I delight. <hi>See alſo 1. Cor.
1. 31. Alſo 2: Cor. 10. 27. Secondly that our
loue to the Lord, ſhoulde be no colde affection, or
ſome meane meaſure of a good minde, but that
it ſhould be feruent, earneſt, continuall, and as
a man woulde ſay fyery to conſume all lets ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
within vs, or without vs, that might hinder
vs from expreſſing the ſound affection that wee
carrye towardes the Lorde Jeſus. This
doth Chriſte notably expreſſe by ſundrye parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
Math. 10. 37. 38. But yet more plainlye
in Luke chap. 14. 26. When he ſayth,</hi> He that
hateth not his father and mother, &amp; wife &amp;
children, brethren &amp; ſiſters, yea, and his own
life alſo, cannot be his diſciple, <hi>but moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in the abridgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law. Luk.</hi> 10. 27
Thou ſhalt loue the lorde thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with
all thy ſtrength, and with all thy thoght, <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that al that we haue both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ſhoulde bee imployed in and about, the
vnfained loue of Gods maieſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. Teacheth vs, that no feare or flattery
of the aduerſaries, ſhould cauſe vs to fal from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
holy loue that wee carry and ought alwayes to
carry to Chriſt our head and ſauiour. It is the
nature of the wicked to aſſay, by fawning and
fauour offered, to fetch that from vs, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
perhaps they could not get from vs, What
ſoeuer they do, we muſt be reſolute, being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20644:131"/>
of this, that as we will holde and defend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the Lordes vndoubted truth, ſo wee
will againe in nothing feare our aduerſaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that all that they doe, or can do againſt vs,
is to them a ſure token of deſtruction, but to vs
a pledge of ſaluation and life euerlaſting, and
that from God. Philip. 1. 28. Notable for
the ouercomming of this aſſault, are the wordes
of the Apoſtle Paule, in the latter end of the
eight to the Romans. <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate vs
from the loue of Chriſt? Shall tribulation or
anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or perrill or ſwoord? As it is written: for
thy ſake are we killed all daye long, we are
counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
in all theſe things, we are more then
conquerours, thorow him that loued vs:
for I am perſwaded that neither death nor
life, nor Aungels, nor principalities, nor pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nor thinges preſent nor thinges to come,
nor height nor depth, nor any other creature
ſhall bee able to ſeparate vs from the loue of
God, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> Rom.
8. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. In which wordes and
names, ver. 35. 36. 37. the Apoſtle ſheweth, that
no terror of the wicked, ſhould cauſe him, or the
reſt of the faithfull, to fall awaye from a ſound
minde towardes Chriſt, and in the other verſes,
vz, 38. 39. hee declareth that no ſhew of good
things offered beeing either preſent or to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſhould pull vs from, or ſhould pul from vs, either
that loue, wherewith God in his ſonne Chriſte,
hath loued vs, or wherewith we in ſome meaſure
of a ſound mind, do affect and loue him. Oh that
men woulde duely regarde theſe thinges, that ſo
they might come indeed, not onelye to the faith
and feeling of the ſame, but alſo to the ſound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and performaunce thereof, that so God
might receiue glory at their handes, their owne
ſoules might be ſaued in the daye of Chriſte, and
other men be builded vp by their examples to do
the like.</p>

Iewes, hauing before made
mention of her unfayned loue
towardes Chriſte, as we maye
perceiue by the latter end of the
other chapter, doth now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the ſound affection that ſhe carrieth towards

ſhe taketh wonderfull care, for the inlargement

but alſo after a ſort wiſhing the calling of
the church of the Gentiles, yea making as you
would ſay large and great offers, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of the ſame. Which though indeed it
did at that time moſt properlye belong vnto the
people of the Iewes, who in thoſe dayes were in
outwarde profeſſion the onelye people of God, it

with the reſte, in that ſpirituall warfare, that
they are to vnder-goe in this life. And this I
woulde haue to bee marked as good, profitable,
and neceſſary, both for the ſenſe and doctrines of
this chapter, ſpeciallye for the three firſt verſes
of it, that we maye not be conſtrayned hereafter,
to repeat the ſame againe.</p>
               <p>This chapter conſiſteth of three partes, or
doth eſpeciallye propounde vnto vs three
thinges. The firſt point is as it were, a
conſultation of the old Church, with her
head and huſbande Chriſt, concerning the
choſing and calling of the Gentiles, into
the ſelfe ſame ſtate and condition of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:20644:134"/>
grace &amp; fauor with her: &amp; this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the three firſt ver of this chapter.</p>
               <p>2 The ſecond thing is, a notable manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; declaration, of the ſound affection of our
ſauiour Chriſt towardes the whole church
conſiſting both of Iewes &amp; Gentiles, or of
all nations as you would ſaye, this beeing
ſet out vnto vs, not onely by commending
the church, but by commending it, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with Solomons vineyard, yea by
preferring it before the ſame, &amp; by ſtirring
vp the ſayde church, to the holye duetye of
praiſing him, from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he did not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affect her, he would not deſire that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
ver. 4. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>3 The third thing is an earneſt requeſt or prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that the church beeing moued with the
loue of hir huſbande, &amp; care to obey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
maketh vnto him for his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinual

lead her &amp; to guid her, into all truth &amp; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
and this is contained in the 7. and

or nouriſh children, and euen ſo was it with the
Gentiles: for neyther were they fit for Chriſte,
and to receiue or imbrace the Lorde, becauſe
they wanted that yeeres and ripeneſſe, that the
Lord had appointed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ſelf for them, as alſo
the meanes wherby they ſhould haue come to it,
for vnto the Iews, and not vnto them then, was
the adoption, the glory, the couenauntes, and the
ſeruice of God committed, Rom. 9. 4. If any
man wil ſay, there were diuerſe of them called,
I anſwere that that was as a man woulde ſay,
but the addition of one day, or ſome ſmall time,
to a naturall life, in reſpect of the fulneſſe of the
age that they grew too afterwardes in Chriſte.
See Epheſ. 4. 13. <hi>What ſhall we doe for our ſiſter.</hi>
The Church and Chriſt are brought in here, as
it were a man and a wife, or a brother and a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
debating what were beſt to bee done, with
their yongeſt children or kinred, and which way
they might moſt labour their preferment. Wee
know by the practize of the world, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
godly, but naturall brethren and ſiſters, will
vſe all the means y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they can, for the preferment
and good beſtowing of ſuche of their kinred, as

and vnder figures, the reſolution of Chriſt
and his churche, what they will doe, and what
waye they will take, when the fulneſſe of the
gentiles ſhall come in. And heere they are
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:20644:136"/>
brought in, as men conſulting and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe,
to place and to plant great ſtore of people,
and fearing that the roomes they haue prepared,
or the city that they haue appoynted, will not be
large inough to contein and hold them, they ſay
thus: if the olde walles be to be razed and pulled
downe, and newe, to incloſe a larger circuite of
ground, for the intertainment of our friends, be
to be erected and ſet vp, let vs do it. <hi>We will build
in it a pallace of ſiluer: <hi>q. d.</hi>
                  </hi> we will not onelye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
our wals for their ſakes, prouiding by that
meanes things neceſſary &amp; fit for them, but that
they may know they ſhal be indeed moſt hartely
welcome vnto vs, they ſhall perceiue that as we
our ſelues will ſpare no paines or coſt, for their
holy intertainment, ſo they ſhal haue al thinges
that may indeed be delightful vnto them. And
all this is donne to drawe on the Church of the
Gentiles with willingnes and ſpeed to come to
the Lorde. Siluer is a precious thing as we
know, and much ſet by amongeſt men, but when
they ſhall haue it in ſuch plenty, that pallaces as
a man woulde ſaye, ſhall be built with the ſame,
that is ſtrong and mighty to draw. And that is
the reaſon, why vnder ſuch earthlye thinges of
great delight, the Lorde ſetteth out ſpirituall
matters. See before chapter 6, 14. of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory
Tower. Alſo Reuel. 21. in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heauenlye Ieruſalem. <hi>And if the

they muſt haue, is to be ſtrengthened. <hi>We will
fence it about,</hi> that is, make it ſtrong and mighty

as Writers affirm: for the durableneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
ſee 2. Sam. 7. 2. 7. &amp;c. The meaning is, that
if they feare any thing to hinder their entrance,
or ſtande in doubte when they are entred, of
ſome annoyaunce from abroade, they ſhall not
need either to fear or doubt, either the one or the

to the Churche, ſo it is not without cauſe,
that hee mencioneth both Walles and Gates,
notinge indeede thereby, that Gods fauoure
to his Folcke ſhall bee all in all to them,
more ſafelye defending them, then in the

of this Verſe is, that at what time the Church
of the Gentiles ſhall bee called in (whiche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede

Boundes of the Citye of <hi>IERVSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEM,</hi>
euen as the Prophettes them ſelues
Propheſied and foreſhewed, of which you
maye reade Iſaiah. 49. 20, And Zechariah
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:20644:137"/>
24. not within the boundes of Iudea it ſelfe,
that then they ſhall bee conſtrained by reaſon of
ſuch infinite number, yea that they will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to, rather then the Gentiles ſhoulde bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
to bring in a new forme, and order as it
were of a city, yea to pul downe the old walles,
and to ſet vp newe walles and newe gates for
the inlargement thereof, for by the terms <hi>walles</hi>
and <hi>gates,</hi> there is by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> that
is a parte or partes put for the whole, meante

The olde churche hauinge before declared her
good minde, towardes the churche of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
doth not ſo ſtay therein, that ſhee neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
her ſelfe: but ſheweth that howſoeuer ſhee
hath receiued as yet more graces from GOD,
then the poore churche of the gentlles had, that
yet notwithſtanding there was muche to bee
added vnto her beauty and ſtrength, which alſo
ſhe did look ſhould be perfourmed to her, euen
by the vocation of the gentiles: and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:20644:137"/>
her alſo to adde, <hi>And my breaſtes like to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,</hi>
that is fayre and comely, by which allo ſhe
noteth, that thogh ſhee were then to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the churche of the gentiles, which as
was ſayde before, had no Breaſtes, and ſhee
had ſome, yet there ſhoulde bee an increaſe ſtill
of that comlineſſe and ſtrength. <hi>Then ſhall I bee
in his eyes,</hi> that is, in the iudgemente and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte
of Chriſte, For becauſe that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
of the eye, is in moſte thinges certayne,
and it is a notable inſtrumente to conueyghe
to our vnderſtanding the trueth and certainty
of thinges, ſhe putteth therefore the eye for
the Iudgemente that Chriſte ſhall haue of
her. <hi>As one that findeth peace,</hi> that is, very deare
and precious, and full of delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For euen as that man, that hath liued in
long and greate diſquietneſſe, ſeeking notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
for peace, and finding it at the length,
hath obtayned his heartes delighte and ioy,
yea, that whiche hee preferreth before all
that hee hadde: ſo was it and ſhoulde it bee
with the Churche. All in effect is as muche,
as if the Churche ſhoulde ſaye: when a greate
companye of the gentiles beeing ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with mee, ſhall growe vp togeather with
them, and they with mee, and ſo wee both
make but one Citye, I ſhall not bee farre
from that ſame quietneſſe of Spirite and
bleſſedneſſe, for whiche I trauayle ſo ſore now.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:20644:138"/>
I do in deed perſwade my ſelfe now, that I am
not onely entring therinto, but haue made ſome
good proceedinges therein, howbeit the time of
my perfection and full ſtrength therein, is not
yet come. Nigh it is in deede I confeſſe, but
when the time ſhall come, that I ſhall by the
glorious appearing of my ſpouſe Chriſte, bee
taken vp into the perfect communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe
of peace, then ſhall the marriage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
bee thorowly finiſhed, and that is it, which
in ſo manie places of ſcripture, is called the laſt
daie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe. 4. <hi>Shelomoh hath a vine in Baulha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
                  </hi>
Heere beginneth the Second part of this
Chapter, which is Chriſts ſpeach to the Church
Wheerin he doth propound two ſpeciall things.
Firſt by comparing it to a vine, yea to a moſte
excellent vine, hee ſheweth how deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
the Churche it ſelfe is vnto him ver. 4. 5.
Secondly, hee prouoketh and ſtirreth her vp, to
publiſhe his praiſe, and the great graces that
bee in him, verſe 6. Concerning the wordes.
The vine is commended in this verſe, firſt by
the perſon of the owner, to wit Solomon, whoe
if euer any man liuing, might haue moſte excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
thinges, hee aboue others (as a man would
ſaye) might haue them, both for the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
aboundaunce of his wealth, as alſo for the
excellencye of his wytte. Secondlye, it is
commended for the ſituation or place wherein
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20644:138"/>
it was, vz. <hi>Baalhamon:</hi> whiche if wee take as
the proper name of a place, as ſome of the
Hebrewe writers doe, and particularlye Alen
Ezra: no doubt but it was famous, not onelye
for good Vyneyardes, but alſo for greate
ſtore of the ſame, from whiche alſo as it ſhould
ſeeme, it tooke the name: for <hi>Hamon</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
a multitude: and if <hi>Baal</hi> maye bee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
as <hi>Rabbi Shelomoh</hi> thinketh it maye,
namelye to ſignifye a playne: to whiche ende
hee aleadgeth Ioſhua 12. 7. Of <hi>Baalgad,</hi>
then no doubte but it was ſo muche the more
plentifull, becauſe playnes and Vale coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes,
are moſte commonlye accounted moſte
Fruitefull. But if wee take it as a Nowne
appellatiue as wee ſaye, or common, and turne
it as ſome doe, and as alſo the Worde maye
well beare it in the Lorde, of the multitude
to witte of Wyne, meaning thereby as ſome
alſo doe render it, in a fruitefull place, the
ſenſe and meaning commeth all to one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
that the Vyne is commended for the
fruitefulneſſe of the place wherein it grewe.
<hi>Hee gaue the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine it ſelfe vnto thee keepers,</hi>
That is, hee lette it foorthe to hyre, or for a
Rente, to ſuche as ſhoulde keepe, Dreſſe,
prime, cut and trimme the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man,</hi> That is euery one of thoſe, that
hired it, or all they togeather, for ſo haue
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20644:139"/>
you this word vſed in ſundry places of ſcripture.
ſee 1. Cor. 11. 28. <hi>Bringeth for the fruit therof,</hi> vz,
that hee hath reaped &amp; receiued from the ſame, or
for the rent thereof as we ſay. <hi>A thouſand pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſiluer,</hi> that is a verye great ſumme, for hee
putteth a number certaine for an vncertaine:
ſome read ſickles, meaning no doubt common
ſickles which was halfe as much as the ſickles
of the ſanctuarye, and did amount as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to the valew of our twenty pence. He that
luſteth to ſee or read more of this matter, maye
view the moſt learned annotations of M. Beza.
vpon Math. 17. 28. whatſoeuer it be this is the
third commendation attributed to the Vine,
namely that it was hyred or let for a very great
rent, which alſo is an argument of the great
fruitfulnes therof: and in this verſe is contained
the firſt part of the compariſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 5. <hi>My vineyard which is mine.</hi>
                  </hi> He begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
here to put downe the ſecond part of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
namely to ſhew how much Chriſts vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
which is his Church, differeth from Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
euen as much as Chriſte who is greater
then Solomon. Mat. 12. 42. differeth from him,
and as much as ſpirituall thinges exceed bode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And this difference is not onely noted in the
word <hi>my vineyard,</hi> but alſo in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Which is mine.</hi> Chriſt by dubling the words,
nothing both the excellency and the certaintye of
it, as we haue ſundrye tymes declared hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20644:139"/>
                  <hi>q. d.</hi> It is an excellent vineyard, euen as I
my ſelfe, and belongeth to none other but to me
alone: no man ſhal ſucceed me in this, becauſe he
is the eternal Lord &amp; heyre of all things. Heb. 1.
2. and therefore of the church alſo. <hi>Is before my
face,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, I do continually looke vppon it, &amp; haue
an eye ouer it, or watch ouer it alwaies for good,
noting not onelye his perpetuall preſence, in his
church by this phraſe, of which ſee Math. 28. 19.
but his continuall dreſſing and pruning of the
ſame (as the huſbandmen do vineyards) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may
bring foorth more fruit. See Iohn. 15. 2. And
this is the ſecond thing for which Chriſtes vine
is preferred before Solomons, namelye becauſe
he is inforced to put ouer his, to the labour and
dreſſing of other men: but Chriſte doth as it
were, with his owne handes, prune and keepe
his owne. <hi>To thee O Shelamoh a thouſand,</hi> vz, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſiluer or common ſickles doe in right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne,
as a rent belonging to thee. <hi>And two
hundred,</hi> vz, peeces of ſiluer or ſickles, for all this
muſt be repeated out of the fourth verſe. <hi>To
them that keepe the fruite thereof,</hi> that is, to them
that labour to dreſſe it and make it fruitful. And
al this is ſpoken by the way of conceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<hi>q. d.</hi> I yeeld to this that thy vineyarde is
worth a thouſand ſickles a yeare, yea I conſent
to more than that, that the laborers in it, and
the dreſſers of it, are worthy for their paynes, to
haue ouer and beſides two hundreth peeces of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:20644:140"/>
ſiluer, and yet for all that this vine of mine ſhall
far exceede the ſame, in the reſpects aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
To be ſhort: The force of this reaſon, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from compariſon or the argument it ſelfe,
is this much in effect. King Solomon himſelfe
not for all his wit &amp; wealth, though hee haue a
moſt fruitful vine, and ſuch a one as yeeldeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and good ſtore of wine, can not prune it,
and dreſſe it himſelfe, or receiue the whole fruit
of the ſame, but is faine to let it out vnto others
to dreſſe (and this is the ſumme and meaning of
the forth verſ) but as for I my ſelf (ſaith Chriſt)
I haue a far more excellent and fruitfull vine,
hauing many branches in it, (and euery branch
bearing many cluſters of graps) than Solomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
hath grapes, as a man would ſay: yea ſuch care
and loue do I my ſelfe carrie to this, as that I
will not let it out to others to dreſſe it, nor ſuffer
any thing of it to bee taken from me (which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
can not chuſe but graunt to the dreſſers
of his vyneyarde) becauſe I am alwaies preſent
with it and haue myne eye ouer it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually for
good. And yet the truth and worthineſſe of this
compariſon may the better appeare, if wee will
well looke, either into the perſons, or the things
compared. Solomon muſt of neceſſity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that he was a man and weake, haue others
to labour for him, and to dreſſe the vyneyarde to
his vſe: but Chriſt as the eternall God &amp; head
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:20644:140"/>
of his church needeth none of thoſe aydes: for
though he vſe men as his Miniſters, that is
not done ſo muche to derogate from his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
who canne without their helpes worke the
ſaluation of his elect, as for theire weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſake, hee ſpeaking vnto them in perſons
like to themſelues, that ſo they mighte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare as it were, imbrace the truethe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they that laboure in Solomons Vyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde,
muſt becauſe it was worldlye, bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed
with a worldely wages, and eate as
you would ſay, parte of that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they trauelled
for: but neyther CHRISTE nor his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
if wee ſhoulde ſpeake of them (but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
wee are not ſo muche to weighe that
in this place) eateth anye bodelye thinge that
commeth from the Churche, but hee giueth
them all their laboure, and receyueth as a
man woulde ſaye, nothinge in compariſon
from them agayne. If any man liſt to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
this further, hee maye, ſo bee keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
alwayes, within the compaſſe of the
place, and the Analogye or Proportion of
fayth.</p>

                  </hi> After
that CHRISTE had extolled the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencye

hauing care, both ouer the whole,
and ouer euery particular one, and pruning and
dreſſing them with a ſingular affection towards
them, as appeareth by the particular churches
mentioned. Reuel. 1. 2. 3. chapters. <hi>The compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
harkening to thy voyce, cauſed me to heare,</hi> So
it is word for worde in the Hebrue text: but the
meaning is, make me knowne by ſetting abroad
my prayſes to ſuch as are thy companions and

                  </hi> The third
part of the chapter, wherein howſoeuer the word
<hi>flying,</hi> maye ſeeme to inſynuate, as though the
church wiſhed the remoouing of Chriſt: yet doth
ſhee rather thereby note, the ſpeedye approch of
Chriſte towardes her, euen as they that goe to
thinges they take delight in, doe runne rather
than goe, or as we would ſay flye. <hi>And be like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the roe, or to the young hart.</hi> To the end that ſhe
may the better expreſſe the ſpeede or ſwiftneſſe,
that ſhee woulde haue Chriſt to vſe in comming
towardes her, ſhee vſeth this dubble ſymilitude.
For the ſwiftnes of theſe creatures, ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
is written. Pſalm. 18. 33. To which ende alſo
tendeth the worde <hi>young,</hi> becauſe they are farre
more luſtye and freſhe than when they grow to
greater yeares. <hi>Vpon the mountaynes of ſpices.</hi> If
we referre this as ſome doe, to the roe, &amp; young
hart, then it meaneth moſte pleaſaunt hilles or
mountaynes: but if wee referre it to Chriſte, as
indeed I take that to be the moſte true ſenſe. <hi>q.

there by thouſandes of degrees, then there is or

with all kindes of moſt precious &amp; ſweet things.
In ſumme, this is the meaning of this verſe,
that the church imbracing Chriſtes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,

abroade of his name: and knowing how harde a
thing it is to perfourme that duetye, as well by

of action indeed, the holy Ghoſt doth adde to
the former care and affection, as a notable note
to diſcerne, who are in truth ſoundly affected to
Gods glory, &amp; the furtherance &amp; floriſhing of his
church. Youſhal haue many will by words, make
a goodly ſhew of a ready minde, and if it goe no
further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeech, none more forward than they
but when it commeth to iuſtifie their woords by
their deedes, then men ſhall finde them, (and
therefore much more the Lorde) to be miſerable
ſtinckers away and ſtarters aſide. If S. Iohn
ſaye, that whoſoeuer hath this worldes goodes,
and ſeeth his brother haue need and yet ſhutteth
vp his compaſſion from him, hath not the loue
of God dwelling in him. Iohn. 3. 17. how much
more may we ſafely conclude, that he is vtterly
vayde of a ſound mind to God and men alſo, that
will hazard either the ſouls of men, or the while
church, for the ſparing of his owne pelfe? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the queſtion is not now, of the body onely,
or of one particular perſon, but of the ſoule alſo,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:20644:143"/>
yea the ſoules of manye for whome Chriſte hath
dyed, and the ſtate of the church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. Teacheth vs, ſo to performe the duties
preſcribed in the former verſes, that is in care &amp;
conſcience, to aduaunce and promote the good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of the whole church, &amp; the ſaluation of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular member thereof, that we do not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in curiouſnes towards other. or in carleſnes
towards our ſelues neglect Gods graces offred
and beſtowed vppon vs. No doubt, but the holye
Ghoſt, was well acquainted, both with mans
corruption, and ſatans malice towardes him: all
which tend, as in all other things, ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, to bring vs, to two dangerous and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
extremes. If he can not cauſe vs in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe
towardes other men, to neglect our
ſelues then he will labour, by care for our ſelues,
to neglect our brethren and to make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them. But we ſee a right raſe or courſe
deliuered vs here, according to which if we ſaile
no doubt, but we ſhall eſcape, thoſe ſame feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
dangerous and deadly gulfes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. Teacheth vs, that Princes and mighty
men of the earth, may well and lawfully haue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as it were the beſt thinges of the worlde or
land wherin they dwell, which alſo me thinketh
may appeare by this, that the Lord hath aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them, to the higheſt and beſt place amongeſt
men, and therefore good reaſon that they ſhould
haue all thinges in, in ſome meaſure of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:20644:144"/>
anſwering to their ſtates and callinges. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
prouided y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they come not by it by iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meanes or oppreſſion, as Ahab did, by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths
vineyard. 1. King. 21: or vſe it as a mean,
to grow either in pride or forgetfulnes towards
God, as Nebuchadnezzer did. Iſaiah. 14. 12. 13
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27</note> a thing alſo which god hath forbidden, Deut.
6. 12: or in preſumption and tyrannye ouer the
people. Deut. 17. 20. but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they refer it to Gods
glorye, the giuer thereof, the good of his people,
for whoſe ſake God beſtoweth it vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the
ſaluation of their owne ſoules, in the ſanctified
vſe thereof, they beeing led therby, as it were by
the hand, to heauen and heauenly thinges, ſith it
pleaſeth the Lorde by ſuch to reſemble vnto vs,
ſpirituall and heauenly graces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. Containing an excellent deſcription of
the church, and the continual care of Chriſt ouer
it, doth teach vs two profitable leſſons: the firſt
that we ſhold continually loue the church, which
is ſo excellent, that howſoeuer earthly things be
vſed to expreſſe the ſame, yet no one thing, nor al
the thinges together of the earth can ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſemble it, or paint it out vnto vs: the reaſon
is, becauſe worldly thinges are earthlye onelye,
and ſubiect vnto our humaine ſenſes: but the
Church is ſpirituall, and to bee diſcerned by
fayth: for howſoeuer it be vpon the earth, yet it
is not earthlye, and though it be viſible, yet not
ſo much viſible to the outwarde eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:20644:144"/>
(though that may be a meane many times
to direct vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches aſſembly)
as to the eye of faith, which muſt indeed diſcern
it euen as in reſpect of the outwarde markes, to
wit, the pure preaching of the worde, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
adminiſtration of the ſacramentes, and the
faithful executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſts holy diſciplin: which
though they be outward, yet are they ſpiritual,
and muſt be alſo ſpiritually diſcerned or known.
The ſecond, that we ſhould always labor to ioin
our ſelues to it, and neuer to fear the faces or for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
of the wicked y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perſecute the ſame, becauſe
Chriſte continuallye watcheth ouer it for good:
who we know is greater then all, who alſo hath
made vs ſuch promiſes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gates of hell, ſhall
not preuayl againſt it: Mat. 16. 18. &amp; therfore no
reaſon but we ſhould be incouraged: for if ſatan
with all his helliſh power, cannot preuail, what
ſhall the wicked of the earth do, who are not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo mighty in power, or ſo many in number,
or ſo deepe in ſubtilty, or any way, no not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce
matchable wich them, though I doubt not,
but the hatred and cruelty of the wicked, is furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as the fire to conſume, and outragious as the
hel or graue to eat vp all, if they coulde haue it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. Teacheth vs by al meanes poſſible to
extoll and prayſe Chriſt, and to endeuour, euen
to our vttermoſte, to haue his trueth knowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the people and nations of the world,
if it were poſſible. The perfourmaunce of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:20644:145"/>
which duety is not only acceptable before God,
who hath commaunded the ſame, but is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the churche, as who by that meanes is
brought to the creator and father thereof, yea is
comfortable to our ſelues while we feele therby
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are ſound members of that holy body, both
in that wee our ſelues growe vp in the ſame, and
wold gladly haue others to do the like. In what
miſerable taking then are they, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either haue
no care at all to pull on men to Chriſte, or elſe
diſcourage them, from drawing nigh vnto him,
by ſetting before them affliction, perſecutions,
&amp;c. Or elſe peruert them, infecting and poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their ſouls, with falſe doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 7 Teacheth vs many good leſſons. Firſt
it ſetteth out the weaknes of man, yea and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ſort of men which are ranged into the church, &amp;
therefore haue regeneration begun in them, to
accompliſhe and performe the good thinges of
God. Which is not onelye profitable for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of the Pelagians and free wil men, but
alſo forcible, to beat down, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> high conceit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee
carry, of our owne wits, willes, and ſtrength: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which ſee Geneſ. 6. 5. Pſal. 14. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c.
Ioh. 15. 5. Rom. 7. 18. &amp;c. 2. Cor. 3. 5. Phi. 2. 13.
Secondly it ſheweth vs what wee ſhoulde do in
theſe wants, namely run vnto God, by earneſt &amp;
heartye prayers: for our better incouragement,
wherein we haue Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, by which
we know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that duty performed in faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:20644:145"/>
is acceptable before him, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
alſo, by which wee are aſſured that if wee
belieue we ſhal haue our petitions granted. See
Iames 1, 5. 6. But alaſſe what do wee in theſe
caſes, either wee pray very faintly, and forſake
not our ſinnes, or elſe we neglect prayer altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; ſeek ſome odde worldly ſhifts, or elſe run
ragingly to ſome one miſcheef or another, and ſo
ad drunkenneſſe vnto thirſt, and ſinne vnto ſin,
to the great diſpleaſure of almightye God, and
wounding of our own ſouls. Thirdly, that thogh
we liue in this life, and praye for Gods graces
neceſſary to paſſe our pilgrimage to his glory, &amp;
our comfort: that yet we muſt always remember
eternall life, and to ſaye, Thy kingdome come.
For we haue not here an abiding citye, but look
for a building that is eternall in the heauens. 2.
Cor. 5. 1. And that not ſo much for any worldlye
greefe that we endure here, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hauing al tears
wiped from our eyes, wee may not only ceaſe to
ſin, but alſo be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually occupied in weldoing,
&amp; made partakers of eternall bleſſedneſſe, with
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reſt of the beleeuers in heauen, whither Chriſt
is gone before to prepare a place for vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where
he is as the head there might we be as the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
which the Lorde bring to paſſe, and that
with ſpeede, according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
euen for his crucified
Chriſts ſake. So
be it.</p>
