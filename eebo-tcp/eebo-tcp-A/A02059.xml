            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Then the children of Ioſeph ſpake vnto Ioſhua, ſaying, why haſt thou giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me but one lot, and one portion to inherite, ſeeing I am a great people?</p>
                  <p>Ioſhua then anſwered, if thou beeſt much people, get thee vp to the wood, and cut trees for thy ſelfe in the land of the Perizzites, &amp; of the Giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</p>
                  <p>Then the children of Ioſeph ſaid, the Mountaine will not be inough for vs, and all the Canaanites that dwell in the low countrey, haue Charcts of Iron as well as they in Bethſhean, and in the townes of the ſame, as they in the valley of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>And Ioſhua ſpake vnto the houſe of Ioſeph, to Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, and Manaſſes, ſaying, Thou art a great people, and haſt great power, and ſhalt not haue one lot.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Mountain ſhal be thine, for it is a wood, and thou ſhalt cut it downe, and the endes of it ſhall be thine, &amp; thou ſhalt caſt out the Canaanites thogh they haue Iron Charets, and though they be ſtrong.</p>

Yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the fatherly prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; large bountie of God towards man, ſo improuident and irreſpectiue is man, that he had rather liue like a drone, and féede vppon the fruites of other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, wherunto God hath not entituled him, then looke

out and flie abroad, like the Bée to gather the pleaſures and riches of the earth, which God hath giuen him to enioy: whece vpon it comes to paſſe, that although the Lord hath giuen the earth to the children of men, yet this earth which is mans fee-ſimple by deede of gift fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, is the greater part of it poſſeſſed &amp; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vſurped by wild beaſts, and vnreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by brutiſh ſauages, which by reaſon of their godles ignorance, &amp; blaſphemous Idolatrie, are worſe then thoſe beaſts which are of moſt wilde &amp; ſauage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As <hi>Ahab</hi> therfore ſometimes ſaid to his ſeruants, 1. <hi>King. 22. 13. Know ye not that Ramoth Gilead was ours, and we ſtay &amp; take it not out of the hands of the King of Aram?</hi> So may man ſay to himſelfe: The earth was mine, God gaue it me, and my poſteritie, by the name of the children of men, and yet I ſtay &amp; take it not out of the hands of beaſts, and brutiſh ſauages, which haue no intereſt in it, becauſe they participate rather of the nature of beaſts then men.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian part of the world did plainly bewray this improuident and irreſpectiue neglect of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and bountie. When <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> made proffer to the Kings of <hi>England, Portugall,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to inueſt them with the moſt precious and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt veynes of the whole earth, neuer knowne before: but this offer was not onely reiected, but the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who deſerues euer to be renowned, was (of vs <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> eſpecially) ſcorned &amp; accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for an idle Nouelliſt. Some thinke it was becauſe of his poore apparell, and ſimple lookes, but ſurely it is rather to be imputed to the improuidency &amp; imprudencie of our Nation, which hath alwayes bred ſuch diffidence in vs, that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit no new report, bee it neuer ſo likely, nor beléeue any thing be it neuer ſo probable, before we ſée the effects. This hath alwayes béene reported of the Engliſh, by
<pb facs="tcp:6158:5"/>
thoſe that haue obſerued the nature of nations: <hi>Bodin. lib. 5. de Repub. cap.</hi> 1. reporteth, that the Engliſh were alwayes accounted more warlike, valorous, and couragious, then the French, but the French went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beyond them in prudence, and pollicie. And to expreſſe the ſame, he vſeth the words of <hi>Ennius. Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentes ſunt magis quam ſapients potentes.</hi> And it may be that this might be reported of vs Engliſh, in thoſe times when our Country was not peſteced with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, nor ouercharged with ſwarmes of people, for peace and plentie breed ſecuritie in men: neither is it neceſſarie for anie man to beléeue reports, though probable, nor to follow ſtrange proiects be they neuer ſo likely, ſo long as he hath home inbred hopes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon, and aſſured certainties to ſatiſfie his future expectation.</p>
            <p>In thoſe dayes this Kingdome was not ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as now it is, Ciuell warres at home, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine wars abroad, did cut off the ouer-ſpreading bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our people. Our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yéelded vnto all that were in it a ſurpluſſage of all neceſſities: it yeelded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in due correſpondencie, for al degrees &amp; ſorts of men. The commons of our Country lay free and open for the poore Commons to inioy, for there was roome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the land for euery man, ſo that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> néeded to encroch or incloſe from another, whereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that in thoſe dayes we had no great néed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtrange reports, or to ſeeke wilde aduentures, for ſéeing we had not onely ſufficiencie, but an ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meaſure proportioned to euerie man. Religion and pietie taught vs, that ſéeing our lot was fallen vnto vs in a faire ground, and that we had a goodly heritage, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be content with our own, then either politikèly or ambitiouſly to vndertake vncouth enterpriſes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which neceſſitie did no way vrge vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6158:6"/>
But nowe God hath proſpered vs with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the wombe, &amp; with the bleſſings of the breſts, the ſword deuoureth not abroad, neither is there any feare in our ſtreets at home; ſo that we are now for multitude as the thouſand of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and as the ten thouſads of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the Prince of peace hath ioyned the wood of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> in one troe. And therefore we may iuſtly ſay, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay here to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> we are a great people, and the lande is too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for vs: ſo that whatſoeuer we haue béene, now it behooues vs to be both prudent and politicke, and not to deride and reiect good profers of profitable and gainefull expectation, but rather to imbrace euery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which hath any probabilitie in it of future hopes: And ſeeing there is neither preferment nor employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all within the liſts of our countrey, we might iuſtly be accounted as in former times, both impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and improuident, if we will yet ſit with our armes foulded in our boſomes, and not rather ſéeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch aduentures whereby the glory of God may be aduanced, the territories of our kingdome inlarged, our people both preferred and employed abroad, our wants ſupplyed at home, his Maieſties cuſtomes wonderfully augmented, and the honour and renown of our <hi>Nation</hi> ſpred and propagated to the ends of the world. Many examples might be produced to mooue vs hereunto, but becauſe they were the practiſes of rude and barharous people, they are no exemplarie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents for chriſtians: but foraſmuch as euery example approued in the ſcripture, is a precept, I thought good to handle this conference betwéene the tribe of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a family in the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, &amp; <hi>Ioſhua</hi> a faithfull and godly Prince ouer the whole commonwealth of Gods <hi>Iſrael:</hi> which to my ſéeming, is much like that plot which we haue now in hand for <hi>Virginia;</hi> for here the

people of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and of the halfe tribe of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> are a great people, and ſo are we: and by reaſon of the multitude of their people, the land is too narrow for them; and ſo ſtands our caſe, whereupon they repaire to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>And herupon many ſtateſ-men haue thought nothing more profitable for populous common-wealths, then to haue forreigne and externe warres, to the ende that thereby the ſuperfluous braunches might be cut off. This was the cauſe why <hi>Scipio</hi> when he had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Carthage,</hi> would not haue it vtterly ruinated, leaſt ſaith he, the Romains hauing no warres abroad, mooue ciuill warres amongſt themſelues at home: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſéeing the multitude of their people increaſe, haue planted Colonies with them, others haue baniſhed them into remote countries: and the children of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> here being peſtered with multitude come to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to be directed and relieued. This ſhould teach vs of this kingdome and countrey, prudence and prouidence, the Lord hath bleſſed vs, and we are growne to be a great people, ſo that one lot is not ſufficient for vs: Our mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes like too much bloud in the body, infect our countrey with plague and pouertie, our land hath brought foorth, but it hath not milke ſufficient in the breaſt thereof to nouriſh all thoſe children which it hath brought forth, it affordeth neither employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor preferment for thoſe that depend vpon it: And hereupon it is, that many ſeruiceable men giue themſelues to lewd courſes, as to robbing by the high way, theft, &amp; coſoning, ſharking vpon the land, piracie vpon the Sea, and ſo are cut off by ſhamefull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death: others liue prophanely, riotouſly, and idely, to the great diſhonour of Almightie God, the detriment of the commonwealth. Now our caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:6158:8"/>
thus it behooueth euerie one to deuiſe a remedie for this miſery: When there was no bread in <hi>Chanaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iacob</hi> and his familie ſought into <hi>Egypt</hi> for corne to relieue themſelues. And <hi>Iacob</hi> ſéeing his ſonnes deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of counſel in that extremity, did ſharply reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſſolute managing of their preſent ſtate, ſaying: <hi>Why gaze ye one vpo another? Behold, I haue heard there is food in Egypt, get ye down thither, and buy vs food thence, that we may liue.</hi> Euen ſo may it be ſaid to a companie of people in this land, which doe nothing but gaze one vpon another, deſtitute of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, aduiſe, and meanes, how to prouide iuſtly and honeſtly for their maintenaunce. They heare of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable proiects abroade, they heare of employment and preſerment, they heare of plentie and abundance of many good things, of which a fruitful country large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes offer vnto them: they heare of gaine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite both to them and their poſteritie, they heare many honourable men, many worthie wiſe men, many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt and couragious men, many rich and wealthie men, aduenture their perſons, their mony, their ſhips, towards the accompliſhing of ſo godly and memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a dſigne, and yet they ſit ſtill folowing their intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perauncie, incontinencie, and other their luxurious and riotous courſes, to the high diſhonour of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, to the great hurt of the common-wealth, and to their own euerlaſting ſhame and ignomie. If an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable death were ſet before a vertuous minde, it would chuſe rather to die heroically, then liue oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briouſly. What then ſhall we thinke of thoſe perſons, who hauing an honourable life ſet before them, doe yet chuſe rather to liue in idleneſſe, diſhoneſtie &amp; obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? ſurely they are of degenerate and dunghill minder, neither are they worthy to be nouriſhed in the boſome of a wel gouerned common-wealth. It was for euer a

            <p>Thus we haue heard the dutie of the people which is prudently and prouidently to conſult with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, concerning the diſburdening, and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſuch vnneceſſarie multitudes as peſter a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and alſo to further ſuch enterpriſes either with their purſes or their perſons as make to the ſame ende. Now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in next place, we are to note the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> vpon the aforeſaide complaint of the children of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> which is to enlarge their territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and dilate their borders, by deſtroying Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies the Perizzites, and Giants, which inhabited the valleyes, bordering vpon mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> which were moſt abominable Idolaters, and had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true and onely God: from whence we may learne, how odious thoſe people are, in the ſight of God, which hauing no knowledge of him and his worſhip, giue that honour to the inſenſible and vnreaſonable creature, which is onely due to the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and almightie Creator. For this cauſe hath almightie God, ouerthrowne the mightieſt <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies</hi> in the world, for this cauſe did hée diſperſe his owne <hi>Iſrael</hi> among the Nations, &amp; neuer vouchſafed them to returne againe into their owne land. <hi>Dauid</hi> by way of prophecie, doth promiſe a bleſſing to thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:6158:9"/>
that ſhall take the children of the Idolatrous <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and daſh them againſt the ſtones, and they that haue taken armes againſt ſuch people, are ſaid to fight the Lords battells. <hi>Saul</hi> had his kingdome rent from him and his poſteritie, becauſe he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous king of the <hi>Amalechites,</hi> whom God would not haue ſpared: ſo acceptable a ſeruice is it to deſtroy Idolaters whom God hateth, but foraſmuch as God doth not delight in bloud, but rather that a ſinner ſhould conuert and liue, agréeable vnto which, is that ſpeech of our Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpell, There is ioy in heauen ouer one ſinner that repenteth. It is far more commendable, and out of doubt more acceptable vnto God, to reclaime an Idolater, vnles we haue a ſpeciall commaundement of God to the contrarie, as <hi>Saul</hi> had then to deſtroy him, to win him to the faith, then to depriue him of life, and to bring him to the knowledge of God, &amp; whom he hath ſent Chriſt Ieſus: rather then to kill them in their ignorance, and ſo to bring them into daunger both of bodie and ſoule, for they that turne many vnto righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres for euermore. <hi>Dan. 12. 3. Paul</hi> calls thoſe whom he had won to the faith of Chriſt, his crowne, his ioy, his glorie. 1. <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 2. 19. 20. As though they were the matter of his ioy, of his crowne, and of his glorie. Happie therefore is he that hath an hand in turning any vnto God. And he that will finde delaie whereby ſo gratious a worke may be hindered, is not with God, but againſt God, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he hinders the building vp of the kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>And ſurely ſo deſirous is man of ciuill ſocietie by nature, that he eaſily yéelds to diſcipline and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:6158:9"/>
if he ſée any reaſonable motiue to induce him to the ſame. For we reade of certaine people in <hi>Affrica,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the mountaine <hi>Magnan,</hi> which offentimes do conſtraine ſtraungers which trauell that way, to take the gouernment of them, and to impoſe lawes vnto them, whereby they may be iuſtly and orderly gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and many Nations willingly ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſubiection of the Romanes, being allured thereunto by Iuſtice, equitie, clemencie, and vpright dealing of the <hi>Romaine</hi> captaines: for it is not the nature of men, but the education of men, which make them barbarous and vnciuill, and therefore chaunge the education of men, and you ſhall ſée that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be greatly rectified and corrected: ſéeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men by nature ſo eaſily yéelde to diſcipline and gouernment vpon any reaſonable ſhewe of bettering their fortunes, it is euerie mans dutie to trauell both by ſea and land, and to venture either with his perſon or with his purſe, to bring the barbarous and ſauage people to a ciuill and Chriſtian kinde of gouernment, vnder which they may learne how to liue holily, iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſoberly in this world, and to apprehend the meanes to ſaue their ſoules in the world to come, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to deſtroy them, or vtterly to roote them out: for a wiſe man, but much more a Chrtſtian, ought to trie all meanes before they vndertake warre: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The report goeth, that in <hi>Virginia</hi> the people are ſauage and incredibly rude, they worſhip the diuell, offer their young children in ſacrifice vnto him, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vp and downe like beaſts, and in manners and conditions, differ very litle from beaſts, hauing no Art, nor ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor trade, to imploy themſelues, or giue themſelues vnto, yet by nature louing and, gentle, and deſirous to imbrace a better condition. Oh how happy were that man which could reduce this people from brutiſhnes, to ciuilitie, to religion, to Chriſtianitie, to the ſauing of their ſoules: happy is that man and bleſt of God, whom God hath endued, either with meanes or will to attempt this buſines, but farre be it from the nature of the Engliſh, to exerciſe any bloudie cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie amongſt theſe people: farre be it from the hearts of the Engliſh, to giue them occaſion, that the holy name of God, ſhould be diſhonoured among the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, or that in the plantation of that continent, they ſhould giue any cauſe to the world, to ſay that they ſought the wealth of that countrie aboue or before the glorie of God, and the propagation of his kingdome.

them all, he called vpon the Moone to reuenge ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In like maner ſhould all men vſe their wits in the firſt place, and weapons ſhould alwayes be the laſt meanes in all our proiects. And therefore although the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> haue an expreſſe commaundement here in this place, to deſtroy thoſe Idolaters, and poſſeſſe their land, yet foraſmuch as we haue no precept but by example, we muſt firſt trie all means before weapons, and when we take them into our hands, neceſſitie of preſeruing our owne liues, muſt rather moue vs to deſtroy the enemyes of God, then either ambition, or gréedineſſe of gaine, or crueltie, or anie priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Now the third thing which we are to obſerue in this entercourſe of wordes betweene the children of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Ioſua,</hi> is the delayes which the people vſe, and the excuſes which they feigne, which ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an impoſſibilitie, in the vndertaking of <hi>Ioſuas</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.

And <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> alledgeth Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for proofe hereof, whoſe wordes are theſe: <hi>Qui licentia iniquitatis eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur, vtiliter vincitur.</hi> Thoſe people are vanquiſhed to their vnſpeakeable profite and gaine, which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt are abridged of the libertie of ſinne &amp; impietie. And the ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath an other gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſaying to this purpoſe. <hi>Apud veros Dei cultores etiam illa bella peccata non ſunt qua non cupiditate &amp; crudelitate ſed pacis ſtudio geruntur, vt mali coercean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; boni ſubleuentur:</hi> Amongeſt the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of GOD, euen that warre is lawfull which is vndertaken, not for couetouſneſſe and crueltie, but for peace and vnities ſake: ſo that lewde and wicked men may thereby be ſuppreſſed and good men maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and relieued: whereby we ſee, that both in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Polititians, and alſo by the iudgement of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe, we might lawfully make warre vppon the Sauages of <hi>Virginia</hi> our proiect, hauing the endes aforeſaid. And therefore let euerie man that is or will be an aduenturer in this plantation, examine his whole heart, and if hée finde that hée is drawne to partake in this buſineſſe, to drawe the Sauages from their barbarous kinde of life, to a moreciuill, honeſt, and Chriſtian kinde of life, let him not doubt of the lawfulneſſe of it, but let him chéerefully and liberally put his helping hand to this buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they reaſon of the future euents by thoſe that are alreadie paſt. And ſéeing it is aboue twentie yeares agee ſince this attempt was begun, and yet no good hath come of it, nor little hope of any, they holde it an vnaduiſed courſe to ſet the ſame attempt
<pb facs="tcp:6158:12"/>
on foote againe: which obiection of theirs is very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie anſwered in that booke intituled <hi>Noua Britannia.</hi> And indeed moſt childiſh is this obiection, for neither was the end of the firſt attempt the ſame, with the end of this, nor the meanes, nor the managing of the meanes of this attempt ſemblable with the former, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all likelihood the euent of this cannot be iudged by the euent of the former.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond obiection is, that this age will ſee no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this plantatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which obiection admit it were true, yet it is too brutiſh, and bewraies their neglect and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſpect of poſteritie: we are not borne like beaſts for our ielues, and the time preſent only, but beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other things which may challenge an intereſt and right in vs: poſteritie and the age yet enſuing haue not the leaſt part in our life &amp; labours. What benefit or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſhould we haue enioyed in the things of this world, if our forefathers had not prouided better for vs, and bin more carefully reſpectiue of poſteritie then for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? We ſow, we ſet, we plant, we build, not ſo much for our ſelues as for poſteritie; we practiſe the workes of Godlines in this life, yet ſhall we not ſee the end of our hope before wee inioy it in the world to come: It is a bleſſed thing to be bleſſed of poſteritie. It was the reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Uirgin <hi>Marie,</hi> that from thenceforth all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhould call her bleſſed. They that do not prouide for eternitie, can haue no aſſured hope of eternitie, and they which onely are for themſelues, ſhall die in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſhall not haue a name among poſteritie, their rootes ſhall bee dried vp beneath, and aboue ſhall their branch bee cut downe, their remembrance ſhall periſh from the earth, and they ſhal haue no name in the ſtreete, <hi>Iob</hi> 18. 16. 17. But the remembrance which a good man leaues behind him, is like the compoſition of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume that is made by the Art of the Apothecary; it is ſweet as honie in all mouthes, and as muſicke at a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of wine: let it not grieue thee therefore to plant and
<pb facs="tcp:6158:13"/>
build for poſteritie, for the memorie of the iuſt ſhall bée bleſſed, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot. <hi>Prou.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
            <p>Others obiect the continuall charges which will prooue in their opinion very heauie and burdenſome to thoſe that ſhall vndertake the ſaid Plantation. Theſe like the dog in the manger, neither eate hay themſelues, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they ſuffer the Oxe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would. They neuer think any charges too much that may any way increaſe their owne priuate eſtate. They haue thouſands to beſtow about the ingroſſing of a commoditie, or vpon a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, or to take their Neighbours houſe ouer his head, or to lend vpon vſurie: but if it come to a publicke good, they grone vnder the leaſt burden of charges that can bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them. Theſe men would bee vſed like ſponges, they muſt be ſqueaſed, ſeeing they drnuke vp all, and will yeeld to nothing, though it concerne the common good neuer ſo greatly. But it is demonſtratiuely prooued in <hi>Noua Britannia,</hi> that the charges about this Plantation will be nothing, in compariſon of the benefit that will grow thereof. And what notable thing I pray you can be brought to paſſe without charges? The things of this world are appointed vnto man with ſuch conditions as there may no profit accrew vnto him without paine, nor no gaine without charge: <hi>Hiel</hi> will build <hi>Iericho,</hi> though the foundation of it coſt him his eldeſt ſonne, &amp; the ſetting vp of the gates coſt him his youngeſt ſonne: <hi>Haman</hi> wil haue his wicked deſire vpon the Jewes, though it coſt him ten thouſand talents; So little doe the wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect charges about the effecting of their malicious, or vaine glorious attempts, condemning thoſe that profeſſe pietie and religion, which for ſauing charges, neglect, and often times ſuffer moſt honorable and profitable protects to faile and fall to the ground. Without queſtion kee that ſaues his mony, where Gods glory is to bee aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Chriſtian religion propagated and planted, the good of the Commonwealth increaſed, and the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of the King inlarged, s ſubiect to the curſe of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:6158:13"/>
Magus,</hi> his monie and he are in danger to periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Let none therefore find delaies, or faine excuſes to withhold them from this imployment for <hi>Virginia,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery oppoſition againſt it is an oppoſition againſt God, the King, the Church, and the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt place let vs heare the anſwere of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> to the excuſes of the children of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is an exhortation, that in ſtead of delaies they would vſe Art and induſtrie in this enterpriſe which they were to vndertake: Art in cutting downe the trees and making the Countrie champion: Induſtrie by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king paines to conquer and caſt out thoſe Idolatrous Cananites, &amp; to plant themſelues in their places. From whence we are to gather, that for this preſent buſineſſe of plantation in <hi>Virginia,</hi> there muſt bee ſpeciall choice and care had of ſuch perſons as ſhall be ſent thither. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath emptied her ſelfe in beſtowing her richeſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures vpon that Countrie; ſo that if Art and induſtrie be vſed, as helpes to Nature, it is likely to prooue the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt attempt that euer was vndertaken by the Engliſh. And foraſmuch as of all humane Artes Political gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the chiefeſt, there muſt be a ſpeciall care in the Magiſtrate how to carry himſelfe in his place and order: for herein conſiſts the verie maine matter of the ſucceſſe of this buſineſſe. As therefore the Magiſtrate hath the eminencie of dignitie conferred vpon him by his Prince, ſo muſt he furniſh himſelfe with eminencie of vertue: for he ſhal the better containe others within the bounds and limits of honeſtie and godlineſſe, if he firſt be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe. <hi>Mala anima male imperat, Plato: 1. de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</hi> A Magiſtrate therefore muſt haue a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God, and he muſt alſo haue a louing affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards thoſe ouer whom hee hath the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Concerning the conſcience that a Magiſtrate muſt carrie towards God, he muſt ſo watch ouer himſelſe, that at no time he burſt ſoorth into any notorious vice, nor ſuffer himſelfe to be ſtained with the imputation of any
<pb facs="tcp:6158:14"/>
enormious crime; for the vices of men are holden ſo much the greater, by how much greater the Maieſtie is of the partie delinquent: the blemiſhes of Princes are deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and diminitiue ſins in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are ſins of the higheſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Again, he that is in place of gouernment muſt know that his example preualles much with thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are vnder his gouernment, ſo that he ſhall rule his ſubiects better by his good example of life, then by all the lawes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes that hee can make. Laſtly, a Magiſtrate muſt know that the moderne times doe not onely behold him, but that he is ſubiect alſo to the view of ſucceeding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie; and therefore <hi>Tacitus</hi> doth aduiſe Princes, <hi>lib. 4. Ann.</hi> to beware by all meanes that they giue no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Chroniclers to publiſh their leaud and wicked actions. Concerning his looing affection towards his ſubiects, his firſt care muſt be that he alwaies ſeeke the publike good of his ſubiects aboue his owne priuate profit: to which purpoſe the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> was wont to ſay; <hi>Ita ſe rempublicam geſturum vt ſciret populi rem eſſe, non propriam.</hi> The example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great is moſt memorable for this purpoſe, who leading his ſouldiers through the drie and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> places of India, had almoſt loſt his whole armie for water. At the laſt one of his ſouldiers found out the riuer Oxus, &amp; brought the King water to quench his thirſt: but the King pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the water vpon the ground before all his ſouldiers, and would not drinke it, ſpeaking theſe words: <hi>Ego bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam? &amp; reliqui ſitient?</hi> and when he and his whole armie came to the riuer, hee would not drinke before all his ſouldiers had quenched their thirſt: giuing thereby all Princes to vnderſtand, that they ſhould prouide for the good of their people before their owne good. Thus in conſcience towards God, and in affection towards his ſubiects ought a Prince to ſtand affected. And if he ſtand ſo affected he will puniſh ſuch as are vild and vitious, and he will aduance ſuch as are veriuous and well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; he will incourage the painfull and induſtrious,
<pb facs="tcp:6158:14"/>
and he will correct the idle and diſſolute; he will eſtabliſh true religion, and he will repreſſe hereſies and ſchiſmes; he wil reiceue the weake and impotent, and he wil ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the mutinous and inſolent; ſo that God will giue a bleſſing, &amp; al things wil proſper vnder his gouernment.</p>
            <p>And for as much as no policie can ſtand long without religion, a chiefe care muſt be had of ſufficient, honeſt, &amp; ſober minded Miniſters to teach and inſtruct the people both by their life and doctrine in their dutie to God, and obedience to their rulers. When the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Neither do I euer reade of any that euer attained vnto any gouernment of what religion ſoeuer they were, but their firſt care was to prouide fit perſons which might teach the people religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diuine worſhip; and therefore if this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhould bee vndertaken without this care, there were ſmall hope of any good ſucceſſe to come thereof. And as the Miniſter being a ſubiect muſt yeeld his obedience to the Magiſtrate, ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Magiſtrate muſt bee carefull to yeeld him countenance to keepe him from neglect, and maintenance to incourage him in his miniſtery. And it muſt be ſpecially foreſeene of the Miniſters that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Poperie; for as it doth infect the mind with errour, ſo it doth infect the manners of men with diſloyaltie and treachery: and laſtly they muſt labour to preſerue the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace; for if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Policie thus eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing religion, and religion guiding policie; prouiſion muſt be made of men furniſhed with Arts and trades moſt neceſſarie for this buſines: Artificers and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men muſt be nouriſhed and cheriſhed, for without Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and tradeſmen a common-wealth cannot flouriſh nor endure: and therefore the Magiſtrate muſt ſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:6158:15"/>
regard them and reſpect them, and they muſt ſo carrie themſelues that they may be reſpected and cheriſhed of the Magiſtrate. It is required at their hands that they be faithfull, painefull, and honeſt in their callings; for if they be thus qualified, the countrie itſelfe will make them rich. Euery trade hath his myſtery, which is for the moſt part grounded vpon deceit and fraud: but ſeeing the beginning of a common wealth is now attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the foundation muſt not bee laid vpon fraud and deceit, for there can no good end be expected of an euill beginning. It is requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red likewiſe that they be painefull in their trades, or elſe the commonwealth can haue little vſe or comfort of them. And here our Engliſh tradeſmen and Artificers are to be aduiſed that they be warie in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sauages to bee apprentices to teach them their trade, ſeeing there be meanes of imployment ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient beſides to ſet many thouſands on worke; and therefore not neceſſarie as yet to inſtruct them in our trades and myſteries.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, induſtrie muſt be alſo added to helpe Arte and Nature, ſo that ſuch as haue no proſeſſed artes and trades, muſt painefully im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>y themſelues in ſome labour or other, to the furthering of this Plantation: a Drone will in ſhort ſpace deuoure more hony than the Bée can gather in along time, and therefore the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt correct with al ſharpeneſſe of diſcipline, thoſe vnthriftie and vnprofitable Drones, which liue idly: for there is a law giuen to the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> to labour, and to the daughters of <hi>Eue,</hi> with the ſweate of their browes to get their liuing, and therefore it is an Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall precept that they which will not labour muſt not eate. In <hi>Iobs</hi> time there was a very ſtrict order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſuch as liued idely, <hi>Iob 30. 5. They were chaſed forth from among men, and euery one ſhowted at them as at a theefe:</hi> and ſurely ſuch an order muſt bee taken with thoſe that will not liue painefully in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the rather becauſe meate and drinke, and ſuch other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

ſupplies of liueliehoode will be very precious there a while: and therefore order had more néede be taken, that ſuch prouiſion be not conſumed by vnſeruiceable loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring companions.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, all degrées and ſorts of people which haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelues for this Plantation muſt be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to preſerue vnitie, loue and concord amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: for by concord ſmall things increaſe and growe to great things, but by diſcord great things ſoone come to nothing. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> being demaunded why the Citie of <hi>Sparta</hi> was not compaſſed about with walles for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defence and ſafety of the Citie, he ſhewed vnto the demandant, the Citizens and Souldiers of <hi>Sparta,</hi> all of them liuing and agréeing together in firme concord and vnitie; theſe, ſaith <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> are the walles of <hi>Sparta:</hi> and out of queſtion ſo it is; concord and good agréement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt coinhabitants is a more ſure defence than walles or Caſtles, or any other warlike munition whatſoeuer. Therefore if any mutinous or ſeditious perſon dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to mooue any matter which may tend to the breach of concord and vnitie, he is preſently to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as a moſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
