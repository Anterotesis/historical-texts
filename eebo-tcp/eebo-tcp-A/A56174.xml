            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That after the said heavy sentence, your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner by an order in the said Court, (by way of addition to the said Censure) was inhibited the use of Pen, Inke and Paper, and all Bookes, except the Bible, and the Booke of Common-Prayer, and some few Bookes for private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and before his wounds were perfectly cured, he was by order removed from the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to <hi>Carnarvan;</hi> and some of his friends in <hi>Chester,</hi> who visited him there in his passage, in the presence of his Conductors, who had no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to restraine any person from resorting to him, were for this very cause sent for by a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, to appeare before the Lords of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Counsell, and likewise cited into the High-Commission at <hi>Yorke,</hi> where they were impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and fined, to the ruine of their estates, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to make a publique <hi>Recantation</hi> in the Cathedrall Church, and in the Towne-Hall of <hi>Chester.</hi> The said Commissioners further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing that three pictures of your Petitioners found in <hi>Chester,</hi> should bee publikely burnt at the high Crosse there, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60641:6"/>That your Petitioner since his said sentence, hath beene publikely reviled at, and libelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, both by the High Commissioners at <hi>York,</hi> and in sundry Churches, both at Chester, and else where, and in divers licensed printed bookes compiled by the said <hi>Heylin,</hi> and published by the <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> privity or command, and that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of his friends houses, studies, Bookes, and writings have beene violently broken up, ransack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken away, and themselves prosecuted in the High Commission, out of malice, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they had to your Petitioner.</p>
            <p>That after your Petitioner had continued some ten weeks space close prisoner in <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> he was about three years since by a warrant from the Lords of the Counsell, made in the summer vacation (to which the said Arch Bishops hand was first subscrib'd) ordered by way of Exile, to be imbarqued and transported with all privacy into one of the Castles in the Isle of <hi>Iersey,</hi> and his conductors thereby charged not to admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny person whatsoever, but themselves onely, to speak with vour Petitioner in his passage: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon after some injuries there received by Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> the Kings Atturney in those parts (who endeavoured to seize upon the furniture of his chamber for his owne use) your Petitioner was imbarqued amongst Papists, in a bruised ship-wrackt vessell, full of leakes, and after foureteene weekes voyage in the Winter season, through dangerous stormes and seas, which spoyled most of his stuffe and bedding, and threatning often
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60641:6"/>
ship-wrack to him, he arrived at the said Isle, and was conveyed close prisoner into <hi>Mount Orgatile Castle,</hi> there where the Lieutenant Governour by an other extrajudiciall Order, to which the sayd Arch-Bishops name was first ordered, to keepe your Petitioner close prisoner in a chamber, suffer none but his keepers to speake with him, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all letters to him; to permit him neither Pen, Inke nor Paper, either to write to his friends for necessaries, or to petition for reliefe, and to permit him no Booke but the Bible, and those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed bookes, without giving any order for his dyet there, so that beeing deprived of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and estate, exiled and shut up close prisoner among strangers, remote from all his friends, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed all adresse to him by person or letters, hee had certainely perrished in his almost three years close imprisonment there, had not the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary providence and goodnesse of God (which he shall ever adore) &amp; the noble charity of those, under whose custody he did remaine, furnished him with such dyet and necessaries, as dyet him both in health and life, in this his close im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment and exile.</p>
            <p>May it therefore please this Honourable House, to take these your Petitioners almost eight yeares tragicall grievances, of new and dangerous example, into your most sad and just cosiderations, that so they may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come presidents to the prejudice of posterity; to grant him liberty to send for, and examine
