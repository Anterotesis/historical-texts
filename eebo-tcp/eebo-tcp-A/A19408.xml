            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

If euer any Kingdome hath beene fortunate, to giue a true mirror and example of this happineſſe, this famous Iſland hath beene therein incomparable, wherein ſo many puiſſant Monarchs, ſucceſſiuely ſwaying this Emperiall Diademe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the ancient Lawes and Cuſtomes of

things ſaith he (as may be plainely out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named place collected) doe concurre vnto the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right conſtitution of euery complete law, whereby it may be held ſacred and inuiolate. The firſt is, that it be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, that it be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and gift of God. Secondly, that it be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, the vniuerſall conſent of the whole ſtate, Citie or countrey. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the true cauſe of the forementioned generall lameneſſe, and confuſion of Lawes in the propoſed caſe of Witch-craft conſiſteth herein. Firſt, for that men haue not as yet ſufficiently ſearched the holy Scriptures to finde out that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, what is the ordinance of God therein. Secondly, for that men haue not ſeriouſly conſulted with that wiſedome and prudence, which by the light of nature and reaſon Almightie God hath left diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable and allowed to be iuſtly and truly deemed, <gap reason="foreign">

worke and building of God: let it not ſeeme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that I offer this my Moytie of deſire, and good will. I know that in this ſubiect, many ages of learned Authors, haue endleſly varied, many famous Writers haue bin branded with infamous errors, many excellent wits haue run themſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of their wits, &amp; thoſe who haue beſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, their trembling pens haue niggardly dropped, &amp; timorouſly pointed out any fully, or firmely auou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched certainty. It is notwithſtanding no breach of rule of modeſty, but my bounden duty, vnto the accompliſhment and honour of truth, to adde what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in my vtmoſt endeauour may be conducible. Neither would my many conflicts, with difficulties in this kinde, hold me excuſed, if ſo oft ſpurred, or rather galled, by ſo frequent exerciſe, practiſe and conuerſation, with perſons in ſo diuers extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manners afflicted, and ſuppoſed bewitched, it ſhould awake no anſwerable diſpatch or diſplay therein. Let it then ſeeme no wonder, that a man (though leſſe then the leaſt among men) who hath not onely as ſtudiouſly as others laboured the ſame particular, and as diligently therein obſerued, but hath farre more happily bin fortuned then others, with frequent matter, and occurrents worthy obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and hath alſo beene more plentifully grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with opportunitie, to inrich his vnderſtanding with variety and worth of obiects, inſtructing his reaſon, and confirming his experience: Let it ſeeme no wonder (I ſay) that a meane wit, thus beyond others furniſhed thereto, may aduenture amiddeſt

ſo many doubts and ambiguities, wherewith ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthies haue been formerly intangled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, to auouch and prooue certainty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. In this ſubiect of Witch-craft, by better meanes aduantaged, if beyond former times or Writers, I haue haply propoſed a more direct and certaine Module and Methode of iudging therein, I doe not thereby arrogate vnto my ſelfe, but attribute vnto the meanes, nor derogate from others, whom if the like contingence of the ſame helpes, had as freely and friendly affronted, and the like facilitie had opened as ready acceſſe, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the guilty ſenſe of my owne exiguitie (whether in the outward beauty of words, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſubſtance of vnderſtanding) it had beene eaſie for any man to exceed with ſo good meanes this ſo euill meaneneſſe of my performance. Since then (Right Honourable Lords) the ſubiect it ſelfe, and a pertinent and peculiar vſe therein, doe point vnto your Honours the propertie of this Dedication, vnto whoſe tribunall the Lawes of God and men appeale againſt that foule abominable ſinne, let it not be cenſured pride or preſumption, humbly to preſent vnto your Lordſhip that conſideration and reſolution which beyond my merit or deſert, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents haue freely adminiſtred vnto long-diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted meditation.

The firſt of theſe is the inward vnderſtanding: the <note place="margin">Scalig. de Subtil. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit 307. ſect. 22.</note> ſecond is the outward ſenſe.

Beſides theſe waves of knowledge; namely, the inward and the outward ſenſe, there neuer was, nor euer can be enumeration of any other.

Such things as immediatly proue themſelues, and are vndoubted, in their firſt view, are ſubiect either to the ſenſe onely, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vnderſtanding onely. Such things as are only proper to the ſenſe, and thereto immediatly and properly ſubiect, are things ſeene, heard, touched, taſted, ſmelt; as colours, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, lineaments, ſounds, muſike, hardneſſe, ſoftnes, drines, moiſture, roughneſſe, ſmoothneſſe, ſowre, ſweete, diuerſity of

Likewiſe, theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in Logicke: Euery propoſition is true or falſe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue or negatiue, and extendeth generally vnto all vnder the ſame kinde, or to ſome particulars, or to a ſingular, or is indefinite. Likewiſe, in Arithmaticke theſe: One is no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one cannot be diuided, or is indiuiſible; foure is more then two. Likewiſe, in Phyſike theſe: Euery man is ſicke or healthfull, or a neuter: Contraries are cured by contraries, as heat by cooling, cold by heating, moyſture by drying, dryneſſe by moyſting. As in theſe named Sciences, ſo in all other; there are the like generall notions, immediatly at the firſt view proouing themſelues vnto the vnderſtanding, and euery man in common ſenſe and reaſon, immediatly conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto their truth; and he that denieth it, or ſeeketh proofe therof, is eſteemed iuſtly madde, or voyd of reaſon.</p>
               <p>There are other things alſo ſubiect vnto the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely, which do not immediatly vpon the firſt view or conſideration (as the former) proue themſelues, but are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by others more cleere and euident then themſelues; as this propoſition. The motion of the heauens is not infinite. This is not manifeſt vnto euery man at firſt view, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth another more manifeſt then it ſelfe, to make it manifeſt thus: That which hath a certaine limitted courſe, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution and motion, cannot be infinite; but Aſtronomie for many thouſands of yeares hath diſcouered the courſes, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, reuolutions, and ſet perambulations of the heauens, and therefore the motions of the heauens cannot be infinite. It
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9304:11"/>
may here eaſily be obſerued, how the firſt poſition being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to proue it ſelfe, another more manifeſt doth giue it light, and doth deduce it vnto that, which doth ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately proue it ſelfe vnto common ſenſe, and reaſon, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of all ages and times, that no idiot can be ignorant, or will deny it.</p>
               <p>Thus hath bin manifeſted, how ſome things are immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood in the very firſt conſideration &amp; view: ſome are proued by themſelues, ſome not proued by themſelues, but made euident by others. As many things are in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kinds &amp; ſeuerall maners manifeſted, and euidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto reaſon, ſenſe, or vnderſtanding: ſo are there many things neither by themſelues nor by other euident, neither to the vnderſtanding and reaſon, or to the outward ſenſe at the firſt apparent, but remaine ambiguous and doubtfull. In theſe things certainty of knowledge by manifeſt proofe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, there remaineth no other refuge, but prudent and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial coniecture, narrowly looking &amp; ſearching thorow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, vnto the neereſt poſſibilitie of truth &amp; certainty.</p>
               <p>Fom hence doe ariſe excellent vſes and benefits vnto vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, though not ſo farre forth ofttimes gained, as is deſired vnto all priuate ends, yet ſo farre forth, as maketh wiſe and vnderſtanding men excell and ſhine before others. Hence it commeth to paſſe that in doubtfull caſes, counſels and attempts, one man is ſeene and knowne to ouerſhine an other, as much as the glorious Sunne doth his ecclipſed ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Moone. Hence haue iſſued ſo many noble and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roike Vertues; Sagacitie, exquiſitneſſe of iudgement, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Art, in the adminiſtration of high affaires. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in probabilities are no euident certainties, yet doe they ſo farre forth oft-times aduantage and aduance vnto the knowledge of certainety, that it is almoſt equall vnto certainty, and doth perſwade and ſettle diſcreete reſolution and diſpoſition in all affaires. In this conſiſteth the height, the tope, the ſom of Art, and the perfection of all humane knowledge, aboue or beyond which, no man could euer ſoar or leuell. By this light onely the former mentioned meanes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9304:11"/>
failing, is oft times gained much excellence of natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to man, beyond and without which the eye and ſight of knowledge in man is ſealed vp, his vnderſtanding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cannot know many hidden things. And thus to him that rightly doth meditate and conſider, it is vndoubtedly cleere and certaine, how the Creator and infinite Prince of all principles hath founded the beginning &amp; end, the power and <hi>poſſe</hi> of all knowledge, vpon one of the former waies of inueſtigation, beſide which there is no naturall knowledge to be expected.

For this cauſe alſo, all true Philoſophers haue determined the two onely inſtruments of all true Arts, to bee Reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which <hi>Galen</hi> doth call the two legges whereupon the Art of Phyſike doth conſiſt. And therefore in the ſecond chapter of his <hi>Finitiones medicae,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Optimus is eſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus, qui omnia in Medicina recta agit ratione,</hi> that is, hee who doth all things in his ſubiect of Phyſike, according to right rule of reaſon, is the moſt excellent Phyſicion.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo all true Artiſts haue defined Art to bee, <hi>Habitus cum ratione factiuus,</hi> that is, a ſettled habilitie, and promptneſſe of action, and operation according to reaſon. Vpon this ground others haue built other true rules and obſeruations, concerning true and lawfull Arts. Therefore (ſaith <hi>Galen) ars non eſt ex ijs quorum neutiquam eſt poteſtas, Iſagog. chap.</hi> 5. that is, Art is not of ſuch things as cannot be accompliſhed. Which is worthy noting, to diſtinguiſh preſtigious and ſuppoſed Arts from true Art. To this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9304:12"/>
likewiſe haue added another obſeruation, that is; that Art is imployed about ſuch things as are in reaſon profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and not vaine.

Vpon the ſame reaſons, diuers Emperors, Kings, Kingdomes and Lawes, haue exploded, cenſured, and condemned all ſuch as vnder pretext of the wholeſome Arts of Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Mathematikes, and the like, haue runne into fooliſh curioſities, impoſtures, and deceitfull practiſes. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Roman Law-giuer and Emperour, his lawes are extant to this purpoſe.

As then in thoſe diſeaſes which are apparent vnto ſight, it is blindneſſe in a Phyſicion to make queſtion; in thoſe which are euident to reaſon, to make doubt, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſſe fatuitie; in thoſe which may be attained by artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all coniectation, ſearch or perquiſition, either to be ſlacke, is ſloth, or to bee vnable, is inſufficiencie: ſo in thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which neither outward ſenſe, nor inward reaſon, nor Art, nor artificiall coniecture can poſsibly diſcouer; to hope or ſeeke beyond Senſe and Reaſon, and reaſonable likelihood, is reaſonleſſe and ſenſeleſſe ſtriuing, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of thoſe bounds which God hath ſet to limit the curioſitie of man. For better proofe and illuſtration, it will not bee impertinent to nominate ſome particuler diſeaſes in all theſe kinds.

If with that ill affection bee ioyned a manifeſt inward heate about the region of the ſtomacke, accompanied with

an Ague, drineſſe, thirſt and other accidents, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of heate, is not as plainely detected the kinde of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be hot?</p>
               <p>Thus both the part affected, which is the ſtomacke appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently (becauſe there the former accidents are found origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally moouing and firſt ſeated,) and alſo the ill affection (which by the manifeſt burning heate doth prooue her kinde) being both conioyned, doe truely define the diſeaſe to bee an inflammation of the ſtomacke. The like may bee ſaide of the inflammations of all other inward parts of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, Phrenſies, inflammation of the Liuer, Spleene, Wombe, Reines, Guts and other parts, the certaine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of exceſsiue heate giuing demonſtration of an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the paine (or at leaſt, ſome defect) or defection in the proper offices of the parts manifeſting the parts themſelues. As concerning inward inflammations of diuers parts, ſo likewiſe of inward Vlcers, and other maladies may be inſtanced. The diſeaſe of the bladder is oft certainly knowne, by paine in the part, or by ceſſation of his proper functions, or defection therein, and the kinde of diſeaſe therein by the excretions oft-times proceeding from it. And thus an Vlcer is oft diſcouered in the bladder, by paine, with purulent and ſanguiuolent miction. Diſeaſes likewiſe of the head are certainly diſcouered and detected vnto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by defects growing; ſometimes in the vnderſtanding, ſometimesen in the memory, ſometimes in the imagination, ſometimes in all thoſe together, &amp; ſometimes in the general motion of the whole body. Diſeaſes of the heart likewiſe, appeare by the euill and faulty motions of the pulſe, by ſoundings and defections in liuelihood of the ſpirits and vitall faculty. Diſeaſes of the Wombe or Mother likewiſe doe oft demonſtrate themſelues by depriued or depraued motions. It were tedious to make a particular enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all diſeaſes of this kinde, which are in the ſame manner euident and apparent vnto reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now let vs briefly alſo conſider ſome diſeaſes, which are neither euident to Reaſon, nor manifeſt to Senſe; but are gained, detected, and hunted out of their deepe and hidden

Many examples of diſeaſes of this kinde would cauſe the ſmall body of this little worke voluminouſly to ſwell: we will therefore onely propoſe one.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſuppoſe a ſicke man, doubtfully and diuerſly with theſe accidents afflicted: namely, a continuall feuer, a cough, ſpitting of blood, ſhortneſſe of winde, head-ache, deliration, want of ſleepe, drineſſe, thirſt, paines in diuers parts, ſides, ribbes, backe and belly: What diſeaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes here are, can neither be manifeſt to ſenſe, diſtracted in this confuſion, multitude and concurrence of accidents; nor yet be euident to reaſon at the firſt view, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſo different conſideration, and deuided contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo many ſeuerals apart. Here then it remaineth, that ſearned, iudicious, prudent, and diſcreete artificiall conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture proceed exactly to diſtinguiſh &amp; analiſe, as followeth. All the forenamed paines, diſtempers and accidents may indifferently ariſe, eyther from the Lungs inflamed, or the Liuer, or the Midriffe, or the Pleura; becauſe any one of theſe by it ſelfe doth vſually bring forth all, or moſt part of them. Heere then prudent, artificiall, and exquiſite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion doth exactly valew and eſteeme all the different manners, quantities, qualities, poſitions and ſituations of paines; likewiſe accidents, motions, times, manners of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, caracters, orders, and all other both ſubſtantiall and circumſtantiall conſiderations.</p>
               <p>And firſt, as touching the feuer, head-ache, thirſt, idlenes of braine (becauſe they are common to many other diſeaſes beſides theſe, and require no curious, but a more careleſſe and common reſpect,) prudent and circumſpect coniectation doth leaue their needleſſe confuſion of more vſefull and needfull perpenſion, and doth more narrowly ſearch about thoſe accidents, which are more inſeparable, proper and peculiar vnto the diſeaſes named, and by exact
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9304:14"/>
diſquiſition in their differencies, doth notwithſtanding ſift out their hidden and ſecretly couched differencies, by which, in exact view they are found and diſtinguiſhed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently differing. The inſeparable accidents which doe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly, or for the moſt part accompany the diſeaſes before named, that is, the inflammation of the Lungs, the Liuer, the Midriffe and the Pleura, are cough, ſhortneſſe of winde, ſpitting of blood, paines about the ribbes, ſides, belly, which in all theſe named diſeaſes, more or leſſe are preſent, either primarily, or by conſent of one part with another. Theſe, though ſeldome abſent from moſt of the foure former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and therefore not eaſily diſtinguiſhed, when they proceede from th'one or th'other; yet rightly weighed, and accurately conſidered in their ſeuerall manners, meaſures, and right poſitions in euery one, when apart and ſingle, they doe likewiſe in their confuſed mixture one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yeeld diſtinct and ſeuerall difference to him, that in a iudicious and diſcerning thought, doth beare their iuſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions apart. For illuſtration, ſpitting of blood is vſually a companion to all, or moſt of the foure named diſeaſes; but in one in leſſe quantity, in another more; in one after one manner, in another after another; in one by vomiting, in another by expectoration, and in another by coughing; in one with much expuition, in another with little; in one with danger of ſtrangulation and ſuffocation, in another without; in one with thickneſſe, blackneſſe, and ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bloud, in another with thinneſſe, brightneſſe of colour, and more quantity; and in one of theſe alſo with leſſe, and in another with more difficulty and labour. Shortneſſe of winde, or difficulty of breathing, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon companion to all the named diſeaſes; but in one with frequent expuition, in another without, and where, with expuition, in one with more facility, in another with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, in one with one manner of diſtenſion of the inſtruments of reſpiration, in another with another, in one kinde of difficulty of reſpiration more frequent, in another leſſe, in one more grieuous, in another tolerable.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9304:15"/>
The like may be ſaid of coughing, and paines. Coughing in one of the forenamed diſeaſes is with much, in another with little, and in another with no expuition at all; in one continuall, in another with intermiſſion; in one with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in another with remiſsion; in one loud, in another ſtill; and where, with expectoration, in one of one colour and quantity, in another of another, and in another of none at all; in one eaſie, gentle, free and without paine, in another, grieuous and painfull; yea ſuffocatory, and neere to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. Paine likewiſe is a common companion to all the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned diſeaſes; but diſtinguiſhed in the one and the other, by the manner, nature, and ſituation of the ſeuerall parts, which apart ineuery one it poſſeſſeth, and alſo by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent oddes, faſhions, and kindes of paine; ſome being ſharp, ſome dull, ſome quicke, ſome ſlowe, ſome with diſtenſion, ſome with punction, ſome with heauineſſe and ſenſible weight, ſome more grieuous to the Patient lying, ſome to him ſitting or ſtanding, ſome more calme in one poſition of the body, and ſome in another.</p>
               <p>And thus prudent an skilfull coniecture, by due and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perpenſion, comparing together oddes, and exactly referring vnto true diſcerning the ſeuerall properties and differences of accidents, their manner proportions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther due circumſtances, doth in the end reduce euery acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his right diſeaſe, and euery diſeaſe to his right cauſe; whereby the prudent, and iudicious Phyſicion doth cleerly vnderſtand directly and timely to apply proper and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent remedies. And thus in doubtfull caſes, which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euident to Reaſon, nor manifeſt to Senſe in the Art and exerciſe of Phyſike, it is manifeſt how ſolert and accurate coniectation, through the clouds and miſts of ambiguities, doth in the end ſo cleerely ſend forth and giue ſo faire a light, that doubt it ſelfe doth become out of doubt, and is little inferiour vnto certaine and plaine demonſtration. As a ſhort ſumme of all that hath been ſaid, whatſoeuer hath beene declared of diſeaſes, the ſame may bee propounded concerning their iſſues very briefely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:9304:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The iſſues of all diſeaſes are either informed from Senſe, or euident by reaſon, or ſcrutable by artificiall coniecture. Examples of the firſt kinde are manifeſt, when with our eyes we behold the motion and Senſe externall and other outward functions of the body, either aboliſhed, or in an high degree depriued of their power and naturall vſe.</p>
               <p>This certaine teſtimony of our ſight doth certainely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the vnderſtanding, concerning the dangerous iſſue.</p>
               <p>Examples of the ſecond kinde are manifeſt likewiſe we finde either the cauſes of diſeaſes vnremoueably fixed, or the diſeaſe it ſelfe rooted in the ſubſtance of any of the principall parts, or accidents in malignitie, vehemence, and fury irreſiſtable. In theſe caſes a doubtfull and hard iſſue is euident to Reaſon by iuſt conſequent.</p>
               <p>Examples of the latter kind are alſo apparent, when in diſeaſes, good and euill ſignes are ſo doubtfully mixed, that ſome promiſe Life, others as much threaten Death: ſome in number diſcourage, other ſome in worth as much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage. We doe oft ſee and know in the middeſt of this miſt and darknes, where there appeareth not to a common ſenſe ſo much as the leaſt ſhew of any indication of certaine iſſue; yet through the exquiſiteneſſe of prudent &amp; artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perpenſion, and due exact diſtinction in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſeeming inſcrutable oddes; the learned Phyſicion euen in the firſt ſcarce ſenſible budding of indication, and in the firſt moſt imperfect and ſcarce-being thereof doth oft diſcouer that true euent, which vſually and for the moſt part is ſeene and obſerued to come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>If any man not rightly apprehending reaſon, make a doubt or queſtion of any ſuch poſſible exquiſitnes, let him conſider and behold it by an eaſie example. In an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie of one and the ſame Vermiculant pulſe, where the beginning of the ſame diſtenſion is quicker, the next conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation or middle part is ſlower, and the beginning of the and thereof, ending almoſt before it begin: it muſt needes be very difficult, nay, almoſt impoſſible vnto the firſt view of Senſe or Reaſon, or to a common iudgement or learning,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9304:16"/>
to diuide really, and diſtinguiſh this one ſhort ſmall motion into two or three diſtinct times and parts of motion, the ſpace ſo very ſhort, the faculty of mouing ſo low and weake, and the mouing it ſelfe almoſt altogether in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible exiguitie, and an indiuiſible degree of lowneſſe.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee oft-times a common vulgar cannot in his reaſon conceiue it, much leſſe by his ſenſe at all perceiue it. Neither is it found eaſie to euery man, though learned therein, yea, or educate thereto, either perfectly to apprehend the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Idea of ſuch a motion, or at all in the firſt proofes and tryals of his ſenſe or hand to deprehend any particular. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Phyſicion that exquiſitely diſcerneth and iudgeth, doth both in reaſon ſee, that euery ſingle ſmalleſt motion, hath his diuers diſtinct diuiſion of parts, &amp; alſo by his diſcerning, wary, iudicious and exerciſed touch, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partly detect and diſcouer it: And thus hath been proued by ſeueral inſtances taken in the art of Phyſicke, inſteade of al other Arts and Sciences, for auoiding tediouſneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that all knowledge, all Art, all Science whatſoeuer giuen vnto man, hath no other entrance, meanes, or wayes thereto, but thorow Senſe or Reaſon, or prudent and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall coniecture, ſagacitie and exquiſiteneſſe of iudging and diſcerning thereby.</p>
               <p>And that it may the better appeare, that beyond theſe waies and lights, the Phyſicion cannot finde any knowledge or diſcouery of Diſeaſes: let vs view ſome particular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſome Diſeaſes for this cauſe vndiſcouerable and not to be detected: and therewith conſider the impoſsibilitie of diſcouery to conſiſt ſolely herein; namely, for that they are remoued from any capacitie of Senſe or Reaſon, and from the reach of all artificiall ſearch, ſcrutiny &amp; accurate inſight deriued from both, which is the higheſt ſtraine of humane Vnderſtanding. In the generall it cannot be denied (except of ſuch whoſe vnderſtandings are extremely blinde) that it is impoſſible, that thoſe diſeaſes ſhould or can bee at all ſo much as ſuſpected (and therefore much leſſe knowne) which yeeld no ſhew, no ſigne, no indication of themſelues. There
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9304:16"/>
needeth hereof no other, nor better proofe, then the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of ſome particular diſeaſes of this kinde.</p>
               <p>Are not diuers ſecret and hidden Apoſtemations, and other inward collections of vicious matter in the body, dayly Seminaries of vnexpected and wondred ſhapes of corruption and putrifaction, which lying long hidden in the body, and by an inſenſible growth taking deepe roote, in the end ſodainely breake forth beyond all poſsible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, or thought of the moſt excellent, exquiſite and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till circumſpection and diſquiſition? For a briefe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereof, <hi>Hollerius</hi> doth mention a man, the cauſe of whoſe diſeaſe while he liued, being vnknowne to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicions, and Art, after his deceaſe his guts were ſound gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened and periſhed, and therein things viewed like vnto Water-ſnakes, and his Liuer full of ſchirroſe knots.</p>
               <p>There happened vnto my ſelfe this yeare laſt paſt, a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, a very worthy Gentleman, who being extremely vexed with the Strangury, Diſurie, and Iſchurie together with piſſing of blood in great abundance, and the ſtone, by the vſe and accommodation of remedies, found much eaſe, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of paines, and qualification of the extremitie of all the former accidents. Notwithſtanding, for that there were certaine indications of an Vlcer in the body or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the Bladder, his recouerie was not expected, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deceaſe, in the diſſection of his body, his Bladder was found rotten, broken and black, without any manifeſt matter therein as cauſe thereof, or ſo much as one ſtone, although hee had formerly and immediately before auoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many ſtones at ſeuerall times. This I produce, being freſh in memory, as an inſtance of impoſſibilitie of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vnto a Phyſicion in many and frequent caſes. For how could the fracture or colour of his Bladder, while the Patient was liuing, by any exquiſiteneſſe of Art or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, be knowne in any poſſibilitie, meanes, or power of man, although all the other accidents aboue mentioned, were vndoubtedly, by certaine indications and ſignes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered? I might here deliuer many other like Examples
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9304:17"/>
out of mine owne knowledge; I will onely call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance one more.</p>
               <p>I was of late yeares Phyſicion vnto a right Noble Lady; the cauſe of whoſe apparent dangerous eſtate, diuers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and famous Phyſicions conioyned with my ſelfe, could neuer diſcouer. In the diſſection of her body after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, her heart was found in cloſed with a ſhining rotten gelly, and the very ſubſtance of the heart of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Lady, an intolerable paine about the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of her ſtomack, by fits depriued her of all eaſe by day, and of reſt by night, and could neuer be either knowne in the cauſe, or remooued in the accident by any meane or remedy: but after death, in the diſſection of her body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, a black round gelly as bigge as a Tenice ball, did manifeſt it ſelfe in that place, where, in her life, the intolerable paine was ſeated and fixed.</p>
               <p>Of this euill diſcoloration of her heart, of the matter and euill colour of that matter wherewith her heart was inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; as alſo of that collected gelly in her ſtomacke, what poſſible knowledge (thinke you) or exquiſite vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or art of man could euer in her life time giue any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or information? Like vnto this is that which <hi>Holle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in the 21. of his rare obſeruations doth mention. In a ſicke man perplexed in a ſtrange manner from an vnknowne cauſe in his life, after his death his liuer and epiploon did appeare corrupted and putrified, his ſtomacke toward the bottome bruiſed and full of blacke iuice or humour. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophorus Schillincus,</hi> opening the body of a childe after death, reporteth, that hee ſaw in the ſmall veines, running thorow the ſubſtance of the liuer, many ſmall ſcrauling wormes then liuing. <hi>Beniuenius</hi> doth make mention of a woman tormented grieuouſly by a needle in her ſtomack, which was impoſſible by any art or exquiſitneſſe of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to bee conceiued or ſuſpected, if nature it ſelfe working it out thorow the body and ſubſtance of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, vnto the outward view and Senſe, had not ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9304:17"/>
it. I will not here mention the generation of wormes, ſtones, and the like in the guts, gall, heart, longs and other parts, of which no Art, or excellence of knowledge can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly take notice, vntill they haue prooued themſelues vnto the fight. Many diſeaſes of theſe kindes being fearefull and terrible accidents, and afflictions vnto the body, yet for the moſt part are neuer detected; becauſe they haue not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no proper true certaine likely, but no poſsible meanes or way of indication or notice at all, in any reaſon or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of humane Art or Science; without which the moſt exquiſite and Scientificall Clarkes are altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, and muſt neceſſarily bee ignorant. Thus hath beene at large manifeſted, that nothing can bee vnto the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in his Art and Science knowne, which either by outward Senſe or inward is not apparent, or by likely and artificiall coniecture from both, is not detected or diſcerned. The like might bee vrged concerning the trials of Lawe and Iuſtice, and inquiſitions of offences and errors againſt the Law, which are the diſeaſes of a Common-weale, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the body of man. Many offences againſt the Lawe are apparent vnto the outward Senſe, as ſight or hearing: and therefore being witneſſed by hearers or beholders, are without doubt or difficultie immediately diſpatched, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed, and adiudged. Many alſo are euident to reaſon, which therefore are held and reputed inuincibly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly to conuince.</p>
               <p>Many offences alſo there are, neither manifeſt to Senſe, nor euident to reaſon, againſt which onely likelihood and preſumptions doe ariſe in iudgement; whereby notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, through narrow ſearch and ſifting, ſtrict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, circumſpect &amp; curious view of euery circumſtance, together with euery materiall moment and oddes thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vnto the depth and bottome by ſubtill diſquiſition fadomed, the learned, prudent, and diſcerning Iudge doeth oft detect and bring vnto light many hidden, inteſtine, and ſecret miſchiefes, which vnſenſibly and vnobſeruedly would otherwiſe oppreſſe and ſubuert the Common-weale, When
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9304:18"/>
by none of theſe wayes of extrication the trueth can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be gained, the wiſe and vpright Iudge vnto neceſſitie in want of due warrant vnto iuſt proceeding, doeth with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſobrietie ſubmit. For this cauſe (as may be ſeene vpon records) many caſes iuſtly neceſſarily and vnauoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtand perpetually inſcrutable, vndecided and neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, as certaine proofes &amp; euidences of the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and annihilation of mans knowledge in many things of this life: Almightie God oft-times decreeing to hide ſome trueth from the ſight of man, and detaining it in his owne ſecret will and pleaſure.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT hath beene at large before declared, how God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue limited and confined all knowledge of man, within certaine wayes and bounds, out of which, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it cannot paſſe; as alſo for that cauſe, that no iuſtifiable Art or true Science whatſoeuer, doeth or can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe reſtraints. There haue bin alſo diuers examples produced of the neceſſitie of mans ignorance, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie of much knowledge, and diſcouery of things hidden and inhibited by the iuſt and vnſearchable decrees of God and Nature. It remaineth now to enquire concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our particular ſubiect of Witch-craft, whether in the common way of all other detections of trueths, it ought likewiſe conſiſt; or whether by it ſelfe it haue other priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges beyond all other trials. If reaſon be the ſole eye and light of naturall vnderſtanding which God hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reaſonable man (as is before prooued.) If without it can be no naturall knowledge, no Art, no Science, no diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. If Law among all people and nations be ſo iuſt in all things, as to doe or allow nothing againſt true reaſon (in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9304:18"/>
which conſiſteth right.) If God himſelfe, and all flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Common-weales haue tyed men and Lawes, and the deciſion by them of all doubts, queſtions and controuerſies, either vnto right proofe, euidence and allegation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto reaſon, or at leaſt, faire likelihood, preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and probabilitie; and beyond theſe there neuer was, is, or can bee any iuſt iudgement or triall: How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that man can attaine any knowledge of Witch-craft, if not by thoſe meanes, by which onely his nature is capable of whatſoeuer is allotted to bee knowne thereto? If this bee infallibly true, man muſt either by the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wayes of knowledge and detection, know likewiſe and detect Witch-craft, or elſe bee altogether ignorant thereof; whereof the contrary by dayly experience is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. It may bee and is obiected, that it is a hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to detect Witch-craft, by the former and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſes, as is oft ſeene and found apparent. So is it likewiſe equally difficult, and as hard by the ſame meanes oft times, for many a iuſt man to prooue and cleere his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed innocency, and for many an iniuriouſly wronged wretch to prooue his right, to defend his goods, yea, life it ſelfe from violence; notwithſtanding, this is no allowance vnto another way, no reaſon or iuſtification of any vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted way, or way out of the way of Reaſon, Iuſtice, and Law, bee his burden neuer ſo importable, or his iniury ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding crueltie.</p>
               <p>For, if God had allowed vnto men alwayes ſmooth, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, certaine and infallible wayes vnto the ſatisfaction of their wants, and the accompliſhment of their intentions and deſires without failing; what would become of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Vertue, and Wiſedome? Then ſhould euery man be alike wiſe, and men would bee ſo confident in their owne ſtrength and power, and ſo proud, that they would forget God and neuer thinke of the Almighty. If the meanes and wayes vnto all knowledge, and the information of our deſires and affections, did meete with no impediment, no oppoſition, no contradiction, no caſualty to intercept, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9304:19"/>
all things ſhould proſperouſly ſucceed vnto our meanes and endeuours, there would neuer bee any vſe of Patience, Temperance, or dependance vpon the diuine prouidence; and conſequently, little acknowledgement, and leſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and adoration of our Creator, who according to his wiſedome, good will and pleaſure, doth otherwiſe gouerne, guide, order and diſpoſe all things. For if vnto our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed needfull ends, vſes and neceſſary deſires were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vncontrouled wayes, nothing impoſsible, nothing denyed; then were our luſt a Lawe, and man in no power but in his owne, in no awe, in no Law, in no rule.</p>
               <p>Therefore Almightie God in his great and vnſpeakeable Wiſedome hath ſubiected vaine man, and made his pride ſubiect to infinite creatures, limits, reſtraints, coertions, thereby to teach him true wiſedome, pietie, truſt, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, worſhip, and adoration of his all-reſtraining and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limiting vnlimited power. Man therefore muſt thereby learne to be contented ſo to know, as therewith to learne to know himſelfe; that is, with his large portion, his lot, his manifold indowments, his excellencie of Senſe, Reaſon, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Prudence, Art, not to forget or ſpurne at their interdictions, prohibitions, and inioyned liſts, beyond which to deſire to know, is curioſitie, is folly: <hi>Sapientia, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra nolle nimis ſapere,</hi> ſaith the Poet. It is true Wiſedome, not to bee too wiſe: that is, not to know, nor deſire to know more then is allowed or needfull: needfull, not in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but Gods Decree.</p>
               <p>Here then let me intreat reaſonable men, not too much (as is vſuall) to ſwell with indignation, or to be puffed with impatience, where God doth not apertly reueale &amp; plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as they deſire and thinke needfull) the ſubtill engines, and myſticall craft of the Diuell in the Machinations of Witches and Sorcerers; but ſoberly, modeſtly, and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo farre forth be contented to purſue the tryall and iuſt way of their diſcouery, as with ſenſe, with reaſon, with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is iuſt and righteous, knowing that whatſoeuer is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe liſts, is reaſonleſſe, ſenſeleſſe, and impious.</p>

For ſince God and Nature (as is before ſaid) hath limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſcrutinie of all true Arts, and Sciences, all naturall knowledge for diſcouerie of controuerſies and reſolutions vnto the lights of Reaſon and Senſe, &amp; artificiall coniecture, prudence, Art, Sagacitie, and ſubtiltie of vnderſtanding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from thence; vnto that other barre or ſeate of Iuſtice can Witch-craft appeale or be brought?</p>
               <p>It may be obiected, the Art of Witch-craft, being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and the practice thereof ſuſtained by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power; that therefore the meanes and wayes of diſcouerie muſt bee likewiſe more then ordinary and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall.</p>
               <p>Hereto is truely anſwered, that ſince the nature and power of Spirits is vnknowne vnto man (as all things ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall) and can bee, and is no otherwiſe knowne, but by examining the workes iſſuing from thence, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them aright with that which is naturall (becauſe man in his Reaſon and vnderſtanding cannot diſcerne that which is truely tranſcending his Nature, otherwiſe, then obſeruing how farre it exceedeth that which is according to Nature:) therefore (I ſay) the workes of the Diuell, or Witches, though ſuſtained and produced by a ſupernaturall power, yet can haue no other way for their detection by man, but that which is ordinary vnto man, and naturall and poſſible vnto man; for that which is aboue or beyond his power, or Nature, is not his owne. From hence muſt neceſſarily be concluded, that there is no other ordinary way vnto man (who knoweth or can know nothing but that is naturall) vnto the diſcouerie of that is ſupernaturall, but that way which is likewiſe naturall. Although therefore the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of Witch-craft require a greater meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to diſcerne that which is therein really, and truely ſupernaturall, from that which in nature oft times hath a very great likeneſſe, and a deceiueable ſimilitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: yet is the way vnto that knowledge, the common high way which conducteth vnto all other knowledge whatſoeuer. And that this alſo is the ſame way &amp; direction,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9304:20"/>
which the holy Scripture it ſelfe doeth intend, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of witches, and their ſentenſing is manifeſt. <hi>Num.</hi> 39. 30. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6. and 19. 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 17. 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 28. In theſe named places it is required, that no man bee iudged in matter of weight, or death, but by the teſtimony of two witneſſes, at the leaſt. Witch-craft therefore being a matter, both of weight, and death, cannot according vnto Gods word, bee iudged but by teſtimony of witneſſes: whatſoeuer is witneſſed, muſt neceſſarily bee ſubiect to ſenſe, ſince no man can witneſſe ought, whereof there is not ſenſe. From hence then it is ineuitably concluded, that the workes of Witches, are no other way to bee diſcerned, or iudged, but by the common way of diſcouery, by deedes, and workes apparent to ſenſe, and the teſtimony thereof. Let men then bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and contented (ſince God hath alotted, and allowed vnto the nature and power of man no other way) in this onely warranted true way to ſeeke the diſcouery, to finde the footing, path, and ſteppings of Witch-craft, as of all other things, which by the Decree of God are reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto man, and ſubiect vnto the knowledge of man. It may bee here demanded, whether Almighty God doth not extraordinarily, and miraculouſly at ſome time diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this ſo abominable ſinne of Witch-craft, aſwell as by ordinary meanes leaue it vnto diſcouerie? This doubt ſhall more fitly in more due place be hereafter at large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed. It hath now beene here manifeſted, that there is or can bee no other ordinary tryall of Witch-craft, then that which is common vnto all other detections of trueth: and alſo that all detections ſubiect vnto the diſcouerie of man (as hath beene before cleared) are drawne and deriued either from Senſe or Reaſon, or likely probability raiſed from both.</p>

               <p>BEfore wee proceed further to treate concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Witch-craft, according to the former waies of diſcouery and inueſtigation: it will be needfull to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh who is the true Author, cauſe, and immediate workman of the ſupernaturall workes which by Sorcery and Witch-craft are compaſſed or brought to paſſe.</p>
               <p>All created ſubſtances indowed with powers and vertue from God their Creator, are either bodily, or corporall ſubſtances, or ſpirituall, or mixt and betweene both.</p>
               <p>Bodily and corporall ſubſtances are the heauens, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies of the Starres, of the Sunne, of the Moone; the bodies of the elements, and all elementarie ſubſtances from them deriued and compoſed.</p>
               <p>Spirituall ſubſtances are either Angels, or Diuels, or ſoules of men after death, ſeparated from their bodies.</p>
               <p>Mixed ſubſtances, partly Spirituall, partly bodily, are mankinde compounded of a naturall body, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſoule.</p>
               <p>Hence it commeth to paſſe, that man by his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spirit, doth together with Angels, Spirits, and Diuels, participate and vnderſtand many things; as the Scripture reuealed; the Hiſtory and Creation of the whole world; many truths of God; the grounds of Reaſon; the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9304:21"/>
of Nature; many generall rules and obſeruations, and infinite particular obiects of many things paſt, preſent, and to come. But for that this vnderſtanding Soule is depreſſed, and impriſoned in this life by the body, by the paſſions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and manifold incumbrances thereof, and cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or inlarge it ſelfe further vnto any portion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then thorow the narrow windowes, cloſures, parts and organs of the body: therefore muſt neceſſarily the knowledge of man be much inferiour vnto that meaſure of knowledge, which Spirits, being of a more ſubtill eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and free from the burden and incumbrance of an earthly tabernacle or priſon, doe in a more large extent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.</p>
               <p>As is ſaid of the difference of knowledge in Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power and nature of man: ſo may be ſaid from the ſame reaſon of the difference of the workes of ſpirits, farre inlarging and extending their vertue and power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power and force of men.</p>
               <p>The workes of men, are confined within the power and nature of theſe ſublunarie bodies, vnto which they are annexed, and tyed.</p>
               <p>The workes of Spirits are limited to no corporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or body, but ſpaciouſly compaſſe the whole and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall body of the ſublunary or inferiour world (as the Diuell doth witneſſe of himſelfe, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 7.) and are not tied vnto any particular place, but rule generally therin, and in all places by the permiſſion of God, as is euident, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. where the Diuell is called the Prince that ruleth in the ayre, euen the Spirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience: and likewiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>verſe.</hi> 12. where he is called the Prince of darkneſſe of this world.</p>
               <p>From theſe vndoubted grounds, it is neceſſarily inferred, that both all knowledge exceeding the knowledge of man, muſt needs iſſue from the knowledge of Spirits, and alſo that all workes exceeding and tranſcendent, aboue the power and nature of corporall ſubſtances, muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9304:21"/>
be the force of Spirits. It may now be demaunded, how the workes of good Spirits ſhall be knowne and diſtinguiſhed from the workes of euill Spirits and diuels, ſince both their workes proceede from the ſame nature, ſubſtance, and ſpirituall eſſence common vnto them both. This ſhall appeare by the conſideration of the orders and ſorts of good Spirits, expreſſed in holy Scripture, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, beſides which, all other are neceſſarily euill, and therefore diuels; like vnto whom likewiſe, by iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent muſt be their workes, the one reciprocally <note n="*" place="margin">Angeli boni non poſſunt per care, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmati per gratiam.

All good Spirits are either Angels and Meſſengers of God, ſpecially ſent with his holy embaſſage, to ſpeciall holy men, for ſpeciall holy ends; as was the Seraphinſent vnto <hi>Iſaiah, the</hi> 6. <hi>Chapter, verſe</hi> 6. and as were the Angels vnto the Shepheards, when our Sauiour was borne, or as were the Angels which were ſent vnto the Patriarches of olde, or els tutelar Angels, ordinarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to guide, protect, and defend the Elect and choſen children of God, as is manifeſt both by the teſtimony of our Sauiour, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe.</hi> 10. See that you deſpiſe not (ſaith our bleſſed Sauiour) one of theſe little ones: For I ſay vnto you, that in heauen their Angels alway behold the face of my Father, which is in heauen.

Beſide theſe orders of good and holy Spirits, neither hath the holy Scripture, neither hath the light of reaſon, or nature, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, knowne or diſcouered any other.</p>
               <p>All the workes likewiſe and employments of theſe good Spirits, are all and euer obſerued to be like themſelues, holy, good, freely ſeruing and miniſtring vnto the expreſſe will, knowne and vndoubted pleaſure of Almighty God, as is certainly confirmed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>verſe</hi> 20.

Likewiſe, was not the Diuels carriage of the body of our Sauiour, and ſetting it vpon a pinacle of the Temple, manifeſt to the eye? Was not the fire which the diuell <note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 1. ver. 16.</note> brought done from heauen in ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner, and in ſo extraordinary power to deuoure ſo many thouſands of <hi>Iobs</hi> ſheepe, truly viſible?

But it may be obiected, that theſe examples out of the holy Scriptures are recorded as things ſpecially ſeene, or noted in ſome ſpeciall ages &amp; times, which after-times &amp; other ages doe not, or cannot affoord.</p>
               <p>The contrary is manifeſt by the faithfull hiſtories and true reports of Ethnicke writers, who liuing in diſtant ages, do not differ in the true conſent and harmony of the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, concerning the ſame things, as they haue ſucceeded in their ſeuerall ages. It is not incredible, but certaine vnto any common Reader, what diuers authors of approoued faith and credit, in ſeuerall ages haue written: how the diuell not onely out of the bodies and ſeuerall parts, <note n="*" place="margin">Oracula e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita ſunt per pudenda pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellae.

                  <hi>Ventriloqui,</hi> and the like. The ſecond was neuer hid many hundreth of yeares, for many ages long before the birth of our bleſſed Sauiour, as is apparent by the famous Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> the Oake of <hi>Dodona,</hi> the Statue of <hi>Memnon. Petrus Gregorius Tholoſanus,</hi> in his <hi>Syntagma Juris,</hi> reciteth this hiſtory concerning certaine ſtatues at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that they did fall vnto the ground ſudainly, and with an audible voice declared the death of <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Emperour, euen at the ſame moment and point of time when he was then ſlaine at Rome.</p>
               <p>As the Diuell doth ſhew himſelfe by voices and ſounds in trees, caues, ſtatues, and the like: ſo doth he in diuers other outward ſhapes and formes of other creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:9304:23"/>
Thus he appeared vnto <hi>Eua,</hi> and ſpake vnto her in the ſhape of a Serpent aforeſaid. Of his appearance in diuers other formes likewiſe are many Teſtimonies. Neither doe Philoſophers differ or doubt herein. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſickes</hi> hath theſe words. <gap reason="foreign">

That is, ſubſtances are called ſimple bodies, as water, earth, fire and the like, and things compounded thereof, as liuing creatures and ſpirits: which is ſo farre forth to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of ſpirits, as they were in aſſumed ſhapes viſible. <hi>Orpheus</hi> doth number ſixe kinds of theſe viſible diuels or ſpirits. <gap reason="foreign">

Vnto this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the apparitions of Spirits variety of ſtory likewiſe doth bring forth faith and credit.

by <hi>Iohn de Serres</hi> the French Chronicler, that the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed K. of France, <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. being in his hunting ſports, a Diuell or Spirit preſented vnto the Kings eares and his whole company, a great cry of hounds, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of hornes. The King commanded Count <hi>Soiſſons</hi> to goe ſee who it was, wondering who durſt interrupt his game.

               <p>IT now followeth to giue examples of ſuch ſupernaturall workes as are offered by the Diuell, wherein man hath an intereſt and propertie by contract with the Diuel; as alſo to ſhew that theſe workes are manifeſt in like manner vnto the outward ſenſe. Vnto this proofe out of holy Scripture, behold the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> Did not <hi>Saul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with her, and ſhe promiſe vnto <hi>Saul</hi> to bring vp <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel</hi> vnto him?

               <p>And as the holy Scripture doth afford vs theſe examples, ſo are the hiſtories of all ages, people, and countries, fraught with the like as manifeſt to ſenſe as theſe, and as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently detecting and pointing out the Sorcerer and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liuy</hi> reporteth, in thoſe ancient dayes of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Romane Claudia,</hi> a veſtall Virgin, did ſhew her ſelfe in act, able alone with eaſe and facilitie to draw a mighty ſhip by a ſmall line or girdle, which was in the weight and greatneſſe vnmoueable, againſt the force and power of many ſtrong men, aſſiſted by the ſtrength of cattell accuſtomed to draw mighty and heauy burdens. That this was an act ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and aboue, and beyond any naturall vertue or force in her Nature, is madneſſe to doubt. That in this ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall act alſo, ſhe had a propertie by her allowance and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9304:25"/>
thereof, expreſſed by her voluntarie action of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and drawing; who can make doubt? The act was ſupernaturall, and aboue her power and nature: her good will, allowance, and voluntary putting the act in practice, did proue her conſent, if not contract, with that power and nature ſuperiour vnto her owne, which is vndoubtedly, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and Witch-craft. To this purpoſe, ſaith <hi>Binsfieldius, Explicat. in praelud.</hi> 5. <hi>Requiritar in maleficio hominis libera voluntas quam Diabolus non potest cogere, ſed perſuadere tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aut terrere.</hi> That is, in Witch-craft neceſſarily the will, or conſent of man, muſt concurre with the Diuels worke, for the Diuell cannot force, or compell the will of man, but perſwadeth it onely, or affrighteth it. And againe hee ſaith, that whoſoeuer doeth pretend to doe thoſe things, which are aboue the power, and reach of man, by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes, which cauſes are allowed no ſuch effects, either in nature, or in Gods word, or by any ordinance of of his Church, that man doeth cloſely, or tacitly inuocate the Diuell. <hi>Quoties (inquit) quis contendit illud facere, per cauſas naturales, quae nec virtute ſua naturali, neque ex diuina aut Eccleſiaſtica poſſunt illud facere, Tacitè in vocatur Daemon.</hi>

               <p>The like is reported by <hi>Ianus, Iacobus, Boiſſardus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Germane Count in his booke <hi>de Diuinatione.</hi> It is related vpon good record, that <hi>Decius Actius</hi> the Augur, was able to report vnto <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the Romane King, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9304:26"/>
very particular which he intended, &amp; prepared in his moſt ſecret deſignes. It is written of the <hi>Euthuſiaſtes,</hi> or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Caſtabala,</hi> a towne of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> that they would walke vſually, &amp; voluntarily, with naked &amp; bare feet, vpon hot burning coales, without any hurt, or alteration by the fire. It is recorded concerning <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that hee would by certaine ſecret words, compell a feeding Oxe, Bullocke, or the like, immediately to ſtand ſtill, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare his meat. Others report of him, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand wild beaſts, and Birds, Beates, and Eagles, to come vnto him, to grow tame, to follow him. It is credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the ſame <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that hee was at once by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall parties ſeene, in the very ſame point of time, both in the Citie of <hi>Thurium,</hi> and the towne of <hi>Metapontum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> likewiſe was tranſlated, as it were, in the twinkling of an eye, or in the ſpace of a word ſpeaking from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> vnto <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as ſome Hiſtories report. That the power by which theſe things were done, was more then humane, no Reaſon can doubt. That alſo the voluntary acceſſion of theſe mens diſpoſing, or apting themſelues vnto theſe workes, doeth prooue their conſent, and by conſent in conſequence of reaſon, ſocietie with a Spirit, who can doubt? And for this cauſe, <hi>Binsfieldius</hi> termeth it a tacit contract, as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But here by the way, is iuſt occaſion offered vnto a queſtion; namely, whether a Spirit or Diuell can cauſe or bring to paſſe, that the ſame true body at once may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in two diſtant places, as it ſeemeth by this hiſtory of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwere hereto muſt needes in reaſon bee negatiue; becauſe it is impoſſible in nature, and in the ordinary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable courſe of all things by God created, that one indiuiduall and continued ſubſtance, or entire thing ſhould be wholly diuided from it ſelfe, and yet be it ſelfe, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be twice, or bee in two places, and yet bee but one and the ſelfe ſame thing.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore rather here thinke that the diuell is a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9304:26"/>
Iuggler, preſenting the liuely ſhape and pourtraiture of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in one place, and thereto haply by his ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power, adding a connterfait liuelihood of ſpeech and geſture, while the true ſubſtance is certainely and truly ſeen in another place. That theſe like practiſes are vſuall with the diuell, is apparent in many other kinds beſide. Did hee not vndertake, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 8. vnto wiſdome it ſelfe our bleſſed Sauiour, to ſhew vnto him all the Kingdomes of the earth, a thing ſo farre out of his reach and compaſſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a lying and iugling viſion? If this he doeth vnto the Sonne of God, how ſhall the ſilly ſonnes of ſinfull men eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape? It is written by ſome Authors, that the diuell hath perſwaded ſome fooliſh Sorcerers and Witches, that hee hath changed their bodies and ſubſtances, into Catts, Aſſes, Birds, and other creatures, which <note n="*" place="margin">Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationes in cattos aut lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice et per praeſtigias et non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter fiunt. Auguſt. de Ciuit. Dei cap. 18.</note> really and indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out illuſion (if it be not preſumption to reaſon with the Diuell) is impoſſible vnto him to doe. For there can bee no reall or true matamorphoſing of one ſubſtance or nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, but either by creation or generation. The one is the ſole immediate hand of God, communicable to no creature (becauſe there cannot be two Creators) the other is naturall, the finger-worke and power of God in nature, and proper to the nature of liuing animate creatures, not to Angels or Spirits.</p>
               <p>Againe, creation is the worke of an infinite power, and therefore of God alone, becauſe there can be but one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, whoſe nature containing all things, and contained of nothing, can admit no equall, no ſecond, no other. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell then cannot create. That likewiſe he cannot cauſe theſe tranſmutations by generation, is as plaine and euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a true and reali generation hath many precedent <note n="*" place="margin">Generatio non eſt niſi in tempore <abbr>idq</abbr> apparata ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria per ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutationis. quam Graec. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9304:27"/>
and therefore are no true, but ſeeming and iuggling tranſmutations.</p>
               <p>Here may be againe obiected, that the Diuell is able to worke aboue the power of Nature; and therefore beſide and aboue the naturall courſe of generation, hee is able to make theſe reall tranſmutations. It is anſwered, though the diuell indeed, as a Spirit, may doe, and doth many things aboue and beyond the courſe of ſome particular natures: yet doth hee not, nor is able to rule or command ouer generall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or infringe or alter her inuiolable decrees in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and neuer-interrupted order of all generations; neither is he generally Maſter of vniuerſall Nature, but Nature Maſter and Commaunder of him. For Nature is nothing els but the ordinary <note n="a" place="margin">Natura eſt ordinaria Dei poteſtas. Scalig.</note> power of God in all things created, among which the Diuell being a creature, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and therefore ſubiect to that vniuerſall power.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe, although aboue the power of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular nature, the Diuell as a Spirit doth many things, which in reſpect of our nature, are ſupernaturall; yet in reſpect of the power of Nature in vniuerſall, they are but naturall vnto himſelfe and other Spirits, who alſo are a kinde of creature contained within the generall nature of things created: Oppoſite therefore, contrarie, againſt or aboue the generall <note n="*" place="margin">Natura eſt vniuerſalis, eſt particularis.</note> power of Nature, he can doe nothing: Therefore, to conclud this point, he cannot be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund or compaſſe any generation aboue the power of Nature, whoſe power is more vniuerſall and greater then his. We will then hence conclude, that aboue and beyond the vniuerſall Nature and courſe of all generation, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a true tranſmutation of the ſubſtance of any one creature into another.</p>
               <p>It was before prooued, that it is impoſſible for him to doe it by creation. It is here manifeſt, that he cannot doe it by any courſe of true generation. There can be no real tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of one ſubſtance into another, without either a creation or generation. Wee will therefore conclude with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9304:27"/>
the ſaying of Saint <hi>Auguſtine de Ciuitate Dei, lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Nec ſane Daemones naturas creant, ſed ſpecie tenus, quae à Deo creata ſunt, commutant, vt videantur eſſe quae non ſunt:</hi> that is, diuels cannot create any nature or ſubſtance, but in iuggling ſhew or ſeeming onely, whereby with falſe ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and outward induced ſhapes couering thoſe things which are created of God, by theſe commutations they cauſe them to ſeeme that which they are not indeed.</p>
               <p>Concerning other manifeſt iugglings and illuſions of the Diuell, diuers authors haue giuen diuers examples, but that which aboue all the reſt doth moſt palpably detect him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is a hiſtory related by <hi>Ioannes Baptiſta Porta</hi> in his ſecond booke <hi>De Magia naturali.</hi> He there witneſſeth, that vpon the Diuels ſuggeſtion, a Witch beleeued firmely, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her ſelfe, that all the night ſhe had rid in the ayre, ouer diuers great Mountaines, and met inconuenticles of other Sorcereſſes; when the ſame night the mentioned Authour himſelfe, with others, had watched and ſeene her, all that imagined time of her tranſuection in the ayre, to be within her chamber profoundly ſleeping; yea, had ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her, made her fleſh blue with ſtrokes, and could not a wake her, nor perſwade her afterward, when ſhee was a waked that they had ſo vſed her, or at all had either ſeene or beheld her. Thus preualent was the iuggling power of the Diuell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Auſtine de Ciuitate Dei, lib.</hi> 18. doth deliuer an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory concerning the father of one <hi>Praeſtantius,</hi> who lying in a deep traunce ſo profoundly that no meanes could awake him, did dreame (as when he awaked he did report) that hee was transformed into an Aſſe, and carried bagges or burdens of corne into a campe of Souldiers. At the ſame time, in the ſame manner, ſuch a like Aſſe as hee in dreame imagined himſelfe did bring ſuch burdens into the ſame campe.</p>
               <p>From theſe examples may bee iuſtly drawne a plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Diuels palpable iuggling and illuſion, which alſo may ſerue for confirmation, together with the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9304:28"/>
reaſons before annexed vnto my former anſwer, concerning the Diuels ſeeming, or deceitfull preſentation of the reall body of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in two diſtant places at once, in the ſame point of time. And from all theſe conioined and conferred, may be truely inferred and collected, that the Diuell as hee doth many ſupernaturall workes really, ſo he doth many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by illuſion and beguiling the imagination.</p>
               <p>Theſe his iugglings notwithſtanding are things alſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, and tricks onely poſsible to Spirits and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to man. For it is impoſsible to man to frame ſo liuely a ſeeming preſence of man in one place, that it ſhall not bee diſcerned otherwiſe then the very ſame true preſence &amp; real ſubſtance which is really in another place, as alſo to faſten ſuch dreames as were before mentioned, vpon men, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe dreames to cauſe the things dreamed, by the witneſſe and teſtimony of other beholders, to bee brought to paſſe in ſo liuely likeneſſe and ſimilitude, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee diſcerned and diſcouered otherwiſe then the very ſame that they were in dreame likewiſe beleeued.</p>
               <p>From hence it doth alſo follow very neceſſarily, that what man ſoeuer ſhall vndertake theſe ſupernaturall iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, which are onely poſsible in the power of Spirits, &amp; of the Diuell alone, is thereby as truely conuinced to bee a Witch or-Sorcerer, as he that vndertaketh any of the former reall ſupernaturall workes, or any other of the like kinde, becauſe they are both and all alike proper onely to the diuell, and wherein man can haue no property or power but by and through him. Let vs now then againe returne vnto the Diuels reall ſupernaturnall performances and workes, vnto Sorcerers, from whence by the way of anſwer vnto the former doubt, concerning <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his ſuppoſed realty of being at once in two places, we haue hitherto one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digreſſed.</p>
               <p>It is written as a thing vſuall vnto many famous Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Sorcerers and Witches, vnto the view and ſight of ſome admitted ſpectators, to raiſe reſemblances of the dead, which ſeemeth a thing vndoubted by the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi>

raiſing <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet vnto <hi>Saul</hi> the King before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>In this kinde thoſe famous and renowned Witches <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> and <hi>Circe</hi> in old and ancient times are reported to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Hence among the Heathen had <hi>Necromancie</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the name and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is diuination by calling vp, or raiſing the dead.</p>
               <p>Later times haue not been behinde former times in the record of the like: but to adde reaſon to inforce the truth of report herein; I will anſwer an obiection which may bee made. Whether in theſe apparitions there be onely illuſion and imagination; or ſome thing truely and really viſible vnto the outward ſenſe.</p>
               <p>As touching the reall raiſing of the dead, it is impoſſible vnto the limited power of the Diuell, either in the ſubſtance of body or ſoule, to reduce or bring the dead back into this world, or life, or ſenſe againe; becauſe in death, by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and vnalterable decree of God in his holy Writ, the body returneth into duſt from whence it came, and the Soule to God who gaue it.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, ſince the outward ſhape and figure, and proportion of any ſubſtance, and not the ſubſtance it ſelfe, or creature, is the true and naturall obiect of the eye, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who truely ſaith, <hi>Res non viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſed rerum ſpecies;</hi> that is, the ſubſtances or things themſelues are not offered, nor come vnto the ſight, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ſhape, and outward figure, as alſo for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and experience doe teach vs, that it is a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and impoſſible, that all thoſe bodies and ſubſtances, which in infinite number wee dayly ſee, and behold really and materially in their corporall ſubſtances, and dimenſions, ſhould be contained in the ſmall body of the eye: for theſe cauſes (I ſay) it is poſſible according to reaſon, that the Diuell in theſe ſuppoſed apparitions of the bodies and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of dead men, may preſent true, reall, and naturall obiects, certaine and aſſured vnto the eye and ſight, if hee can onely preſent thereto the outward liuely pourtraitures,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9304:29"/>
and ſhapes of the ſubſtances or bodies, though the bodies themſelues be away. That the Diuell can doe this, is no doubt. For if man by Art can vſually diuide the outward ſhapes, and figures of creatures and ſubſtances, from the ſubſtances and creatures themſelues (as is apparent by the looking glaſſe) and the cunning Painter can in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther borrowed ſubſtance, ſeparated from their true, right and proper ſubſtance, repreſent perfectly the true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhape of men, &amp; other creatures, euen when they are not onely abſent and remoued in farre diſtant places, but when oft-times they haue many yeares beene ſwallowed of the graue; why ſhould it be thought impoſſible vnto the Diuell (who certainely is more then exquiſite <hi>Apelles</hi> excellent) to offer and preſent vnto the eye likewiſe any true ſhape what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer?</p>
               <p>If he can offer the true ſhape (as is not to be doubted) he doth offer a true and perfect obiect; and therefore that which is truely and certainely manifeſt to ſenſe, although ſpeech and the motion thereof, without another viſible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſuſtaine it (being impoſſible vnto ſhapes and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures drawne by men) be things ſupernaturall, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirituall, which doe therefore make it a worke proper vnto the Diuell.</p>
               <p>And thus it is apparent, that the ſuppoſed apparitions which the Diuell doth offer of dead men, may be eſteemed and reckoned among ſuch ſupernaturall workes of diuels and Sorcerers, as manifeſtly are brought to outward ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Now let vs turne to view ſome other kinds of the ſame workes of the ſame Authors.</p>
               <p>It is reported by ſome Writers of worthy credit, that the bodies of Sorcerers &amp; Witches haue bin really carried, and locally remooued from on place into another by the diuell.</p>
               <p>And of later times (as <hi>Bartholomaeus de Spina</hi> doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) the inquiſitions haue condemned vnto perpetuall priſon, and their detained Witches, who by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and others proofe, haue by the Diuell been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into ſo farre diſtant places, in few houres, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9304:29"/>
it hath bin a trauell of many dayes, by their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power to returne againe from whence they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly by the diuell carried.</p>
               <p>It is a thing likewiſe written and vulgarly receiued, that Witches are oft-times ſeene bodily to haunt places, fields, houſes, graues, and ſepulchers, in an vnuſuall and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner and wondred faſhion. Theſe things, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite more, whether true or no, cannot be knowne, but to him that doth himſelfe behold, and can from his owne ſight auouch them really true, and not imaginarie. To performe ſome manner of aſportation, and locall tranſlation of the bodies of Witches and Sorcerers, it ſeemeth in reaſon a thing whereunto the Diuell is not vnable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that it appeareth within the power of a Spirit, by the hiſtory of the Prophet <hi>Habacuc,</hi> whom the Angel carried by the hayre of the head, out of <hi>Iudea</hi> into <hi>Babylon.</hi> The naturall faculties and properties of a Spirit, giuen in their creation, and by their eſſentiall formes vnited vnto them, the Diuell doth participate with all other Spirits whatſoever, though in his fall from heauen, he loſt their true happineſſe and perfect fruition in the face and fauour of God his Creator.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that there are vndoubted examples in holy Scripture, of the diuels power in the locall tranſlation, not onely of bodies inanimate: as fire, windes, tempeſts, houſes (as is apparent in the hiſtory of <hi>Iob)</hi> and of animate bodies alſo, or bodies of brute creatures (as is euident in the heards of ſwine which he carried head long into the Sea) but likewiſe of the bodies of men, as is cleere in the Goſpel, where it is ſaid, that the Diuell did caſt the bodies of the poſſeſſed into the middeſt of the people. If the Diuel could caſt, or carry their bodies the diſtance there expreſſed (whatſoeuer or how little ſo euer it was) it doth manifeſtly prooue his power, in the locall motion of mens bodies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the full extent of his power therein be not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thence collected.</p>
               <p>Concerning the taking the body of our Sauiour, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

it vpon a pinacle of the Temple, I will not vrge, but do conclude vpon my former reaſons ſufficiently and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Diuell, where God himſelfe doth not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, or prohibite him, hath power to diſpoſe and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our naturall <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>odies. I will not cite a multitude of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors herein and from them borrow needleſſe examples. As ſome may bee true, ſo I doe not beleeue all, and very few I wiſh truſted, where the proofe doth not manifeſtly exceede all exception.</p>
               <p>I conclude, that it is poſſible, that ſometimes the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power of the Diuell in this kinde, as in other before mentioned, may appeare vnto outward ſenſe manifeſt, and the Witch or Sorcerer be found a voluntarie with him. And as is ſaid of this kinde, ſo may be ſaid of many more beſides thoſe before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Concerning the manifeſt ſupernaturall workes done by Charmers, who is ignorant? To omit the hiſtories of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Charmers.</note> and <hi>Circe</hi> thoſe old famous Hags, who were ſeene by charmes immediately to cauſe graine to wither vpon the ground; the current of waters to ſtand ſtill; the ſtreame to runne backe againſt the courſe, ten peſts, raine, thunder, windes to riſe and fall at their word and command, for an aſſured teſtimonie of the true and reall harmes, which Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers manifeſtly vnto outward view and ſenſe did vnto the ancient world, is as yet extant ſo many hundreths of yeares, the Law of the twelue <hi>Romane</hi> Tables, wherein was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Statute made to preuent and reſtraine the manifeſt wrongs and iniuries of Charmers. <hi>Alienas Segetes ne incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato,</hi> ſaith the Law, <hi>Alienas Segetes in-cantando ne pellexeris,</hi> that is, Let no man charme his neighbours graine. Let no man by charmes and incantations carry away or tranſport anothers graine. There are many other true reports and records of other wonderfull works and ſupernaturall feates, all alike offered vnto the outward ſence: There inumeration or citation is not further needfull. It is ſufficient whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer or how many ſoeuer they be, that they are workes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, that they are manifeſt to ſenſe, that they are of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9304:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Diuell, and that the Witch or Sorcerer doth manifeſt his guilt therein, by voluntary preſenting himſelfe therein, by manifeſt vndertaking any part or office in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or by promiſing, and according to promiſe cauſing to come to paſſe. The reaſon is infallible. He that doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake voluntarily, doth preſent himſelfe and doth promiſe and according to promiſe, cauſe to be performed that which is in anothers power, and impoſſible vnto himſelfe, doth thereby neceſſarily and vnanſwerably prooue himſelfe to haue an intereſt, a power, a contract with that other, which for any may to haue with the Diuell, is ſociety with Diuels, which is Witch craft and Sorcerie.</p>
               <p>And thus hath beene declared, how the ſupernatuall workes of the Diuell and Sorcerers may be manifeſt to the outward ſenſe, and the true teſtimony thereof.</p>
               <p>An obiection here may be made, that many of the former workes may ſeeme manifeſt to the ſenſe, which indeed and truth are deceits of the imagination and illuſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no ſuch certainty vnto the outward ſenſe. It is truely <note n="*" place="margin">Things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined and fancied, eaſily diſcerned from thoſe things which are reall and true obiects of the ſenſe.</note> anſwered, He that wanteth ſo much true iudgement, as to diſtinguiſh when he doth ſee a certaine true obiect offered vnto his ſight from without, and when he is incountred onely with a reſemblance there of from within his fancie and imagination, is diſeaſed in body or minde, or both, and therefore is no competent Iudge or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in theſe or any other weighty affaires For that is in health of body, and in the outward organes and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſenſe, and ſound in his reaſon, iudgement, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, though ſometime the fogge and miſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſenſe, or fancy, ouerſhadow the brightneſſe of true and vndeceiued reaſon for a ſhort time in him yet it cannot ſo perpetually eclipſe it, but it wil recouer his light and true ſplendor againe, and truth will ſhine more excellently in the end out of that darkneſſe. This is very liuely ſeene in the example of S. <hi>Peter. Acts</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 10. 12. who at firſt did thinke he had onely ſeene the Angell which God ſent vnto him to deliuer him out of bonds, in a dreame or viſion: but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9304:31"/>
when afterward he was come to himſelfe, and his true ſenſe and reaſon, hee then perfectly diſcerned and knew that he was really deliuered out of priſon by an Angel of God.</p>
               <p>If men could not certainly diſcerne betweene that which they doe really ſee, and that they falſely imagine in viſions, dreames and fancie, then were the life of man moſt miſerable, there could be no certainty of truth, no excelling in knowledge or vnderſtanding. All men ſhould be a like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to diſtinguiſh, whether we liue in dreames onely, or in wakeful deed. But the certaine knowledge which God hath giuen vnto mankinde in ſo infinite kindes and meaſures, doth prooue the eminence of reaſon and vnderſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the intanglements and depreſsion of ſenſe and fancie.</p>
               <p>There remaineth as yet another doubt, which is, how thoſe things which before were mentioned to be ſpirituall and ſupernaturall can be ſubiect in reaſon vnto outward ſenſe or be knowne thereby, howſoeuer by the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, it doth ſo ſeeme. It is true that a Spirit and a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worke ſimply in it ſelfe in the owne nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, cannot be ſeene by any bodily eyes, or be deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by any outward ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, as they doe mixe themſelues with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <note n="*" place="margin">Spiritus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corpori &amp; à ſenſibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris remoti operibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicui. Fernel. l. 1. de Ab. Rer. cauſ. cap. 11.</note> ſubſtances, which are ſubiect to ſenſe, by accident Spirits, and ſpirituall operations, are certainly tryed and diſcouered euen vnto ſenſe. For how is it poſsible that a Spirit ſhould mixe it ſelfe in corporall things, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant nature thereof, and mighty difference, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and beget ſome great apparent alteration, which alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being beyond the wonted nature of the one, doth prooue another ſuperiour nature in the other? For illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration hereof, let vs borrow an inſtance from one of the forenamed manifeſt Sorceries. Water is turned into blood by a Spirituall power. The eye doth manifeſtly ſee the water, and as apparently after ſee the blood, and is a true and vndeceined witneſſe of both. Reaſon and common ſenſe doe know the tranſmutation to proceede from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible power, which appearing in viſible bodies, is by them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9304:31"/>
apart ſeene, and doth detect an inuifible Author, becauſe an immediate effect manifeſted to ſenſe, doth neceſſarily in nature prooue the immediate cauſe, though hidden and vnknowne to ſenſe. That inuifible and ſpirituall things may, by thoſe things which are viſible and bodily, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and diſcerned, the holy Scripture doth witneſſe in theſe words of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1. 20 The inuiſible things of God (ſaith he) are ſeene by the viſible things, or by his workes in the creation of the world, which are viſible.</p>
               <p>It may be here demanded, ſince it is the propertie of the Diuell, in his ſeeming miraculous contriuements and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (though a limited and finite obiect creature of God) yet to indeauour to counterfeit and imitate the moſt high and mightieſt workes of wonder of the infinite Creator, thereby to magnifie, deifie, and equall himſelfe vnto God in vnbeleeuing and ſeduced hearts: Since, I ſay, this is his property, how ſhall the fraile vnderſtanding and capacitie of man diſtinguiſh the maruailes of the diuell, ſo liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled thereto, from the true miracles, and truly miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous workes of God, that thereby with more facility, and leſſe confuſion, induſtrious mindes may diſcouer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per workes and acts of the Diuell, and his aſſociates, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunters, Witches, and Sorcerers? Firſt, the true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God being tranſcendent aboue all created power, and the immediate effects only of a creating vertue, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for his ſole good will and pleaſure doth vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euer diſpenſe by the hands and through the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of holy men, <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> manifeſtly called of God. Secondly, the end and ſcope of Gods mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, directly and mainely ayme and are bent at the glory of God, and the benefit of his people, not vnto any priuate end, any particular vaine end, tending to ſatisfaction of priuate luſts and curioſitie.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe the holy Apoſtles vſed the gift of miracles not vnto any other ends, then vnto the confirmation of that holy Goſpel, which they preached and publiſhed from God, neither did they therein aſcribe ought vnto their own
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9304:32"/>
praiſe or glory, but ſolely vnto the praiſe and glory of God, and the good of his Church.</p>
               <p>That this was their true end, and ought to be the ſcope and end of all that receiue the power of miracles from God, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth witneſſe and teach, 1. <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. Now there are (ſaith he) diuerſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit: and there are diuerſities of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, but the ſame Lord: and there are diuerſities of operations, but God is the ſame which worketh all in all. But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is giuen to euery man to profit withall.</p>
               <p>It is from hence manifeſt, that if any miracles proceede from God as Author, they are diſpenſed by men, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, and who can and are able to prooue and iuſtifie their warrant from God: as alſo that theſe men of God doe ſolely profeſſe and bend them vnto the glory of God, and the weale of his Church. This then is the ſquare and infallible rule by which all miracles doe ſtand or fall, and are approoued either to be of God, or conuinced to be of Diuels.</p>
               <p>Let vs then conclude this point, with that excellent and diuine ſaying of <hi>Theophilact,</hi> vpon the 9. <hi>chap.</hi> of S. <hi>Luke. Praedicatio miraculis &amp; miracula praedicatione ſanciuntur. Multi enim ſaepe miracula ediderunt per Daemones, ſed eorum doctrina non erat ſana, quamobrem eorum miracula non extite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt a Deo.</hi> That is, thê word of God doth eſtabliſh and confirme the truth of miracles, and miracles ratifie and confirme the authoritie and truth of the word. For many haue done miracles by the power of the Diuell, but their doctrine was corrupt and not ſound; and therefore their miracles were not of God. Whereſoeuer therefore mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or ſupernaturall workes ſhall dare to ſhew their heads, not contained within thoſe limits or compaſſe, that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prooued immediately from God himſelfe, nor medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by him reuealed in his writ &amp; word of truth, they are iuſtly to be ſuſpected to iſſue from the enemies of God; the Diuell, and euill Spirits, and therefore their Authors ought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9304:32"/>
to be accomptant therein vnto Iuſtice, and all religious Miniſters and ſeruants of God and Iuſtice, in the moſt ſtrict and ſeuere extent of Law. And thus much concerning the manifeſtation of the ſupernaturall workes of Witches and Sorcerers, vnto or through the outward Senſe.</p>

               <p>ALl doubts being cleared, it hath vndoubtedly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how ſupernaturall and ſpirituall workes are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to ſenſe. It now followeth to declare, how likewiſe they are euident to Reaſon, or neceſſary to conſequence of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things are ſaid to be proper obiects of Reaſon and vnderſtanding: which, being remote from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate view or notice of the outward ſenſes, are grounded vpon vniuerſall and intellectuall knowne poſitions, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and certaine vndoubted generall notions, by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary collections, or raciocinations. That we may build the foundation of this our Reaſon or Raciocination vpon the infallible truth of Gods holy Word which ſhall neuer be ſhaken: let vs for the detection of Witches and Sorcerers, by reaſon, and conſequence of reaſon, ſyllogiſe directly and immediately from God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaith Almighty God, <hi>Iſaiah chap.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe.</hi> 19. And when they ſhall ſay vnto you, Enquire of thoſe that haue a Spirit of Diuination, and at the South-ſayers, which murmure and whiſper, ſhould not a people enquire of their God? Vnder this interrogatiue (ſhould not a people inquire of their God?) is vnderſtood this affirmatiue; A people ſhould enquire of no other Spirit, but of their God alone.</p>
               <p>From this holy text and writ, reaſon doth aſſume and collect neceſſarily, and truly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:9304:33"/>
Firſt, that many things are hidden from the knowledge of man, which are reuealed vnto the ſcience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Spirits. Otherwiſe neither would man aske or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Spirits (as hath beene vſuall in all ages) neither ſhould God haue occaſion here to forbid the enquiring at Spirits. That the ignorance alſo of man in things knowne to Spirits, is the true, firſt and originall motiue or reaſon for enquiring at Spirits, is very plaine by the words of King <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 15. God is departed from me (ſaith he) vnto the viſion of <hi>Samuel,</hi> raiſed by the Diuell, and anſwereth me no more, neither by Prophets, neither by dreames: therefore haue I called thee, that thou maiſt tell mee what I ſhould doe.</p>
               <p>Here is a manifeſt grant of knowledge in Spirits aboue men. Secondly, reaſon doth hence collect, that all Spirits that doe ſuffer themſelues to be enquired at, are euill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and therefore Diuels; becauſe Almighty God hath here expreſſely forbidden the enquiring at any other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit beſide himſelfe: and therefore good and holy Spirits will not, nor <note n="*" place="margin">Angeli boni non poſſunt peccare, Pet.

Thirdly, reaſon doeth neceſſarily hence conclude, that ſuch men as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at for reuelations of things hidden from the skill and poſſibilitie of knowledge in man, are Sorcerers, <note place="margin">This doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne that white Magick or The<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The conſequence and inference of this reaſon is iuſt; for that to promiſe thoſe things, or to vndertake thoſe things which are out of their own knowledge, and ſolely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the knowledge of Spirits and Diuels, doeth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly proue in the performance, their intereſt, ſocietie, and contract with Spirits and Diuels, which is Sorcery and Witch-craft.</p>
               <p>It may bee here obiected, that there are ſome men who affect to bee reſorted vnto, and to bee enquired at in things ſuppoſed hidden from the knowledge of man, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9304:33"/>
able vnto ſuch Reuelations, though haply they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe to deceiue, vnder the colour or pretence, of ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</p>
               <p>It is iuſtly hereto anſwered, that this their preſumption ought to be ſeuerely enquired into, whether it doe taſte of ought that is diabolicall, of the Diuell, or ſupernaturall: and if nothing ſo doe, yet in this Grand cauſe of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the religious iealouſie of the prudent Magiſtrate, ought to puniſh their preſumption, which dare affect to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the name or note of a ſinne, ſo odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable vnto Almightie God. Let vs for better impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againe repeate and iterate thoſe things which were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the propounded text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is knowledge in Spirits of things hidden, and ſeparated from the knowledge of man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſuch Spirits as are enquired at, and doe reueale ſuch knowledge vnto man, are Diuels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that men which doe practiſe to be enquired at for ſuch ſuppoſed Reuelations, ought not onely to be iuſtly ſuſpected, and inquired into, but that if they be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, to know and reueale thoſe things, which are indeed and really aboue and beyond the knowledge of man, and are properly and onely in the power of Spirits; that then this doth infallibly prooue their intereſt power, and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with Diuels, which is certaine and aſſured Sorcery and Witch-craft.</p>
               <p>And thus hath reaſon drawne a demonſtration out of the booke of God, of a certaine Witch, and manifeſt Sorcerer. Let vs now exerciſe our ſelues in the conſideration, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and tryall of ſome particulars herein.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that he foretold the day, the houre of the day, the moment of the houre; wherein <hi>Goc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Nerva</hi> the Emperour ſhould die, long before the time and being in farre diſtant places remooued from him. It is reported of the ſame <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that being conſulted by one who for that purpoſe came vnto him, how he might grow rich, <hi>Apollonius</hi> appointed him to buy a certaine
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9304:34"/>
field or ground, and to be carefull in tilling and plowing thereof, which after he had done a while, he found in the end a great treaſure and ſo became rich. It is written of the ſame <hi>Apollonius</hi> alſo, He made knowne vnto <hi>Titus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatian,</hi> the time and manner of his death, enquiring it at his hands. Theſe things with many other the like <hi>Ianus Iacobus Boiſſardus,</hi> relateth in the life of <hi>Apollonius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who hath not heard of the name and mention of that famous and renowmed <hi>Britiſh</hi> Wizard <hi>Merlin,</hi> and of his high and great eſteeme among Princes for his propheſies? Vnto his fore-ſight and predictions, from many foregoing ages, the ſucceſſes and euents of diuers Princes affaires, in their ſeuerall raignes, haue beene vſually by diuers times and hiſtories referred.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe Maſter <hi>Camden,</hi> in the deſcription of <hi>Caermarden-ſhire,</hi> doth terme him the <hi>Tages</hi> of the <hi>Britans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Speede</hi> in his tractate of the ancient Inhabitants of great <hi>Britane;</hi> as alſo of the life of <hi>Aurelius, Ambroſius,</hi> and of the raigne of King <hi>John,</hi> and of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, doth out of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and others, recite diuers accidents and euents, in ſeuerall ſucceeding ages, vnto his oraculous and miraculous illuminations, aſcribed to haue beene foreſeene, foretold, and knowne.</p>
               <p>If there be truth in thoſe Oracles, and ancient fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Reuelations, they doe neceſſarily inferre the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a power, farre ſuperiour vnto all the power of man. Therefore whoſoeuer doth finde them true, muſt conclude their Author a Witch or Sorcerer. Neither hath the generall reception, or opinion of Authors, beene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from different, who haue publiſhed him the ſonne of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus,</hi> or the ſonne of a Witch, begotten by the Diuell. As it is ſaid of this ancient time-noted, and age-viewed Sorcerer; ſo may be teſtified of many other.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we iudge of that infamous woman, among the French, called <hi>Ioane</hi> of <hi>Arc,</hi> by others <hi>Ioane Pucell de Dieu? Iohn de Serres,</hi> the French Hiſtorian, doth report that ſhe had many miraculous Reuelations, where of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9304:34"/>
King (then <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeauenth) and all his Armie and men of warre, were open wondering witneſſes, and in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations for the moſt part, there was found no leſſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous truth, then true wonder, as ſaith <hi>Serres,</hi> although ſome others haue iudged her an Impoſtereſſe only. By her ſole incouragement, and ſtout aſſurance of ſucceſſe, built vpon miraculous reuelations, the French proſperouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred the victorious Engliſh in France, at ſeuerall times, and againſt all humane reaſon, recouered their in reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnrecouerable, and moſt deſperate ſtanding, euen neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pit of vtter downefall, with more then vnſpeakeable amazement and terrour, vnto the ſodainely confounded Engliſh.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, at length ſhee was taken priſoner by the Engliſh, executed and burnt for her Witch-craft. What ſhall wee ſay or iudge of other the like Authors, and broachers of ſupernaturall reuelations, and predictions in other times? The fore-mentioned Hiſtorian reporteth, that a Wizard foretold Duke <hi>Biron</hi> of his death, and that hee ſhould dye by the backe blow of a <hi>Burguignon,</hi> who afterward prooued his Executioner, beeing that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melancton</hi> out of <hi>Carion</hi> doeth recite the mention of a woman, of the order of the <hi>Druides</hi> among the <hi>Tungri,</hi> who foretold <hi>Diocleſian</hi> that hee ſhould bee Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he had firſt killed a Boare, which prooued afterward one <hi>Aper,</hi> then an Vſurper, which in the Latine tongue ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Boare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth of a Diuinour, who long before was able to make knowne the death, and the manner of the death, and murder of <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philippe de Commines,</hi> in his 8. booke, chap. 19. doeth make mention of one Frier <hi>Hierome,</hi> and of his many admirable reuelations and predictions, concerning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the King of <hi>France,</hi> which as from Friers owne mouth, hee himſelfe did oft heare, ſo with his owne eyes hee did witneſſe and behold their iſſue true. It was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9304:35"/>
whether in theſe tranſcendent reuelations the Frier were a <note n="*" place="margin">Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors doe write, that this man was an holy man, and a man of God. If it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that he receiued thoſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. I doe ſubſcribe. If it cannot be prooued, that hee did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them from God, it is moſt certaine, that they were of the Diuell, ſince in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations there can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medium.</note> man of God or no, and it is doubtfully there concluded.</p>
               <p>In theſe like reuelations and prophecies, reaſon cannot deny, but muſt acknowledge the manifeſt impreſſion and ſtampe, of more then humane Science or demonſtration. If wee deſire or affect more ſpecially to viewe what our owne Hiſtories at home afford: who can deny him a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, or Witch, who as Maſter <hi>Speede</hi> and others teſtifie, in the reigne of <hi>Richard</hi> the Vſurper foretold, that vpon the ſame ſtone where hee daſh his ſpurre, riding toward <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> field, hee ſhould daſh his head in his returne: which prooued accordingly true, when being ſlaine in battell, hee was carryed naked out of the field, and his head hanging low by the horſe ſide behinde his bearer, did ſmite vpon the ſame ſtone in repaſſage, where before in paſſage hee had ſtrooken his heele and ſpurre.</p>
               <p>What can be deemed leſſe of the Author of that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; that is, that <note n="*" place="margin">Speede,</note> 
                  <hi>G.</hi> ſhould murder King <hi>Edwards</hi> heires, which <hi>G.</hi> vnderſtood of the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> was too true.</p>
               <p>How can he likewiſe eſcape the iuſt ſuſpition of the ſame foule crime, from whom originally or firſt was deriued that prophecie or prediction in <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, concerning his ſonne, as yet then vnborne, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that what <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhould winne (which was <hi>Henry</hi> the fift) <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Windſor</hi> ſhould loſe (which was <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt and his ſonne) as it after came truely to paſſe? Theſe things as I ſaid before, doe neceſſarily inferre a power farre ſuperiour, vnto the power of man, and therefore prooue their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie vndertakers Witches, or Sorcerers. This doeth <hi>Binſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius</hi> in his Tract, <hi>de Malef. confeſſionis,</hi> confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in theſe words, <hi>Referri non poſſunt ad cauſas naturales, ſed ad Daemonas hi effectus, nempe reſponſa dare de occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ferri, per derem, per loca remotiſſima.</hi> That is, theſe things can haue no relation vnto naturall cauſes, namely, to giue anſwere vnto things hidden from man, to flie in the ayre,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9304:35"/>
and the like, but are to be attributed vnto the power of the Diuell, or Diuels.</p>
               <p>But here may bee obiected, that ſince it is ſaid by God himſelfe, that no man ought to aske of any other Spirit, but of God alone, things hidden and vnreuealed to men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. before alleadged; and ſince for that cauſe it is not to be doubted, that many things may be reuealed by God vnto men, for this cauſe and reaſon (I ſay) it may be deemed and obiected, that ſome of the former reuelations and prophecies may bee free from the imputation of Witch-craft, and Sorcery.</p>
               <p>It is vnanſwerably anſwered to this obiection: Firſt, that all the reuelations and prophecies which are of God, are euer publiſhed by Prophets, &amp; men of God, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called by God himſelfe, vnto thoſe functions and places. Secondly, thoſe veſſels, and ſeruants of God, which are the publiſhers of Gods reuelations or pophecies, doe euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch, and openly profeſſe God himſelfe, to bee Author thereof, from whom they onely claime, and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime their immediate, and expreſſe warrant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as appeareth by all the prefixions of their prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: Thus ſaith the Lord, The Word of the Lord, The burden of the Lord, The reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, and the like. Thirdly, the reuelations and prophecies, which are thus deriued and ſent from God, carry in themſelues ſome manifeſt ſlampe of their authority, and power from God, in ſome fruites or effects correſpondent, and anſwerable to the nature, will, and pleaſure of God, and are directly and originally bent, and intended vnto the glory of God, and the publike weale, and good of his Church, and people.</p>
               <p>By theſe notes, and infallible markes of Gods holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and reuelations, may bee euidently diſcerned a cleere difference, and diſtinction thereof from diuelliſh predictions, and Sorcerous Prognoſtications, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſhrowde, or hide themſelues vnder colour or pretenſe thereof, being duely and rightly expended.</p>
               <p>It may bee yet further obiected, that ſome learned and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9304:36"/>
truely religious ſeruants of God (though no publike Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, of Propheticall functions or callings) haue had ſometimes their ſpeciall reuelations of ſome particular things, in which it were not onely manifeſtly infurious, but plainly &amp; extremely ridiculous to accompt them Witches. It is true, and cannot be denyed, that Almighty God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by dreames, ſometimes by ſecret prodigies, doeth admoniſh ſome his priuate ſeruants, good and holy men, of ſome things to come, for their owne priuate and retired reformation, information or better preparation; not for prophane or trifling ends, or vſes, but that any prophecies or reuelations, can be of God, that are obſcurely whiſpred, or caſt abroad for ſuch vſes, by any vnwarranted or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Authors, without any manifeſt warrant, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or authoritie from God, in the vpright iudgement of all men, that truely worſhip and feare the true God, the God of hoſtes, is much irreligion, and prophane creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to auouch, or affirme. Nay, it is altogether contrary and contradictory, and therefore impoſsible to God his miraculous reuelations, viſions and prophecies, ordinarily, or commonly to ſerue, or waite vpon the ordinary ends, or vſes of priuate men, ſince all true miracles, and miraculous reuelations are euer in their proper nature, and true end, ſolely attendant vpon God his immediate command and Word, vnto his extraordinary workes. To make it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordinary, or a thing common, or of cuſtomary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to foretell or giue prediction of things to come, muſt neceſſarily proceede from the Diuell, ſince the gift of true propheſie, and the Spirit of true reuelation, is not ſubiected to the common or vſuall intentions of men; neither can profit or commodity, or ſale bee made thereof by men at their pleaſure, as is not vnwonted with all the diſciples of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Sorcerers and Witches, in their markets and farres made of their prophecies and reuelations.</p>
               <p>If men theſe whiſpered reuelations cannot bee of God, then are they neceſſarily of the Diuell. If they proceed from the Diuell, then by an ineuitable concluſion, thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9304:36"/>
men are his inſtruments or organs, by whom or through whom they originally flowe, or are deriued vnto men and publiſhed. It may be yet further obiected, that is men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Diuell, as were thoſe men in the Goſpel, whoſe bodies the Diuell did really rend and teare (in whom hee did roare and crie out) whom hee caſt into the middeſt of the people. It may be (I ſay) obiected, that in thoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and the like, there may be reuealed many things hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from men, without the imputation or iuſt opinion of Witch-craft or Sorcerie in them.</p>
               <p>That this may bee, is manifeſt in the Goſpel, where the Diuell in the poſſeſſed vttered wordes of knowledge then hidden from men, but by extraordinary reuelation, when hee acknowledged our Sauiour to bee Ieſus the Sonne of the liuing God. This could not in any poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of mans reaſon bee knowne vnto the poſſeſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was then but in part reuealed vnto the Diſciples themſelues, who were as yet but learners themſelues and Scholers of that Diuinitie; neither had the naturall man, or the world as yet ſo much as taſted, or ſauoured any notice thereof.</p>
               <p>The like may bee obiected concerning thoſe that are obſeſſed. I call them obſeſſed, in whoſe bodies outwardly appearing no extraordinarie ſignes or tokens of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels corporall preſidence, or <note n="*" place="margin">Maſter Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins in his diſcourie of Witch craft chap. 3. pag. 122. doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide likewiſe Witches vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in whom the Diuell is not inwardly, but from without doeth inſpire them and within whom hee is, as was the Pytho niſſe at Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, Actes 16. 16.</note> reſidence in them (as was in the poſſeſſed manifeſt) yet are their mindes, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wils, and reaſon palpably obſerued to bee beſieged, captiued and inchanted, by an extraordinary and more then naturall, or rather an infernall inuaſion of the Diuels illuſions, for the magnifying and aduancing whereof, the Diuell doth oft-times mixe and temper them with ſome rare and wonderfull reuelations, by or through the obſeſſed deliuered.</p>
               <p>From theſe obiections both concerning the poſſeſſed, and alſo the obſeſſed, doeth iſſue a neceſſary ſequell, that prophecies and reuelations are not alwayes inſeparable teſtimonies of a Witch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:9304:37"/>
It is truely hereto anſwered, that ſolely and ſimply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations are not ſufficient euidences, or conuictions of a Witch, or Sorcerer, but with difference and diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Supernaturall reuelations vnrequiredly transfuſed and transferred by the Diuell, doe not prooue the perſons in whom they are found, to bee their owne free or deſirous Agents in conſent therein, but rather properly and truely the Diuels Patients, and therefore it cannot be their guilt, but his intruſion, vſurpation, and inſidiation: but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall reuelations, in which any man ſhall knowingly, and delibrately conſult with, or inquire at a knowne Spirit, and inioying the free libertie of his will, not depraued or corrupted by illuſions or diſeaſes, ſhall with conſent or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance thereof entertaine, commerce conference or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Spirits vnto that purpoſe: ſuch reuelations (I ſay) whereſoeuer truely and duely detected, doe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiuely and infallibly point on a Witch or Sorcerer, by what way ſoeuer hee doe practiſe with the Diuell, whether by coniuration, ſpels, or other Magicke rites, or by vulgar trading with him, by familiar ſpeech and expreſſe contract, as is moſt vſuall with vulgar and vnlearned Witches. It is not the different manner of contracting, or couenanting with the Diuell, that maketh a new or a different ſpecies of a Witch, for by what name ſoeuer, in what manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, any man doeth contract with the Diuell, hee is a Witch or Sorcerer, ſaith <hi>Binsfeldius,</hi> and inuocateth the Diuell.</p>
               <p>Although therefore the poſſeſſed, or obſeſſed, are iuſtly acquite in their reuelations and prophecies, becauſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or ſent vnrequired, and vnknowingly vnto them, yet cannot the Witch or Sorcerer bee any thing at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantaged, or cleared in his reuelations, which are euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected to bee both by him affected (as is prooued by his mercinarie ſale thereof) and alſo are fore-thought and premeditate, as is euident by his promiſed and couenanted vndertaking thereof, according to conditions or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:9304:37"/>
That we may make this point yet more cleere, let vs yet farther examine, and conſider what Witch-craft is. Theſe are the expreſſe wordes of <hi>Binsfeldius</hi> a Papiſt Diuine, in his tract <hi>de Confeſſionibus Sagarum &amp; Veneficorum Vt fiat maleficium haec tria concurrant neceſſe eſt inquit, Deus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittens, ſecundo Diaboli poteſtas, tertio hominis malefici vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas libere conſentiens.</hi> That is, vnto Witch-craft three things neceſſarily concurre: firſt God permitting: ſecondly the Diuell working: thirdly, man thereto conſenting or yeelding his free-will. Vnto the very ſame purpoſe, ſaith a learned Proteſtant Diuine our countriman, <hi>Perkins</hi> in his deſcription of Witch-craft, including the worke or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Diuell, the permiſſion of God, and a wicked art freely practiſed by man, and chap. 5. of his diſcourſe of Witch-craft, hee pronounceth alſo him a Witch, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wittingly or willingly conſenteth to vſe the aide or aſſiſtance of the Diuell, in the working of wonders aboue the ordinary courſe of nature. I name theſe two Diuines onely, becauſe in this particular they ſeeme to mee to haue beſt ſatisfied, and by the common conſent both of Papiſt, and Proteſtant Diuines, the trueth doeth more vncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſedly appeare Catholike and firme, moſt other learned men that I haue ſeene on both parts, hauing generally or for the moſt part comparatiuely beene defectiue. <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his booke <hi>de Sabtilitate,</hi> conſenteth with them both, <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> 347. where ſpeaking of the impoſſibilitie, of one man hurting another meerely by bare wordes, hee hath theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>There is a greater power then wordes ſaith hee, namely, the Diuell doeth the miſchiefe vpon the vttering of ſuch words; and the fooliſh ſottiſh man, that pronounceth or vttereth them, ſuppoſeth that by vertue of his words it is done. <hi>Ipſeigitur agit Daemon (inquit) ſtultus &amp; vecors pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat ſuis ſe verbis agere;</hi> vnto the ſame effect are the words of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> by Magicke Art ſaith hee, miracles and things aboue nature are brought to paſſe, <hi>Miracula Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis artibus fiunt. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Trinitate.</hi> The word Magicke
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9304:38"/>
doeth inſinuate, or imploy, or include both a Diuell, and a ſupernaturall effect or miracle, as in the former words of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> alſo the ſupernaturall effect and conſequent of mumbling, argued a power in them aboue the power of a meere voyce, or ſpeech, which therefore ſaith <hi>Scaliger,</hi> was the Diuell. In both likwiſe, the will and conſent of man was apparent. In the firſt, where S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth Magicke an Art, that imployeth a mans conſent, for that Artes are willingly, and wittingly ſtudied by man. In the ſecond, where <hi>Scaliger</hi> in the mumbling of words of ſupernaturall effect, affirmeth that the fooliſh man who vttered them, ſuppoſed thoſe effects to proceed from his words; his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering therefore ſuch words, with that expectance, prooued his liking and conſent vnto ſuch effects. And thus it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly apparent, by theſe Authors in their deſcriptions of Magicke, and Witch-craft, that neceſſarily by conſent of reaſon, though not alwayes in expreſſe wordes, is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and included, both ſomething ſupernaturall, and the will and conſent of man thereto. And this may yet bee made apparent, by the words of the ſame <hi>Scaliger, Exercit.</hi> 327. <hi>Magi (inquit) ſuas effectiones violentias appellant: propterea quod vires ſuas ſupra eas, quae naturae ordine fieri vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur exercent.</hi> That is, Magitians tearme their workes violencies, becauſe they exerciſe violent force, or power, aboue the courſe or order of humane nature. The Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans giuing names vnto their workes, aboue humane power or nature, and boaſting them as their owne, doth prooue their free will and conſent. Thoſe their workes being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, doe prooue them to bee of the Diuell, as the very vſuall vnderſtanding of the word Magitian, whereby they are ordinarily tearmed, doeth teſtifie. And thus it is manifeſt. Firſt, that in Witch-craft the effect or worke done is ſupernaturall, aboue the reach and power of man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that in that worke the Magitian, or Witch, hath a willing intereſt.</p>
               <p>And hence now is manifeſt alſo, what Witch-craft is, namely, a worke or effect, aboue the nature or power of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9304:38"/>
man, wherein notwithſtanding is the will, conſent, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of man. This no man can deny, the demonſtration being ſo euident.</p>
               <p>It now followeth to enquire, how this Witch-craft ſhall bee detected, or diſcouered; Secondly, how ſhall mans free will, or conſent therein be diſcouered. Vnto the firſt, is eaſily anſwered, <hi>videlicet,</hi> the ſupernaturall worke or effect doeth appeare by it ſelfe, when it is manifeſt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent aboue the nature, reach, and power of man, ſuch as are diuers effects and workes formerly mentioned. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecond I anſwere, that mans free will, good will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, aſſent, or allowance therein is diſcouered by the ſame true actes or meanes, whereby any man his conſent or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is vſually diſcouered, indicted, and arraigned in the caſe of Treaſon, Murder, Fellonie.</p>
               <p>In caſe of Treaſon, Murder, Fellonie, conſent is diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vſuall courſe and practiſe of the Law, either by ſome manifeſt act promoting or furthering thoſe wicked intents, or by conniuence therein: by wilfully not ſeeing, or by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or not reuealing,</p>
               <p>As therefore in thoſe hainous crimes iuſtly; ſo in this high Treaſon againſt God, and adherence vnto his enemie the Diuell, in like manner any man his wicked aſſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or good liking, is to be traced and diſcouered by any act tending vnto the promoting thereof, by his conniuing, willingly concealing, or ſilence: For as in caſe of Treaſon, Murther, Fellonie, whoſoeuer permitteth or admitteth any of thoſe crimes, whoſoeuer only conſenteth thereto, conniueth, keepeth counſell, or concealeth, is iuſtly by the law held, iudged, and condemned as a Traytor, Murderer, or Fellon himſelfe; So by the ſame equitie and reaſon in high Treaſon againſt God (ſuch as is Witch-craft and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering vnto the Diuell his enemie) whoſoeuer ſhall conſent thereto, conniue, or giue allowance is certainly a Witch himſelfe, and guilty of Witchcraft. This is the reaſon why all Writers, with one conſent doe as well hold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne for Witchcraft the tacit contract as the expreſſe.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9304:39"/>
Wherein in expreſſe tearmes vocally any man couenanteth with the Diuell, or contracteth. A tacit contract is, when any man taketh vpon him to doe, that by naturall cauſes, which cauſes are allowed no ſuch effects in courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor yet are allowed vnto any ſuch effects beſide the courſe of nature; Either by God, his Word, or by the Ordinances of his Church. To this effect expreſſely ſaith <hi>Binsfeldius lib. de Confeſſ. Malefic: &amp; Sagarum: Tacitè (inquit) inuocatur Daemon quoties quis contendit illud, facere per cauſes naturales, quae nec virtute ſua naturali, neque ex Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina, aut Eccleſiaſtica poſſunt illud facere.</hi> To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſaith <hi>Perkins cap.</hi> 5. of his diſcourſe of Witch-craft, giuing allowance, ſaith he, vnto meanes not allowed by God maketh a Witch. That there are ſuch effects, the ſame Author doth inſtance in another place, in theſe words, <hi>Referri (inquit) non poſſunt ad cauſas naturales ſed ad Daemonas hi effectus, ferri per aerem dare reſponſa de occultis;</hi> That is, theſe effects cannot be referred vnto any naturall cauſes, but vnto the power of Diuels, namely, to flye in the ayre, to reueale things hidden from man. For this cauſe alſo ſaith <hi>Perkins,</hi> Diuining of things to come peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conuinceth the Author a Witch.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, whoſoeuer taketh vpon him to doe theſe things, or the like, and cannot iuſtifie them done according vnto the vertue or power of naturall cauſes, or (if beſides courſe of nature) cannot prooue or warrant them to be of God, neither by his Word, nor Ordinance of his Church, that man is a Magitian, a Witch, or Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. But here it is requiſite, and fit that men doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betweene things vnwarrantably done beſide courſe of nature; and therefore neceſſarily to be tryed and iudged by thoſe rules of Gods Word, and Church, And betweene thoſe things, which are likewiſe vnwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably done, but are aboue the courſe of nature, yet are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be tried by the ſame rules, and limits of Gods Word, and Church.</p>
               <p>For as beſides courſe of nature are many things, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9304:39"/>
rites, Ceremonies, Which are to haue allowance of their being from the ſame limitations, or elſe are to be condemned. So there are things aboue nature as miracles, which alſo are to haue their allowance, and approbation by the former rules.</p>
               <p>It followeth therefore neceſſarily from hence, that whatſoeuer ſupernaturall effect, or aboue the power, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man doth happen, and is not warranted or allowed by God, his Word, or Church, that certainly is of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. If it be of the Diuell, then whoſoeuer doth allow, yeeld his good will, conſent, or by any way or meanes, or art doth promote or further, it is a Witch, as he who in Treaſon, or Murther, conniueth or conſenteth, is a Traytor or Murderer as is aforeſaid. That a ſupernaturall worke, or an effect aboue nature, is to be held Diabolicall, is not only prooued by examination and triall of God, his Word, and Church, but reaſon it ſelfe doth alſo demonſtrate it. Euery ſupernaturall effect, hath a ſupernaturall cauſe. Euery ſupernaturall cauſe is God, or the Diuell, there being no meane betweene, but one or the other. Good Angels or ſpirits doe worke their ſupernaturall effects alſo or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature, but thoſe their ſupernaturall workes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies directed and commanded by God, and therefore are of God, and carrie with them euidence immediate from God. All ſupernaturall workes that are of God, are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted from God. Therefore whatſoeuer ſupernaturall worke cannot be warranted of God, is of the Diuell. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be warranted to be of God, will appeare eaſily by the former limitations and rules. If therefore a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall worke appeare not to be of God, by the former li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, and examination; then is it certainly of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. By neceſſary conſequence, therefore of reaſon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that whoſoeuer vnto any ſuch effect or worke, thus demonſtratiuely diſcouered to be of the Diuell, doth giue any allowance or conſent, though neuer ſo tacitly, or cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea though ignorant of the qualitie or degree of the ſin, yet in his raſh and vnaduiſed and inconſiderate yeelding or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9304:40"/>
conniuing therein, he is guiltie, acceſſary, and a very Witch himſelfe, as is aforeſaid in caſe of Treaſon, and the like grieuous offences againſt a Prince or State. For the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the law excuſeth no man, yea and in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, So many faire directions by learned Writers giuen, doth leaue men inexcuſable, and maketh ignorance wilfull, and reſolute, and excludeth eaſie pardon. Neither can the moſt ſimple ignorance iuſtifie any man, although it may qualifie the degree or grieuouſneſſe of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>If this law ſeeme ſtrict and hard. Let men conſider the greatneſſe, and grieuouſneſſe of the ſinne, and the pernicious conſequence thereof. Which iuſtly doth vrge, and impoſe the neceſſary; fearefull rigour, and ſtrictneſſe of the law. The neceſſitie and equitie hereof is apparent in caſe of high Treaſon aforeſaid againſt a Prince, or State, wherein vſually they who are ſimply, or ignorantly drawne, or vſed, or are inſtruments in any ſort, to further or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the miſchiefe, are as well lyable vnto the ſeuere inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and terrible cenſure of the law, as are they who were the maine plotters and contriuers. Witchcraft is high Treaſon againſt God himſelfe, a combining, and adhering vnto his enemie the Diuell, a deſperate renouncing of God and all goodneſſe, and a worſhip of Diuels. In this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinne therefore, in any kinde or ſort, in any manner or action, to befriend, aide or conniue<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is no leſſe then high Treaſon againſt God alſo, wherein as well the acceſſarie as the principall are both guiltie. Whoſoeuer therefore ſhall in matter of this high nature or danger, dare or hazard to doe any thing that may be queſtioned or iuſtly ſuſpected in that kinde, or to tend thereto, cannot be by his ignorance excuſed.</p>
               <p>Thus I obiections doubts and impediments remooued, let vs build a neuer-deceiuing, and inuiolate concluſion concerning Witches, vpon this neuer-failing nor ſhaken foundation: that is, all ſupernaturall workes reuelations or prophecies whatſoeuer, that iſſue not either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and manifeſtly from God himſelfe, or from his Word
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9304:40"/>
or Church allowed (the proofe and touchſtone whereof hath beene before touched, and briefely declared) or from the Diuell in the ignorant poſſeſſed or obſeſſed, or are not counterfeit and impoſturous (which is likewiſe elſe-where in the due place conſidered) all other reuelations or works (I ſay) whatſoeuer, not excepted nor included in one of theſe, are vndoubtedly iſſuing from Witches and Sorcerers, and are certaine and demonſtratiue proofes and euidences of Witch-craft and Sorcery, in whom they are originally firſt detected. And thus how Reaſon doth cull and draw forth a Witch or Sorcerer, hath euidently beene cleared and declared.</p>

               <p>AS Almightie God hath out of the Text before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8. in generall made euident, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly a Witch or Sorcerer: ſo hath he in other places of Scripture manifeſted ſome of their ſeuerall kinds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different ſhapes and formes, in which they doe enquire at Spirits for their knowledge and reuelations.</p>
               <p>This is apparent out of the 18. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomie, verſe</hi> 10. Let none bee found amongſt you that vſeth Witch-craft. What Witch-craft is, was before out of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> declared.</p>
               <p>Now in this place doth follow the enumeration of ſome of the ſpeciall or particular ſhapes in which they ſhroud themſelues. Let none be found among you (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) that vſeth Witch-craft: and immediatly after doth adde thoſe particular formes in which they enquire: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garder of times: a marker of the flying of fowles: a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: a Sooth-ſayer, or that asketh counſell of the dead. As therefore before we prooued, that the infallible true note of a Witch in generall, and in common vnto all Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9304:41"/>
and Sorcerers, of what kinde ſo euer, is to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at in things hidden from men (as is likewiſe by thoſe words of <hi>Saul</hi> apparent, <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 28 <hi>verſe</hi> 7. Seeke mee a woman that hath a familiar Spirit, that I may goe to her and aske of her:) ſo here in this text are reckoned vp ſome of their ſeuerall ſhapes, by which in true and ſound reaſon, and the due conſequent thereof, we may conſider and collect many other, though not here numbred, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>For ſince the common and inſeparable ſigne or marke of Witches is certainely made knowne to bee, the practiſe of reuealing vnto men that enquire thoſe things which are hidden from men, and onely reuealed by Spirits: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by neceſſarie conſequent, that not onely thoſe which are here ſpecially nominated, in that ſhape of marking of the flying of fowles, or of charming, or of raiſing the dead, but all other whatſoeuer, in what other ſhape ſo euer that is, hath, or can be deuiſed, that ſhall be found to practiſe or vndertake to be enquired at, and to giue anſwer and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of things ſeparated from the knowledge of man, and which God hath hidden from men, and therefore hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Spirits to be made knowne to men; all ſuch (I ſay) in what ſhape ſo euer, as well in theſe kinds here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are, according to the generall note of a Witch, to be iudged Witches and Sorcerers.</p>
               <p>For as the holy Scripture hath nominated and pointed out vnto vs ſome few kinds, as a light onely vnto all the reſt: ſo may common experience by theſe bring others vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our view, and all ages haue vpon the records of time and Hiſtorie, left vnto ſucceeding poſteritie, many ſhapes more of memorable and famous Witches, not onely in theſe ſhapes and formes ſhrowded, which are here mentioned but in many other.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe kinds therefore, which here the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath nominated, let vs take a ſhort view of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are in other ſhapes found (ſince all are in their common kinde and nature the ſame.) It is no ſtrange thing,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9304:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that in the ſhape, and vnder the pretenſe of <hi>Astrologie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aſtrologers.</note> ſome men haue hidden ſorcerous practiſe, and performing vnder the colour thereof ſuch things as were onely in the power of Spirits, haue thereby cleerely manifeſted, that they deriued and borrowed them of Spirits. <hi>Saxo Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus,</hi> in his hiſtorie <hi>de rebus Danicis,</hi> doth make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſort of Wizards, who would vndertake for gaine, to foretell the certaine ſtate and conſtitution of weather to come ſo aſſuredly, that they would vſually ſell vnto Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants proſperous and fortunate windes, when by aduerſe and oppoſite gales they were deteyned from their intended voyage.</p>
               <p>This kinde of Sorcerer may very rightly be referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which in <hi>Deuter.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 10. is noted by a regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of times, which perhaps may alſo not vnaptly be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a <hi>Magicall Aſtrologer.</hi> His performance aboue the nature and power of his Art, of that which is onely in the power of a Spirit, doth both detect the Diuell to be chiefe Author of the workes, and the other to be alſo guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the worke.</p>
               <p>That the profeſſors of <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> haue in former ages vnto <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> ioyned this diuelliſh skill and cuſtome; as alſo other kinds of Diabolicall Diuinations, plainely doth appeare.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the word of God, <hi>Daniel</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. wherewith the <hi>Astrologers,</hi> the <hi>Caldeans, Magicians, Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters</hi> are conioyned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it doth appeare by the Lawes, which by the Romane Emperours were prouided againſt them ioyntly together, with Caldeans, Magicians, and Southſayers. The words of one ancient Law are, <hi>Nemo Aruſpicem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulat, aut Mathematicum, nemo Ariolum, Caldeum, Magum;</hi> that is, let it be enacted or ordered that no man aske coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of a South-ſayer, a Mathematician, an Aſtrologer, a Caldean, a Magician.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> in the 27. booke of Hiſtorie, doth make mention of Aſtrologers, who by diuelliſh skill practiſed and vſed to

ſend the Diuell to preſent <note n="*" place="margin">This kinde of Diuell is called, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> dreames vnto men in their ſleepe; for which cauſe <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour reuenged himſelfe vpon ſuch Aſtrologers, though otherwiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a great friend and louer of Aſtrologie. Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> in his defence of iudiciall Aſtrologie, doth out of <hi>Oſiander</hi> recite this diſtinction of Aſtrologie: <note n="*" place="margin">Page 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Aſtrologia pura quae nihil habet de Magia,</hi> that is, Aſtrologie that is not mixed, nor intermedieth with Magicke. Whereby is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily concluded, that Aſtrology may be, and ſometimes is impure and defiled with Magicke and Sorcerie. In other places of the ſame worke, he maketh a difference betweene Aſtrologers <note n="*" place="margin">Page 29.</note> ſimply, and ſuch as with Aſtrologie ioyned Magicke. And out of <hi>Brentius</hi> he reciteth theſe words, <hi>Non negat Hierimias eam partem Aſtrologiae, quae ſequitur manifest as naturae rationes;</hi> that is, the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> doth not deny or condemne that part of Aſtrologie, which is guided by manifeſt reaſon or cauſe in nature. Hereby then is vnauoidably concluded, that the Prophet of God condemneth that part of Aſtrologie, which exceedeth cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and reaſon in nature, and that neceſſarily muſt needs be Sorcery and Magicke. As it is not obſcure, that ſome men vnder the colour of Aſtrologie haue practiſed Magicke and Sorcery; ſo is it no leſſe euident, that many others, vnder the pretenſe of aduiſing and counſelling in Phyſicke, for curation or Prognoſtication of diſeaſes, haue likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the ſame diuelliſh practiſe.</p>
               <p>That this hath beene no new vpſtart cuſtome, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of diſeaſes, which ancient times doe regiſter to haue beene cured by enchaunted Spels, and words, and Magicke skill, doeth plentifully witneſſe.

               <p>Whoſoeuer is acquainted with bookes and reading, ſhall euery where meete a world of the wonders of cures, by wordes, by lookes, by ſignes, by figures, by characters, and ceremonious rites. As what the practiſe of former ages hath beene is manifeſt; ſo what our age and later time doeth herein afford, is almoſt no where in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome obſcure. The neereſt vnto that impudence, which herein this our time doeth produce and ſet foorth, is that hiſtory of a <hi>Germane</hi> Witch, reported in the <hi>Malleus Maleficarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was (as the Author of that worke ſaith) ſometime a Sorcereſſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> who vſually cured not onely all that were bewitched, but all kinde of diſeaſed people, ſo farre beyond all power or courſe of Art and Nature, and with ſuch facility, that all vſe of the Art of Phyſicke, or of Phyſicions was altogether (for a time) neglected and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; while people from all Countries, both neere and remote, in ſuch numbers and frequence reſorted vnto her, that the Gouernour of that Countrey impoſing vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man one penny that reſorted vnto her, thereby raiſed himſelfe a mighty treaſure.</p>
               <p>What others among the moſt ancient Authors that are not Phyſicians doe publiſh, concerning the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations in the curing of diſeaſes is needleſſe to write. Hee that hath read any few lines of old <hi>Homer,</hi> or of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other aged Poets, ſhall finde plentifull record hereof. <hi>Herodotus</hi> is not ſilent herein. But to omit all their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe teſtimonies, Phyſicians of theſe laſt times, of the moſt eminent note and worth (whoſe pennes are yet ſcarce drie) doe witneſſe the trueth hereof from their owne knowledge, ſight and experience. Aboue the reſt, <hi>Fernelius de Abditis rerum cauſis,</hi> is worthy any mans paines or view.</p>
               <p>Let vs now laſtly ſee what may bee collected out of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9304:43"/>
booke of God, concerning the power of the Diuell in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſeaſes, from whom all theſe inferiour Agents, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Sorcerers doe deriue their power and skill. If it bee in his power, where God doeth permit, to induce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, it muſt needes bee in his power to ceaſe or calme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; becauſe both cauſing and curing, conſiſt in the vertue and force of the ſame meanes. Hee therefore that knoweth how and by what cauſe the diſeaſe is induced, doeth neceſſarily vnderſtand, that by the remouall of that cauſe it is cured, and according to that rule can equally, as well by remouall of that cauſe, cure, as by the inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the cauſe bring ſickeneſſe. For this reaſon it is a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime in Phyſicke infallible, that he is the moſt excellent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who knoweth beſt the cauſes of diſeaſes, and who vpon the knowledge of their true cauſes doeth found the right method of their curation.</p>
               <p>That the Diuell doeth both know the cauſes of diſeaſes, and alſo how by them to procure and produce diſeaſes, is manifeſt by the Hiſtory of <hi>Iob,</hi> vpon whom he brought that grieuous generall botch and byle, ouer all his body, <hi>Iob chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 7. That hee did this by the force of cauſes in nature, muſt needes bee euident. Firſt, becauſe hee is a creature, and ſubiect and limited by nature vnto and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her liſts; and therefore is not able abſolutely and ſimply without cauſes and meanes in nature, to produce any effects in nature, although our ignorance of his power and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (becauſe it ſo farre excelleth our power or nature) doeth call all his workes iuſtly ſupernaturall. Secondly, for that byles and botches are knowne naturall diſeaſes; and therefore had naturall cauſes, although haply vnknowne to any man, and beyond the nature of knowledge or skill in man.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons of the Diuels impoſſibilitie, to worke thoſe effects without nature, are thus yet more briefly and cleerely made infallible. Of <note n="*" place="margin">Creatio eſt conſtitutio ſubſtantiae ex nihilo, Scali. de Subt. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. vi. Sect. 13</note> nothing ſimply to produce any thing vnto a true being and exiſtence, is the ſole and proper worke of any infinite Creator, and impoſsible vnto
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9304:43"/>
any creature. Therefore the Diuell being a creature, could not bring thoſe diſeaſes vpon <hi>Job,</hi> but by created meanes preexiſting in created nature, in which he is contained and limited. And thus much concerning that kinde of Witch and Sorcerer, which is enquired at concerning the curing and iſſue of diſeaſes, which we will conclude with this note, that all learned men of the beſt experience haue obſerued; that in thoſe cures by Witches and Sorcerers, the Diuell hath neuer perfectly healed, but for a time; or elſe where hee hath ſeemed moſt perfectly to cure, it hath beene for a reſeruation of the body by him cured, vnto a greater and further miſchiefe in time to ſucceede. Beſides, this kinde of Witch, by meanes vnknowne to man, or by a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vertue in knowne meanes, aboue and beyond their nature, vndertaking to cure the ſicke, or to foretell the euent and iſſues of diſeaſes, there is alſo another kind which doeth vndertake to bee enquired at for extraordinary reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſuch diſeaſed perſons, as are bewitched or poſſeſſed by the Diuell. This kinde is not obſcure, at this day ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Kingdome, whereof no man can bee ignorant, <note place="margin">Wiſe men and Wiſe women.</note> who luſteth to obſerue the vncontrouled libertie and licenſe of open and ordinary reſort in all places vnto wiſe-men, and wiſe-women, ſo vulgarly termed for their reputed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning ſuch diſeaſed perſons as are ſuppoſed to be bewitched.</p>
               <p>But it may bee obiected, that many of theſe two laſt mentioned ſorts are rather deceiuers, and Impoſtors onely, who by an opinion of this power, and not by any reall power herein, doe deceiue, ſeduce, and beguile the people. This cannot in ſome be denied: notwithſtanding leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious impoſture bee ſtill tolerated to bee a couert to hide the manifeſt diuelliſh practiſe of Witches, vnder pretenſe thereof (whereby it ſhall euer continue in this ſhape neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or vnſpied) I will both briefely giue ſatisfaction how the one may bee diſtinguiſhed from the other, and alſo declare how men ceaſing to enquire at Diuels and Witches, or Impoſtors, may learne to enquire of their

For this cauſe ſometimes vnder an holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, he maketh God the <note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ 4 14.</note> Author of his vnholy preſtigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ſlandereth God vnto his face, ſometimes to be reputed an <note n="b" place="margin">Col 2. 23.</note> Angell of light, he maketh himſelfe a licenſe to counterfeit the Diuell. He propoſeth it his trade to ſeduce, and liueth by lying. Sometimes in ſhew and pollicitation he is a Witch but in the performance of the greater ſinne hee is leſſe iuſt, and in the perſonate reſemblance ſolely a Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. For as the Witch performeth that which in true, and infallible reaſon is tranſcendent and aboue nature; ſo the Impoſtor performeth that which in falſe and fallible reaſon and opinion onely ſeemeth parallel.</p>
               <p>Hence as Witches doe ſtrange and ſupernaturall workes, and truely vnto reaſon worthy of wonder; ſo the Impoſtor doth things voide of accomptable reaſon, in ſhadow, ſhew, and ſeeming onely ſupernaturall, wondred and admired. And hence it commeth to paſſe, that with vndiſcerning mindes, they are ſometimes miſtaken and confounded <note n="*" place="margin">See Reginald Scot in his diſcouerie of Witch-craft, where in regard of the ſeeming likeneſſe of Impoſtur<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:9304:44"/>
From hence it is alſo neceſſarily concluded, that as Witch-craft is diſcouered by a ſupernaturall worke aboue reaſon, whereto the Witches conſent is acceſſary; ſo an Impoſtor is detected by a worke voide of accomptable reaſon, but in a deceiuing falſe Viſar or ſhew, wherewith the purpoſe and intention of the Deceiuer or Impoſtor doth concurre. As therefore the ſuſpected Witch is tyed to anſwere vnto any iuſt doubt, which may bee directly vrged againſt his or her manifeſt voluntary action, that is prooued ſupernaturall: ſo is a truely doubted Impoſtor bound to giue ſatisfaction, for ſuch his ambiguous actions, as doe in likely reaſon appeare fraudulent, vaine, preſtigious, iuggling, couzening, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing. And thus ſhall each appeare in his owne true ſhape apart. Of diuers kinds of Witchcraft, I haue before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced examples.</p>

I know ſome I ſay, who are not aſhamed prophanely and moſt irreligiouſly, to affect among vulgars, to gaine the opinion of skill in Coniuration, Magicke, and Diuell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charming.</p>
               <p>By this impoſturous Art or deuice many yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (not among men Religious, Orthodoxe, or iudiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned) but among vulgars, and ſometimes alſo among ſome great and mighty men) they haue become vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily magnified Phyſitions, aboue other farre more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and performing ſometimes, ſome things praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy (as is oft-times contingent vnto the meaneſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers) they ſtill gaine countenance, and time to robbe God of the firſt fruites of their time, ſtrength, and labours, and the Church of their more requiſite maine ſtudy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. It is not vnknowne how common it is among theſe men, to profeſſe the erecting of figures, the giuing of anſweres as Wizards, the reuealing of things hidden, as Magitians, vnto the great diſhonour of God, the ſhame of the Church, the Lawes and Kingdome.

I will referre the Reader to a former manuell, called <hi>The diſcouery of Erroneous practiſes in Phiſicke,</hi> where although, by reaſon of my abſence beyond and beſide the <hi>Errata,</hi> many errours both in ſome words and ſenſe, doe ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine; yet there are many things in this kinde worthy notice. Read page 71. the Treatiſe of Wizards; likewiſe, in the ſecond marginall note of the page 53. an Hiſtory of a Chirurgeon, famous in curing ſuch as were bewitched: Likewiſe page 109. 110. 111. an Hiſtory of impoſture, vnder the colour and pretenſe of the inſpection and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Vrines: and likewiſe, page 60. and from thence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of that whole Chapter. There is a very rare, but true, deſcription of a Gentlewoman, about ſixe yeeres paſt, cured of diuers kindes of convulſions, and other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plecktike, Epileptike, Cataleptike, and Paralytike fits, and other kindes of accidents of affinitie therewith. After ſhee was almoſt cured of thoſe diſeaſes, but the cure not fully accompliſhed, it was by a reputed Wizard whiſpered, and thereupon beleeued, that the Gentlewoman was meerely bewitched, ſuppoſed Witches were accuſed. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman hath beene free from all thoſe accidents there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the ſpace of ſixe yeeres now paſt.</p>
               <p>In this laſt paſt ſeuenth yeere, ſince the writing of that hiſtory, ſome of the former fits are <note n="*" place="margin">Plurimae autem paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones puerulis iudicantur in ſeptem men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibus nonnul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae in 7. anno Hipp. Aphor 28 lib. 3.

Her diſeaſes which formerly, farre exceeded theſe which now are, in number, frequence and vehemence, were in ſhorter ſpace cured, and ſo continued the ſpace of ſixe yeeres together. Theſe few which now doe returne, due counſell and time neglected, though

being in number fewer, leſſe intricate, and farre leſſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, haue notwithſtanding a farre larger ſpace of time continued.</p>
               <p>If that Counſeller or vndertaker to counſell, be a Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in name and reputation only (as I doe geſſe and deeme him) then is this Hiſtory an incomparable example and inſtance of the wickedneſſe, impietie and crueltie of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and Impoſtours. If he be found a Witch, then is it an vnanſwerable euidence and inſtance of the Diuels iuggling, lying, illuſion and deceiuing, whereof we made mention and proofe before in the queſtion or doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Pythagoras</hi> realty in two places. For, in true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and iudicious diſcerning, it is as cleere as the brighteſt day, that no accident befalling the Gentlewoman mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, can be other then naturall, or farther ſupernaturall, then either the Diuels credit with a Witch, or an Impoſtors credit with deceiued and ſeduced men is able to inchaunt perſwaſion vnto vaine affiance in them. I referre the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the conſideration of the Hiſtory at large, with that which here is added: I will only exhort all men not to be in thoſe doubtfull caſes, too violent, nor raſh in asking or beleeuing vnworthy or worthleſſe counſell, but to aske it of ſuch as are truly and godly learned and prudent, and not of Impoſtours or Seducers, conſidering that the conſequence of raſhneſſe, miſtaking error and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; are no leſſe then the life or death of the ſicke, a putting out of the eyes and light of reaſon, which God and Nature hath giuen man to walke withall in the darke pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of this life; a depriuation of due remedies which God hath allowed (while beguiled with vaine and fooliſh opinion, with wilfull blindneſſe, they worthily eſteeme not, nor will expect his grace and fauour therein.</p>
               <p>Aſſuredly, he that doth giue vp himſelfe to become a prey to folly and illuſion, and led by deceiuers headlong into confuſed, vniuſtifiable, vnwarranted and inhibited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorations and trials, doth forſake the guidance and vſe of right reaſon, and in ſtead thereof, is intemperately diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

with impatience of expectation of due reſpect and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of Gods ordinance and allowance in his ordinary meanes, may iuſtly feare that God hath decreed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, not onely to diſpoile him of that common bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which he hath promiſed to all that duely ſeeke, and rightly vſe his allowed meanes; but alſo that he leaueth him vnto the curſed path and way of perpetuall blindneſſe and hardneſſe of heart therein, except his ſpeciall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diuine grace in time reduce his dangerous ſteps. For certainly he vnto whoſe blinded eyes God doth offer ſo great mercy and fauour, as is plainly euident in all his ordained ordinary meanes, vnto euery good that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth man in this life, and with thankfulneſſe cannot or will not behold it, when it is laid at his vnthankfull feete, is in a deſperate way of a lethargicall diſpoſition, or ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe memory and obliuion, both of his reaſon, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and of Gods mercifull goodneſſe towards him. And thus the vglineſſe of impoſture both by the deſcription thereof, and alſo by example doth appeare, wherein may be firſt ſeene, how they that truſt thereto, doe forſake God, themſelues and their owne common ſenſe and reaſon, and giue themſelues to be ſwallowed vp of lying and illuſion. Secondly, in the whole courſe of impoſture it ſelfe, is ſeene the continuall practiſe of mercileſſe impietie, the vſuall wrong of the afflicted, the belying of truth, the deceiuing the miſerable, the depriuation of the ſicke, of the vſe of due remedies and meanes which God hath made and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto men, that with praiſe vnto his name, patience and due dependance vpon his prouidence therein, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſeeke and expect the likely and hopefull iſſue thereof, in vſuall courſe of nature. Laſtly, may be collected, and obſerued, the vſe and neceſſitie of diſtinction betweene Impoſture and Witch-craft; namely, that the odious and abominable ſinne of Witch-craft be not ſuffered to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, vnregarded or neglected, vnder the colour of vaine Impoſture, and that the Diuell be not ſuffered to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, too commonly, and too openly, in the coate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9304:48"/>
and habite of a fooliſh Impoſtor, or Iuggler. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely nothing doth more hood-winke the through diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of Sorcerers, then remiſſeneſſe and omiſsion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and caſtigation of Impoſtors, out of whoſe leauen (no doubt) but diligent animaduerſion, might oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times boult out many a ſubtill and concealed Witch.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>How men may by reaſon and nature be ſatisfied, concerning ſuch ſicke perſons as are indeede and truly bewitched.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT followeth now, according to promiſe, briefely to point vnto direction, how men leauing to inquire at Witches and Sorcerers, and Impoſtors, concerning the ſick, ſuppoſed to be bewitched, may inquire and be better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the light of Reaſon; which God hath giuen vnto them. Reaſon doth detect the ſicke to be afflicted by the immediate ſupernaturall power of the Diuell, two wayes: The firſt way is, by ſuch things as are ſubiect and manifeſt vnto the learned Phyſicion onely: the ſecond is, by ſuch things as are ſubiect and manifeſt vnto a vulgar view.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things which are manifeſt vnto the Phyſition alone are of two ſorts. The firſt is, when in the likeneſſe and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a diſeaſe, the ſecret working of a ſupernaturall power doth hide it ſelfe, hauing no cauſe or poſsbilitie of being in that kinde or nature. The ſecond is, when naturall remedies or meanes according vnto Art and due diſcretion applyed, doe extraordinarily or miraculouſly either loſe their manifeſt ineuitable nature, vſe, and operation, or elſe produce effects and conſequences, againſt or aboue their nature, the impoſsibilitie of either of theſe in vſuall or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie courſe of nature, doth certainely prooue an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie of a ſuperiour nature, which aſſuredly therefore muſt needs be either Diuine or Diabolicall.</p>
               <p>This concluſion concerning the infallibilitie of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall mouer, from the like aſſumption, the learned and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9304:49"/>
worthy preſeruer of reuerent antiquitie, Maſter <hi>Camden,</hi> in his deſcription of Cheſhire, hath truely inferred vpon the miraculous preluſions, and preſages, euer and prepetually forerunning the death of the heyres of the houſe or family of the <hi>Briertons.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like things (ſaith he) are done either by the holy tuteler Angels of men, or elſe by Diuels who by Gods permiſsion mightily ſhew their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this inferiour world.</p>
               <p>Whenſoeuer therefore the Phyſition ſhall truly diſcouer a manifeſt tranſcending power, manner, or motion in any ſuppoſed diſeaſe, there is an vndoubted concluſion of the Author. Where likewiſe remedies finde concomitances, or conſequences contrary to their nature, or ſuch as neuer were, nor euer can be contingent in courſe of nature: this aſſumption truiy granted, doth inuincibly inferre a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent force and vertue therein neuer to be denied. The Demonſtration hereof is euident. A proper cauſe is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely knowne where is detected his proper effect. <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where is effected ought ſupernaturall, there is infallibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered a ſupernaturall cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thus how diſeaſes, and the wonderfull accidents which oft happen in diſeaſes, may be by the Phyſicion detected, according vnto the rule of reaſon, whether induced by the Diuell or no, is briefely pointed at.</p>
               <p>How the guilt of any man therein with the Diuel (which doth onely conuince a Witch) may and ought appeare, hath beene before declared, and ſhall likewiſe hereafter be further made cleare.</p>
               <p>It will not now be immateriall or vnprofitable, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, illuſtration, and better proofe of thoſe two waies, which are diſtinguiſhed to be onely ſubiect, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto the Phyſicion, in the detection of the ſecret workes of Diuels and Witches in diſeaſes, to produce one or two examples of both.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his 2. booke <hi>De Abd. Rer. cauſis, chap.</hi> 16. deliuereth a hiſtory of a yong man of a noble family, who was by a violent convulſion in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9304:49"/>
manner long time tormented. Diuers learned Phyſicions remained long time doubting and vnſatisfied, both in the cauſe of this diſeaſe, as alſo of the ſeate or place where the cauſe, with any ſufficient reaſon, might be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſetled.</p>
               <p>Behold very pregnant inducements of the finger of the Diuell, moouing in the diſeaſe. One was the incredible ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locitie of motion in the diſeaſed, impoſsible vnto the force of man: the other was, for that in all the fits and convulſions, though very ſtrong and vehement, his ſenſe and vnderſtanding remained in the diſeaſed, perfect and nothing obſcured, or interrupted, which in convulſions according vnto naturall cauſes was neuer ſeene, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible.</p>
               <p>The force of theſe reaſons to euince the preſidence of the Diuell, in the manner and motion of the fore-named diſeaſe, the Diuell himſelfe did ſhortly after iuſtifie, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and profeſsing himſelfe the Author thereof in plainly expreſſed words.</p>
               <p>In the ſore-named booke and chapter, there is another report or relation of a man ſudainly ſurpriſed, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie faſhion, or ſhape of madneſſe or phrenſie, wherein he vttered and reuealed things hidden, and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Science and reuelation, not onely aboue the pitch and power of naturall capacitie, and the ſtimulation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in diſeaſes contingent, and the forgerie of fained extaſie, but really in true and vpright iudgement, and vnpartiall diſcerning of a Phyſition beyond all queſtion and excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſupernatuall. The ſequele after made it good. Theſe examples are ſufficient vnto men that are wiſe, and with whom reaſon hath authoritie. I doe not affect vnaduiſed multiplication herein, ſuſpecting many hiſtories, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of diuers Authors.</p>
               <p>The poſsibilitie of thoſe which are here produced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the vnſtained credit of the Author, is apertly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the holy Scripture, where, in the Lunatike the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell manifeſted himſelfe by actions, onely proper and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9304:50"/>
vnto the power of a Spirit: ſuch was his caſting the Lunatike into the fire, and into the water, his violent rending and tearing him, which were things by the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion iudiciouſly diſtinguiſhed, in moſt part impoſsible vnto the power and nature of the Lunatike himſelfe, or of his diſeaſe alone, though not all.</p>
               <p>The man poſſeſſed among the <hi>Gadarens, Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. likewiſe doth eſtabliſh the ſame, who was knowne and ſeene euidently by the Phyſition, how farre ſimply or ſolely diſeaſed, and how farre poſſeſſed beyond diſeaſed extaſies by thoſe vndoubted workes, and that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Diuell, when he eaſily brake in peeces thoſe yron chaines wherewith the Lunatike was bound: ſo that no force thereof whatſoeuer could hold or binde him; as alſo when he vttered and ſpake that more then humane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of God: a knowledge as yet vncommunicated vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and vnto reaſon impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond way of detection, ſubiect vnto the Phyſition alone, namely, when naturall remedies aptly applyed, are attended with ſupernaturall conſequences, contrary to their nature, or aboue the ſame, out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Author, and fore-named place, there is an example alſo without farther ſtraggling of vnqueſtioned eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A certaine man there mentioned, vehemently burning and thirſting, and by intolerable heate compelled to ſeeke any mitigation, or extinction of his heate and thirſt, in want of drinke or other fitting liquor, happened to finde an Apple, in the moiſture and naturall iuice whereof, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the vſuall ſhort refreſhing of the tongue, he, after the firſt taſting thereof, immediately found (not onely that which was contrary to the nature of an Apple, greater burning and thirſt then before) but had inſtantly his mouth and iawes ſo faſt cloſed and ſealed vp thereby, that he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped ſtrangling.</p>
               <p>The reaſonable doubt of the latitation of the Diuell, in this faire, harmeleſſe, and vſuall remedie of the tongues,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9304:50"/>
thirſt and drines, was afterward made more euident and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the ſudaine and ſwift obſeſsion of his minde, with frightfull viſions, whereof as in the diſpoſition, temper, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or qualitie of his braine or body, there was no ground or cauſe, ſo in the Apple it ſelfe, was no other pernicious mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that the Diuell, as with <hi>Iudas</hi> Sop, though whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſauing in it ſelfe, ſo in this medicinall fruit, entred and poſſeſſed, where God permitted. The like may be ſaid of other both outward and inward remedies, which by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke power are and may be oft interrupted, turned and bent vnto a vſe contrary to their nature.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelfe in his booke <hi>de Sacro morbo, &amp; de Natura muliebri,</hi> doeth acknowledge many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as alſo diſeaſes and remedies themſelues to be diuine, as hauing their cauſe and being aboue the courſe of nature. When therefore fitting vnto any cauſe, matter, or humour in the body, according to true Art and Reaſon diſcouered, apt and fit remedies, are aptly and fitly by the iudicious Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on applyed, notwithſtanding, contrary to the nature and cuſtome of ſuch remedies, they haue vnuſuall and iuſtly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered effects, is there not iuſt matter of doubt concerning an vnuſuall and extraordinary cauſe anſwereable thereto? The deepe and myſticall contengents in this kinde, and their hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den reaſon and cauſe, the vnlearned man, or he that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in difficult diſcoueries, cannot diſcerne, nor can the intricate and perplexed implications therein, of doubts and ambiguites, poſsibly become intelligible in euery ordinary apprehenſion; yet by the former eaſie and familiar example, euery man may geſſe and coniecture at the moſt abſtruſe. The ſubtiltie of the Diuell doeth eaſily deceiue a vulgar thought, and in the clouds and miſts of doubts and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beguileth vſually the dimme ſight and diſquiſition.</p>
               <p>The learned Phyſition, notwithſtanding poſſeſsing true iudgement and learning; who doeth and can warily obſerue, and diſtinguiſh firſt the wonders of nature vnknowne vnto euery mediocrity of knowing: ſecondly, the true wonders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue nature in due collation with nature to be knowne, doth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9304:51"/>
not eaſily or raſhly with vulgars, erre or runne mad in the confuſion of vaine and idle ſcruples. The wonders of nature, are ſuch naturall diſeaſes as are ſeene in their wondred and admired ſhapes or mixture, to haue a great likeneſſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing identitie with ſuch maladies, as are inflicted by the Diuell. The wonders aboue nature, are ſuch diſeaſes, as are truely and vndoubtedly knowne and prooued to haue no conſiſtence, or power of conſiſtence, or cauſe in ſublunary nature.</p>
               <p>For illuſtation hereof, I will giue one materiall inſtance fitting our preſent time, that ſhall apertly without exception manifeſt the diſtinction of both theſe kinds, there with decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great oddes and difference betweene true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding in the learned Phyſition, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed wonderments of vulgars and ignorant men.</p>
               <p>There are vulgarly reported among our Engliſh vulgers to bee in the bodies of many Witches, certaine markes or excreſcencies which are vſually deemed the randevowe of the Diuell, where by couenant hee doeth ſucke the blood of Witches. Theſe excreſcencies are vſually deſcribed to beare ſometimes the ſhape of Wartes and Teates, or ſome other ſuch like tumours. They are moſt commonly found in the priuie parts. They are found ſudainely after their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſometimes to vaniſh. They doe oft bleed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are vulgarly deemed, the remaining dropping of the Diuels ſucking.</p>
               <p>There are diſeaſes likewiſe, like vnto theſe by Phyſitions many hundreth of yeeres publiſhed, &amp; both by ancient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Chirurgions, as alſo by thoſe of later times oft cured. That this be not eſteemed as a wonder, or a fable, I will produce ſome of their ſeuerall ſhapes; deſcribed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Authors, and will cite them according to their vſuall names which are theſe, <hi>Thymion, Nymphe, Cleitoris, Cercoſis, Morum, Alhaſce, Ficus, Mariſcae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the firſt thus ſaith <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> in his ſixt booke, and 71. chapter. It is an excreſcence or eminence, ſtanding out from the reſt of the fleſh, ſometimes red, ſometimes
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9304:51"/>
white, for the moſt part without paine, the bigneſſe of an Aegyptian beane and of the colours of the flowers of <hi>Thyme.</hi> They are found, ſaith he, in the priuie part of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and are cured by cutting them away. <hi>Ioannes Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherus</hi> of the Citie of <hi>Beuois</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ſometimes one of the Kings counſell and Phyſition vnto his perſon, in his ſecond booke concerning barrenneſſe doth teſtifie, that the former excreſcence doth ſometimes grow in ſome length, ſometimes in the hands, ſometimes in the feete, ſometimes in the thighes, ſometimes in the thighes, ſometimes in the face, but ſaith that they are moſt troubleſome in the priuie parts both of man and woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith in his firſt booke <hi>chap.</hi> 28. that theſe excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcencies doe ſometimes open and bleed, &amp; ſend out blood. <hi>Thymion (inquit) facile finditur &amp; cruentatur, nonnunquam aliquantum ſanguinis fundit. Antonius Muſa</hi> vpon the 26. <hi>Aph.</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the third booke teſtifieth by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation in diuers particulars, that the former diſeaſe or excreſcence doth oft-times weare and vaniſh away without helpe or remedie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond diſeaſe or excreſcence called <hi>Nymphe, Paulu-Aegineta,</hi> in his 6. booke 8. <hi>chap.</hi> doeth deſcribe to be a ſwelling or growing out of a peece of fleſh in the ſecret part of a woman riſing oft-times vnto an vndecent faſhion and a great bigneſſe. <hi>Auicenne</hi> deliuereth the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. <hi>Tom</hi> 1. <hi>Fen.</hi> 21. <hi>Tract.</hi> 4. and <hi>Albucaſis Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurg.

                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, out of learned Authors. Let vs now conſider theſe naturall diſeaſes, which are called wonders in nature, (becauſe not ordinarily or vulgarly ſeene) with thoſe markes of Witches or diſeaſes, and excreſcencies effected and cauſed by the Diuell in Witches, which (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needes be wonders aboue nature.) Let vs (I ſay) compare them together, the one with the other. Their exceeding neere neighbour-hood and likeneſſe, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnderſtanding, as they are deſcribed truely and liuely, can chuſe but acknowledge. To confound or miſtake the one for the other, is very eaſie, but yet dangerous and pernicious. I will not denie againſt due teſtimonies, and the free confeſſions of the Witches themſelues, that ſuch markes may bee by the Diuell vpon couenant made, in way of an helliſh ſacrament, betweene the Diuell and the Witch: but where the confeſsion of the Witch her ſelfe, being free from iuſt exception doeth not appeare, nor the Diuell to any ſpectatours, doeth ſhew himſelfe in the act
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9304:52"/>
of ſucking, which hee neuer doeth (as my incredulous thoughts perſwade my ſelfe) where I ſay, theſe appeare not to be manifeſt without fraude, there it is requiſite, and neceſſary, that either wee diſcharge the Diuell, and acquit him of the ſlander, or elſe diſcouer it by ſome other ſigne or note, which may iuſtly be appropriated vnto the Diuell, that his finger or guilt hath beene therein.</p>
               <p>This is reaſon, without which ought bee no perſwaſion. Euery tree is to be knowen by his owne fruit, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Therefore the diuell, is to be knowne by the workes, and fruites of a Diuell, proper and belonging vnto him. Trie and diſcerne the Spirits, (ſaith the Scripture) whether they be of God, or no. And how can they bee diſcerned, if there were not ſome notes, or properties knowne vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerning mindes, whereby they may be diſcerned. It is madneſſe therefore, to ſuppoſe it poſſible to know that which is done by a Spirit, wherein is no euidence, impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſigne, ſhew, or propertie of a Spirit. For as a naturall cauſe cannot bee knowne, but by his naturall effect; ſo is it impoſſible, that a ſpirituall cauſe ſhould be knowne, but by ſome ſupernaturall effect. For this cauſe, in all places of Scripture, where are ſet forth the outward workes, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Diuell, they doe there likewiſe all appeare to be his, in ſome extraordinary &amp; ſupernaturall note or maner.</p>
               <p>The caſting the bodies of the poſſeſſed in the Goſpel, into the middeſt of the people, was a thing extraordinary, impoſſible, and vnuſuall vnto the voluntary motion of men alone. The bringing of fire from Heauen to deuoure ſo many of <hi>Iobs</hi> ſheepe, was in the manner beyond the nature vſuall, and ordinary force, or cuſtome of fire. The carriage of the heards of Swine headlong into the Sea, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly beyond the nature of their naturall motion, yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their nature.</p>
               <p>Here may be obiected, that the Diuell doeth ordinarily worke, and produce things of ſeeming wonder, and ſtrange conſequence, wherein notwithſtanding, doeth not appeare any ſigne or impreſsion, of any ſupernaturall cauſe or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9304:53"/>
as is ſeene in many things produced in men, and iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his vſuall tentations of men.</p>
               <p>The anſwere is, that the Diuell doeth worke vpon man, two wayes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, immediately by the temptings, and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only of man vnto workes, which properly are effected by man himſelfe, in the vſuall courſe and power of mans nature.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, immediately by his owne proper action, as hee is a Spirit, and immediately worketh in himſelfe, the worke of a Spirit.</p>
               <p>In the firſt, the Diuell is not properly ſaid to worke in himſelfe, but rather to giue and offer occaſion vnto the diſpoſition and affections of man, thereby exciting, and tempting man vnto that worke, which therefore onely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the ſtampe of a worke, proper vnto a man.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond, the Diuell worketh immediately himſelfe, as he is a Spirit, and in that worke therefore muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily likewiſe bee ſeene, and appeare the ſtampe of a Spirit, ſince in the courſe and order of all things created whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, the true and immediate cauſe, his immediate true and proper effect, is the ſole true infallible ſtampe, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and proofe thereof.</p>
               <p>The workes therefore, which are called or eſteemed the Diuels, in regard of his tentations, and incitations of man, vnto fooliſh, wicked, and oft wondered miſchieuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are onely and truely called diueliſh, as proceeding from the Diuels inſtigation onely, but are not truely or properly, or immediately any workes of the Diuell, and therefore it is not requiſite, that in ſuch workes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, vnproperly called his, there ſhould appeare any ſignes, proper vnto the workes of a Spirit or Diuell.</p>
               <p>Since then it is infallible, that there can bee no poſsible diſcouery of any cauſe whatſoeuer, naturall, or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but by ſuch accidents, effects, or properties as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong, or iſſue from that cauſe, and ſince proper effects appearing, doe onely diſcouer their cauſes more
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9304:53"/>
cleerely, where they appeare more cleere, and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, where they doe appeare more obſcure, and nothing at all, where they appeare not all: Since I ſay this is true, and neuer to be infringed, thoſe ſuppoſed Witches markes, before they can iuſtly and truely bee iudged to bee by the Diuell effected or vſed, muſt by ſome ſtampe or ſigne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelfe, or to his workes, or to his vſe or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therein, be ſo determined and conuinced to be.</p>
               <p>The wonder indeed of their ſtrange ſhapes, forme and manner, is ſufficient to amaze ſuch as are not iudiciouſly read, or are vnlearned: but the Phiſition who knoweth ſuch diſeaſes to bee in nature, by that knowledge of their nature, knowing likewiſe that they doe not exceede na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doeth iuſtly ſtand apart, and diuide himſelfe from the vulgar errour and opinion, that they are any markes to be appropriate vnto the Diuell.</p>
               <p>And hence appeareth the neceſſitie of conuincing the forementioned Witches markes to bee ſupernaturall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon their ſhape or appearance onely, it can bee eſteemed iuſt, either to impute vnto the Diuell, or to call any man into queſtion. Before they can bee truely iudged or determined, whether ſupernaturall or no, the neceſſitie of conſulting with the learned Phiſition, is likewiſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. Of which wee may yet againe, giue another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration within the ſame inſtance. It hath beene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by oath confirmed and depoſed, that theſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned markes of Witches, haue (immediately after they haue beene ſeene) ſudainely vaniſhed to bee no more ſeene. The queſtion may bee, whether their ſudaine diſparence after their manifeſt appearance, bee in nature poſſible vnto ſuch like diſeaſes or no. It is knowne vnto the Phiſition, that many diſeaſes doe inſenſibly grow, and inſenſibly alſo weare and vaniſh away, without any knowledge or notice thereof taken by the diſeaſed. This therefore ſolely can bee no note of a ſupernaturall marke, whatſoeuer paſſionate ignorants fondly diſpute, to maintaine their owne wils and preiudicate reſolutions. I doe grant; if
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9304:54"/>
thoſe materiall excreſcencies, doe in a moment vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, without any precedent preparation, or alteration ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto, or doe in an inſtant appeare, and in the ſame moment, without any mutation or proportion of time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly vaniſh, then muſt this bee granted ſupernaturall: <hi>Quia nihil fit in momento,</hi> that is, no naturall being hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinence or being, without proportined time, beyond which nothing can bee really or indeed in ſublunarie nature. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there bee in the vaniſhing of the former markes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time or no, and the due antecedent mutations, and alterations in nature requiſite, who can truely iudge, but hee who doeth both know the generall courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all things, and alſo the particular courſe, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diſeaſes, which is the learned Phiſition alone. It may bee obiected, that many common men in the former markes, may as eaſily ſee and diſcerne that which is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall oft-times, as the greateſt Clarkes.</p>
               <p>For example, it hath beene publiſhed by Authors of great note, that Oracles haue beene vttered, and articulate ſounds heard diſtinctly iſſuing from the priuie parts of a <hi>Pythoniſſe.</hi> Any man that doeth know, or heare ſuch ſounds out of that place, can as directly and as truely as the Phiſition auouch this to be ſupernaturall.</p>
               <p>It was ſometime openly obiected, againſt a Witch in <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> at the publike Aſſiſe, that a Rat was oft obſerued to reſort vnto her priuie part, and with her liking and ſufferance there to ſucke. This was by oath and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony vrged againſt her, and ſhe her ſelfe confeſſed it to bee true. If the oath and teſtimony of ſufficient witneſſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Hiſtorie to bee true, there is no man vnto whom this is not apparent, as well as vnto the Phiſition to bee more then naturall. Hereto wee doe anſwere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot bee denied, that many things may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare themſelues vnto euery vulgar, as vnto the learned Phiſition to bee ſupernaturall; yet doeth not this trueth in ſome caſes, euince it true in all caſes. Becauſe ſome things are not denied vnto a vulgar eye or iudgment,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9304:54"/>
it doeth not thence follow neceſſarily, that all things are thereto euident.</p>
               <p>It is further obiected, that in thoſe caſes, Phiſitions are oft found deceiued, as well as other men. It is anſwered, that among Phiſitions, as among all ſorts of other men, there are many vulgars, who are, and may bee ordinarily, and eaſily deceiued, yea amongſt the iudicious and learned alſo, who cannot ſo ordinarily or eaſily bee deceiued, yet there muſt be ſome wants and imperfections, ſince no man in this mortall life can bee in all particuler points perfect. Notwithſtanding, this doeth not excuſe thoſe who are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and haue many more groſſe wants and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for not conſulting with thoſe that haue leſſe, ſince vnperfect perfection of knowledge, is farre better guide then imperfection, groſſe ignorance, and priuation of Art and knowledge.</p>
               <p>It may bee yet demanded, what if the Phiſition or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, cannot detect the Diuell in theſe named markes, ſince the diuel is able to haue a finger haply in them; where no note or ſigne thereof ſhall at all appeare?</p>
               <p>Anſwere hereto is, where God doeth giue vnto men no meanes, no way or poſſibilitie vnto their deſired ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there they ought to reſt contented, ſince the contrary is precipitation, and impatience with God his good will and pleaſure, and vnbridled curioſitie. For as in other caſes, namely, Fellony, Murder, all Lawe both Diuine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, doeth forbid to accuſe the Murderer, or Felon, where God hath not diſcouered his guilt by any ſigne, euidence, or proofe thereof; ſo in caſe of Witch-craft, where God hath not reuealed it by any reaſonable profe, vnto the learned &amp; iudicious, there hath no man warrant to accuſe, or challeng vpon ſuperſtitious grounds, or ſurmiſes onely. And though this moderation be iuſt and fit to be held, where God hath inhibited the contrary; yet it is no Apologie or excuſe for negligence, contempt, and want of diligent inquiſition at any other time, whenſoeuer God doeth permit or offer meanes, hope or poſſibilitie thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:9304:55"/>
There may here a queſtion be pertinently mooued, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether theſe markes before mentioned, where proued ſupernaturall, doe therefore neceſſarily conuince the party vpon whom they are found, a Witch, yea or no.</p>
               <p>Anſwere hereto is, that ſimply and alone, ſuch markes doe not prooue a Witch at all, but with ſome limitations and conſiderations, they doe abſolutely and infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a Witch.</p>
               <p>Thoſe limitations are theſe; Firſt, that thoſe markes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely detected to be ſupernaturall, bee by circumſtances, preſumptions on neceſſary inference, of reaſon prooued to be knowne, by the party in whom they are found, that they are of the Diuell, or by the Diuell there placed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they are there continued, mainteined, or preſerued with the liking and allowance of that partie. The reaſon of theſe limitations is manifeſt, for that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is able to impoſe diuers diſeaſes, as alſo ſuch like ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall markes or excreſcencies, as are before mentioned, vpon men without their liking or conſent, where God doth ſo permit him. This is euident by the Hiſtorie of <hi>Iob,</hi> vpon whom the Diuell brought extraordinary, and more then vſuall botches, biles, and ſores, beyond the common courſe and nature of thoſe diſeaſes, and this he did full ſore againſt the will, and liking of righteous <hi>Iob.</hi> No man can iuſtly be accuſed or ſuſpected in that act wherein hee is no agent, but an vnwilling Patient, nor can bee acceſſary vnto concurrence, or conſent with any author in his act, if that author bee not knowne vnto him, or not conceiued by him to be author. Indeed, if any man be found with ſuch markes, who may be conuinced to know them to bee of the Deuill, and then to like or to be contented with them, aſſuredly by manifeſt demonſtration, that man is a Witch, if not by an expreſſe and open, yet by an occult allowance of the Diuels poſſeſſion and power, of that part or portion in him. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer giueth any poſſeſſion of himſelfe vnto the Diuell, either in part or in whole, doeth thereby renounce his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, &amp; by this combination with the Diuell, is a Witch, or Sorcerer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:9304:55"/>
There remaineth as yet a doubt or queſtion, Whether ſimply the affirmation of a ſuppoſed Witch (which is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly but not properly called and deemed her confeſsion) that the Diuell doth ſucke him or her, as alſo whether the affirmation of a ſuppoſed Witch, affirming her ſelfe to be a Witch, doe infallibly conuince that ſuppoſed Witch, to be a Witch indeede; and whether that affirmation be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient (as commonly deemed her owne confeſsion) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne her.</p>
               <p>The anſwer is negatiue. The reaſon is, for that many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations in themſelues, and at firſt view doe ſeeme true ſerious and ſufficient; which better and more conſiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, are oft times euen ſenſeleſſe and ridiculous; and therefore iuſtly are denied credit.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe no accuſations, whether againſt any man himſelfe, or againſt another, wherein is no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or likelihood, no colour or poſsibilitie of being; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are or ought to be admitted or heard in iuſtice in any Courts of Iuſtice. And for this cauſe the teſtimonies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, or confeſsions which by fooles, or madmen are auouched, are by all nations through the world in law not valued, and reiected. The ſame regard is had of the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and teſtimonies of children and of melancholy people, and likewiſe of men with yeeres and age doting, or by diſeaſes or cares manifeſtly decrepite in their wittes and ſenſes. That ſuch decrepits there are vſually walking among men not noted nor knowne vnto moſt, or many, except ſometimes vpon eſpeciall occaſion or triall of them made, is no wonder.</p>
               <p>I did my ſelfe know ſome lately liuing, who formerly haue beene very vnderſtanding, yet diuers yeeres before their end, were with age in their inward ſenſes ſo worne and waſted; that although as reaſonable creatures vnto the common view, they talked, conuerſed, conferred, ſpake many times, and in many things with very good reaſon, and ſenſibly; yet oft-times by ſodaine enterchanges, they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9304:56"/>
neither knew reaſon nor themſelues, nor their owne names nor children.</p>
               <p>I now know a man neere an hundreth yeere old, who hauing in my late remembrance beene an excellent pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, doth neither now know a word, nor can write nor name ſo much as one letter among the foure and twentie; yet hath he his ſight good, as by his diſcerning and vpon his view thereof, giuing right name and title vnto other as ſmall formes and characters is apparent. His memory ſometimes euen of the ſame things is altogether gone by fits: and by fits ſometimes returneth in many things, but not in all, nor in any alway or certainly. Other ſome I haue knowne in their memory and phanſie by age ſo worne, that they could not hold or retaine in the one ſo much as that which very lately was in their eye; in the other ſo much as that which was in the ſame inſtant almoſt conceiued; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming things in this confuſion which neuer were nor euer could be; and denying their ſight of thoſe things which from their ſight thereof they had truely before named of their owne accord; one while conſtantly beleeuing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching whatſoeuer was ſaid or informed them, though neuer ſo diſſonant from ſenſe or reaſon; another while as confidently denying whatſoeuer truth was ſaid or vrged, though neuer ſo manifeſt vnto their ſight or ſenſe. This is not ſtrange in age, ſince in diſeaſes it is vſuall for men ſometimes for a time to loſe their memory alone, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their reaſon alone, ſometimes imagination: ſometimes part of one; and part of another; ſometimes all; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perfectly none; and yet imperfect in euery one. It ſometimes alſo is ſeene (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith) that a man inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely and accurately all his inward ſenſes of right reaſon, memory and imagination in all other things beſide; yet in ſome one particular alone and in no other whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is euer conſtantly and without change void of ſenſe or reaſon, and as a very mad man or foole.</p>
               <p>Thus much is alſo writren by others of many wiſe and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9304:56"/>
learned men; who notwithſtanding in ſome one particular alone haue diſcouered them ſelues to be very fooles or mad men: conſtantly affirming themſelues to be doggs, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, glaſſes, and for that one follie neuer reclaimed, in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things being iudicious, learned, diſcreete and ſolid. Neither is every vulgar man, nor euery man vulgarly learned not accurately iudging able to diſcerne theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, at firſt, or alwaies; much leſſe where they are hardly and difficultly eſpied, or by fits onely doe ſhew themſelues. How poſſible is it for theſe ſorts of people either to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by others, or from their owne guide and vnſtable conceite to affirme any thing whatſoeuer concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or others? and for that cauſe how neceſſary is it in matter of weight and iudgments, eſpecially of life, to take heede of their raſh admittance vnto accuſations or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies concerning themſelues or any others. Vnto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion ſo properly and truely called, doe neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre three things. Firſt, in a confeſſion is properly implied &amp; vnderſtood the partie confeſſing to be capable of reaſon, becauſe without reaſon he can neither know nor iudge of himſelfe nor of his guilt. Secondly, in a confeſſion is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary that a partie confeſſing himſelf doth truly know what the Law doth take &amp; define that offence to be which he doth aſſume vnto himſelfe. For by ignorance of the law ſometimes ſilly men ſuppoſe themſelues and others to haue incurred the danger of the Law, where he that truly vnderſtandeth the Law is able to informe him the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and for this cauſe the law it ſelfe doth giue leaue to conſult with the Lawyer, and with ſuch as profeſſe and are skilfull in the Law.</p>
               <p>Diuines likewiſe generally acknowledge and grant, that there is a miſtaking, an ignorantly and a falſely accuſing conſcience or guilt, as well as a conſcience iuſtly iudging and accuſing.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe many a man may take himſelfe to be a Theefe, a Witch or other offender, who doth not truly or rightly konw what Theft in his owne caſe or ſome other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9304:57"/>
points is, or what Witch-craft or ſome other offences ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly in themſelues are, or by the Law are vnderſtood; being in ſome caſes not knowen or agreed, among Lawyers themſelues. It is therefore ſenſeleſſe that a man can accuſe himſelfe iuſtly of an offence which he doth not know; and therefore alſo is it as vniuſt to admit ſuch an accuſation againſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in a confeſſion is implyed and preſuppoſed a precedent manifeſt offence or guilt either by faire euidence likely to be prooued, or at leaſt by due circumſtances and preſumptions iuſtly ſuſpected or queſtioned.</p>
               <p>I doe hence conclude demonſtratiuely, that if a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Witch be not firſt found capable of reaſon, and free from dotage with age or yeeres or ſickneſſe; and doe not alſo know what Witch-craft or a Witch is, and thirdly if the Witch-craft or ſinne it ſelfe bee not vpon ſufficient grounds either prooued, or at leſt queſtioned; the meere accuſation of ſuch a ſuppoſed Witch againſt her ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the former conſiderations, is not ſimply or alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conuince or condemne her; neither is ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, truly or properly to be tearmed a confeſsion. And thus we haue made euident by this inſtance of the ſuppoſed Witches markes, how the learned Phyſition poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsing true Art and learning, is not ſo commonly as the vulgar ſort tranſported into the maze of vaine wonder and ignorant admiration, but duely and truly weighing reaſon doth apart diſtinguiſh and put true difference betweene the wonders in nature, and the wonders aboue nature.</p>
               <p>The wonders in nature are ſuch diſeaſes, as in their ſtrange ſhape and likeneſſe, doe counterfeit ſuch maladies, as are induced by the Diuell or by Witch-craft. Wonders aboue nature, are ſuch diſeaſes, wherein the finger of the Diuell is indeede and really diſcouered.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt kinde (as here) ſo formerly in a former Manuell, I haue briefely deliuered, both ſome of their generall <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page.</hi> 58 59 60</note> deſcriptions, denyed by no man that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time was, or at this time is a iudicious and learned
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9304:57"/>
Phyſician, as alſo diuers of their <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 61 62 63 64</note> particular Hiſtories in the perſons of ſome ſicke men knowne vnto my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Of the ſecond it is here needleſſe to propound any more particulars then thoſe aboue mentioned, which I eſteeme for the generall illuſtration ſufficient. In true and right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and diſtinction of the one from the other, multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of conſideration and circumſpection ought diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend the intricate maze and labyrinth of error, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion in their deceiueable likeneſſes, whereby the Diuell, for his owne aduantage, and the perdition of ſeduced and beguiled men, doth ſometimes cunningly hide his owne workes, and the diuelliſh practiſes of Witches and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, from their due detection and puniſhment; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to inſnare the guiltleſſe and innocent, doth iuggling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeme to doe thoſe things which Nature doth iuſtly challenge, not as his, but as her owne, in iuſt ballance weighed. It is moſt certaine, that the Diuell cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly mixe himſelfe, or his power, with any inferiour nature, ſubſtance or body, but the alteration, by the coniunction of ſo farre diſcrepant natures, in the vnchangeable decree of the vniuerſall nature of all things, neceſſarily and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoidably produced, muſt needs witneſſe and manifeſtly detect it in the great and mighty oddes. This is very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and apparent in all the ſupernaturall workes of the Diuell, before mentioned in the generall diſcourſe of this ſmall Treatiſe or worke, whether ſuch as were declared manifeſt to ſenſe, or ſuch as were euident to reaſon; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as were effected by the Diuell himſelfe, with the conſent or contract of a Sorcerer or Witch, or ſuch as were without their knowledge, ſocietie, or contract performed by himſelfe. All thoſe ſupernaturall workes of both theſe kinds were therefore knowne to be ſupernaturall, becauſe they were aboue and beyond any cauſe in ſublunary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The like the learned Phyſician may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, concerning diſeaſes inflicted or mooued by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. For it is impoſsible that the finger or power of the Diuell ſhould be in any maladie, but ſuch a cauſe muſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9304:58"/>
needs produce ſome effect like it ſelfe, where true and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious diſcerning is able to finde the infallible, certaine, and vndeceiued ſtampe of difference. Thus farre hath bin briefely declared, how the Phyſician properly and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth alone enter into the due conſideration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of diſeaſes (where is iuſt occaſion of queſtion) whether naturally or ſupernaturally inferred. How vnfit it is here to admit euery idiot for a Phyſician or Counſellor (as is too common both in theſe and all other affaires of health) let wiſe men iudge.</p>
               <p>Certainely from hence it commeth to paſſe, that moſt men for euer liue in perpetuall confuſion of their thoughts in theſe caſes, and as a iuſt iudgement of God againſt their careleſſe ſearch and neglect of learned and warranted true counſel, all certainety and truth herein doth ſtill fly farre from them. For as in theſe ambiguities is requiſite and neceſſary, a learned, iudicious, and prudent Phyſician; ſo is it as neceſſary that he finde thoſe that neede herein aduice, truely and conſtantly obedient vnto good reaſon, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſcreete, not mutable vpon euery vaine and idle proiect to ſtart away, and to bee tranſported from a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, iuſt &amp; diſcreete proceeding, vnto vncertaine, vaine, and Empiricall tryals, ſince wiſdome, knowledge and truth are neuer truely found, but onely of thoſe, that with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, patience, and perſeuerance ſearch and ſeeke them out. It remaineth now to come vnto the ſecond way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the bewitched ſicke, which was before ſaid to conſiſt in ſuch things as were ſubiect and manifeſt vnto a vulgar viewe, as the firſt vnto the learned Phyſician alone. As of the firſt, ſome few examples haue been propounded, ſo of the latter let vs alſo viewe other ſome.</p>
               <p>In the time of their puroxiſmes or fits, ſome diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue beene ſeene to vomit crooked iron, coales, brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, nailes, needles, pinnes lumps of lead, waxe, hayre, ſtrawe, and the like, in ſuch quantity, figure, faſhion and proportion, as could neuer poſsibly paſſe downe, or ariſe vp thorow the naturall narrowneſſe of the throat, or be

               <p>As theſe examples are manifeſt to any beholder, which ſhall at any time happen to view them: ſo are the examples of the firſt and ſecond kinde euident to the reaſon and iudgement of the learned and iudicious Phyſicion, and all doe therefore certainely detect and prooue a ſupernaturall Author, cauſe, or vertue, becauſe they are manifeſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall effects.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we pointed out briefely, the detection of the bewitched Sicke, both by learned Reaſon proper vnto the iudicious Phyſicion, and alſo by common ſenſe and reaſon in all men.</p>
               <p>If men more at large pleaſe to exerciſe themſelues in due conſideration and proofe hereof, they ſhall finde more certaine and ſound ſatisfaction and fruit, with the bleſsing and allowance of God, then can iſſue out of the mouthes of Sorcerers and Witches, which God hath curſed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9304:59"/>
and in whoſe hearts and mouthes, the Diuell is oft a lying Spirit.</p>
               <p>It hath been briefely, and yet ſufficiently herein proued, that Almightie God hath giuen vnto Reaſon light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reaſonable, temperate and ſober minds, through cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect care and diligence, may ſee and behold whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is truely poſsible, or iuſt for man to know, with the fauour and allowance of Gods grace, in the detection and diſcouery of the bewitched Sicke. Whoſoeuer therefore ſhall contemne, or neglect this light, and ſhall aske coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Diuels and Witches, the open and proclaimed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, doe certainely relinquiſh their faith, and truſt in God their Creator, and their patience and dependance vpon his prouidence.</p>
               <p>And although it may ſometimes fall out, that proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous iſſue doth ſeeme to follow the counſell of the Diuell, yet doth it behooue men to be wary, and not preſume, leſt it prooue onely a ſweete baite, that by a ſenſible good, the diuell may draw their bewitched deſirous vaine minds vnto an inſenſible damnable hurt. For certainly, he who will rather be beholding vnto the Diuell, for his life or health, then chuſe to die in the gracious and mercifull hand of God his Creator, can neuer expect to participate any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſaluation in him, without extraordinary repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the reaſonable diſcouery of the bewitched Sicke, wherein leauing to enquire at Witches, Sorcercers, or impoſtors, vpright men, that loue or feare God, or imbrace Religion or common reaſon, may and ought confine and ſatisfie their iuſt deſires.</p>

               </head>
               <p>VVE haue hitherto conſidered, how the workes of Diuels and Witches, may be both manifeſt to Senſe, and euident to Reaſon. They haue in their diuers kinds and different performances and manners diſtinctly beene inſtanced. Beſides thoſe kinds which haue beene mentioned, there may bee innumerable more, among which are thoſe who vndertake and are enquired at, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale treaſures hid, goods loſt or conueighed away, the workes and guilt of other Witches, good fortunes, and euill fortunes in diuers affaires, diſſeignes and attempts: as alſo thoſe who vndertake by inchantment, to leade cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue the wils and minds of men, vnto extraordinarie and vnreaſonable deſires or luſts, hatred or loue vnto, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this or that perſon, or this or that particular thing, aboue or beyond the naturall power of reſiſtence, and the force and vſuall guidance of naturall reaſon, in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of mans will and nature: but they are all inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſame generall kinde, and common proofe of their diuelliſh impietie, deriued from the word of God before alleadged vnanſwerably, and the true conſequence of Reaſon from thence.</p>
               <p>The difference that is in their diuers kinds, doth onely ariſe from their ſeuerall ſubiects, manners, ceremonies, and rites, according to their ſeuerall differing contracts with the Diuell: ſome vſing in their workes, reuelations or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous anſweres, of the demand of reſorting people in one manner, faſhion, ceremonie, geſture, and rite; ſome in another, and ſome in none at all, certaine, or vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe ceremonies, with their ſeuerall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9304:60"/>
and the manners thereof, I will not write, partly, becauſe in this place not much materiall; partly, becauſe they are difficult to detect, except by the Witches owne free confeſſion, which happeneth very rare and ſeldome; partly, becauſe they tend more to the ſatisfaction of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie then of vſe, and therefore are not without ſome danger publiſhed. It hath now beene manifeſt by the word and mouth of God, vnto the reaſon of man, how a Witch or Sorcerer may euidently appeare vnto right Reaſon; namely by his voluntary vndertaking to bee enquired at, for knowledge and reuelation of ſuch things as are hidden by God from all knowledge of men, and are ſolely and properly in the knowledge of Spirits, as hath beene by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Authors and by reaſon declared.</p>
               <p>The reuelation being found ſupernaturall, doth diſcouer the ſupernaturall Agent or Author the Diuell, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act whatſoeuer man doeth vndertake in part, or in whole, muſt neceſſarily buy or borrow from him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be conuinced vndoubtedly of contract with him.</p>
               <p>We haue produced diuers ſorts of noted Practiſers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of this inhibited contract, both in the holy Scripture expreſſely nominated, and alſo by their ordinarie common cuſtome herein obſerued in ſeuerall kindes.</p>
               <p>Concerning them all, we will conclude as a corallary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that went before, with the teſtimonie and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lucius Apuleius,</hi> that famous, expert, &amp; learned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, in his booke <hi>de Aureo Aſino,</hi> from his long proofe and acquaintance with the Diuell: <hi>Daemones</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>praeſident Auguriis, Aruſpiciis, oraculis, Magorum mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis,</hi> that is, the Diuels are chiefe preſidents, haue chiefe power or authoritie, are chiefe Maiſters, Guides, or Rulers ouer Diuination, or reuelation by the ſignes taken in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fowles, of diuination by inſpection of the entralls of beaſts, of Oracles, and of all the miracles or miraculous workes of Magicians. They that will not beleeue the holy Scripture, nor the teſtimony of ſo many men and ages,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9304:60"/>
that the Diuell is the ſole Author of vaine miraculous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, diuinations and workes, let them credit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician his owne mouth.</p>
               <p>As we haue hitherto viewed, how Witch-craft and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may bee, firſt, by ſenſe manifeſtly detected: ſecondly, by reaſon euidently conuicted: ſo let vs now conſider, how they may bee both produced vnto the barre of Iuſtice, and bee arraigned and condemned of manifeſt high Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Almighty God, and of combination with his open and profeſſed enemy the Diuell.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, ſince it chiefely conſiſteth in that which is manifeſt vnto the outward ſenſe, if the witneſſes of the manifeſt magicall and ſupernaturall act, be ſubſtantiall, ſufficient, able to iudge, free from exception of malice, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie, diſtraction, folly; and if by conference &amp; counſell with learned men, religiouſly and induſtriouſly exerciſed, in iudging in thoſe affaires, there bee iuſtly deemed no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſenſe, miſtaking of reaſon or imagination, I ſee no true cauſe, why it ſhould deſerue an <note n="*" place="margin">Crimina Meleficorum ſunt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſoil, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent ad fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticum <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The ſecond kinde of Witch by euidence of reaſon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, is farre more frequent then the firſt, as appeareth by the varietie and multitude of names, which it hath bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon it, and the diuerſitie of kindes and faſhions which it hath put on. It is likewiſe more eaſily detected and prooued.</p>
               <p>A ſupernaturall reuelation being firſt made truely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt (leſt prepoſterouſly wee haply call a ſurmiſed, or falſely ſuſpected offender into queſtion, before any offence
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9304:61"/>
be apparent or knowne; which is an vniuſt iniury, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of rebuke and ſhame with God and iuſt men) a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall reuelation (I ſay) being manifeſt, any mans guilty contract therein is prooued, by his vndertaking to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at therein.</p>
               <p>That vndertaking likwiſe is eaſily knowne &amp; diſcouered by thoſe that haue inquired. The foundation of this way of inueſtigation of this Witch or Sorcerer, is the Word of God it ſelfe before recited, and iuſt and true reaſon built thereupon, cannot fall or be ſhaken.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing brought theſe priſoners to the Barre, I there arreſt any farther progreſſe, and leaue them to Iuſtice, to the decree and ſentence of the reuerend, graue, and learned Iudge, and ſo proceede to the third promiſed way of inueſtigation, and inquiſition of Witches and Sorcerers, according to likely preſumption, probable and artificiall coniecture.</p>
               <p>But before wee arriue vpon that point, it is neceſſarie, that firſt a materiall obiection bee ſatisfied. That is, in the forementioned Iudgement of ſupernaturall workes of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery manifeſt to ſenſe, how can any true teſtimony or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be required or expected, ſince doubt is made whether really or truely, or deluſorily and in ſeeming onely, many or moſt things of that kinde, are ſeene or heard? Hereto is anſwered: As a true ſubſtance is ſeene not of it ſelfe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but in and by the outward true ſigne, ſhape, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, colours, and dimenſion inherent therein, and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable there-from; ſo the true likeneſſe, reſemblance and pourtraiture of that ſubſtance, when ſeparated from that ſubſtance, is as truely and as really ſeene. Therefore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doeth ſhew vs, that the ſame eye which ſaw the ſhape, proportion, and figure, together with the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, doeth as perfectly both ſee and know it, when it is ſeparated from the ſubſtance by the Art of the Painter.</p>
               <p>As in the true miracles of God, wrought by the hand of his ſeruant <hi>Moſes,</hi> the true and vndoubted ſubſtance of a truely created Serpent, was ſeene when it was changed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9304:61"/>
from a rodde, by the outward proper and inherent ſhape: ſo as truely was an outward pourtraiture and likeneſſe of Serpents ſeene, in the falſe miracle of the ſeeming tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the Sorcerers roddes. For how could religion or reaſon condemne thoſe miracles of the Diuell for illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if the liuely reſemblance of miracles appearing mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly vnto the eye, had not thereby made them knowne? For an example, or illuſtration, how is a iuggling deceit knowne but by the eye? The ſight is ſaid to bee deceiued therein. Therefore it doeth ſee that which doeth deceiue. Reaſon likewiſe comparing that which was ſeene, with that which is not ſeene; that is, the counterfait with the true ſubſtance, doeth prooue the counterfait the preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of the ſight. The ſame eyes therefore that ſaw, in the true miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſubſtance of a Serpent by the true inſeparable inherent ſhape, ſaw likewiſe the true image and picture of a Serpent, in the falſe and ſeeming miracles of the Enchaunters of Egypt. The teſtimony of the preſentation of both vnto the eye, is as true as trueth it ſelfe; becauſe the Word of trueth hath ſaid it. That the Diuell is as powerfull as the moſt excellent Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to repreſent any the moſt true and liuely likeneſſe of any creature, is in reaſon cleare, and hath beene alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prooued.</p>
               <p>Therefore a true teſtimonie may bee truely giuen, and iuſtly accepted or taken of a liuely ſhape, figure, likeneſſe, or proportion, really preſented (by the Art of the Diuell) vnto the eye. All the doubt then remaining, is, to put a true difference betweene that which our imagination doeth repreſent vnto vs, from within the braine, and that which wee ſee without by the outward ſenſe. This difference will beſt appeare by an example. <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his firſt booke, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>de Abd. rer. cauſ.</hi> doeth make mention of a man, who by the force of charmes, would coniure into a looking glaſſe certaine ſhapes or viſions, which there would either by writing, or by liuely preſentations ſo perfectly expreſſe and ſatisfie, whatſoeuer hee did demaund or commaund
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9304:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto them, that eaſily and readily it might bee diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and knowne by ſtanders by. This <hi>Fernelius</hi> doeth report that hee ſaw himſelfe. What ſhall wee ſay herein? Was this Diueliſh practiſe a thing doubtfull? Was it not manifeſt to many eyes, diuerſitie of beholders, and the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious view of a learned and diſcerning ſight. The like <hi>Franciſcus Picus Miraudula</hi> reporteth, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Magician of <hi>Italy</hi> in his time, did keepe the skull of a dead man, out of which the Diuell did deliuer anſweres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men enquiring, when the Wizard had firſt vttered cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words, and had turned the skull toward the Sunne. Theſe things being palpably ſeene, could not bee meere imagination. Thoſe things which are meerely in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (with thoſe men whom diſeaſes depriue not of their ſenſe or reaſon) are by right reaſon and true ſenſe, after a ſhort time of their preualence, eaſily detected to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; but thoſe things which are truely, really, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſeene, remaine the ſame for euer after in their due reception of ſenſe; with vndoubted and vnchanged allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that a man in a ſleepe or dreame, though for a ſhort ſpace, hee doeth oft times verily, really, and very feelingly (as it were) thinke himſelfe in many actions and employments; yet when hee awaked from ſleepe, his ſenſe and reaſon doe tell him hee was but in a dreame. Many ſicke perſons likewiſe vſually, though waking, dreame of things falſely imagined, but the diſeaſe being gone, and their ſenſe and reaſon there-from recouered, they then know and laugh at the fallacies of their imaginations. By theſe ſhort inſtances it is apparent, that it is not a thing impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but vſuall and familiar vnto all kinde of men that want not their common wits, to diſtinguiſh betweene thoſe things which are onely in imagination, and thoſe which are reall and indeede.</p>
               <p>From hence we may then truely conclude, that againſt the acts of Sorcerie and Witch-craft manifeſt to ſenſe, the due teſtimonies of vnderſtanding, diſcreete, and iuſt men,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9304:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ought to bee no leſſe equiualent then againſt another open acts, or crime whatſoeuer, whereof the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> may ſerue to ſhut vp and conclude all doubt for euer herein, for an vnanſwerable inſtance and proofe. Shee acknowledgeth her guilt and crime might bee made manifeſt vnto <hi>Saul</hi> in theſe wordes, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 9. Wherefore ſeekeſt thou to take mee in a ſnare, to cauſe mee to die? <hi>Saul</hi> likewiſe himſelfe doeth grant vnto her, the ſufficiency of his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to cauſe her to die, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. in theſe wordes, As the Lord liueth, no harme ſhall come vnto thee, for this thing: meaning, by his teſtimony of her fact, no harme ſhould come vnto her. But here may bee obiected, that it was not his teſtimony of her fact of raiſing the viſion of <hi>Saul,</hi> which the Witch did feare, but his teſtimony of her confeſſion of her ſelfe to be a Witch, by promiſing to vndertake it. The contrary is manifeſt by the Text, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. See, thy hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide hath obeyed thy voyce, and I haue put my ſoule in thy hand, and haue obeyed the word which thou ſaidſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. And thus is the doubt concerning the ſufficiencie of teſtimonies, and witneſſe in caſe of Witch-craft ſatisfied. It now remaineth as was promiſed and intended, that we next view that light vnto the diſcouery of Witch-craft, which artificiall coniecture, probable reaſon and likely preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe afford, ſince what ſenſe and reaſon haue made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt is already declared.</p>

               <p>Hence alſo it commeth to paſſe, that according to ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaſures, and degrees of diligence, ſtudy, practice, and exerciſe of iudging in probabilities, men doe diuerſly differ, ſome excelling other in the merited ſtiles and attributes of ſubtiltie, Policy, Sagacity, Exquiſitenes. It is true, that in probabilitie, is no perpetuall <note n="*" place="margin">Certum eſt, quod nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam aliter fiat, probabile, quod plerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ita fiat, Cicero.</note> certainty: notwithſtanding he that warily and wiſely weigheth it, cannot in the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof but finde more certainty, then in blinde and vnlikely caſualtie; then in raſh attempts and proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, voide of counſell, or likely reaſon.</p>
               <p>For although ſometimes thoſe things which ſeeme moſt likely and probable, doe happen to prooue falſe, yet doth nature and reaſon teach and inioyne vs rather to giue credit thereto; and experience doth manifeſt that the cauſe of deception therein, for the moſt part, doth conſiſt in the weakeneſſe of mans iudging thereof aright.

               <p>The <hi>Oratour</hi> in his coniecturall ſtate or queſtions, in his pleas of doubtfull and controuerſed facts, or rights, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in oft-times probabilitie and likelihood, ſeeme to ſtand equall and vnpartiall vnto both parts: notwithſtanding by mature, acute, and ſeaſonable preſſing, and vrging that which is moſt like, moſt reaſonable, and conſonant with right, with law and equitie, in the end doth bring into light, and diſcouer, what is moſt equall, vpright, and worthy to be credited, or reſpected. What euictions of truth and right, what conuictions of guilt and errour doe dayly iſſue from hence, common experience, doth prooue and demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>Thus much briefely prefixed in generall, concerning the neceſſitie, light and truth of probabilities; it now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to conſider the vſe and power thereof likewiſe, in our particular propoſed ſubiect of Witch-craft, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe doth not onely iuſtifie (as in all other ſubiects) but the word of vndoubted truth.</p>
               <p>Almightie God, in caſe of Idolatrie, doth not onely publiſh and proclaime his deteſtation of that great ſinne it ſelfe, but therewith doth include whatſoeuer hath any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie of reſpect, or reference thereto; whether in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and inclination, or in ceremonie or ſuperſtitious ſhew. This is euident, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. where he firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9304:64"/>
his people ſo much as to imitate, or doe after the manners of the Gentiles; and afterward particulariſeth their making their ſonnes and daughters to paſſe thorow the fire. Likewiſe <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. 27, 28. where he forbiddeth as much as the cutting of his peoples heads, or the corners of their heads round, or marring the tufts of their beards, or marking or cutting of their fleſh, as was the manner of Infidels and Gentiles, in their mourning and lamenting of the dead. Likewiſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 21. where he forbiddeth ſo much as the planting of any groues of trees neere his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, becauſe it was the cuſtome, inuention, manner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Idolaters.</p>
               <p>As in caſe of Idolatrie, ſo in caſe of Witch-craft, which is likewiſe a kinde of Idolatry, becauſe the worſhip of Diuels, Almightie God in thoſe places of holy Writ, where he publiſheth and proclaimeth his high diſpleaſure againſt Witches and Sorcerers, with that abominable ſinne it ſelfe, doth alſo condemne as abominable; Firſt, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall all kinde of ſhew, of affection, liking, inclination, or reſpect thereof; Secondly, any cuſtomes, faſhions, rites, ceremonies, ſuperſtitions, or geſtures from thence deriued, or belonging thereto.</p>
               <p>The firſt is manifeſt, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. <hi>verſe</hi> 31. There the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, from their God <hi>Iehouah,</hi> doth charge his people, that they doe not ſo much as turne toward, or decline toward Sorcerers or South-ſayers, vouchſafe to aske any queſtion, or to reſpect them: and <hi>Leuit.</hi> 20. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. he giueth iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſentence of death, againſt that ſoule that doth but turne or looke toward them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is likewiſe manifeſt, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. where Almightie God noteth the ſuperſtitious peepings, whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and mutterings of Sorcerers, and according to thoſe geſtures, doth with reproch terme them whiſperers, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and peepers: and <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11. he rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their mumblings, and charmings, and their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous marking the flying of fowles; and <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. <hi>verſe</hi> 26. he noteth their vaine and ceremonious obſeruing of times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:9304:64"/>
If then Almightie God be ſo ſtrict, that he will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure or tolerate ſo much as a friendly looking toward Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers: the leaſt reſpect giuen vnto them, or ſo much as a demand of a queſtion at their hands, any inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, any their ceremonies, rites or ſuperſtitions, yea, ſo ſmall a matter as their very outward geſtures; how can religious zeale, or the duty of man toward God his Creator, eſteeme any of theſe, or the like, or the leaſt of them, leſſe then ſufficient matter of probable doubt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, religious iealouſie, and ſuſpicion againſt ſuch men, as doe, or dare preſume to imitate, to practiſe or vſe them?</p>
               <p>As the holy Scripture hath pointed out ſome few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, manners, and rites of Sorcerers, for an example and light vnto all other of the ſame kinde: ſo hath the daily obſeruations of ſucceeding times added infinite more, which haue, doe, and ſtill may encreaſe, multiply, and be added, and newly inuented, and put on new different ſhapes and faſhions, according to the fancie of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors therein, which are the Diuell, and man poſſeſſed by him, in whoſe powers and will, according to the nature, qualitie and conditions of their contract, dependeth and conſiſteth the variation, or innouation of ceremonious rites.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe, among Authors and records both of elder and later times, wee reade of ſuch diuerſities and numbers of ſuperſtitious litations, dedications, performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a diabolicall ſolemnities. As therefore we haue manifeſted ſuch ſuperſtitious rites, ceremonies and geſtures of Sorcerers, as the holy Scripture hath noted and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered; ſo let vs propound ſome other by after-times, and other Authors obſerued.</p>
               <p>Some haue vſed in their intention or execution of their Diabolicall workes, or in the way of preluſion one kinde of <note n="*" place="margin">See Maſter Perkins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of Witch-craft, chap. 2. pag. 48.</note> ceremonious homage, and ſome another. Some doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer attempt nor enterpriſe a Diabolicall execution, but with mumblings, whiſperings, and ſecret ſounds, and words
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9304:65"/>
heard grumbling in their mouthes: as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> in his 9. booke of herbes and plants doth witneſſe, concerning certaine Magicians in gathering <hi>Helleborus,</hi> and <hi>Mandra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gora:</hi> and as is likewiſe vndoubtedly diſcouered, by the great attributes that are by many famous Writers aſcribed vnto the Caball of the Iewes, and vnto letters, characters, words, ſillables and ſentences ſuperſtitiouſly pronounced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> writeth, that a certaine Sorcerer by vttering and muttering but one word, immediately killed, or cauſed to dye a Serpent or Scorpion. <hi>Beniuenius</hi> in his booke <hi>de Abd. morb. cauſ.</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That ſome kinde of people haue beene obſerued to doe hurt and to ſurpriſe others, by vſing only certaine ſacred and holy words.</hi> It is apparent likewiſe, that others haue accompliſhed their diueliſh ends, by apparitions, ſhapes, or figures, raiſed or coniured into glaſſes; as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> an eye-witneſſe, in his booke <hi>de Abdit. rer. cauſ.</hi> doth publiſh. Some receiue power and vertue from the Diuell vnto their Diabolicall preparations, by certaine inchanted hearbes, or medicines which they mixe and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes with braſſe hookes, ſometimes by Moone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine in the night, ſometimes with their feete bare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and their bodies clothed with white ſhirts, as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth. Some are reported, to obtaine of the Diuell their deſired ends or workes, by deliuering vnto the Diuell bonds or couenants, written with their owne hands. This <hi>Serres</hi> the French Chronicler doth report, confeſſed by certaine Witches, in the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox,</hi> in the life of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> doth make mention of a yong man, who deliuered a bond vnto the Diuell, vpon certaine conditions, which bond was written with the yong mans owne blood, and vpon his repentance, and the earneſt zealous prayer of the people vnto God in his behalfe, was redeliuered, and caſt into the Church in the view and ſight of the whole aſſembly there and then being. Some deriue an effectuall vertue vnto their decreed Diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh workes, by hanging characters or papers about the necke, as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth. Some practiſe to bring their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9304:65"/>
Diueliſh ends vnto iſſue, by coniured images and pictures of waxe, golde, earth, or other matter, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in his booke <hi>de occultis Naturae</hi> witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holingshed,</hi> page 534. doth chronicle the execution of certaine Traitours, for conſpiring the king of Englands death by Sorcerous and Magicall pictures of waxe. The ſame author, page 1271. doth report, that in the twentith yeere of Queene <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> a figure-flinger (as hee termeth him) being ſuſpected as a Coniurer or Witch, ſudainely dying, there was found about him (beſides bookes of coniuration, and other Sorcerous papers or Characters) the picture of a man wrought out of Tynne. Some late writers haue obſerued, that diuers Witches by ſuch pictures, haue cauſed the perſons thereby repreſented ſecretly to languiſh and conſume, as was lately prooued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome late famous Witches of <hi>Yorke-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> by the teſtimonies beyond exception of witneſſes, not onely preſent, but preſidents in their tryall and arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some execute their helliſh intentions by infernall compoſitions, drawne out of the bowels of dead and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Infants; as <hi>Ioannes Baptiſt Porta</hi> in his booke <hi>de Magia naturali,</hi> doth from his owne knowledge affirme, and thereto the <hi>Malleus Maleficarum</hi> with others doe aſſent.</p>
               <p>Some practiſe alſo Sorcery by tying knots, as Sant <hi>Ierome</hi> teſtifieth in <hi>vita Hilarij,</hi> concerning a prieſt of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> at <hi>Memphis.</hi> Some practiſe Witch-craft by touching with the hand or finger onely, as <hi>Biniuenius</hi> ſaith. Some in their Sorcerous acts or coniurations, vſe partchment made of the skinne of Infants, or children borne before their time: as <hi>Serres</hi> reporteth from the confeſſion of Witches, in the time and raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth detected. Some for the promoting of their Diueliſh deuices, vſe the miniſtery of  liuing creatures, or of Diuels and ſpirits in their <note n="*" place="margin">Perkins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Witch-craft, chap. 2. page, 48.</note> likeneſſe as hiſtories report, and <hi>Theocritus</hi> in his <hi>Pharmacentria,</hi> ſeemeth to credit, inducing there a Sorcereſſe, who by the power of her bird, did drawe and force her Louer to come vnto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:9304:66"/>
This ſeemeth not impoſsible vnto a Witch, by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of liuing ſhapes, which the Diuell in former ages hath vſually aſſumed, termed <hi>Faunes, Satyres, Nymphes,</hi> and the like, familiarly conuerſing with men. Some bring their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sorcery vnto their wiſhed end, by ſacrificing vnto the Diuell ſome liuing creatures, as <hi>Serres</hi> likewiſe witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, from the confeſsion of Witches in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> deprehended; among whom, one confeſſed to haue offered vnto his Diuell or Spirit a Beetle.</p>
               <p>This ſeemeth not improbable, by the Diabolicall litati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and bloudy ſacrifices, not onely of other creatures, but euen of men, wherewith in ancient time the heathen plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their gods, which were no other then Diuels. And rather then the Diuell will altogether want worſhip, he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contented to accept the parings of nailes; as <hi>Serres</hi> from the confeſsion of certaine French Witches doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Some Authors write, that ſome ſorts of Sorcerers are obſerued to faſten vpon men their Magicall miſchieuous effects, and workes, by conueying or deliuering vnto the perſons, whom they meane to aſſault, meats, or drinkes, or other ſuch like; as is euident by the generall knowne power of the Magicke cups of the inchaunted Filtra or loue draughts: and as ſeemeth iuſtified by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his 18. booke <hi>de Ciuitake Dei,</hi> making mention of a woman who be witched others, by deliuering only a piece of cheeſe. Some of our late Countrie-men haue obſerued, ſome Witches to miſchiefe or ſurpriſe ſuch as they intend mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to deſtroy, by obtaining ſome part or parcell of their garments, or any excrements belonging vnto them, as their hayre, or the like.</p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted that the Diuell, that old <hi>Proteus,</hi> is able to change and metamorphiſe his rites, ceremonies, and ſuperſtitions, into what new ſhapes or formes are beſt ſutable to his pleaſure and his fellow-contractors moſt commodious vſes and purpoſes. Concerning all the former mentioned, although it be exceeding difficult; nay, an impoſsible thing for any man to auouch euery of them
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9304:66"/>
true in his owne knowledge or experience; yet for that ſome kindes of them wee may aſſuredly know and beleeue from God himſelfe, who hath in his ſacred word nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both <note n="*" place="margin">Iſaiah 8. 19.</note> apparitions of the Diuel, as alſo, incantations, charmes, <note n="*" place="margin">Sam. 1. 28.</note> ſpels and familiarity with Spirits; as alſo for that reaſon doth demonſtrate, that there may be many more kinds, beſides thoſe named of the ſame likeneſſe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Exod.

As we haue now briefly recited and called to minde ſome ſorts of ſuch ceremonies, rites, ſuperſtitions, manners, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and geſtures as are annexed vnto that kinde of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery or Witch-craft which conſiſteth in action: So let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo recite ſome other ſorts of ceremonies, rites, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, which belong vnto that kinde of Sorcery which is conuerſant in diuinations, reuelations of things hidden, predictions, and prophecies. Diuinations according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or art, as <hi>Cicero</hi> diſtinguiſheth in his firſt booke <hi>de Diuinatione,</hi> we doe not intend or purpoſe, but that diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which the ſame Author in the ſame place doth refer into a power aboue man, which he there termeth the power of the gods, betweene whom and diuination, the <hi>Stoickes</hi> make this reciprocation, <hi>Si ſit Diuinatio, Dij ſunt, ſi Dij ſint eſt Diuinatio;</hi> that is, if there be right diuination or predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of things to come not contained in Art or Nature, certainly that diuination is of the gods, as reciprocally
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9304:67"/>
where there are Gods, there is diuination. Here wee ſee plainely, not onely the antiquity, but the direct originall of diuinations, and that they do manifeſtly deriue themſelues from Idol-gods, from Infidels, from Idolaters.</p>
               <p>This is further euident likewiſe, by the generall current and report of all Hiſtories, euen from the firſt beginning and foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Romulus,</hi> as through all ancient writings and writers, the frequent mention of <hi>Augury, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſpicy, Extiſpicy,</hi> and the like, doth plentifully witneſſe. The holy Scripture alſo and Word of God doth teſtifie the ſame, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 10, 11. where diuination by the flying of fowles, by the obſeruation of times, and the like, are reckoned among the abominations of the Nations, or Gentiles.</p>
               <p>The originall then of Diuinations iſſuing from Diuels (becauſe from falſe gods, the gods of the heathen and Idolaters) let vs for the better noting of the abomination it ſelfe, obſerue and point out ſome of their ceremonies, manners, and ſuperſtitions alſo.</p>
               <p>Some in olde time vſed to diuine, as by the flying of fowles, ſo by viewing of lightning, by monſters, by lots, by inſpection of the Starres, by dreames, <hi>per monſtra, &amp; por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta, fulgura, ſortes, Inſomnia, per Aſtra,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> teſtifieth at large in his bookes <hi>de Diuinatione.</hi> Some did vſe to draw their Diuinations out of tubs, or veſſels of water, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to were caſt certaine thin plates of ſiluer and gold, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precious Iewels, by which the Diuels (which Infidels ignorantly called their gods) were allured to anſwere vnto demands, doubts, and queſtions, as is by <hi>Pſellus</hi> deſcribed, and was vſuall among the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> coniectors. Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued their Diuinations from looking-glaſſes, wherein the Diuell ſatisfied vnto demands and queſtions, by figures and ſhapes there appearing.</p>
               <p>This kinde of Diuination was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. If we ſhould number vp euery particular kinde of ſhape, wherein Diuination doeth ſhrowde it ſelfe, it would prooue a long and tedious voyage, not onely through fire, water, ayre, earth, and other farre diſtant and diuided parts of the wide and ſpacious world, but through ſiues, riddles, the guts and bowels of the dead, and many other ſecret haunts &amp; holes, wherein as the inuincible <hi>Labyrinths</hi> of intricate illuſions, the Diuell doeth ſhadow and hide his ſubtill inſidiation of ſilly deceiued man.</p>

               <p>Wee haue ſummarily (wherein for our information is ſufficient competence) produced ſome few ſorts of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, rites, and ſuperſtitious geſtures in both kindes, that is, both ſuch as belong to that kinde of Sorcery, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in act, and working, as alſo that which is exerciſed in Diuination, prediction, and reuelation.</p>
               <p>The generall rule and reaſon is the ſame, and extendeth it ſelfe equally againſt both.</p>

It may be obiected, that it doth commonly fall out, and is ſo oft ſcene, that the hearts of Witches are by the Diuell ſo poſſeſſed, ſo hardned and ſealed vp againſt all touch, either of any conſcience, or the leaſt ſparke of the affections of men left in them, that there is no poſſibility, or hope of any preualence, by the preſsing of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions or circumſtances, which they for the moſt part will anſwere with wilfull and peruerſe ſilence.</p>
               <p>This is and may be ſometimes true, yet is no ſufficient reaſon, why due proofe and tryall ſhould not alwayes dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently be made herein, ſince firſt experience it ſelfe doth witneſſe a manifeſt benefite thereby: ſecondly, the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable courſe and practice is knowne both vſuall, fruitfull and effectuall in all other diſquiſitions, and inquiſitions whatſoeuer: and thirdly, the Diuell himſelfe, the Witches

and Sorcerers great and graund Maſter, though of farre fewer words then Witches, (as ſeldome ſpeaking at all) and abounding with farre more ſubtiltie and cunning; yet is he not able by all his art of cunning, alwayes to hide his owne workes, but by preſumptions and circumſtances, wiſe and vnderſtanding hearts doe oft diſcerne and diſcouer them, as is by dayly experience ſeene and teſtified, and is confirmed by the proofe which all holy and godly men haue euer had thereof. And to this purpoſe, and for this cauſe the holy Scripture doth require Gods choſen children, to ſift and try the Spirits, whether they be of God or no; that is, whether they be of his holy ſpirit, or of the euill ſpirit which is the Diuell.</p>
               <p>Although therefore God for his owne ſecret decree, or purpoſe, doe permit the Diuell ſometimes to hide and ſhadow the guilt of his aſſociates, Witches and Sorcerers, from the ſight or deprehenſion of man, and thereby, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, fruſtrate mans iuſt endeuour and duty of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery; yet doth he not totally or altogether herein ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, or captiuate, or abridge mans power or poſsibility of preualence, euen againſt all the power and force of Diuels, as oft-times our dulleſt ſenſes cannot chooſe but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Could the Diuell, or their owne craft whatſoeuer, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Sorcerers from deſtruction out of the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> who iuſtly deſtroyed them all out of the land of Iſrael, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. or out of the hands of <hi>Ioſias,</hi> who according to lawe, tooke away or aboliſhed all that had familiar Spirits, and Southſayers. 2. <hi>Kings chap.</hi> 23. <hi>verſe</hi> 24? The extirpation of theſe Southſayers, by thoſe Princes, was commended of God, and by his Lawe commanded, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 20. 27. The ſame Lawe of God commaundeth, that no man be iudged or put to death, but by the mouth of two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, from whence it is neceſſarily collected, that the workes of Sorcery are not alwayes hidden, but oft-times ſo open, that they may be manifeſtly noted; otherwiſe, how could they be teſtified, which vnto their condemnation the Lawe doth euer preſuppoſe and neceſſarily commaund?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:9304:70"/>
Neither is this Lawe of God any thing diſcrepant from the common equity of all lawes, or from reaſon it ſelfe: firſt, for that many workes of Sorcery doe immediately in their firſt view, manifeſt themſelues to the ſenſe, as is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the miraculous workes of the Enchaunters of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, practiſed in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Secondly, for that many workes are apparent manifeſtly to Reaſon, in which, though the ſenſe cannot immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, or take notice of their quality and authour; yet by neceſſary inference and euidence of reaſon, they are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and demonſtratiuely prooued to iſſue from the power and force of Spirits and Diuels, as hath beene formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, concerning both workes and alſo diuinations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and reuelations hidden from all curioſity and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of man. Thirdly, for that circumſtances and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions doe with good and likely reaſon call into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and iuſtly charge with ſuſpicion (as hath beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced) concerning the performers and practiſers of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious rites, ſuperſtitious geſtures, actions and manners vſuall vnto Witches and Sorcerers. Since then, as is before prooued, Almighty God doth inioyne a neceſsity of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, vnto all condemnations and iudgements of death whatſoeuer, and teſtimony doth alwaies neceſſarily include a manifeſtation of whatſoeuer is teſtified, either to ſenſe, or reaſon, or both; it followeth as a neceſſary concluſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that hath bin ſaid: that from things either manifeſt to ſenſe, or euident to reaſon, iſſueth wholly and ſolely, not onely the reaſonable and likely way of detection of Witches, but the very true way by God himſelfe, in all true reaſon intended and commanded. And from this way it is, both by multitudes of examples, by experience and reaſon manifeſt, that neither Witches, nor the Diuell himſelfe is altogether able to hide or defend their guilt. Diligence therefore herein duely and carefully exerciſing it ſelfe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſhall not, not can prooue the Lawe of God vaine, nor the owne endeuour fruſtrate or voide, although haply difficulties and impediments may ſomtimes interrupt, as in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9304:71"/>
all other caſes and affaires is vſuall.</p>
               <p>Thus hath beene made manifeſt how Witch-craft is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable by ſenſe, and euident by reaſon; likewiſe, that it is no more inſcrutable or hidden from detection in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition thereof, by ſignes of preſumption, probable and likely coniecture or ſuſpicion, then all other intricate or hidden ſubiects, or obiects of the vnderſtanding whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. For, although preſumptions are alone no ſufficient proofe, yet doe they yeeld matter and occaſion of diligent and iudicious inquiſition, which is the reaſonable way and due method of vpright proceeding, and the common, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and warranted path vnto all detections, in all other caſes of doubt and difficulty whatſoeuer; wherein I ſee no cauſe or reaſon, why iudicious, wary and wiſe practiſe and proofe, weighing and preſsing circumſtances into the bone and marrow, ſhould not equally, in caſe of Witch-craft, as in all other caſes of iudgement and inquiſitions (though not euer becauſe that exceedes the nature of preſumption) equally, I ſay, and as oft ſhould not confound the guilty, and chaſe and winde out as faire an iſſue.</p>
               <p>Certainely, if men would more induſtriouſly exerciſe their ſharper wits, exquiſite ſenſe, and awaked iudgements, according vnto the former reaſonable, religious, and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes, exempt from the burthen and incumbrance of blinde ſuperſtitions, traditionary and imaginary inuentions and cuſtomes, no doubt, but experience would yeeld and bring forth in ſhort time, a much more rich increaſe of ſatisfaction, and more happy detection in iudiciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>It is true, that in the caſe of Witch-craft many things are very difficult, hidden and infolded in miſts and clouds, ouerſhadowing our reaſon and beſt vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, why ſhould men be more impatient or deiected, that in matters of Witch-craft, many things are oft hidden from our knowledge, and diſcouery, when the ſame darkeneſſe, obſcurity, difficulty and doubtfulneſſe, is a thing ordinary in many other ſubiects beſide, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:9304:71"/>
vnto vs, and concerning which, it may be no leſſe true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that in this life of mortality, much more is that which is vnknowne, then that which is knowne and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Hence is that ancient ſaying of the Philoſopher: <hi>Hoc tantum ſcio, quòd nihil ſcio,</hi> that is, ſo few are thoſe things, which are demonſtratiuely, truely, and certainely knowne, that they are nothing in compariſon of the infinite number and multitude of ſuch things, as are either onely probable, or obſcure or inſcrutable.</p>
               <p>For to deny that God hath giuen vnto man a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge in many things, were not onely groſſe darkneſſe and blindneſſe, but great ingratitude, yea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. Neuertheleſſe, it were alſo as great fatuity not to ſee or acknowledge, that God hath mixed this knowledge with much intricate difficulty and ambiguity, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he doth in his wiſedome more or leſſe reueale diſtribute and diſpenſe, in ſeuerall meaſures, vnto ſeuerall men, according to their ſeuerall cares, ſtudies, indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paines, and more induſtrious indeauour, in ſeeking and inquiring it: in defect whereof more commonly then either in Gods decreed reſtraint, or natures abnuence, mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and labours are ſo often annihilate.</p>

               <p>IT is vulgarly credited, that the caſting of ſuppoſed Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bound into the water, and the water refuſing or not ſuffering them to ſinke within her boſome or bowels, is an infallible detection that ſuch are Witches.</p>
               <p>If this experiment be true, then muſt it neceſſarily ſo be, either as a thing ordinary, or as a thing extraordinary: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing can happen or fall out, that is not limited within this circuit or compaſſe.</p>
               <p>That which is ordinary, is naturall; as likewiſe that which is natural, is ordinary. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the ſecond of his <hi>Ethickes</hi> ſaith of that which is naturall, <hi>quod aliter non aſſurſcit,</hi> that is, ordinarily it is not otherwiſe, then euer the ſame. From whence it doth follow by good conſequent, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is ordinary, muſt be naturall, becauſe it keepeth the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:9304:73"/>
ſame courſe and order, which is the property of nature.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his booke <hi>de ſubtilitate</hi> ſaith, <hi>Natura eſt ordinaria Dei poteſtas,</hi> that is, nature is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power of God, in the ordinary courſe and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all things.</p>
               <p>If then this experiment in the tryall of Witches, be as a thing ordinary (as it is vulgarly eſteemed) it muſt be found likewiſe naturall. If it cannot be found naturall, it cannot be ordinary. That it is not, nor cannot be naturall, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that the ordinary nature of things ſenſeleſſe and voide of reaſon, doth not diſtinguiſh one perſon from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, vertue from vice, a good man from an euill man. This our Sauiour himſelfe doth confirme, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe.</hi> 45. God maketh his ſunne to ariſe on the euill, and the good, and ſendeth raine on the iuſt and vniuſt.</p>
               <p>Nay, we may further obſerue in the booke of God, and alſo reade in the booke of nature and common experience, that the common benefit of nature, is not onely vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vnto all wicked men indifferently, but euen vnto Diuels themſelues, who doe not onely participate in nature the common eſſence, faculties and powers, proper vnto the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and nature of all other Spirits; but alſo doe exerciſe theſe powers and ſpirituall forces vſually vpon other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our natures, ſubiect vnto their ſupernaturall nature, reach and efficacy, as is often ſeene in their workes euen vpon the bodies and goods of the bleſſed Saints and ſonnes of God.</p>
               <p>Hereby then is euident, that nature cannot take notice, or diſtinguiſh a wicked man, no not a Diuell, and therefore much leſſe a Witch.</p>
               <p>But here may be obiected, that diuers herbs and other ſimples, produce many ſtrange and wondered effects, by an hidden ſecret, and occult qualitie and property in nature, though there appeare no manifeſt qualitie oft-times in them, by which in reaſon or probabilitie they ſhould or can bee effectuall thereto. This Phyſicions doe dayly witneſſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9304:73"/>
and prooue true.</p>
               <p>Why then may not there bee likewiſe yeelded the like hidden power, or antipatheticall vertue in the nature of the element of water, and thereby a Witch bee detected; as well without knowne cauſe or reaſon thereof in nature; notwithſtanding naturally the euils or diſeaſes both of body and minde, are both detected, and cured by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſubſtances or compoſitions, in which there is no manifeſt knowne proportion therewith?</p>
               <p>It is truly anſwered, that although in this ſuppoſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the diſpoſition of the element of water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Witches, caſualty may haply ſometimes ſeeme to iuſtifie it true; yet is not this ſufficient to euince it a thing naturall. Thoſe things which are naturall, neceſſarily and euer produce their effect, except ſome manifeſt or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary interception or impediment hinder.</p>
               <p>Thus fire doth neceſſarily, ordinarily, and alwaies burne and conſume any combuſtible matter or fuell being added thereto, except either ſome manifeſt or extraordinary hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance oppoſe it. The like may be ſaide of all other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their naturall effects in their proper obiects. Naturall medicines likewiſe, if rightly accommodated with prudence, art and diſcretion vnto the right diſeaſe, doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faile their vſuall productions or effects.</p>
               <p>This Almighty God in his holy writ doth confirme, and long and aged experience of many hundreths of yeares hath ſucceſſiuely witneſſed, wherein the ancient records of all learned writers, haue euer teſtified innumerable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal herbs and drugges, certainely and truely to bee euer the ſame. Preſent times doe likewiſe ſee &amp; witnes it, and no man doth or can doubt it in the right proofe. Concerning any ſuch nature or cuſtome in the element of water, in the refragation of Witches, who was as yet euer able to write and fully reſolue, or prooue it ordinary, neceſſary, certaine, euer or for the moſt part, not failing as is in courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moſt infallible and neuer doubted? What former ages haue ſucceſsiuely vouchſafed the mention of truth or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9304:74"/>
therein? Hath Almighty God, at all, ſo much as approued any opinion or thought thereof? Is it not rather to be iuſtly doubted, that it may be eſteemed among the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of the Gentiles, which God in his people doth deteſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 9? Doe all men in our time, or good and iuſt men auouch their owne proofe in the tryall thereof? Or contrariwiſe, doe not many wiſe, religious, learned and equall minds with reaſon reiect and contemne it? Doth Law as yet eſtabliſh it, or reaſon prooue it? How can it then be propoſed as equiualent with thoſe reaſonable meanes or wayes, of iuſt proceedings or tryalls, which God, his diuine Lawe, his law of nature, iudgement, reaſon, experience, and the lawes of men haue euer witneſſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually and onely aſſured certaine and infallible?</p>
               <p>It wanteth the vniuerſall teſtimony of former ages and Writers; in this our age it is held in iealouſie with the moſt iudicious, ſage, and wiſe: It hath no reaſonable proofe, no iuſtifiable tryall hath dared to auouch it vpon publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, no lawe hath as yet, thought it worthy of admittance; and the Lawe of God is not prooued to prooue or approue it. If it had beene a thing naturall, ordinary, of neceſſary, or of certaine operation or power, and therein ſo euidently remarkeable, it is impoſſible it ſhould haue eſcaped au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall approbation, or the ſame notable teſtimonies, which all other tryed truths haue euer obtained. From the former premiſes therefore we conclude, that it cannot be a thing naturall, neceſſary or ordinary. If it be not ordinary, then is it not alwaies the ſame; if not alwayes the ſame, then is it ſometimes failing; if ſometimes failing, then is it not infallible; if not infallible, then in no true iudgement or iuſtice to be truſted or credited. It now remaineth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether being prooued falſe or ordinary, it may not be prooued true as extraordinary (for to eſteeme or grant it both is an impoſsibility in nature, and an abſurdity in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.) Let vs grant, it may be iudged and deemed extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; the next doubt then remaining is, whether being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary or miraculous, it be of God or of the Diuell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:9304:74"/>
The reaſon why ſome men ſuppoſe it ſhould be of God, is, for that the water is an element which is vſed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and therefore by the miraculous and extraordinary power of God, doth reiect and refuſe thoſe who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their vowe and promiſe thereby, made vnto God, of which ſort are Witches.</p>
               <p>If this reaſon be ſound and good, why ſhould not Bread and Wine, being elements in that Sacrement of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, be likewiſe noted and obſerued to trurne backe, or fly away from the thraotes, mouthes, and teeth of Witches? and why, (if for the former reaſon, the water being an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Sacrament of couenant, made with God, in the firſt initiation into the faith, doe for that cauſe refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Witches into her boſome, and thereby giue an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proofe of a Witch?) Why, I ſay, ſhould not by the ſame reaſon Bread and Wine, being elements in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of confirmation and growth of faith, refuſe and fly from thoſe much more, whoſe faith and promiſe made vnto God in riper and more vnderſtanding yeares, is by them renounced? And why for that cauſe, ſhould not Bread and Wine become as infallible markes and teſtimonies vnto the detection of Witches? If the reaſon be good in the firſt, it muſt neceſſarily be the ſame in the ſecond; and if it faile in the ſecond, it cannot be good or ſound in the firſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it or can it ſtand with any good reaſon at all, that becauſe ſo ſmal part of the element of water, is ſet apart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that religious ſeruice in the Sacrament; therefore, the whole element of water, or all other waters muſt thereby obtaine any generall common property aboue the kinde or nature. Neither is it as yet agreed, or concluded gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally among the moſt learned, and reuerend Diuines, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſmall part of water which in particular is ſet apart, or vſed in the Sacrament, doth thereby receiue any manifeſt alteration at all in ſubſtance, eſſence, nature or quality. If then that part of the element of water it ſelfe, which is hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vnto that holy vſe, be not manifeſted, or apparently prooued to be thereby indowed with any vertue, much leſſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9304:75"/>
can it communicate any vertue vnto other waters, which did not participate there with in the ſame religious ſeruice. Except then there may be prooued by this religious vſe of water, ſome more endowment of ſenſe or religion therein, then is in other elements, why ſhould it more fly from a Witch then the fire, then the ayre, then the earth? The fire doth warme them, the ayre flyeth not from them, but giueth them breathing; the earth refuſeth not to beare them, to feede them, to bury them. Why then ſhould the water alone runne away or flye from them? It may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it is a miracle, whereof therefore there neither can nor ought reaſon in nature to be demaunded or giuen. If it be a miracle, it is either a true miracle, which onely and ſolely doth exceed the power of any <note n="*" place="margin">Non eſt creator, niſi qui princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paliter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat: nec quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam hoc poteſt, niſi vnus Creator Deus.

               <p>If this miracle, or this miraculous detection of Witches by water, be of this later kinde, it is of the Diuell; and is not to be eſteemed or named, where the Name of God is feared or called vpon.</p>
               <p>For although the cunning fraude of the Diuell, aboue and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9304:75"/>
beyond all capacitie of the weake ſenſe and vnderſtanding of man, doe ſo liuely oft-times caſt before our eyes, the outward ſhape and ſimilitude of the miracles of God, that man is not able eaſily to diſtinguiſh them, or at firſt ſight to put a true difference: yet muſt men ſtudiouſly, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly be aduiſed herein, leſt raſhly they confound, or equall the vile and abiect illuſions of that damned creature the Diuell (though neuer ſo wonderfull in our eyes) vnto the infinite power of the Almighty Creator, in his true and truely created miracles, which is an high diſhonour vnto our God, and accurſed impiety.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe, the holy Scripture hath admoniſhed and warned the weakeneſſe of humane vnderſtanding, not to be tranſported by ſignes and wonders, nor to truſt or giue credit to euery miracle: and our Sauiour himſelfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. <hi>verſe.</hi> 24 doth furniſh his Diſciples with carefull war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning herein. And S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his Reuelation fore-telleth, that in the latter dayes and times, the Diuell and the great Whore of Babylon, ſhall with great ſignes, wonders, and miracles, ſeduce and deceiue the laſt ages, and people of the world.</p>
               <p>Since then miracles are of no validity, except certainely and truely knowne to be of God; and ſince alſo it is not eaſie for euery Spirit to diſcerne therein; let vs duely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and ſift this our ſuppoſed and propoſed miracle in the tryall and detection of Witches. <hi>Petrus Gregorius Tholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus</hi> in his <hi>Syntagma Iuris, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. in a tractate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Relicks and Monuments of Saints, together with miracles, doth giue very honeſt, ſound, and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all direction.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that all credited miracles be found and allowed by religious lawes and authoritie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the perſons by whom they are firſt reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or knowne, or by whom they are auouched, be <hi>teſtes ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nei, <abbr>omniq</abbr> exceptione maiores,</hi> that is, that they be worthy witneſſes of vndoubted and vnſtained credit and worth, free from all iuſt exception, of holy life, and vnſtained conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9304:76"/>
Without theſe cautions (ſaith he) no miracles ought to be eſteemed, or receiued as of truth.</p>
               <p>How farre our vulgar tryall of Witches, by the ſuppoſed miraculous indication and detection of them by the water, is different from this care or reſpect, this equitie, religion, or humanitie, common practiſe doth openly declare, when without allowance of any law, or reſpect of common ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, euery priuate, raſh, and turbulent perſon, vpon his owne ſurmiſe of a Witch, dare barbarouſly vndertake by vnciuill force and lawleſſe violence, to caſt poore people bound into the water, and there deteine them, for their owne vaine and fooliſh luſts, without ſenſe, or care of the ſhamefull wrong, or iniury, which may befall oft-times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents thereby.</p>
               <p>Though this kinde of tryall of a Witch, might haply prooue in it ſelfe worthy to be allowed, yet is it not in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery priuate perſon iuſtifiable, or tolerable, or without warrant of authoritie in any ſort excuſable. The manner therefore of this vulgar tryall, muſt needs with iuſt and honeſt mindes, vncontrouerſedly, and vndoubtedly, be ruſticall, barbarous, and rude. Now to returne againe into the truth of the miracle it ſelfe in this tryall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let vs enquire with <hi>Petrus Gregorius,</hi> what religious lawes or authoritie haue admitted it as true.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what religious, reuerend, iudicious, graue, or holy Spectators, or eye-witneſſes doe auouch it. Let vs yet farther proceede with the ſame Author, in the fore-named <hi>Syntagma, lib.</hi> 34. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. and by ſome other rules, farther examine this miracle, if it be well and duely auouched and credited, concerning the being thereof, whether that being be not a being of the Diuell, &amp; of his miracles. <hi>Conatus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Daemonum</hi> (ſaith the Author) <hi>vnum habet generalem ſcc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum, operibus Dei ſe obijcere, ei debitum honorem ſubfurari, pios hominum animos ſibi lucri facere, &amp; a vero Deo retrahere.</hi> That is, the workes of the Diuell haue one generall ſcope; namely, to oppoſe themſelues againſt the workes of God, to rob God of his honour, to drawe the hearts of men
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9304:76"/>
from God, and to gaine them vnto himſelfe. Let vs now conſider the fore-named miracle by theſe rules.</p>
               <p>Concerning the approbation thereof by any religious lawes or authority, I haue neuer read my ſelfe, nor haue heard by others, of any authentike ſuffrage from claſſicall Author, and with good reaſon, I may conceiue and iudge a nullity therein.</p>
               <p>Concerning any religious, learned, and iudicious Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and auouchers of this miracle, whoſe faith and credit may be wholly free from al iuſt exception, it hath euer been a difficult and hard taske to furniſh any true ſufficiencie or competency in this kinde, though multitudes and ſwarmes of deceiued Vulgars, continually and violently obtrude their phantaſticall ſominations. Since then as yet there doth no manifeſt law ſtand vp to patronage this miracle, and the learned, religious, and holy man able to diſcerne and iudge, and free from exception, is not at all, or hardly to be produced or found to auouch or countenance it true; it may be with good reaſon ſuſpected, and that reaſon may iuſtly diſſwade all ſodaine, raſh, or haſty credit or truſt thereof. Now let vs examine, if it were vndoubtedly to be aſſumed as true, whether being true, it be not as truely of the Diuell. And firſt let vs conſider, whether it doe not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the workes of God, which was the firſt direction of <hi>Gregorius.</hi> It is herein truely conuicted, becauſe the nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſuppoſed miraculous force and might thereof, doth firſt vſually and eaſily intiſe vnſetled braines, raſhly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the wayes of iudgement and iudicious legall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which is the ordinance and worke of God: ſecondly, doth imbolden ſtaggering and vnreſolued minds preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly without warrant to expect, to aske or ſeeke a ſigne or miracle, which ordinarily or vnneceſſarily required, our bleſſed Sauiour apertly condemneth, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. An adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vnbeleeuing generation doth ſeeke a ſigne or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. And as herein it directly oppoſeth againſt the decree and worke of God, ſo likewiſe by giuing occaſion and way, that ſuppoſed miracles may become vulgarly common and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9304:77"/>
ordinary, whereby the true miracles and miraculous workes of God alſo may grow with vndiſcerning men of leſſe eſteeme, vile and of no accompt. <hi>Nam miracula Dei aſſiduitate viluerunt</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> the miracles and miraculous workes of God, being oft ſeene, become of ſmal or no reputation. The ſecond tryall of a falſe miracle, was the robbing of God of his due honour and praiſe, which in this propoſed miracle is partly prooued; by making the extraordinary work or vſe of miracles ordinary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by derogating from the power, worth and nature of Gods true miracles (as is before ſaid): partly by vnthankfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-valewing, omitting, or relinquiſhing the ordinary meanes of tryals and detections of doubtfull truths, which God hath made &amp; giuen in his good grace; and therefore their contempt and neglect is a manifeſt robbing of God of his due praiſe and glory therein. The third tryall of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels property in miracles, was the ſeducing of mens hearts from God vnto himſelfe, which in our ſuppoſed miracle may be neceſſarily concluded. For if the miracle it ſelfe be vpon good grounds before alleaged, rightfully deemed to bee of the Diuell; it muſt neceſſarily follow, that what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer eſteeme or reputation is giuen thereto, is a ſecret ſacrifice of ignorance or ſuperſtition vnto the Diuell, and an hidden and couert ſeduction from God. And thus hath beene prooued, or at leaſt, with good reaſon alleaged. Firſt that the tryall of Witches by water, is not naturall or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any reaſon in nature. Secondly, if it be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and a miracle, that it is in greater likelihood and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability a miracle of the Diuell to inſnare, then any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt miracle of God to glorifie his name, which is the true end of right miracles. Concerning the other imagined tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Witches, as by beating, ſcratching, drawing bloud from ſuppoſed or ſuſpected Witches, whereby it is ſaid that the fits or diſeaſes of the bewitched do ceaſe miraculouſly; as alſo concerning the burning of bewitched cattell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is ſaid, that the Witch is miraculouſly compelled to preſent her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:9304:77"/>
Theſe, and the like, I thinke it vaine and needleſſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly or ſingly to confute, becauſe it doth directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, by their examination, according to the former rules produced againſt the naturalizing of the detection of Witches by caſting them into the water, that firſt they are excluded out of the number of things naturall: ſecondly, that being reputed as miracles, they will alſo be rather iuſtly iudged miracles of the Diuell, then of God, by the former reaſons which haue ſtripped the ſuppoſed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous detection of Witches by the water, of any hopefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that they can be of God.</p>
               <p>Nor doth our law now in force, differ here from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting ſuch like miraculous trialls. See the triall by <hi>Ordell</hi> aboliſhed by Parliament the third yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. <hi>Coke</hi> 9. <hi>Rep. Caſe Abbot de Strata Mercella Fol.</hi> 33.</p>

               <p>THere remaine as yet other miraculous explorations of a Witch, carrying in their firſt view a far more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred repreſentation then any or all the former explorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

This is reputed a certaine
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9304:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conuiction of a witch. An other miraculous tryal of a Witch and like vnto this, wonderfull is; when a ſuppoſed Witch required by the bewitched, doth touch him or her (though when vnknowne or vnperceiued by the bewitched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,) yet according to the prediction of that iſſue by the bewitched, he or ſhee immediately are deliuered from the preſent fit or agony, that then was vpon him or her, which I haue alſo my ſelfe ſeene. For the better diſcouery of truth in theſe ſo wondered difficulties, let vs firſt recall to minde theſe few obſeruations in our former Treatiſe determined and prooued. Firſt, that the Diuell doth many miraculous and ſupernaturall things meerely ſimply and alone of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for his owne ends, and without the inſtigation or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of a Witch. This was made manifeſt by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, diſputation and ſpeech with <hi>Eua</hi> after a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner, out of the body of the Serpent, when as yet neither Witch, nor Witch-craft were come into the world. Secondly, that the Diuell is able to obtrude or impoſe his ſupernaturall or miraculous workes vpon men, againſt their knowledge, liking, will, or affection, and being vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. This is cleere by his tranſuection of the body of our bleſſed Sauiour, as alſo by his violent caſting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the poſſeſſed, amongſt the people mentioned in the Goſpell. Thirdly, let vs not here forget ſpecially, that hee is able to tranſmit and ſend vnto, or into men vnrequired, and without their deſire or aſſent, ſecret powers, force, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, illuminations, and ſupernaturall reuelations. This was prooued by the poſſeſſed in the Goſpell, who from a ſecret and hidden reuelation and power, aboue and beyond themſelues, were able to vtter that high miſtery, as yet hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the world, that Ieſus was the Sonne of the liuing God. This could not be knowne vnto them, by their owne reaſon or nature, being aboue and beyond all reaſon or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by grace onely then begun to be reuealed vnto the bleſſed Diſciples themſelues. To thinke that the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed could haue that knowledge equally with the Diſciples by the ſame grace, were impious derogation from their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9304:78"/>
Apoſtolicall priuiledge and prerogatiue therein, vnto whom did properly belong the firſt fruits thereof alone.</p>
               <p>This ſupernaturall reuelation therefore was transfuſed into the poſſeſſed by the Diuell, who could not be ignorant of the Lyon of <hi>Juda,</hi> the mighty deſtroyer of his ſpirituall kingdome, long before the diſciples were borne, or capable of knowledge. And thus hauing recalled theſe obſeruations, from them doe iſſue theſe neceſſary inferences. Firſt, that all ſupernaturall acts or works in men, are not to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto thoſe men. Secondly, that for this cauſe thoſe ſupernaturall workes, are onely to be imputed vnto men which the Diuell, according vnto contract or Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which thoſe men doth practiſe and produce.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe, in the inquiſition of Witch-craft, when we haue truely firſt detected an act, done by a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and ſupernaturall force (becauſe it is in all lawes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious, to accuſe of any act, before it be certainely knowne the act hath beene committed) then, and not before, wee ought indeuour directly and neceſſarily to prooue the contract, conſent, and affection of the perſon ſuſpected, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or in that ſupernaturall act, that being no leſſe eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to detect and diſcouer the true and vndoubted Witch; then the ſupernaturall act, being certainely apparent, doth vndoubtedly prooue the Diuell, and his power therein.</p>
               <p>This equall regard, in caſe of Witch-craft, ought to bee carefully ballanced, without which vaine and vnſtable men ſhall euer at their luſt and pleaſure, vpon affections and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, be priuiledged with impunity, to lay vniuſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to vſe wrongfull violence and oppreſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all equitie, or reaſon.</p>
               <p>When therefore men that are prudent, iudicious, and able to diſcerne, doe firſt aduiſedly vpon good ground and reaſon, adiudge a ſupernaturall act euidently done, or at leaſt worthy to be ſuſpected: ſecondly, ſhall by iuſt and reaſonable proofe, or at leaſt liuely and faire preſumption detect the contract, affection, or conſent of any man in that act; then and not before, is the accuſation, inquiſition

               <p>Theſe obſeruations, and conſiderations, firſt neceſſarily prefixed, let vs now proceed vnto the two former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded experiments of the miraculous detection of Witches.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarily true, that it can ſolely proceed from a ſupernaturall power, that the bewitched are inabled in their traunces, to fore-tell the ſequell of the ſuppoſed Witches touch: likewiſe, that the nominated Witch, ſhall accordingly by her touch immediately free and diſpoſſeſſe the Sicke or the bewitched of their agonies.</p>
               <p>It is as neceſſarily true alſo, that it can ſolely proceed from a ſupernaturall power, that the bewitched are able in their traunces to nominate the moſt ſecret and hidden marks in the bodies of the ſuſpected Witch, her preſent ſpeech <note n="*" place="margin">Herein the Diuell affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the power of God in his holy Prophet, who was able by his diuine reuclation to make known what the King ſpake in his Priuy Chamber. 2.

               <p>If they proceede from God, their end, their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary neceſſitie and vſe, bent ſolely vnto the immediate ſpeciall glory, or extraordinary glorification of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will euidently declare.</p>
               <p>What more extraordinary glorification of God can be pretended in the needfulneſſe of a miraculous detection of Witch-craft, then of any other ſinne committed, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9304:79"/>
againſt God, and with as high an hand? Witch-craft is indeed one kinde of horrid renunciation, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of God, but there are many more kinds much more helliſh then this ſecret and concealed defection: as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen curſings, wilfull blaſphemings, and ſpitefull railings vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, euen vnto his face, profeſſed hatred and contempt of God.</p>
               <p>Among many Offendors in theſe kindes, after their owne long prouoking continuance therein, and Almighty God his vnſpeakeable long ſuffering and patience: ſome few ſometimes haue been made hideous ſpectacles and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples vnto the reſt, of the infinite power and iuſtice of God, his vnſufferable diſpleaſure, indignation and direfull reuenging wrath. In this number was, for ſome time <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadneſer,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in later times <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> and others the like. Many other as high Blaſphemers, and deſpiſers of God, notwithſtanding haue been permitted to eſcape any ſuch miraculous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or fearefull notorious expoſings vnto the worlds view.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> railing on the liuing God, in the open view and hearing of the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Olofernes</hi> denying the God of heauen, were not miraculouſly, or by any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hand of God ſmitten, but were ſuffered to grow on, vntill their harueſt of confuſion was ripe. That high degree of blaſphemie againſt the Sonne of the liuing God, hanging vpon the Croſſe for the ſinnes of mankinde, committed by the cruell and hard-hearted Iewes, in ſcorning, ſcoffing, and ſpitefull deriſion both of God in heauen, <hi>Math.</hi> 27, <hi>verſe</hi> 43. and alſo of the eternall Sauiour of the world, deſcended from heauen, was not by God then extraordinarily reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (as the incomparable greatneſſe of the ſinne might ſeeme to require) but was in Almighty God his iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuffered, vntill in the due time, their owne execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and curſings of themſelues, and their poſterity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to haſten and purchaſe the effuſion of that holy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, did fall vpon them ſo heauily, that their whole
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9304:80"/>
Nation, People, and Kingdome, became extirpate, vile, and vagabond for euer vpon the face of the earth. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the <hi>Reuelation, chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6, 7. concerning the Beaſt, that he opened his mouth vnto blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, his Tabernacle, and the Saints; that he ſpake great mighty blaſphemies, yet power was giuen vnto him to continue, and preuaile therein many yeares, and a large ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>By theſe few examples it is euident, that neither the height, the nature, the quantitie, nor the qualitie, of the moſt abominable, or prouoking ſinne, moſt odious vnto God and men, doth vſually, or alwaies draw downe from heauen vpon it ſelfe a miraculous immediate hand of Gods wrath. We may eaſily inſtance the like, concerning the ſin of witch-craft, which is our particular ſubiect.</p>
               <p>Although by the hand of his holy ſeruant Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mghty God did miraculouſly ſmite the Sorcerer <hi>Elymas,</hi> &amp; as writers report, <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> by the hand of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> multitudes and ſocieties of other Sorcerers, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers among the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> eſcaped not onely the hands of <hi>Nebuchadneſer,</hi> in his wrath; but as it ſeemeth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> they liued many yeares in high eſteeme, fame, and renowne, both in their owne Nation, and alſo in forreine Countreyes, yea through the world. There is no doubt, that <hi>Aegypt</hi> likewiſe did abound with ſwarmes of Sorcerers, as the holy Scripture, and all times and writers report. Among the people of God alſo, the Iſraelites, it is manifeſt that diuers Sorcerers and Witches did ſhrowed themſelues, and liued with impunity, as appeareth by the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> which king <hi>Saules</hi> ſeuerity, in their gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all extirpation thorow the whole kingdome, had notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding paſſed by, and left vneſpied; as alſo by that ſpecial note and commendations, from Gods owne mouth and word of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that is, that hee had taken away from amid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt his people, all the Enchanters and Sorcerers: by which it is likely and cannot be denied, that through the lenitie or careleſneſſe of former Princes, they formerly had long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:9304:80"/>
their breathed. That God doth not vſe by miracles to detect all, or moſt Enchanters, Magicians, or Witches, is farther made vndoubted; becauſe it ſhould follow then &amp; thence neceſſarily, that he hath both in the firſt ages of the world, ordained lawes, and ordinary, legall courſes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt them in vaine; as alſo for that he doth, in the holy records of his ſacred word, make knowne his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that they ſhall be permitted to liue and continue vpon the face of the earth among other, and as other vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinners, vntill his ſecond comming, and the laſt day of eternall doome, <hi>Reuelat. chap.</hi> 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. without ſhall be Enchanters. If his Iuſtice and ſeuere iudgement ſhould by his miraculous power make ſo narrow ſearch amongſt them, as ordinarily to root them out, it were impoſſible any one of them ſhould eſcape his all-ſeeing reuengefull hand, to ſuruiue vnto his generall decreed day of ſentence, and dreadfull doome, of all kinde of ſinnes and ſinners, which both in iuſtice vnto ſome, and mercy vnto other ſome, his infinite goodneſſe and wiſdome hath decreed, ſhall not be fruſtrate. Although therfore Almighty God doth ſometimes ſtretch forth his mighty hand miraculouſly to ſmite, or bring into light ſome horrid ſinnes and ſinners, his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power therein ſometimes onely extended, at his owne good will and pleaſure, doth not iuſtifie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous expectation of the diſpenſation thereof in any particular. God who is the God of order, and not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, doth not ordinarily diſpenſe his extraordinary workes, nor vſually confound indifferently, ſo different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their end and vſe, and his owne decree. Nature it ſelfe doth alſo teach an impoſſibility in that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, to become or be expected ordinary. In that way which is ordinary, the induſtruous, the diligent, the prouident man therefore doth with carefull perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vprightly walke. The ſlothfull, onely the intemperate, the improuident man, either by folly or ignorance loſeth or by idle ſloth forgetteh, or omitteth, his ordinary way or opportunity, and ridiculouſly hopeth or truſteth vnto
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9304:81"/>
the redemption thereof, by extraordinary contingents or euents.</p>
               <p>Thus it hath appeared, that in regard of any more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or extraordinary glorification of God, in the detection of Witches, rather then of other as great and as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinners, their is no needfull or neceſſary vſe of myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>The ſecond conſideration was, whether they are not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Diuell, then of God; as alſo, how they may be any iuſt conuictions of the ſuppoſed or ſuſpected guilty.</p>
               <p>Wee will firſt herein examine the touch of the ſuppoſed Witch, immediatly commanding the ceſſation of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed fits of the bewitched. That this is a falſe or Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call miracle and not of God, may be iuſtly doubted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the holy and bleſſed power of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles (among which, the healing the Sicke or the poſſeſſed was not the leaſt) was neuer of God diſpenſed, to haunt or follow the touch of wicked men, or Sorcerers or Witches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that the true miracles of God (which were euer diſpenſed, either for the common good of his Church, or the declaration of his glorious truth, or for the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary puniſhment and deſtruction of euill men) did neuer obſcurely, or indirectly, prooue themſelues or their ends, but in their manifeſtation were inabled to ouer-ſhine cleerely, all the fogges and miſts of doubt or queſtion.</p>
               <p>The contrary hereunto in this our ſuſpected miracle is manifeſt, wherein is ridiculouſly imagined, that the bleſſed gift and vertue of healing the ſicke, deſcended from God aboue, may be reputed in the hands of a Witch a ſigne or teſtimony of his or her guilt and impiety, which euer hath beene, and is in it ſelfe a ſpeciall grace and fauour of God, and was euer vſed rather as a confirmation of the truth of Gods Miniſters and ſeruants. Let vs now conſider how this miraculous touch and the efficacy thereof, may be any iuſt conuiction of a Witch. No man can doubt that the vertue wherewith this touch was indued, was ſupernaturall. If it bee ſupernaturall, how can man, vnto whom nothing ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9304:81"/>
is poſsible, that is not naturall, bee iuſtly reputed any proper Agent therein? If hee cannot bee eſteemed in himſelfe any poſsible or true Agent, then it remaineth, that hee can onely bee intereſſed therein, as an acceſſary in conſent; as a Solicitor or Tenant vnto a ſuperiour power. If that ſuperiour power (as is before prooued in the falſehood of his miracle) be the Diuell, the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable doubt remaining whether the Diuell alone, or with the conſent or contract of the ſuſpected perſon hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that wonderfull effect: with what Religion or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can any man rather incline to credit the Diuels infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the mouth of the bewitched (who is the common accuſer of God to men, and of men to God) then in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite pittie, pietie, and humane reſpect vnto his owne kinde to tender the weakeneſſe of fraile man, againſt the ſubtilty of the deceitfull Diuel. Shall man with man find leſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, then the Diuell with man againſt man? That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is able by the permiſſion of God, to annex or hang this miracle vpon this or that particular, is manifeſt, by the poſſeſſed in the Goſpell; vpon whom and their naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and motions, he caſt ſupernaturall conſequences or concomitances. Was not their ſpeech attended with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall reuelation, their hands with ſupernaturall force, to rend and teare in pieces iron chaines and bonds? If the Diuell be able to transfuſe, or caſt theſe miraculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitances or conſequences alone, and without allowance of any man or perſon where God doth permit; how is it in any equity or reaſon iuſt, that theſe impoſitions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſhould be imputed vnto any man? God forbid, that the Diuels ſignes and wonders, nay his truths ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any legall allegations or euidences in lawe. We may therefore conclude it vniuſt, that the forenamed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effects by the Diuell wrought and imputed by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, ſhould be eſteemed a ſigne or infallible marke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any man, as therefore conuinced a Witch, for that the Diuel and the bewitched haue ſo deciphered him. Theſe like miraculous ſtratagems may be exerciſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:9304:82"/>
or vnto any mans actions may be deceitfully or fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by the Diuell conioined or apted. This therefore doth not inferre any mans guilt therein. It ought be a mans owne proper contract therein with the Diuell, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and directly proued, that ſhall iuſtly condemne him, This contract may be and is plainly detected, by ſifting and conſidering, that mans voluntarily aſſiſting or promoting, promiſing, or vndertaking ſuch ſupernaturall workes, with anſwerable performance thereof. As hath beene ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the miraculous conſequence of the touch of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected Witch; ſo may be determined concerning the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall reuelations of ſecret markes or ſignes in her body, according vnto the prediction of the bewitched, as alſo of the diſcouery of the preſent actions, geſtures, and ſpeeches of ſuppoſed Witches in farre diſtant places. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers examples I my ſelfe haue ſeene in theſe kinds: I muſt neceſſarily acknowledge a more then natural power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becauſe farre beyond the nature, reaſon, or power of man. But there is notwithſtanding ſufficient matter of doubt, whether ſuch reuelations, ſecret ſignes, and marks, though found in the named perſons or parts true, as alſo the right pourtraitures &amp; ſhapes of the ſuppoſed or accuſed Witches, though neuer of the bewitched before ſeene, and yet by the bewitched truely deſcribed; there is, I ſay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſufficient matter of doubt, whether they are not very inſufficient to charge or accuſe any particular thus pointed out or marked. The Law and expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God doth allow of no reuelation from any other Spirit, but from himſelfe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 19. Whether theſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are immediately of God, if their due examination by the rule of his Word <note n="*" place="margin">ESTIN AMARTIA ANOMIA. Quicquid non congruit cum lege, peccatum eſt.</note> doe not clearely determine, raſh or haſty perturbation or paſſion ought not preſume it. The lawes of men alſo admit no ſupernaturall illuminations or reuelations, as any grounds of iuſt tryals or deciſions of right or truth. It follows therefore neceſſarily, that they are voide, &amp; ought to be of no force or credit in vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with iuſt and righteous men. It may bee obiected,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:9304:82"/>
that truth is found in theſe reuelations, and truth ought be of regard. It may hereto againe bee replied, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though truth in it ſelfe be great, and ought and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile; yet in the abuſe, euill vſe, or corrupted, or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued end thereof, it ought not deceiue nor is of force. The Diuell, as all other cunning lyers and deceiuers and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of that his art, vſually mixe truths with lyes, that thoſe truths giuing credit vnto lyes, men may beleeue both and ſo be deceiued. It was euer the onely ſafe way of lying, to face and guard it with ſome plauſible truths. In the former reuelations therefore, repreſentations and true deſcriptions in the bewitched, of perſons of ſecret markes and ſignes, of ſpeeches, geſtures, and the like, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Diuell be found true, or ſpeaking truth, yet may he notwithſtanding haply bee therein alſo a lyer, while truly deſcribing their perſons, ſhapes, markes, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and geſtures, ſpeeches and the like, he falſely and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly addeth thereby a ſeeming or deceiuing neceſsity of their guilt, as if therein or thereby neceſarily inferred. The fallicy illuſion and the lyingly true reuelations of the Diuell, may by many examples be manifeſted. <hi>Ianus laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Boiſſardus in his tract. de Diuinatione Chap.</hi> 5. repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an admirable ſtory of a noble Gentleman his familiar friend, and knowne vnto himſelfe. This man flying from his owne natiue Countrey for feare of puniſhment for a murther by him committed, and liuing in farre diſtant coaſts, deſired curiouſly to enquire what his wife was in his abſence doing, whom hee had (being very faire young and beautifull) married two monethes onely before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or voluntary exile. For this purpoſe he came vnto a Magitian liuing in the place of exile, who liuely deſcribed vnto him the true faſhion, building, and ornaments of his houſe where his wife in his abſence liued, her apparrell, countenance, &amp; the like, as they were perfectly foreknowne vnto himſelfe. He farther expecting to learne what ſhe was at that preſent inſtant doing. The Magitian made knowne that there was then in her company a beautifull young
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:9304:83"/>
man with his hoſe or breeches about his heeles ſtanding neere or cloſe vnto her. Vppon the knowne truth of the <hi>Magician</hi> his firſt deſcription of his houſe and wife, the gentleman aſſuring himſelfe of the truth of the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſeeming manifeſt adultrey in her, ſecretly ſtealeth home with an abſolute reſolution by murdering of her to be renenged, &amp; comming home by ſtealth neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place where his houſe &amp; her dwelling was, by a ring (which as an infallible teſtimonie of her true loue ſhe had deliuered vnto him at his departure) he immediately cauſed her to come vnto him. Her kinde and louing intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo qualified and mollified his intended rage and fury, that he had patience firſt to confer with her, which before his ſight of her, he did not intende. After her conference he demaunded whether ſuch a day (naming the certaine day) ſhe did not weare apparrel of ſuch a colour and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. She anſwered with wonder that it was true. He againe demaunded what that was which ſhe ſmothed and handled in her hand, and who that young man was which ſtood neere her with his hoſe about his heeles. She hereat amazed and perceauing the ſodaine change of a fierce and cruell looke in her husband, deſired him to be pacified and better informed. The young man was his owne brother who could witneſſe the truth thereof, and that which ſhe ſmoothed or ſtroked in her hand was a plaiſter which ſhe did ſmooth for him and applyed vnto his hip, where he had a very greiuous and painefull vlcer. This being found true, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſorrowed for his bloudy intention, and deteſted the execrable and damnable Art of the <hi>Magician,</hi> and the foule lying truth of the Diuell. How foulely likewiſe many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men by theſe like darke and double dealing truthes, equiuocations, and amphobologies, haue beene deceaued conſulting with the diuell and his oracles may be by many other examples teſtified. The ſame Author mentioneth the oraculous reuelation by dreame preſented vnto the daughter of <hi>Polycrates</hi> of <hi>Samos.</hi> It was reuealed vnto her that her father ſhould be taken vp into heauen, be waſhed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9304:83"/>
by <hi>Iupiter</hi> and annointed by the Sun. This after proued true but in a dreaming ſenſe. For <hi>Polycrates</hi> being ſurpriſed by <hi>Orantes,</hi> was hanged vp toward heauen vpon an high Croſſe, where <hi>Jupiter</hi> (that is the ayre) with his moiſture did waſh him, and the Sun melting his greaſe and the ſubſtance of his fleſh did ſo annoint him as was leaſt imagined or ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>Plutarke</hi> in the life of <hi>Anniball</hi> reporteth that <hi>Anniball</hi> conſulted with the oracle concerning his owne reſerued deſtiny or end. The oracle anſwered that <hi>Libiſſa</hi> land ſhould burie his corpes. Hereupon he preſumed that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into that his owne countrey and therein his old age die. He grewe therefore ſecure and careles. But ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward being taken by the <hi>Romanes</hi> in a little obſcure village by the ſea coaſt called by the name of <hi>Libiſſa,</hi> he there grewe wearie of his life and poyſoned himſelfe. In the Diuels truth <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> behold vntruth and deceipt. <hi>Libiſſa</hi> buried <hi>Anniball,</hi> but not <hi>Libiſſa</hi> by <hi>Anniball</hi> either knowne or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be imagined. Theſe examples are ſufficient whereby is plainely ſeen the dangerous deceitfull fallacy of the diuel euen where he ſpeaketh truth. Let vs now returne againe vnto our former miraculous prediction of the Diuell by the mouth of the bewitched concerning the cure of the bewitched by the touch of the ſuppoſed Witch. We may boldly affirme that in this caſe or in any other, if it were poſſible for the diuell to ſpeake the truth, truely, wholly, vnpartially; ſo as it might appeare plaine, euident, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; yet ought we not from him beleeue it or receiue it. This is in our bleſſed Sauiour made vndoubted, who in the Goſpell oft rebuked him euen ſpeaking truth, as alſo in S. <hi>Paul</hi> rebuking the Pythoniſſe, truely affirming, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him the ſeruant and Miniſter of God. If the diuell then ſpeaking truth, may not be allowed or credited; how ſhall reuelations, miracles or oracles proceeding from him, be they neuer ſo true, or approued with any ſhew of true Religion or reaſon, become any iuſt probations or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations in law, equity or iuſtice? it may be obiected, that many times men haue bin by dreames and viſions admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9304:84"/>
of ſecret and concealed hideous murders, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euill facts committed priuily, whereby the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors and their guilt haue bin admirably produced vnto due puniſhment. This truth is euen by Heathen Authors witneſſed, and in our time the like haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and is teſtified by witneſſes, whoſe faith and credit is free from all exception. Although this be true and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, ſome reaſons notwithſtanding doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that it is more ſafe to incline, to ſuſpect that theſe like viſions or dreames are rather of the Diuell, then raſhly to determine or decree that they are immediately of God. Firſt, for that though haply they might be ſometimes ſo granted, yet ought we not too ſwiftly or ſodainly ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, for that by the liuely counterfait of the true viſions, dreames and reuelations of God, the Diuell hath euer vſually practiſed to be taken and eſteemed as God: the allowance whereof by men is high blaſphemy againſt God, and ignorant occult adoration of Diuels. Secondly, for that no viſions, dreames, or reuelations, ought to be eſteemed of God, originally or immediately, which doe reſpect or anſwere curioſitie of knowledge or deſire, as moſt of the forementioned kinds vſually are wont. Thirdly, for that the viſions of God, as they are euer bent vnto an extraordinary, diuine end, and an vniuerſall good, ſo are they euer diſpenſed by the miniſtery of men, who haue manifeſt commiſſion, or warrant from God, either mediate, or immediate. The mediate is prooued by the manifeſtation of the meanes: the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, by the euident reflexion of a manifeſt diuinity, in the power and authority thereof. For as it is ſaid of the word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>verſe</hi> 12. ſo muſt it neceſſarily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of all the true miracles, viſions, or reuelations of God, that they are liuely, and mighty in operation.</p>
               <p>This is ſeene in the miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the Sorcerers themſelues could not deny to bee the finger of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. This is likewiſe ſeene in

                  <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who could not but acknowledge the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power of the holy Ghoſt, by the laying on of the Apoſtles hands, ſo far forth that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his owne guilt, and of a conuincing power or deitie therein, he deſired them to pray for him.</p>
               <p>The ſame is alſo witneſſed in the ſeruants of the high Prieſts who being ſent with wicked malice, and curſed preiudice to intrap and betray our Sauiour, were by the miraculous power of his word and workes compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to proclaime and confeſſe; <hi>No man euer ſpake like this man.</hi> All theſe notes or markes, of the true viſions, dreames, or reuelations of God, are euer generally, or for the moſt part wanting in the forementioned kinds, which being neuer free from ſome ſuſpitious note of godly iealouſie, therefore ought not but with much doubt and difficulty be at any time admitted. It may bee as yet further obiected. How can it otherwiſe bee deemed, then that God himſelfe is the Author of the former reuelations, ſince they tend vnto his glory in the detecting and puniſhing of ſo hideous ſinnes? It is hereto anſwered, that Almighty God is able to vſe and command euill inſtruments vnto good ends. He hath ordained the Diuell himſelfe to be the common accuſer of all ſinnes and ſinners. It is therefore no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience nor repugnant vnto religion or reaſon, to affirme, that the Diuell himſelfe, in the fore-mentioned viſions or dreames, by the commandement or permiſſion of God, is the producer of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned murders, euill facts, vnto light and iudgement: God for his owne glory permitteth the Diuell by theſe his wonderfull reuelations, to detect the named ſinnes and ſinners. The Diuell alſo for his owne end, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of their deſtruction, doth execute the Decree of God for their iuſt puniſhment.</p>
               <p>But here may be obiected againe, that the Diuell
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9304:85"/>
in his reuelations (as is before mentioned) is not to be beleeued or credited, although he ſpake truth. How then may men be allowed, to admit or make vſe of theſe his viſions or dreames in this kinde.</p>
               <p>It is hereto replyed, Almighty God himſelfe doth both permit and heare the Diuell when hee accuſeth, as is manifeſt by holy Scriptures. Therefore among men, and by men alſo, his accuſations may be heard and conſidered. Notwithſtanding, ſince hee is oft a falſe Accuſer, and the enemy of God and truth, hee may not bee credited in himſelfe, no nor truth it ſelfe ſimply as in his mouth. Vpon his accuſation therefore, if truth and certainety doe declare it ſelfe, the force and vertue thereof, and not the accuſation doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, vpright men and minds, vnto proceeding and iudgement; it is not the Diuels accuſation, but the truth it ſelfe, vnto which haply that accuſation did point inquiſition, that by it ſelfe made manifeſt, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore credited.</p>
               <p>And thus with breuity hath the vanity both of all ſuperſtitious, and alſo of all miraculous waies of the detection of Witches and Witch-craft, beene in ſome few of their particulars generally vnmasked. There are, and may bee many more beſides theſe, which in theſe, and with theſe, will likewiſe periſh and vaniſh, being by the ſame rule and reaſon compelled vnto the golden tryall of ſincere religion and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The ſole, true and warranted way, wherein vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly men may walke herein before God and men, hath beene in this Treatiſe formerly diſquired and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed. Therein (intelligent Reader) thou maiſt obſerue two ſorts of manifeſt Witches: The one is offered vnto the outward ſenſe, in his apparent and palpable Sorcerous workes: The other is made eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by plaine demonſtration out of the ſacred word
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9304:85"/>
of truth. It hath euer preuailed with vulgar cuſtome (becauſe moſt ſenſible of the moſt groſſe harmes more open to ſenſe) to caſt chiefely, or for the moſt part, the eye and common iealouſie vpon the firſt kinde. The other kinde (becauſe vſually leſt noted offenſe, and therefore eſteemed leaſt harmefull to men) is both in the iuſt protraction or production thereof vnto the barre of Iuſtice much more rare and ſeldome, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in common and vulgar obſeruation is little or not at all conſidered.</p>
               <p>Hence it proceedeth, that moſt men doe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſolue thereof; Yea, ſome men admire a worth therein, others eſteeme it of reaſonable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable vſe, vnto the ſatisfaction of their curioſities, in things ſecret and hidden from the knowledge of man.</p>
               <p>But ſince Almighty God hath more ſpecially (as is in the former Treatiſe prooued) both giuen moſt certaine and plaine indication, and information of this kinde, by the expreſſed fruites thereof, and the neceſſary inference of familiarity and conſultation with other Spirits then himſelfe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. and hath alſo ſo oft in ſo diuers places iterated the great abomination, and his high deteſtation thereof, it is not onely the ſauing duety of all priuate men to take more diligent and wary notice thereof, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eſchew and flye from it, according vnto Gods expreſle charge and command; but it is the charge of Princes and Magiſtrates alſo, to fulfill thereby the commanded execution of Gods holy wrath and vengeance vpon it; for which pleaſing ſeruice and ſacrifice vnto him, Almighty God hath vpon the euerlaſting records of his holy word fixed for euer the ſo memorable praiſe, and commendation of thoſe famous Princes, who haue dedicated themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his will therein. As it hath beene declared by
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9304:86"/>
what meanes Witches and Sorcerers, in two kindes ſeuerally may be manifeſtly charged, challenged, and prooued as certaine and vndoubted Offendors: ſo alſo how farre preſumption probabilities, or matter of iuſt ſuſpition in both may blameleſly guide, and conduct vpright and equall inquiſition, hath beene briefely inſtanced. From all which it is euident: firſt, that God in nature hath not ſhut vp in this ſubiect, the common intrance and doore of iudging, trying or deciding as equally, as in other caſes: ſecondly, that beſide and beyond that way, which God hath left open vnto ſenſible and reaſonable progreſſe, herein it muſt neceſſarily bee prepoſterous preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to breake out, or ouer-reach, as alſo in ſteade of that plaine approoued and authentike walke for the tryalls of truth; the iudgement and condemnation of others, and the eſtabliſhment of mens owne thoughts, and mindes, to ſeeke irreligious footing, in the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of amazing wonderments, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe traditions and experiments. To walke in theſe waies, is no better then to runne away from God, in whom to truſt, though with ſome reſtraint, and coertion of our longing vaine deſires, and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is truely farre more happy then out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his allowance therein, to inioy the fulleſt meaſure or ouerflow of all the moſt obſequious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencies of humane bliſſe. If true religion and pietie could ſettle this conſideration, the common folly of miſgouerned, petulant, inordinate, and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate expatiations in this kinde, would not onely in priuate men more vſually bluſh and be aſhamed, but a more euen, ſtraight, and vninterrupted way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared thereby vnto iuſtice, would vſually bring forth a much more happy iſſue, then now is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Thus farre the loue of truth, which I haue euer carefully ſought and ſtudied, hath offered violence
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9304:86"/>
vnto my priuate thoughts and meditations, expoſing them vnto the hazard of publike view.</p>
               <p>As my labour is not loſt vnto my ſelfe, and my owne more confirmed ſatisfaction thereby: ſo if there be therein any good vnto the common good, I know, good men will not for the thorne, refuſe the fruite, for defect of elegance in ſtile, or obſcurity of worth in the Author, quarrell with the matter it ſelfe.</p>
