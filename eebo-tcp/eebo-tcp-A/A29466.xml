            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N <hi>Sunday October</hi> the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1662. I came to <hi>London</hi> for dispatch of my own private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: On <hi>Thursday</hi> following, the 16th of the same month, walking through <hi>Cheapside,</hi> I met one commonly called by the name of Captain <hi>Baker,</hi> then living in <hi>East-Smithfield,</hi> formerly of <hi>New-England</hi>; but more lately promoted by <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> (not long since Hanged and Quartered for many Treasons) to be one of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Yeomen of his Guard; we remained not long in the Street, but he gave me an invitation to
<pb facs="tcp:66344:3"/>
bestow upon me my welcome to Town, which I accepted; and by that means I had the opportunity of Discourse. After we had saluted each other, he proceeded to ask me what News from the Country; I told him we heard l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttle; In the Town, he replyed, there was some stirring and that he had Matters of Concernment in hand to follow, with several others, who did hope ere long to be delivered from that Trumpery of <hi>Rome</hi> that did daily incroach upon the Nation. Some more words to this effect passed from him; I considering and knowing what a desperate Enemy to the King, and all the Ministry of the Land, this man had been; and though he was but an illiterate and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewn fellow, yet in <hi>New-England</hi> he might be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possessed with villanous Principles; and I knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that the chiefest Designers against the Kings Majesty had confidence enough to intrust him with matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: upon this, I modestly put my self upon the sifting of him. He being not suspicious in the least of my fidelity, and knowing how forward my Father had been to promote that Devil, that <hi>Geneva</hi> Good-old-Cause; and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that I was a Non-Conformist, because I was not in a Canonical Habit, he at last told me, That before a few Weeks were expired, he did not doubt but that both of us should see the slaughter and confusion of those Rogues at <hi>Whitehall</hi>; And that it did grieve his heart, to see that Villain (meaning the King) and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> to ride not long since through the City, with a few men with them (which was when (as <hi>Baker</hi> said) He rode a Hunting,) when the said <hi>Baker,</hi> would have been one of the Twenty that should have murdered Him, and have delivered this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Tyranny of an Outlandish Dog. I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the temper of the man to be so high, thought he would not be so bold, unless he had some perswasions that the GODLY PARTY should Once more reign
<pb facs="tcp:66344:3"/>
over this Kingdom: Whereupon I began to under-value his Assertion of Confounding the Rogues at <hi>Whitehall</hi>; and certified him, there was no such Expectation in the Countrey, but the Parliament Party there were heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; onely this, that our Eyes were upon the City; and if any hopes of Recovery were here amongst the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEST PEOPLE, we should gladly set our Hearts and Hands to their assistance; with many words to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>His Reply was, that if I would come along with him, the said <hi>Baker,</hi> at that present time, he did not doubt, but he should meet with some friends, that in these matters would give me better satisfaction; I answered him I had not leisure then, but on the morrow, or any other time, I would gladly accompany them, and understand somewhat of those Negotiations; because it concerned us all to yield our best Council and assistance to that work; whereupon he promised to bring some persons with him suddenly to my Lodging for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October,</hi> 17. Upon the Friday following towards night, the said <hi>Baker</hi> came to my Lodging in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and brought three other persons with him enquiring for me; but it being late before I came home, they departed: and <hi>Baker</hi> with two of the aforesaid three promised to come early on the Saturday morning, which two persons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly came; but <hi>Baker</hi> fayling, and they being not acquainted with me, they let me depart the House af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I came out of my chamber without the least Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Munday following being the 20th of October, early in the morning the said <hi>Baker</hi> visited me excusing his neglect on the Saturday before, telling me that he had brought 3 persons of Eminency the last Friday night, to give me some intelligence of matters
<pb facs="tcp:66344:4"/>
in hand, but they having not the happiness to see me then, had engaged him to come this morning to me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring I would come with him to the <hi>Exchange</hi>; and in the <hi>New-England</hi> walke he should find those three persons waiting for us.</p>
                  <p>I consented, asking their quality and their names. He Answered that one of them was a choyce person, Zealous and active in the Cause, which was Mr. <hi>Edward Riggs,</hi> formerly Chaplain to <hi>Blake</hi>; the other was <hi>Bradely,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a faithful Messenger to <hi>Cromwells</hi> Council of State, the other was one <hi>Hill</hi> a Drawer of Cloth in <hi>Coleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street</hi> and a Church Member.</p>
                  <p>All which persons betwixt twelve and one I met on the <hi>Exchange</hi>; assoon as I beheld their Aspect, I presently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged them of that party. After <hi>Baker</hi> had informed them that I was as good as themselves, and my Father a publick Person that may Advance the Cause in the Countrey, we saluted, and all of us Resolved to have some Godly Communication, at the Sign of the Ship by the <hi>East-India</hi> House in <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> Street.</p>
                  <p>The man of the house, as the said <hi>Hill</hi> the Drawer of Cloth informed, though he was a Trained Souldier, yet was truely honest to the Godly Party.</p>
                  <p>And our Conference there was all of Gods Glory; in Ze<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l we were up to the Eyes; and I began exactly to speak their Language; and especially to fit <hi>Riggs</hi> with expressions sutable to his Tone, because I found him the most intelligent person amongst them, and the Darling of the Churches. After much circumlocution I had insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into <hi>Riggs</hi> a good opinion of me, that our Souls were as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathans</hi>; Then downright we came to the business; and <hi>Riggs</hi> assured me; (I having certified him of our ignorance of it in the Country; yet we were unwilling not to be numbered among the Repairers of
<pb facs="tcp:66344:4"/>
                     <hi>Zion,</hi> to look on and not help our Brethren.) Then he was sick until he had satisfied me of the happy recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of all the Sects and Churches; and that Six most excellent Persons, wishing well to all Parties, and tender of every little fry of Locusts, were elected by general consent to mannage and contrive the Design of reducing us to a Free-State, and to Surprise the King in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> my Lord Chancellor, my Lord Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and Major General Sir <hi>Richard Brown.</hi> And that they had protested secrecy by lifting up their hands to Almighty God; and they were resolved to expedite the work.</p>
                  <p>And to that end several Messengers, being Church-Members, were directed into the Country; and all persons of that Interest were resolved to acquiess in what they should Act, and prepare as those Six should direct.</p>
                  <p>To insist much on particulars, <hi>Riggs</hi> with the rest, were somewhat shy that afternoon; but we appointed to meet on the morrow at the same place of the <hi>Exchange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tuesday</hi> I met <hi>Riggs, Bradley, Baker, Iames Hill,</hi> and to our godly society came one Capt. <hi>Brown</hi> a Sea Captain dwelling in <hi>Wapping,</hi> and <hi>Iames Hinde</hi> a Gunner to a Ship. It was long, because so much company was there, before our good Discourse of the Work of God begun; yet at last <hi>Riggs</hi> could no longer detain it from his new Brother: but taking me aside, assured me that this Work was long intended, that Intelligence came in agreeable to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Counties, that he the said <hi>Riggs</hi> was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded once to be one of those six; but he had engaged himself in business in a Brew-house in town that he could not defer; but he was very instrumental in encouraging honest men to the Work, and in satisfying the Fifth-monarchy men, who would have undertaken the Work themselves; and then 'twas his work with several others, to put a stop to it, until
<pb facs="tcp:66344:5"/>
all parties were agreed; and though the Presbyter would not be active, yet he doubted not, but many of them were consenting to the Work. But if I would meet him, the said <hi>Riggs,</hi> on the <hi>Wednesday</hi> night late, I should have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information; for the six persons in Council sate so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, not twice in a place, all disguized, and were resolved to act it so secret, that no person, Friend or Foe, except two persons, should know where or when they met, or whom they were. But Lieutenant <hi>Strange</hi> would come to town that <hi>Wednesday,</hi> and he, the said <hi>Riggs,</hi> should meet him, and give me full information. For the meeting I gave him my faithful promise, and this time I had understanding of somewhat formidable; then I began to consider with my self the consequence of this Design, and how despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Rogues were in their Attempts, that here was a full Combination, and I believed the zeal of these Rogues was such, that they had no Design of Trepanning me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I consulted my self, how I should proceed wisely and timely enough for their Discovery. I presently meditated, that this was to be acted in the City, and that the King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty had intrusted Major General <hi>Brown</hi> with the care of the City, and that he was of an active spirit, and quick in counsel, I immediately attended him, and had suitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions from him, where by the next day, being <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> I was as full of matter for them as they were of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy to their Prince and Countrey.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Wednesday</hi> night I attended <hi>Riggs</hi> for the News that <hi>Strange</hi> should impart, and then I was informed by him, that some Moneths since there was a <hi>Southampton</hi> man that had offered his service to the Churches in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with a new Model of Government for their Saintships, when they had rooted out the <hi>Amorites</hi> from amongst them; and also a Plot for them to act, whereby they should ease themselves from the Government of that Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian thing called Monarchy. But his counsel was rejected,
<pb facs="tcp:66344:5"/>
as the Committee of Safety rejected Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s; whereupon he sold his Estate and took ship for <hi>Holland,</hi> but now Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> the Minister was sent to reinvite him, and several Army-officers resident there, for their assistance here in this blessed Work: exceeding earnest I was to know those six persons in Council, <hi>Riggs</hi> could not fully resolve, but he was sure (though he had heard others nominated) yet <hi>Philip Nye, Lockier</hi> the Minister, and <hi>Anthony Palmer</hi> the Minister, with Colonel <hi>Danvers,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Strange,</hi> were very active in it; he did believe he had pitched upon some of them, and that they had sate lately at the <hi>Wheat-sheaf</hi> in <hi>Thames-street</hi> concerning the business.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then in short, from <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Hinde</hi> I was confidently assured <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle was their own, five hundred men were fixed in and about <hi>Windsor,</hi> the Serjeants and head Gunner were Right Boys, and Captain <hi>Tonge</hi> had been with the Serjeants there, and brought a Letter to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Council from the Serjeants of their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. That all the Churches in <hi>London</hi> were concerned in it, that now their Money did fly, and the Churches were able to raise twelve thousand, if not twenty thousand, to pay their grand Adversaries in <hi>Whitehal,</hi> at <hi>Somerset</hi>-house, and <hi>Worcester</hi>-house; and to be sure, never a Lawn Sleeve or Circingle-man should have a hole to hide their heads in this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Four hundred Assistants, <hi>Riggs</hi> affirmed, in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> they were ascertained of, and that several Cases of Pistols were sent down by a Carrier into that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riggs</hi> acquainted us then, that in a Ware-house in <hi>Crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet-friers,</hi> Arms were lodged, and there five hundred had been dispersed to those that were not able to buy them; that they intended to make a desperate Assault in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> and one party should attempt it by coming in at
<pb facs="tcp:66344:6"/>
the Gate into St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Park, to assault my Lord Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> whom they must presently dispatch; because when the King was destroyed he had power as Lord General to raise Forces by his Commission in any part of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Also when I put the question concerning the King, what we should do with him? <hi>Riggs</hi> answered, That then they were resolved to give no quarter to any body.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, and it shall please Your Majesty, that <hi>Ludlow</hi> was to be General, and the same Law he should have had; the same, the best, or highest of their enemies should have. Many Friends in <hi>Kent</hi> looked for the blessed hour; and when I asked who should command them there, <hi>Riggs</hi> answered, Col. <hi>Kenrick,</hi> for he was su<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Likewise <hi>Riggs</hi> asserted, that one <hi>Ward</hi> a Chandler in <hi>East-Smithfield,</hi> did furnish the Magazines with much Powder, and sent it by honest Porters in Baskets in white Sheets.</p>
                  <p>Likewise that that day Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> the Minister was numbring out the faithful-fighting Brethren in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and those that could not help with their holy hands, must with their purse: And also, that <hi>Riggs</hi> was

Answer was given by <hi>Riggs,</hi> That he had proposed it to Captain <hi>Tonge,</hi> Strong-water-seller in Tower-Ditch. And <hi>Tonge</hi> replied, That no Arms would be delivered me, unless I was a Church member.

                  <p>Some persons, who are Citizens, were discovered this day; but at night, <hi>Riggs, Ward</hi> the Chandler, Lt. <hi>Stubbs, Bradley, Baker,</hi> and <hi>Iames Hind,</hi> we all associated at Captain <hi>Tonges</hi> house in Tower-Ditch; <hi>Ward</hi> being a cunning St. Rogue, was reserved as I heard after, because I was a stranger to him: But <hi>Tonge</hi> couraged us, that one Captain <hi>Elton</hi> told him, that Lieutenant <hi>Strange</hi> came out of the Countrey last night, from lodging the Horses in several by-places, and corresponding with several Agents there; and the work proceeded gallantly in City and Country; and that for fourteen miles round the City, all their friends were ready, waited but for the knowledge of the day. And for the surprizal of the <hi>Tower, Tonge</hi> said, he had fixed many of the Red Coats to open a back Gate, and with Blunderbushes to enter. Also that Captain <hi>Leigh</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66344:7"/>
had also been with <hi>Tonge</hi> last night, and assured him, that those that sate in counsel, intended speedy action.</p>
                  <p>Saturday, <hi>Octob.</hi> 25. <hi>Bradley</hi> and my self, visited <hi>Riggs</hi> at his house, and there he had this comfort for us, That the Commanders were all nominated; <hi>Ludlow</hi> certainly to be their General: That Captain <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Taverner,</hi> formerly Governors of the Castles in <hi>Kent,</hi> commanding the Sea, had assured the Council of the surprizal of those Castles by their interest there. Then was several Copies of the Letter given forth by the direction of the Council, to be noised through the City; the Contents of which Letter was, that the Forces and Papists at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> did intend a massacre in the City of all the Protestant party: The copy whereof I have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riggs</hi> then assured us, A man that he knew was to be assistant at the assault at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> that would bring the party to the Treasuries at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and elswhere. But for money, large sums were in Bank of their own, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that, all Treasuries must be seized; and at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal,</hi> with my Lord Chancellor and his Attendance, at <hi>Worcester-house</hi>; also <hi>St. Iames, Somerset-house,</hi> no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should be given: But their indignation swelled highly against my Lord General <hi>Monk,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Brown</hi>; they should die (who ever escaped) without mercy; and then when Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was slain, the City was their own.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Tonge</hi> this day certified us, that <hi>Strange</hi> was again gone into the Countrey, but his return was this night, then more particular news we should have: But to morrow being Sunday, at the several Meetings they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to whisper the appointed time of Insurrection to each other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riggs</hi> then affirmed with <hi>Tonge,</hi> that many new Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbushes were made for the Design; and that they had Head-peeces, Back, and Brest, for Two thousand Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and that Captain <hi>Leigh</hi> told him, the said <hi>Riggs,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66344:7"/>
that they were not to seek as to the work in <hi>Ireland</hi>; that special care was taken by the Reverend Council for that affair.</p>

                     <hi>Helmes</hi> the Minister, formerly of <hi>Winchcomb</hi> in <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-shire,</hi> was discovered by <hi>Riggs</hi> to be Active in this desi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This night <hi>Tonge</hi> boasted to me, that he was to go to a Cane man, who had bought Armes for six men for this design, at his own cost and charge.</p>
                  <p>Sunday and Monday last, our Information from them was, That all the Horse that formerly departed the Town, were to return by Monday night; That their Declaration was ready founded on Righteous Principles, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat satisfaction as much as the Holy Sisters.</p>
                  <p>And on the Monday, <hi>Riggs</hi> and my self saluted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant <hi>Phillips,</hi> Sergeant to Colonel <hi>Whales</hi> Company of the Militia Bands, for his good service on the Sunday morning, in sending Intimation to several places where the Godly had their Meetings of their intended surprisal, by the Major General; which Seargeant, as <hi>Tonge</hi> and <hi>Riggs</hi> informed me, was to furnish the Party with the Word that were to secure the City; and upon the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when he was on the Guard, he wished their Party were up; for he thought a few would do the work. The Armes that <hi>Tonge</hi> and <hi>Hind</hi> hath provided for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, as they say, I have seen.</p>
                  <p>And one Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> a Sea Captain, must needs discover himself also; that he had sold his Ship, on purpose, that he may fight stoutly in this work on Land.</p>
                  <p>Tuesday <hi>October</hi> 28. Our Intelligence from <hi>Riggs,</hi> and one <hi>Beazley</hi> by <hi>Fleetbridg</hi> a Chandler, that the Council was dissolved, 2000 Horse came into the Town yesterday, that Wednesday night was originally intended to be the fatal night, although they had now fixed another time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66344:8"/>On Tuesday night late, I was carried by <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Beazley,</hi> with Lt. <hi>Stubbs</hi> into <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> into a House, the Sign thereof I know not, but the House I know, where we had Intelligence from one <hi>Gibbs,</hi> and other persons, their Names I could not learn, that the Council were to meet again Wednesday morning. Some intelligence the Council had of Arms and Ammunition, the City had provided in the several Halls; and because it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported about the Town, the Lord Mayors day at night would be the time, whereupon they all supposed <hi>Alhallows</hi> Even; and those persons that were with us, were somewhat assured would be the time; and we were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to prepare against that time. There and then <hi>Gibbs, Riggs,</hi> Captain <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Shoe lane,</hi> Lt. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> and three other persons, assured us, that that Even, or neer, would be the time we should cut off Root and Branch, rid our selves, as their expression was, of Kings, Queens, Dukes, Bishops; all should go one way, there should be no running beyond Sea, or Parleys there; but a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of King, Lords, Bishops and G<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The several days Intelligence, I committed to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sir <hi>Richard Brown</hi>; from whom I received full instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction every night.</p>
                  <p>On Tuesday, Sir <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Robinson,</hi> ordered me to go along with the Soldiers to take <hi>Riggs, Hind, Tonge, Stubbs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>White</hi> the Cane man, who were all apprehended accordingly.</p>

                     <p>GEntlemen of the Jury, you have heard the Indictment read, you have heard the substance of it opened, it is short in words, but of as high consequence as any thing can be; I shall open the particulars of that Evidence, that we conceive will be made good by the Oaths of Witnesses to be produced to you: You see here what the Indictment is, I shall insist upon these particulars, which I shall open and make good to you; first, what was their Design, next what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66344:11"/>
was their means of accomplishment, what encouragements they used one to another, and what colours they put upon this wicked action; For the first, Gentlemen, I shall begin at the highest, higher no man can go in this world, that is, to design and compass, to contrive to put the King himself to death, to seize his person; some of them called it Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, you know the English of that, A King secured; We will go further, for we shall prove to you the person that with his own wicked Hand undertook the Slaughter and Murder of the King; he did contrive how he might do it, sometimes when the King was performing an office of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to visit his Mother, other times when he should recreate himself by Hunting; higher than this they could not go, and this they coloured over with Religion; this merciful King that had pardoned his People beyond their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and contended to do it; this King they would murder. Had there been no more, it had been exceeding hainous; but they went further, their malice rested not upon His person, but the Family, the noble and excellent Duke of <hi>York</hi> is designed to be secured likewise, and used like his Brother; not they onely, they went further, the whole Nobility was in design; not (Gentlemen) that every one of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you used these Expressions, but they and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, some one and some another Expression; but all joyned in this, to destroy the King and his Family root and branch, that was their Expression: King, his Family, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, nay, go down to the Gentry, and it ceased not there, they go to the Clergy, as one of the Prisoners at the Bar (as you will hear) did express himself, I think it was <hi>Stubbs,</hi> that there should be never a Lawn-Sleeve, never a Sursingler should have a hole to hide his head in.</p>

                     <p>That will be left to proof, I undertake not of my self to prove this, but to open it, let the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses speak. In discourse some went further than that, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever would not joyn with them in their Design (it was one <hi>Strange</hi>) was an Enemy; and thereupon one <hi>Cole,</hi> who is gone, deserted them, though he was contented to have the King murdered, the Nation ruined, yet would not agree in that Principle. To accomplish this, we shall prove to you they did treat of levying a War, that among themselves it was given out that Arms were provided, some delivered; and their Designs to raise Money, seizing all the Treasury at <hi>Whitehall, Worcester-house,</hi> and the Chamber of <hi>London</hi>; to seize the person of the noble Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and all about him, and Quarter to be given to none, that was their Expression. They did give out among themselves (for a while there was some difference among these Foxes, whose Tails were tied together, and had fire in them) and <hi>Tonge</hi> told them (as we shall prove) that all parties were now agreed and would joyn; they had framed Declarations to justifie their proceedings, framed Papers to raise a Mutiny among the Marriners, and encouraged them to joyn with them, this will be proved: for their means, <hi>Phillips</hi> at the Bar undertakes to procure the Word that the Guard in the City had, so to betray them. There was a Design made for seizing the Tower, several men appointed for that purpose, they and their Complices were to come there with Papers in their hands as if they were Mariners and had Accompts to make up, these were to go up to those that sate there to finish Accompts. To encourage themselves they gave out that they had dealt with the Souldiers at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and secured that Castle; if this be proved to you there can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be higher; There was this one pretence, it was given out (and perchance the rumours of the City are come to your ears) that they had designed a Day for the Execution
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66344:12"/>
of this Mischief; several dayes were appointed; one on the Lord Maiors Day, another on <hi>Alhallows</hi> Eve: They gave out by a feigned Letter that there would be a Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre by the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> of the <hi>Protestants</hi>; this was to raise a fear and discontent among the Nation, to induce them to joyn when this Design should be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Gentlemen of the Jury, had they gone on in this wicked purpose, having possessed the people with these fears, who could have told how to behave himself? And it seems strange and wonderfull, especially looking upon the persons, men of little consideration, despicable men, and who live under the Mercies of so good a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, that they should take such a Design in their hearts, and undertake the performance: Though the Spear hath not entred into the Sides of our Soveraign, yet it must needs crown his Head with abundance of Thorns, that such people should be desperately wicked. But we shall call our Witnesses, and when you have heard this proved, we cannot be so uncharitable to think you shall need any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aggravation, or doubt of your giving a Verdict against such Miscreants as these are.</p>

                     <p>May it please your Lordships, about the middle of <hi>October</hi> last, I met <hi>Iohn Baker,</hi> one that is now indicted, he was a Captain formerly called; I met him in <hi>Cheapside</hi>; he meeting me (after a Salutation) invites me to drink with him; I went into a house with him. When I was with him he began to aske me what News there was in the Countrey, I told him I had little to informe him. He told me, if I would stay a while he would tell me some. I asked him of what nature; saies he, Not long agoe the King went a Hunting, sent some Stags to Sir <hi>Iohn Robinson,</hi> now the Lord Major, and went but with a small Guard, and I could have been one of the twenty that would have slain that Outlandish Dog: then said I, Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> that's nothing to me; but what other news have you? saies he, I know thou art right, and I know your Father; there is something on foot in the City, and if you wilt meet to morrow, I will bring some persons to you that will give you information, Sir, said I, understanding it of dangerous consequence, and willing to get it out, I will meet you, and we agreed to meet the next morning; that morning 3 Persons came early to my quarters, <hi>Hill</hi> the Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer, Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi> and this Mr <hi>Riggs,</hi> he appointed them to meet him there, but failing himself, they being strangers said nothing to me then, and so I departed and left them a drinking; the morrow after he himself came to my Lodgings, fetches me out of my Bed, and tells me he had appointed some persons on the Exchange to give me an account; I went with him thither, and there we met with some persons that were his acquaintance, and from thence we went to the Ship in <hi>Leadenhall-street</hi>; and among us was <hi>Hind,</hi> that confessed himself Guilty; and there the business was fully discoursed of, what their intention was, that all interests were agreed, <hi>Fifth Monarchy-men, Anabaptists, Independents,</hi> and <hi>Fighting Quakers,</hi> and the Congregational Churches were consenting, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to indeavour their deliverance from adversaries at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> Many passages more; On the morrow after we met again, and there

met with us <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi>; there we were acquainted of their Magazine and Armes provided, and about their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence in the several Gounties, that they were sure of <hi>Windsoor Castle,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>Phillips</hi>; that day that the meetings were intercepted, that the Trained bands did surprize them, that day this Gentleman and I (pointing to <hi>Riggs</hi>) came to the Main Guard at the <hi>Exchange</hi>; where Sergeant <hi>Phillips</hi> was with a Buff Coat and a Halbert, and this Gentleman (meaning <hi>Riggs</hi>) saluted him, and thanked him for his service in sending down notice to the Meeting to be gone, for he was coming with the Trained bands to surprize them; he asked him what was the occasion of the Bustle, saies he, they say —</p>

                     <p>My Lord, I shall come to that, <hi>Wapshot</hi> told me there were Arms delivered, but further told me, he knew not of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of these things, that at night he should go to a house where he should know, I bid him have a care; At night, as I was passing along, I met <hi>Riggs</hi> at <hi>Stubbs</hi> door, he asked me what news at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi> I said, I was told there would be a Rising, and that Arms were delivered. Is there, says he? said I, I do not believe it, but I shall know certainly to morrow. I did call the next morning, and asked, Is the story true? No, says he, I was there, and there was no Arms, that was all that I know of the business. Friend, did I tell you any such thing?</p>

                     <p>We all stand in the presence of God; and I am very conscientious of what I say and do, I must give account of all things before the Lord. This Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> has asserted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, That I should deliver divers Cases of Pistols, or knowing the delivery of them: if Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> who stands likewise in the presence of God, can produce any man to prove, That I delivered to any man any Pistols, or that any were so delivered by my order, or that I conveyed or sent them away into the Countrey: Do this in the sight of the Lord and his own conscience, I expect not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But I would have him speak no more of me, but what he knows of me, or by me; whether he knows, I ever received any Pistols, or delivered any at any time, for such an end as he is pleased to speak, Which my Soul abhors, and God can witness!</p>

                     <p>There was Arms spoken of, but that man (Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>) spoke of them, and upon this consideration, That there were Arms delivered to every Hall, Ammunition and Powder; <hi>Riggs</hi> knows he spoke it at that time.</p>

                     <p>This likewise he has told me, That he had sometimes met with a certain company: he did not say thirty or forty, but a pretty many there was: he named Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> Captain <hi>Elton,</hi> Captain <hi>Leigh,</hi> that they had often met, but could not well agree; but at last Mr. <hi>Strange</hi> did meet with them, give them one meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they could not agree neither; they went away, and said these words to the best of my remembrance, Mr. <hi>Strange</hi> did refuse to joyn with them, but when God did bid him go, he would go; whether this day, or next week, or next year, matters not; but when God bids him go, he would go. Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> was somewhat troubled to hear it; but sayes Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> if you will go, give me but notice, If I cannot go so fast as you ride, I will hold by your

Horse-tail: A little while after he told me, they had not met again; that Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> because they could not agree about this business, was gone beyond Sea; but before he was gone, he did tell me of some Considerations that were drawn, as he judged about a Government by Master <hi>Cole,</hi> and gave me in a Paper some certain Propositions, three or four concerning Sea-men; the substance was this, what great benefits they had by a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>

That no Sea-men should pay custom for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity that he did bring under the value of Ten pounds, upwards they must: And likewise there should be care taken upon our own Coasts, and beyond Sea, That where any of our English Ships should be cast away, there should be care taken out of the Customes, that might keep them in their travelling homewards, either from begging or starving: Put Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> when they met as <hi>Tonge</hi> said, would not agree, and therefore went beyond Sea; after he was gone, within a week or fortnight they had another meeting.</p>

                     <p>That Friday immediately before we were taken, I think, <hi>October</hi> 24. there was some discourse, in general, concerning <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal</hi>; what might be done, as to the procuring of that, and likewise concerning the <hi>Tower.</hi>

Concerning the taking of the <hi>Tower,</hi> there was some Propositions on all hands concerning the taking of that; Mr. <hi>Hind,</hi> he onely mentioned, but did not say he would undertake it, the righting of Gunners Accompts. Mr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> he said, that the way that he thought convenient, might be this, When Sir <hi>Iohn Robinson,</hi> now Lord Major, did late in the evening go into the <hi>Tower,</hi> there should be a party following his Coach in, and so might do it. And <hi>Iohn Baker</hi> at that present instant of time did say, That it was necessary the King should be surprized; and likewise said then, that there should be no quarter, he would give, nor take none.</p>

                     <p>Sir, that Friday <hi>October</hi> 24. immediately before we were taken, there was this discourse, <hi>Tonge</hi> did propound such a way for surprizing the <hi>Tower,</hi> by following Sir <hi>Iohn Robinsons</hi> Coach in at night; and <hi>Baker</hi> did say, that it was necessary to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66344:20"/>
undertake the securing of the Kings person, and assaulting of <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and that if there were Five hundred horse and foot, they would undertake it by going into the Privy-Garden and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stairs.</p>

                     <speaker>Riggs.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> saying, That he had Two hundred pound to buy Horses, and that he had four already, and wanted Swords, and had friends in Town wanted Arms; asked me, if I knew if any were given out. I told him, that one Mr. <hi>Sallers</hi> told me, That he had heard some Arms were given, and to be given out that day. Upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> and <hi>Bradley</hi> and I being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> said, I there is the person that told me of the Arms; I will go and ask him, if there be any such thing. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> heard the discourse, I cannot tell, but he said, says he, I have enquired, and some Arms are delivered, and forty went without; but within two or three days, there would be more.</p>

                     <p>For <hi>Gibbs,</hi> I brought Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> acquainted with Mr. <hi>Stubbs</hi>; and he said he knew one at <hi>Fleet-bridg</hi> that sells Plums, and such things; and if we would go along with him, he would tell us news: <hi>Hill, Stubbs,</hi> and I, that day I was taken, went to <hi>Beazley; Stubbs</hi> asked him what news; sayes he, I hear the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness goes on, but if you will go to one <hi>Gibbs,</hi> meaning him that is fled, he has intelligence; so we went to an Ale-house neer him, but he was not at home, and we were told, if we would go to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> they said they would send for his Brother, meaning him at the Bar, and so should have an account: <hi>Gibbs</hi> at the Bar, being with us, he told us he knew little himself, but when his Brother came, we should hear. Three quarters of an hour after came <hi>Gibbs</hi> that is gone, <hi>Thomas,</hi> and another man, I knew him not, and <hi>Gibbs</hi> called this Brother; <hi>Beazley, Stubbs,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> and I, set still: when this <hi>Gibbs</hi> came, he said his brother knew little, hoped we were honest men. The news was this, that he heard that <hi>Ludlow</hi> was in Town, and that now the Council was broken up.</p>

                     <p>I was one Friday night at <hi>Tonges</hi> house, a Strong-water man on <hi>Tower</hi> Ditch, where there was these two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with me (pointing to Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Riggs,</hi>) and there was Mr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baker,</hi> and another Gentleman, one <hi>Ward,</hi> and we had some discourse about surprizing of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal,</hi> which way it might be done. Some said, that a party might go through the Guard, and so surprize General <hi>Monks</hi> Guard: Others said, they might come down by <hi>Charing-Cross</hi>; but <hi>Tonge</hi> said, there was no coming down by <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> because there was two great Guns planted at the bottom, and commanded all that way; but said, the onely way he conceived, was to bring a party through <hi>Kings-street,</hi> and if it were possible to get into the <hi>Privy-Garden,</hi> and so into the Lodgings that way. This is all that I remember.</p>

whilst. After we had taken a Pipe of Tobacco, he came again, and said he heard the business was near at hand, and that there would be speedy action. <hi>Hill</hi> was at the shop, and after dinner, <hi>Riggs</hi> and I, Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Hind,</hi> went all out together to <hi>Stubbs</hi> his house. <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> went in, <hi>Hind</hi> and I staid. Standing there a little, said I to <hi>Hind,</hi> What mean these Gentlemen to stay so long? <hi>Riggs</hi> said he staid for a friend; but I will go and meet him: Said I, will you not go on board a Ship with Master <hi>Hind</hi> and I; says <hi>Riggs,</hi> no, I will go to meet my friend. Do you go on board the Ship, and come to my house; if I am not there pray stay a little. We asked Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> if he would go with us, but he went with <hi>Riggs</hi>; and they told me coming back, that <hi>Gibbs</hi> had informed them, the design was ready, Council broke up, and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers sent to give notice, and <hi>Ludlow</hi> in Town, and to be General.</p>

                     <p>I have met Mr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> and others, in three or four seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places; at the Wheat-sheaf at <hi>Lions,</hi> once, if not twice; at the Half-Moon, Widow <hi>Iordans</hi> within Bishopsgate, twice at the least; near <hi>Dukes</hi> place at the Shears, I have heard several things, and have noted it down, to be sure to deliver the truth. I have heard them speak about <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and securing of it, and of the two Guns there. <hi>Elton</hi> and he said, that they might come with a party backwards breaking through a <hi>Barbers</hi> shop in <hi>Kings-street,</hi> and dismount the two Guns. But as touching the King, the Duke, and the Noble Duke of <hi>Albemarle:</hi> They proposed, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent service it would be, to secure these persons; he said, it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66344:23"/>
was not a thing that would admit of much debate, inasmuch as he had a friend a Courtier, (I know not his title) that would give him notice at any time when the King was gone a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or His Progress; and that it was easie to take it. <hi>Tonge</hi> said, he served the <hi>Tower</hi>-Sutlers, and was acquainted there; and said, there was no way to surprize that, but this, either about ten or eleven a clock: I will undertake we may do it with forty persons, thus, says he, Some to go in dropping, one by one, or two together; and others to be at several Alehouses near, to be ready, and they within seizing on the Guard by a private sign, we would secure those without; and the Soldiers being of the old Army, will readily comply: And said, there was a person that lived nigh him, wears Ropes about him, is a Porter, when off the Guard; and believes he can command the whole Company, and would undertake it. For <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, There was an old Gunner, that he kept a correspondence withal, and he served the Sutlers of that Castle also with Tobacco, I think he named Strong-water; and that the Soldiers were many of them his acquaintance, and that he had received Letters from this Gunner, under some strange title; and said it was easie, and knew, that at any time, when the Word was given, let him go or send by such a token, and that place were our own.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tonge.</hi> As to the other person <hi>Phillips,</hi> I can onely say this of him; there is one Lievetenant <hi>Chapman,</hi> so formerly, now a Prisoner in the Tower: This Lieutenant was a Carrier of <hi>Norwich,</hi> I went to his Inne the <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-street,</hi> and asked for him, I was told he was at Captain <hi>Fosters</hi> House in <hi>Leaden-Hall-street,</hi> and there I might find him; I went to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fosters,</hi> and Captain <hi>Foster</hi> told me he was at Supper there with his Master; I went up, there was this Lieutenant <hi>Chapman,</hi> and <hi>Phillips,</hi> which was the first time I laid my eyes on <hi>Phillips</hi>: My business was to speak with Mr. <hi>Chapman</hi> the Carrier; but I perceived by some discourse of Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> there was something driving on; but I must say, that Caprain <hi>Foster</hi> walked about the Room, as if he minded not the discourse; there was <hi>Chapman, Phillips, Elton,</hi> and a man looking a squint, I heard <hi>Phillips</hi> call
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66344:23"/>
him Muster-Master, but I know not the man; I heard them discourse very promiscuously about ships, and something wildly; I tarried while I spent my two pence, and came away with M. <hi>Chapman,</hi> and asked him what that young Blade was that talked so promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously? <hi>Chapman</hi> told me he was a Sergeant belonging to the Trained-Bands: Tell me his Name, his Name is <hi>Phillips</hi>: Do you know his Trade or Dwelling? He is a Gilder I think: Then this is the same person I have heard of at a Coffee-house, which was thus; A Perfumer in <hi>Southwark,</hi> he heard of great rumours about a new Common-wealth; and pressing this Perfumer how he came to be thus informed, sayes he, there is one <hi>Phillips</hi> that lives in <hi>Abchurch</hi>-lane, this man knows of it: for sayes he, he hath said himself, that he has gone from Committee to Committee, where Officers met about these things, and he named Captain <hi>Foster</hi> for one that was engaged in the business: said I, this is strange; I hastened back again in the morning to Captain <hi>Fosters</hi>; Sir, said I, Do you know that <hi>Phillips</hi> that was here last night? Yes, sayes he: What is he, said I; he answered, a Sergeant. The thing is this, this man does talk abroad, That there is a meeting of the old Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and that you are engaged. At which, Captain <hi>Foster</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be troubled that he should be so aspersed; answered, I know nothing, not one word of this. I do declare an abhorrence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or of any action against His Majesty; and thereupon present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to <hi>Phillips,</hi> and charged him wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h this Report; and soon after, this Perfumer comes to my house, and desired me to go over to the Cross-Keys, where <hi>Phillips</hi> was. When I came there, says <hi>Phillips,</hi> Sir, I saw you the last night, when we were talking of Ships, I hope you do not minde the report about Captain <hi>Foster,</hi> for I am troubled such a thing is mentioned: For my part, I know not that I said so; I am sure, I knew no such thing. This was all as to <hi>Phillips</hi>; But for <hi>Tonge,</hi> I must needs say, in all the meetings where I was, the several places that I formerly named, and the <hi>Whalebone</hi> behind the Exchange, he still discoursed of this business.</p>

                     <p>As for altering the Government, that must needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed; for <hi>Tonge</hi> said it was debated, and thought convenient, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the desire of several in the countrey, that the old Parliament should be chosen again, that was to say, that so many of them that had approved themselves faithful from first to last to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths interest, especially in the times of Declension. Secondly, that none should have power to elect or be elected but such also as have approved themselves faithful, as aforesaid. Thirdly, this House was to be filled up within a Moneth. Fourthly, that it should continue one Year, and no more. Fifthly, that they should not have power in things of an Ecclesiastical nature, to impose any thing upon the consciences of the People. Sixthly, that it should be high Treason amongst them to assert the interest of a King, House of Lords, or single person. Seventhly, that they should not appoint any salary Officers. Eighthly, that while they keep to this, it should be high Treason to disturb them; as touching Arms, and things of that nature, the truth is, the business which was very much urged is this, that there should be an uniting of all interests together, Quaker, Fifth-monarchy men, Anabaptist, Independent, Presbyterian, and Leveller; to which purpose every one was obliged at the Meeting, to see what interest they could make among the Presbyters, because they looked upon them as persons that had most money and strength: I think there was no Presbyterian spoken of except one, who is lately secured in the Tower; he said, that if so be that Col. <hi>Beanes</hi> was at liberty he believed he could engage him. There was one man that was there, which was one <hi>Prior,</hi> I suppose <hi>Tonge</hi> knew him, he said, he had very much acquaintance with the Presbyters, knew many in the countrey, and that there they did not meet with any difficulties, as here; for all interests, Quakers, and Presbyterians, and the rest, are all agreed.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Gibbs</hi>'s Brother told us, that he kept a correspondence in the countrey, that in <hi>Essex</hi> he knew there were divers Horse ready there, and I my self spoke with one who is lately secured, who said,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66344:25"/>
there were divers Horse ready thereabouts. I remember there were several at the Half-moon at <hi>Bishops-gate,</hi> one <hi>Smith</hi> a <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> man, and one <hi>El<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

We were informed, that there were two hundred Horse at <hi>Bristow</hi>; one person, not yet secured, did affirm to us, that one Colonel <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi> had two or three thousand men ready, his name was <hi>Thomas</hi>; that <hi>Templar</hi> was now in Town, if we would we might go and speak with him. Said I, Surely he doth but tell you this; saith he, His Lieutenant Colonel gave me this information, and assures me, that his Colonel had converted his Estate into Money to pay his Souldiers. Upon this having occasion to go down into <hi>Essex,</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Tonge</hi> I would inquire further there; and understanding that one <hi>Thornback</hi> a Glover was one of these <hi>Templar</hi>'s men formerly, I went to his house, and being not at home, I rode to <hi>Holsted</hi> Fair, and riding there the man pulled me by the coat, for he knew me; saith he, Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> my servant said you were at my house to speak with me. Yes, said I, I understand your name is <hi>Thornback</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That you can give me some account concerning Colonel <hi>Templar,</hi> we hear in <hi>London</hi> that he hath two or three thousand men in readiness, I pray inform me: saith he, I do not believe any such matter, I have served him long, and if occasion were he would be for you. I asked him the news; saith he, We all dread a Massacre, we understand by a Letter from <hi>Ipswi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66344:26"/>
fully agreed; but now they were come all to an Agreement, and the work would be done in a short time; that all things were now near rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy both in Country and City; and that a Frigat or more would revolt from the King to them. Not long after the said <hi>Riggs</hi> carried him, the said <hi>Phillips,</hi> to the house of one <hi>Tonge,</hi> an old Army Captain, but now a Seller of Tobacco and Strong-water in <hi>Tower-Ditch,</hi> where he heard <hi>Tonge</hi> say unto <hi>Riggs,</hi> that he had been at <hi>Windsor</hi>-Castle, and had made a Captain, two Serjeants, and a Gunner to be of their Party; and that they had undertaken to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the said Castle to that Party which were now to Rise; to which <hi>Riggs</hi> replyed, you have done well; and further said, I am now going to surprise two Castles in <hi>Kent</hi>; one of them, as this Deponent remembreth, was to be <hi>Deale</hi> Castle; and this he would and could do, for that he had some correspondence therein, and much acquaintance near, where he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly used to Preach: And further saith, That <hi>Tonge</hi> asked <hi>Riggs,</hi> who should lead the men that were to Rise, and who Commanded in chief; to which <hi>Riggs</hi> replyed, that <hi>Ludlow</hi> was appointed for that work.</p>

                                       <pb n="38" facs="tcp:66344:27"/>He further saith, That he asked <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Tonge,</hi> how this business might be carried on with safety and secrecy; <hi>Riggs</hi> told him, that there was a Council of Six which managed the Design, who sat but one day in a place, and would not be spoken with, but by the Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of each County, who were imployed by them to and fro in this work, to prepare and make ready all Parties in the several Counties; and that these Six were of several Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Opinions; to the end that all Parties might unite: And further saith, That one <hi>Wade,</hi> or some such name, whom he heard <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Tonge</hi> say was a Ship-Chandler in <hi>East-Smithfield,</hi> did furnish powder to carry on this Design; in whose Company he once was, and heard himself say as much; which said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he believes he knows when he seeth him again. He also saith, That <hi>Riggs</hi> told him all the Congregational Churches were now agreed to joyn in this Design; And that <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Tonge</hi> desired this Examinant to furnish what Men &amp; Arms he could; which he saith he never intended to do it, though they earnestly request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it of him; onely he saith, in some things he was too faulty, which he prayeth pardon for;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66344:27"/>
which was, in sending word to the several Meetings on <hi>Sunday</hi> last, that the Trained-Bands were coming to seise them; upon which the chiefest of them made their escape before the Souldiers arrival; and that he being deluded by their fair Speeches, did promise to give them the Word when the general Rising was to be: In which Rising all the Churches aforesaid promised to joyn, and the <hi>Fifth Monarchy-Men</hi> to lead the Van: And further saith, That <hi>Riggs</hi> told him, they had a Declaration ready to fling among the People, against <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>; and that <hi>Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> was held forth therein: But first before this Declaration, they would Seise on the Kings Person; and that then their Declaration would take with the People; And also saith, That one Capt. <hi>Baker,</hi> one <hi>Bradley</hi> and <hi>Tonge</hi> were privy to all these Transactions which were debated by them in his presence; and that the said <hi>Baker</hi> came afterwards to this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and discoursed all the aforesaid particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and incited him to help on with the work; and told him, their Arms and Powder was distributed, and that a Porter, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Souldier, carried the Powder to several

Places in a Sack. And further saith, That <hi>Riggs</hi> told him, they had divers Friends both in <hi>London</hi> &amp; the Country, who had, and would help them to Money; and that all their Friends were now ready in all Countries, waiting onely for the day when they were to Act; and that the Treasure in the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> was likewise to be seised.</p>
                                    <p>And that the said <hi>Riggs</hi> also told him, That they intended to Surprize the <hi>Tower,</hi> which they could easily do, having some therein that would assist; and this was to be put in Execution in some Evening, when Sir <hi>Iohn Robinson</hi> came home late, by following close after his Coach with a Party of men, which should lie ready for that purpose.</p>

                     <p>He may remember I came on the Exchange, and spoke to him, and was looking for one of his Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, I asked no man the word, but presently went to the Black Lyon in the new Alley, and from thence I went home, I did not ask the word of any one; I have confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before the Councel that at the begining of <hi>August,</hi> I met Mr. <hi>Riggs</hi> in Cheapside, he then came and closed with me, and walking along, said he, Do not you hear of a rising which should have been on Fryday? no said I, and then I asked him where? he said at <hi>Camberwel,</hi> and I thinking nothing of it, came home and spoke of it in my Family, as news from Mr. <hi>Riggs</hi>; on Tuesday I met Mr. <hi>Riggs</hi> on Tower-hill, and he brought me to the house of Mr. <hi>Tong; Tong</hi> told <hi>Riggs</hi> he had been at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and made some party to secure the Castle; <hi>Riggs</hi> said he could go down to <hi>Kent,</hi> and secure <hi>Deal</hi> and another Castle, for he had been a Preacher there; As for Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> one night coming near Captain <hi>Fosters</hi> door, and having not seen him in three years before, he asked me if I would not drink, I said yes, then came in the Carryer of <hi>Norwich,</hi> I never saw this Carryer till then; then came Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> and there was talking of a Friggot &amp; the time of the lanching of it, and how it was to be man'd; but a little after Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Foster</hi> came and charged me with a report, that I should say he was engaged; I told him I knew it not, nor said it not; I have often declared I would have nothing to do in it, It's true Mr. <hi>Riggs</hi> came and thanked mee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66344:29"/>
that I sent notice to the meeting to be gone, and I told him I would do the people any good I could, but Mr. <hi>Riggs</hi> knows I told him it was a dangerous business, and I would not meddle with it, I am sure in the time of the Fifth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy Insurrection, I was faithful to the King, ventured my life as farr as any man, Sir <hi>William Wale</hi> put trust in me, and I did that service there that the Colonel himself did not venture to do; but that I was engaged in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, it is a trouble to me, and I hope the King will be merciful to me, I did not think that such a thing would be disclosed in so short a time, for my part I did not mind it, I knew nothing the night I was taken, I was in bed and did not offer to escape, I hope the King will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as one drawn in.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, I was at a Neighbours house at that time, and went to Drink a Cup of beer alone in their kitchin, not kinowing of <hi>Hill, Riggs,</hi> or <hi>Stubbs</hi> coming there, I never appointed them any meeting, they came in and when they came in, they asked if there was not one <hi>Gibbs</hi> there, so the People of the house told them there was, they came and told me there was some Gentlemen would speak with me, whereupon they being strange faces, I stood up and said, Gentlemen, what is your business with me? said they, we would Drink a cup of beer with you, then said I sit down; they had a desire to be private, and to go up, whereupon not knowing their business, I went up suppossing they meant some matters of my trade, but we sitting down, Mr. <hi>Riggs</hi> said to me, Mr. <hi>Gibbs,</hi> what is the best news, and Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> also did urge and ask for news, said I Gentlemen, I know no news, nor none I can tell you: so they made inquiry then for my Brother, said I, I cannot tell where my brother is, may be your business is

most with him; I will send for him, and I sent the Maid for him, and directed her, that if he was not at home, she should leave word for him to come; Again, they urged for news, and I told them I knew none but only this, that the meeting was seized upon the last Sunday by armed Soldiers; but to tell them, there would be any rising, or of any armes delivered, or Pistols, as Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it, was a thing I was wholly ignorant of, I speak as in the presence of God, and I know I must one day give an account before the great assizes of the world, and I fear that which they have said, is out of some fear lying upon them, being guilty of some fact, and so to shrowd themselves under false lyes. They, nor no other can prove that ever I received, or delivered any arms, or that any were delivered by my order, these men speak falsly.</p>

I said they were strangers to me, and knew not what they came for; saies he, they are strangers to me also, immediately we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, paid our reckoning, and went away: but that ever I said my Brother told me, The Councel of 6 was broke up, all is ready, <hi>Ludlow</hi> to be General, and <hi>Alhallow-Eve</hi> the time, or that things went on well: I deny it, my Brother said no such thing to me, nor I to any man; when there was an Insurrection by the <hi>Fifth-monarchy</hi> men, I was then presently ready at beat of Drum, went out in my own Person to serve his Majestie at twelve a clock at night, though I had Servants of my own.

                        </gap>avour the Word when the Insurrection was to be, and but a very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, he is the man that discovers to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal meetings, that the Trained Bands were coming to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them, that is in his own confession, as well as the willingness in him to discover the Word; It is proved that <hi>Tong</hi> and <hi>Stubbs</hi> were present at those discourses touching surprising the Tower, securing the King, this is proved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly against them; <hi>Stubbs</hi> he thinks he has said fairly for himself, when he doth ask Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> whether he did not say he had horses and 200 l. to carry on the work, Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> saies he did say so, then it seems <hi>Stubbs</hi> was inquisitive what helps there were to carry it on; Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> goes further, that in the presence of <hi>Stubbs,</hi> it was said there should be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66344:32"/>
no quarter given but such as <hi>Ludlow</hi> should have if he were taken. When you come to <hi>Gibbs,</hi> he does deny all the whole matter, and indeed so they would all, and they have nothing to say, but to cry the witnesses have sworn falsely, and God is a righteous God, and he will require their bloud one day; but remember what a horrid prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station was in that Letter that was sent abroad, to Alarm the whole Kingdom, as if a Massacre was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Papists, a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d the watch-word they should all rise by, that Letter saies, <hi>I call the Eternall God to witness, this is no Trepan, but a sober Truth:</hi> Do you think, that men who are not ashamed to call the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God to witness to a Lye, when 'tis to raise Sedition, will make any scruple of such protestations at the Bar when 'tis to save their lives? and if a man may scape by his own protestation, who shall ever be found guilty? But <hi>Gibbs</hi> thinks he saies a great deal for himself, when he sayes his Neighbors can give great testimony of his good conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Alas who will deny to give a good report of any man til he hear evil proved against him? But do you think a little demure and sober carriage amongst a mans Neighbours will serve to ballance an Evidence of high Treason? Is not the proof clear, that he did both know the Design and approve it? Mark what <hi>Gibbs</hi> tels the company.</p>
                     <p>My brother, saith he, for his part he will not speak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; but if you be honest men, this is the News that was spoke, like one that was not consenting to it; well then, what is the News? he tels them why, the Council of 6 are broke up, <hi>Friday</hi> is the day of Action, <hi>Ludlow</hi> is to be General. Can any man be privy to these things, and relate them so cheerfully, and yet not be consenting? believe it, it is a hard matter to find greater evidence of a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and consent against any Conspirator, until he break out into open action. <hi>Sallers,</hi> he says that the Witnesses do not agree; for Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> speaks that he said there was 500 Arms delivered, and 40 men went without Arms, but within two or three dayes there would be more: and when <hi>Riggs</hi> comes to speak, he saies, he did say Arms were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66344:33"/>
and more would be, but he did not remember what number; and because they agree in the thing, but not in the number, therefore he thinks they disagree in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Observe what reason was there that <hi>Riggs</hi> comes to enquire of <hi>Sallers</hi> for Arms, because <hi>Sallers</hi> told him the day before Arms were delivered, and more would be, he thought, therefore he came to a very proper Person to tell him: If you mark, <hi>Sallers</hi> does deny openly in the Court that ever he saw the face of <hi>Hill</hi> till he was apprehended, although <hi>Hill</hi> was with <hi>Riggs</hi> when the Arms were spoken of upon the Exchange: And then he saies again, that <hi>Hill</hi> speaks by hear-say, he is out in that too; for Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> swears expresly, he heard the words themselves from <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>; Then here are these before you, four witnesses against <hi>Tong,</hi> two against <hi>Phillips,</hi> and his own confession; here is two against <hi>Gibbs,</hi> with these circumstances, if you be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men this is the news, &amp;c. Here are two witnesses like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise against <hi>Stubbs,</hi> who was likewise present at all their debates, even when the King himself was to have had the same quarter with <hi>Ludlow.</hi> Now Gentlemen, that there was a Conspiracy, I think you have a clear Evidence, we may thank God, and the care of the King and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that it went no further, but 'tis no thanks to these men, they would have carried it to the extremity, had they had power, and without question this was formed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of wits than these poor contemptible Agitators, who are now tryed for it; you see there was a Council of 40, &amp; an under Council of 6, a Declaration framed to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the time of action, &amp; that action directed to be both in the City and Country, just in effect at the same pitch of time; and that it might be so a wicked and an impudent Letter is contrived, and many thousand Copies dispersed, and it wrought so far that the Couutries, much about the time appointed, were in great disorder, as you have heard it proved: Is it not plain that an evil spirit went through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Nation, and animated the whole party of Male-contents, most evidently it was a terrible conspiracy; Gentlemen, 'tis true, it is a question of bloud, but 'tis royal
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66344:33"/>
bloud, 'tis the bloud of Princes and Nobles, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the peace and security of the Kingdom, and every mans propriety, and of Religion, for they had left no man of conscience or reputation behind, if they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. Consider the Massacre these men would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, had they prospered, and oppose that to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Massacre which they gave out by their Letter the Papists would have committed. Consider that you have the life of the King in your hands, and I doubt not but he and the whole Kingdom shall alwaies be safe in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of honest men.</p>

My speech will not give me leave to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of it; for the Witnesses, they are none but such as may satisfie all honest men, it is clear they all agreed to subvert the Government, to destroy his Majesty: what can you have more? two of the witnesses are without exception, but I do not see any way but their testimony is good; for the parties, they in themselves are very inconsiderable; these are but the out-boughs, and if such fellowes are not met withal, these kind of People are the fittest instrument to set up a <hi>Iack-Straw</hi> and a <hi>Wat-Tyler,</hi> therefore you must lop off these, or else they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others. You see one of their own company hath confessed the Fact out of remorse of his own conscience: But I leave the Evidence to you. Go together.</p>

                        <hi>Thomas Tong, George Phillips, Francis Stubbs, Iames Hind, Iohn Saller,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Gibbs,</hi> you six Prisoners at the Bar, you have been here indicted for one of the greatest crimes that can be committed upon earth, as to this world, against God, our King, and your Country, and against every good body that is in this land for that capital sin of high Treason which is a sin inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable, and indeed hath no equal sin as to this world, upon this you have severally been arraigned, and have severally (except one) pleaded not guilty, and put your selves upon God and the Country for your tryals, and your Country have found you guilty; for the five that are found guilty, I must say, that in you I find little remorse, little sense of your sin, for the little man there, <hi>Hind,</hi> he hath much shewed his penitency; The manner and circumstances of this, most men here believe, this did not originally arise from your particular selves, it must be put into you by some others; you speak as if you desired mercy, where was your mercy, that would have destroyed King and Country, and massacred many millions of souls, no respect of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but your own Fellows? I speak this, that you may be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66344:35"/>
the more sensible of your own Crime, that you may truly out of the remorse of conscience, be sorry for your sin; you know very well the old councel, and it is a good one, <hi>Fear God, and honour the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> Medling with them that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to change, has brought too much mischief already to this Nation; and if you will commit the same sin, you must receive the same punishment, for happy is he that by other mens harms takes heed: I shall not spend long time with you, but if you will as much as you can, discover the Actors herein, you will do God, the King, and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try good service; It remains that the Court proceed to Judgment, and therefore you six, the one by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and other five by conviction of Law: the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Court is, That you be conveyed back to the place from whence you came, and from thence to be drawn upon an Hurdle to the place of Execution, and there you shall be hanged by the neck, and being alive shall be cut down, and your privy Members to be cut off, your Entralls to be taken out of your Body, and (you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) the same to be burnt before your eies, and your head to be cut off, your body to be divided into four quarters, and your head and quarters to be disposed of at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Kings Majesty, And God have mercy upon your Souls.</p>

I freely forgive all men, as I hope to be forgiven of God: I never did act any thing, but onely this, which was my ignorance of the Laws, that I did not discover it; and I was justly found Guilty, for not discovering. I have done, Mr. Sheriff; but hope, after my Brethren have spoken, we may have liberty to call upon the Lord.</p>

                     <p>COuntreymen and Friends, and I hope Christians, and the last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is that that makes me the more free to speak to you: we all profess to own God and Jesus Christ to be our Saviour, our Redeemer, our Sanctifier, and giver of, and bestower upon us Eternal Life; this should excite our Souls to love one another; and upon the account of Gods love, that God has so loved us as to give Jesus Christ, to reconcile us sinners to God, we ought to love one another, it is his great command. Truly as to the Cause for which I am brought here, God the great Judge of Heaven and Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I stand, knows that in the place where I have lived, I behaved my self as an obedient Subject, and when there was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection by the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy</hi> men, I went out in my own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, though I had Servants as well as others, purely out of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to His Majesty, knowing that in the peace of His Government I should have peace, and so I went out hazarded my Life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued out till all was quiet. I was at a neighbors house drinking of a cup of Beer on Tuesday night in the Kitching alone, save onely the man of the house and the maid; these men came in, one <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Riggs</hi> that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the witnesses against me, there was <hi>Riggs</hi> and <hi>Hills</hi> and this <hi>Stubbs,</hi> and on <hi>Beazeley</hi>; and I being alone in the Kitchin, they asked for one <hi>Gibbs</hi>; the people of the house told me there were some Gentlemen would speak with me, I wished them to direct them to me, and they came to me; and through the ignorance of the Law, which it seems runs thus, If any words treasonable against his Majesty is spoken, it is Treason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, so thus I have given you in part the cause of my being here</p>
                     <p>Hereupon information was given to the Kings Majesty, that I should say there would be a Rising, and that <hi>Al-hollows</hi> Eve was the time; that there were arms sent into the Countrey, and that <hi>Ludlow</hi> was to be General; and this was charged upon me by the Kings Majesty when I came before him to be examined: and upon <hi>Hills,</hi> and <hi>Rigg's</hi> Oath, I was sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and kept a long time a Prisoner, examined three or four times over by the Lords

of his Majesties Council, I have one word more; As touching my Judgement, I am reputed in the world to be one of those that is called by the name of <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> a name of dirision and scorn, One is an <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> one an <hi>Independent,</hi> one a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> one this, and one that, and one the other, who gave these nick-names to Christians? There is but one God, one Lord Jesus, one Baptism, one Hope of Glory: How comes the Body of Christ, or the Members of Christ to be called these nick-names? But now, as I am one that do profess Faith in God through the Lord Jesus Christ, and do stand before you all, and before the Lord, I know no other God, but the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Living God, that hath made the World, and that Rules and Raigns, and disposes all his Creatures; I do believe in this God, he has been gracious to me a poor sinner, &amp; to all poor sinners, that when we by reason of sin had forfeited all our mercies, and were under wrath and everlasting destruction, and must perish for ever; that God did out of his rich grace and tender mercies give his onely begotten Son, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise, to be the blessing of God to the poor Gentiles according as the Scripture did declare; the Scriprure foreseeing that God would justifie the heathens through faith, preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gospel to <hi>Abraham,</hi> saying, In thee shall all the Nations of the earth be blessed: he spe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

I say, Jesus Christ took our natures upon him, and for this very end to do the will of his heavenly Father, <hi>Lo it is written in the volume of thy b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

laid on him the iniquity of us all, and he hath born our grief and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured our punishment, it made his soul cry out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, or else we must for ever be banished out of the presence of God, and never have any hopes of glory, of faith, or of salvation, had not the Son of God become our Mediatour and Surety, so there is one God, and one Mediatour, the Man Christ Jesus. He gave himself a ransom for all our sins, to free us from the wrath to come, everlasting destruction, and from the worm that never dies. O that we could ever be thankful to God, live to him that hath so loved us, as to send his Son to die for us, and is by the almighty power of God raised from the dead, and now sits at the right hand of God, and ever lives to make intercession.</p>
                     <p>Truly friends, this is not the love of man, but the love of God, and therefore eternal love. God so loved the world; it is Gods love, he loved sinners, ungodly ones; he did so love them as to give his onely begotten Son to save them, to reconcile them, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, to redeem them from wrath to come: it was to seek and save them that were lost. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. We all like sheep had gone astray, and must perish in our sins, had not the Lord Jesus been sent of his Father, out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to declare the good will of God, and did it, by which we are sanctified through the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ; and this Lord Jesus Christ the eternal Son of God, he is the Mediatour between God and poor sinners. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, says Christ, and I will give you rest; now this grace is from God, we are saved by grace, and that not of our selves, it is the gift of God, through faith in Christ we are saved; and all things that do pertain to life and godliness it is the gift of God; now all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto him. Would you know the forgiveness of your sins, your peace with God, and that God is well pleased with you? God is reconciled by Jesus Christ unto you, and does not impute your sins unto you, but looks on the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ as satisfaction, that thereby you might have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66344:40"/>
of your sins through the bloud of Christ. Be it known unto all men, that through this mans preaching, the forgiveness of sins, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. and by him all that do believe are justified from all things, from which they could not be by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; now justification from sin, and redemption from iniquity, is through the knowledge of Christs death for your sins, and his resurrection, and now there is no other name given under heaven whereby we can be saved but by the name of Jesus, and whosoever believeth in his name shall not perish, but have everlasting life, <hi>Ioh.</hi>

It is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jesus Christ, it is his word, and hope you will search the Scriptures, and look into those things for your souls good, when Christ says Verily, verily, I say unto you; He that heareth my words and believeth them, he hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death to life. The reason why God does assure poor sinners they shall not pass into everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and perish, is through his rich grace; through his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, for he hath promised, he will be merciful to our iniquities, and our sins will remember no more; and these his promises of grace which are all Yea and Amen in Christ, are ratified by the bloud of Christ; the bloud of Christ is this bloud of the New Covenant, and it is that by which we have the forgiveness, remission and cleansing of all our sins,</p>

                     <p>I shall speak a word or two as to the knowledge of forgiveness of sins, by and through Jesus Christ; and so the knowledge of the Resurrection of the dead, it is the fruit of Jesus Christ; for by the first man came death, and by the second man Christ came life, and God that has by his exceeding great and mighty power, raised up Jesus Christ from the grave and power of sin, he also shall raise us up by the same power, and when he comes again the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, at his appearing and coming, we shall see him, and be made like to him, and he will receive us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; he is gone to prepare a place for us, and in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house are many mansions, and if it were not so, he would have told us: and now God that hath given eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and forgiveness of sins unto his poor servants, he will also, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, receive him into his everlasting glory, which is my faith, expectation and hope, in God through Jesus Christ. A man may bear his infirmities, but a wounded conscience who can bear? when God smites, who can bear? and therefore I desire, as I believe the forgiveness of all my sins, through the rich Grace of God, through the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of Jesus Christ his Son; every one must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God, and as their Works are, so will their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be, either accepted by God, as workers of Christ, or condemned, as workers of iniquity. Last of all, as to the separated Congregations to whom I belong; I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in those few daies that I have lived, there is a great deal of animosity, evil will, hard censuring, and abusing the pretious Saints of Jesus Christ. If they are in an error, you that are in the truth instruct them, and you may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them out of the claws of the Divel: Are you Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and have the light of God in your souls? O then strengthen your brethren, do not give them nick-names,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66344:41"/>
and abuse them; that's not the way, Christ teaches ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesson, <hi>That if thine enemy hunger you should feed them, and if he be a thirsty give him drink</hi>; we should pray to the Lord that he would turn those that be out of his way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right way.</p>

fear him; and the Lord knows my heart, I speak it in his presence, that had the King been pleased to shew mercy to me, I should have been a faithful and true subject to him all my daies, but seeing it is the righteous hand of God, that now I am come to this untimely death, I desire you to lift up your hearts and souls to God with me, that when my soul shall leave this body, that the Lord Jesus Christ may with his everlasting arms receive me to glory: There is no redemption after death, we shall either go to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal woe or eternal happiness, therefore good friends, I desire you to look up to God, that when my soul departs it may be received to glory.</p>

O Lord, we are now going, I hope, to an estate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, where we shall sin and sorrow no more, but where we shall ever reign with Iesus Christ. O Lord had we not some hopes, had we not some sight of the Lord Iesus Christ made known to our souls, we durst not appear before thee this day, we durst not stand before thee in thy presence: O that thou wouldest
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66344:43"/>
more and more manifest thy gracious presence with me; that thou wouldst uphold me to take this bitter cup &amp; drink it freely. O Lord, I desire to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; I have been a great sinner before thee, but Iesus Christ has died, is risen, and is now at the right hand of his Father, making intercession for us. And good Lord, as thou hast commanded us to come unto thee, and to believe in thee, and hast said, thou wilt in no wise cast off the soul that comes unto thee, in confidence of that hope, I desire to fix my soul upon thee before I go hence, and be no more. Bow down the heavens, O Lord, and hear the requests of the poor soul before thee, and I beseech thee for Christ his sake, as thou wouldst forgive me, so freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all men that have done evil against me. Be pleased to let the Kings Majestie reign in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and holiness; put a spirit of power and might in his soul, and let him see wherein the stability of his Crown lies, in following Righteousness &amp; Iustice and Iudgement, and preserving of that Truth that is made known to him out of the book of the Lord. Come down, Lord, to his Soul, and let him see wherein is his hope, and O that he may at last live and reign with Iesus Christ for evermore. Good Lord look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, I am coming unto thee, these are my last words. O that thou wouldst be pleased to receive us this day, that we may dine with thee in Paradise; make known thy everlasting kindness to my soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go hence and be no more, that I may receive that comfort and satisfaction which I have longed and looked for. Lord my hope is in thee, thou wilt not fail them that put their trust in thee, in thee is my trust and confidence; if I perish, I will perish at

the feet of Iesus Christ. O that thou wouldst humble me, and seal up the pardon of my sins before I go hence, and let thy Son Iesus Christ manifest his gracious presence with me, and cloath me with that wedding garment of his righteousness, and then take me into his arms, and present me to his Father. O that thou wouldst be pleased to strengthen and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me under this great stroke which thou hast been pleased to inflict upon me; I kiss the rod, &amp; receive it thankefully from thy hand. I had been undone to all eternity, hadst thou not afflicted me, blessed be thy Name, that thou hast been pleased to send Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, upon him I depend, upon him I cast my confidence, who is the rock of ages, and never failed any that came to him. Hear me and answer me, and do for me and all thy Churches &amp; people abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above what I can ask or think, and all for the sake of the Lord Iesus Christ, to whom with thy self and thy holy Spirit be all honour, power and praise henceforth and for evermore.

                  <p>O Eternal, everliving and everloving God, who art a reconciled and loving Father, unto thy poor unworthy Creatures before thee; and unto all the children, whom thou hast called to believe in thee. O Lord, this is no small priviledge that sinful dust and ashes, mortal worms, should have to do and to deal with so holy and infinite a God, as thou art, to make requests unto thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the vast disproportion that there is between thee, and poor sinners: Thou art of purer eyes, then to behold any unclean thing in thy presence, O Lord. We our selves are nothing but polluted rags and fountains of uncleanness, from the crown of the head, to the sole of the foot; all the faculties of the soul and members of the body, are all members of unrighteousness. Were it not therefore, that thou hast been pleased to give us good hopes, and found out a way to hold communion with us, which is through the Lord Jesus; in whom thou art well pleased, in whom thou hast spoke forgiveness of sins to our souls, we durst not now stand before thee; but thou hast promised, that though our sins are as scarlet, thou wilt make them as white as snow; and though they be as crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, thou wilt make them as wool. Thou hast opened a fountain of free-grace, and eternal mercy for poor sinners; that through the blood of the Lord Jesus, they may receive remission, forgiveness, cleansing and purging from all their sins. Thou hast laid an all-sufficient help upon him, who is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God by him. We have nothing of our selves to bring unto God, but sins to pardon, and unclean souls to purge: Thou hast been pleased to give thy Son, and together with him, freely to give us all things: Thou hast given thy poor servant before thee,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66344:45"/>
faith that has brought salvation to his soul: Thou hast saved him by thy free-grace; not of works, but through the mercies and blood of Jesus Christ; and hast sprinkled the vertue of the blood of Christ in his conscience, in the belief of the truth, as it is in Jesus. O blessed be thy Name, that sent him to seek, and to save us from condemnation; who is risen with healing in his wings, and hast set Christ before us, that we should behold him, that our sins have pierced. Certainly, great was that disease that needed such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; that nothing could expiate and take away our sins, and blot out the hand-writing that was against us, but the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, as of a Lamb without spot; he is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our peace, who has made peace for us, through the blood of that his Cross, and has made twain, one in himself, Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. He was delivered up for our offences, and rose again for our justification: We in the knowledge of him, being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And blessed be thy Name, O merciful God, that has made such a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of everlasting grace to poor sinners, and the children that do believe in thee, through Jesus Christ. Thou hast said, thou wilt be merciful to all our iniquities and sins, and wilt remember them no more: These are thy promises, and they are all Yea and Amen in Christ Jesus. Thou hast made thy servant to hear thy voice in thy Son: Thou hast been a merciful God to him, and forgiven him all his sins, and justified him freely through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. Who shall condemn us, or lay any thing to our charge? It is God that justifies, who gave himself a ransom for our sins, died for our sins, is risen again, and now sits at the right hand of God, ever living and making intercession for us; whose blood speaks better things, then the blood of <hi>Abel</hi>: His blood cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vengeance, but the blood of Christ cries for peace and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness. God is in Christ reconciling himself unto the world, not imputing their trespasses: He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Blessed be thy Name, that thou hast sent thy holy Childe Jesus, to be the propitiation, not onely for our sins, but for the sins of the whole world. He hath suffered the just for the unjust, that he might bring us unto God. O do thou therefore help thy poor servants before thee, and all thy children: Give us to see the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66344:45"/>
of eternal death, by the death of the Lord Jesus. Let us see thee at peace with us, and justifying of us, through thy grace. All have sinned, and come short of thy glory; but being justified through the redemption of Christ Jesus, whom God hath let form to be a propitiation for the sins of the whole world. Thou hast promised, that whosoever believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ, thy grace, thy mercy, thy love shall not perish, but have everlasting life; and thou hast given to thy poor servant exceeding great and precious promises, and by thy own Spirit, bringing home these premises, given him to believe the Records thou hast given of thy Son; which beareth witness, That God is reconciled to him, and well pleased with him in Christ Jesus, and given him eternal life. And seeing thou hast hid his soul in Jesus Christ, when he shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then shall we appear with him in glory, and be made like to our Lord Jesus Christ: By the same power that thou raisest up Jesus Christ from the dead, by the same power thou art able to subdue all things. There is nothing impossible with God; what ever thou hast promised, shall be performed; Heaven and Earth shall pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but one title of thy word shall not fail: And therefore blessed be thy Name, that thou hast revealed these things to thy poor and unworthy Creature; that thou art his God and Father; that thou wilt never leave him, nor forsake him; and thou hast hid his life in Christ, and wrote his name in the Book of Jesus Christ; and he rejoyceth that he knows he is his, who is the onely true God: Knows thou art well pleased with him, and justified him freely from all his sins, accepted him, in and through the Lord Jesus Christ. O therefore, dear Father, do thou receive his soul according to thy promise, that he may be thine, and thou his God. O blessed Father, do thou be pleased to do good to all thy people: And now, dear Father, take care of our families, be thou a Husband to our yoke-fellows, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the fatherless: Do them good abundantly above what we are able to ask or think; and what is wanting, and lost by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, do thou hand out to them, thy mercy and grace, and move the hearts of the children of men, to do them good: Be thou their God, help them, and provide for them: Seal up thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them, not onely for this life, but for the life to come. Do good to our Magistrates; thou who hast the hearts of all men,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66344:46"/>
make such as are about them, men fearing God, and hating covetousness, that may judge for God, that he may have glory. O be pleased to let His Majesty rule and reign in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; let His Throne be established in righteousness, and reveal the choicest of thy blessings to His poor soul: Manifest Christ Jesus, and him crucified to Him; and give Him to see the most precious blood of Christ, cleansing Him from all sins. Binde up His soul in the bundle of everlasting life; crown Him with a crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, as well as with an earthly Crown: Let Him be a Nursing Father, and Nursing Mother, indeed, to this Nation; that He may hate the evil doer, and be a praise to them that do well. Do good to every one of us; O help us, that we may first seek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. First, believe in God, and then honor our King: First, fear God and serve him, and then give to <hi>Cesar,</hi> that which is <hi>Cesars.</hi> Give unto the King, that which is the Kings; give Him all obedience to live quietly in all godliness and honesty. And now, O Lord, do thou take away that spirit of emulation, and strife, and malice; From whence comes wars? come they not from our lusts? The Lord remove pride, prejudice, and malice from us, and cause us to love one another: The Lord teach every one in their places, to walk continually, to the glory and praise of God; that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the name of Christians, may be enabled to walk humbly and meekly; to do good, to walk uprightly, and to love mercy, and then certainly we may expect that blessing that God hath promised to them that believe in him, which is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

O Lord help us, that we may die in the love of Jesus Christ: And good Lord, we desire that thou would look in mercy upon him that is the Officer and Executioner of these poor worms; and as he is to wash his hands in our blood, O Lord wash his soul in the blood of the Lamb of God. Father, thou knowest we desire the good of his soul; we forgive him; and we desire to forgive every one. And dear Lord, we desire thee to look upon the King, communicate the riches of thy mercy unto his Majesty; we desire his soul may be saved; thou hast the hearts of all Kings in thy hand, draw forth his heart, that he may love those things that pleaseth thee, and love them which thou lovest; Let him be established in righteousness, and let Justice and Judgment run down the streets of <hi>England</hi> as a mighty stream. We pray thee to carry forth our souls to pray for every Relation; beget Love in all sorts of people, that they may live the life of Love, that when they depart this life, they may enjoy the blessed Comforter, the Lord Jesus Christ. And, dear Lord, thou art pleased to give us a taste of thy love this day; Lord thou hast given us a pardon blessed be thy Majesty for it; thou hast given us a reprieve for our souls, we are delivered from death to life, we hope when we depart this world, we shall meet them with Jesus Christ, we shall enjoy those blessed Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all eternity.

Look in mercy upon all the
