            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </list>
            <p>SINCE the Reſpondents printed their Caſe, there is a Paper come
abroad, Entituled, <hi>The Caſe of the Dutcheſs of</hi> Albemarle <hi>and Mr.</hi>
Monk, <hi>againſt the Earl of</hi> Bathe, <hi>and others Reſpondents,</hi> wherein the
Author declares, the general <hi>Queſtion</hi> to be, Whether the Deed of
1681, or the Will of <hi>July</hi> 87, in Eqnity ought to be conſtrued to be
the true Settlement of the Duke's Eſtate.</p>
            <p>And then complains, the Decretal Order only declares, That the
Court ſaw no Cauſe in Equity, to relieve the Appellants, at which the
Author is greatly offended; and ſaith, <hi>The Court ought to have given a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why they ſaw no cauſe to relieve.</hi> This is certainly an Original; for no
one before did ever expect a Reaſon why another could not ſee a thing that
did not appear.</p>
            <p>But in the next place he arreigns the Lord Keeper and Judges for taking
it to be a Good <hi>Deed; Whereas,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>only the Fact was tryed, and
the Verdict ought to be no farther Evidence, than that the Duke executed the
Deed.</hi> If the Deed was found by Verdict, to be well executed, as the Au-
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35596:2"/>
Author admits, wherein was the Iniquity of the Court to take it to be a good
Deed. But rather why doth the Author, after he admits it to be the <hi>Dukes
Deed,</hi> ſtuff the reſt of the <hi>Paper</hi> with ſo many Libellous Matters; as tho the
<hi>Deed</hi> had never been Executed. The Plain Reaſon of it is; Becauſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hopes to amuſe ſome by bold Reflections, altho nothing to the Point,
which he himſelf makes to be a Queſtion in Equity the Law being agree'd
by himſelf, to be againſt the Appellants, his Points, of Surprize, Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Reſulting Truſt, remain only Points in Equity; ſo that the
Libellous part being determin'd at Law, where the Reſpondents had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Witneſſes than thoſe in <hi>Chancery,</hi> they need not here Anſwer
what they there confuted out of any reſpect to their Cauſe. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
not to ſuffer ſuch ſcurrilous Reflections to remain unanſwer'd: They
ſay, that they cannot but wonder to ſee the Author again to mention the
Raſure in the Date of the <hi>Deed,</hi> as though there was ſome very ill Practice
therein, whereas the Date is not Material, ſo as it was Sealed at any time,
either before, or after, and it is not to be ſuppoſed that any one ſhuuld do
an ill thing for no End, but the Raſure is plain and viſible, and not done with
Art, to deceive, but always ownd, and fully provd to be before the Scaling.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The <hi>Writer</hi> ſwears it done by him ten years before, and that he never
ſaw it under Seal, untill he ſaw it at the Examiners Office, at his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
in this Cauſe.</item>
               <item>II. Mr. <hi>Croft</hi>'s, who read the ſame at the firſt opening, doth ſwear, The
Room being dark, he by miſtake read it 82; but at the ſame time
corrected himſelf: And it was then handed about, and agreed to be 81.
And it ſtands now as it was then.<note place="margin">Anſwers to the Raſure in the Date of the Deed of 81.</note>
               </item>
               <item>III. Mr. <hi>Aleman,</hi> one of the Witneſſes, went beyond Sea in <hi>September</hi>
81, and had a Paſs from the <hi>Secretary</hi> of State, which he produced of
that Date, aud poſitively ſwears it was before he went.</item>
               <item>IV. All the Witneſſes ſwear it was in <hi>Albemarle's</hi> Houſe, which was ſold
before 82.</item>
               <item>V. Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer</hi> took an Abſtract thereof before the Duke went to
<hi>Jamaica,</hi> where it is plainly mentioned to bear Date, as now it appears
in <hi>July,</hi> 1681.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The next thing quarrell'd at is, that the Earl by his Anſwer ſaith, he
knew not who writ the Deed, and what wonder is it, if a Perſon that
had been concern'd in ſuch variety, and multiplicity of Buſineſs, as the Earl
was, ſhould not after ſo great a length of time as ten years, call to mind
who it was that did a particular thing.</p>
            <p>The next Reproach that is therein repeated, doth rather ſhew the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
than Diſcretion of the Author, for he cannot but remember that the
Seal-Cutter ſwears that Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bathe</hi>'s Secretary helped him
him to many Cuſtomers, and that it is about 28 years ſince he cut two
Seals, one for the Earl of <hi>Bathe,</hi> and this of the Duke of <hi>Albemarl</hi>'s,
for which the Earl of <hi>Bathe</hi> paid him; and this they would have to be a
Seal prepared only for the Sealing of this Deed, and kept by the Earl for
ſuch purpoſe; but it was proved.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35596:2"/>
               <item>I. That Duke <hi>George</hi> uſed this as his Seal, by many Inſtruments produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the <hi>Tryal,</hi> that had been kept by the Parties from the time they
received them from his Hand.</item>
               <item>II. Marthew Look <hi>
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the old Duke's Secretary ſwore,</hi> That he kept the
ſame Seal many Years in the Old Duke's Time, and deliver'd it to
his Son, the laſt <hi>Duke,</hi> after his death.</item>
               <item>III. That there were many Inſtruments alſo produced at the Tryal made by
Duke <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> under the ſame Seal.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And ſurely after ſuch Proof to renew this Reflection, is very malicious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> quarrels with the Unlawyer-like Pening of the <hi>Deed</hi> of 81.
But by whom was it done? was it not by Sr. <hi>Thomas Stringer,</hi> the Dukes
<hi>Councel?</hi> And if good in Law, ſhall his Informalities make it void in Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
That ſurely they will not agree; for then what would become of
their <hi>Will</hi> of 87. Their own great <hi>Oracle</hi> had his <hi>Blunders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How comes it to paſs (unleſs to ſhew the Duke was not in earneſt)
That by that <hi>Will,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>I. The Remainder of all the Eſtate is limited to the <hi>Regecide Iſſue,</hi> whom
the Duke made it his great Concern to exclude from Inheriting what
came from the <hi>Crown.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. How comes is that the Duke, after he had given his <hi>Heir at Law</hi>
5000 l. abſolutely by the <hi>Will</hi> of 75, gives it by this only upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That ſhe Releaſe her Right to 500 l. <hi>per Ann.</hi> her <hi>paternal</hi> Eſtate,
and to <hi>Pudridg</hi> the Capital Seat, where the Duke had laid out 16000 l.
in Building. This could not be in Earneſt.</item>
                  <item>III. How comes he to enjoyne Mr. <hi>Monke</hi> to make that his Habitation, could
he think his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Daughter would ſo eaſily give up what ſhe had by
Settlement from her Father, Duke <hi>George</hi>'s elder Brother? That is no
more to be imagined than that the Duke really intended it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this the <hi>Appellants</hi> will ſay, Altho Mrs. <hi>Pride</hi>'s Father to
keep the Eſtate in his Name, ſetled thoſe Lands, <hi>from his own Daughter,</hi> on
his Brother Duke <hi>George</hi> in tayl Male, with the remainder to his Daughter;
yet the Dukes might have ſuffered a Recovery, and then the Deviſe to Mr.
<hi>Monke</hi> would have been good: And however they out of Honour would not
do ſo ungrateful a thing. Yet in regard they could have done it if they ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that now in favor of the Deviſe his Intent appearing thereby, <hi>Equity</hi>
ſhall ſupply both the <hi>Recovery</hi> in this Caſe, and the <hi>Revocation</hi> in the
other. But God forbid ſuch dangerous <hi>Doctrine</hi> ſhould take place.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Paper declining to contend the Reality of the Deed,
and labouring only to perſwade, that in Equity Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> without Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or Merit, ought to have Preference to the Duke of <hi>Albemarl's</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and not the Reſpondents: The Reſpondents forbear to anſwer the
ſame, but refer to their Printed Caſe, and doubt not but every impartial
Reader will agree, that if they have the beſt Title at Law, they ought
not in Juſtice or Equity to be further diſquietd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35596:3"/>
But the Author having in the beginning of theſe Sutes, rais'd and ſpread
thoſe ſcandalous Reports, doth now even againſt his own Conviction (the
Appellants acquieſſing in the Verdict, and not denying the Deed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſiſting on Equity) maliciouſly revive the ſame.</p>
            <p>And the Reſpondents hope, That as they have been vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt that foul Imputation of Forgery, by a Verdict
at Law; and of that of Surprize, and Concealment, by
a Decree in <hi>Chancery;</hi> after full deliberation, they ſhall
now be diſmiſſed by this <hi>Noble Houſe,</hi> and repared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
