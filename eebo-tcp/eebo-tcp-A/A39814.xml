            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A CHARACTER OF A TRUE PHYSICIAN.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> True <hi>Physician</hi> is one unto whom <hi>God</hi> hath opened the eyes of his mind, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated the properties of things, as he did to <hi>Adam,</hi> before the fall; and to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> upon his begging of Wisdom; and unto <hi>Baza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> for the Glory of his Name, in <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Or a True <hi>Physician</hi> is one whom <hi>God</hi> hath qualified with a longing desire to know Nature, in her operations, Integrity, and defects, and how they may be amended.</p>
            <p>For which he doth ask, seek, and knock in a right way, not at the doors of <hi>Aristotle</hi> or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> with diligence, patience and constancy, till it be given and opened unto him; his heart is not set upon gain, but out of charity to the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, he doth persist in this pursuit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the mercifull <hi>God</hi> hears him, and gives
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65768:3"/>
him what he seeks for: Then having received his <hi>Talent,</hi> he doth not bury it in a napkin, but doth improve it, untill with it he gain 2, and with them 5 and with them 10; and then he doth not seek to get worldly Honour, Riches and Fame, so much as the good of those he undertakes; nor is he startled at the sad Catalogue of incurable <hi>diseases,</hi> which the Proud fond usurping School-Doctors have most shamefully compiled; but he by his Noble <hi>Balsamic Medicines,</hi> is able to overcome, as the valiant <hi>Champion</hi> is reported to have conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the devouring monster. He, <hi>viz. (A Son of Art)</hi> knows how by his <hi>Chymick</hi> Art, to prepare either Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral, so as their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be separated from all gross Adherents, that it may be an apt <hi>Medicine</hi> to perform what <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Nature</hi> hath granted to it.</p>
            <p>But this his Art and knowledge, is not such as he sucks from the Schools, but such as is applicable to Action, the other being but <hi>mere empty shadows</hi> or <hi>meer ornaments</hi> at best.</p>
            <p>But this his <hi>Art</hi> consists in the knowledge of <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>generation;</hi> for, he that knows the wayes of <hi>Generation,</hi> will easily come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the true <hi>menstruum</hi> of Bodies, which in the Art of preparing <hi>Medicines</hi> is most usefull.</p>
            <p>For every thing that <hi>Nature</hi> affords for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence and health of <hi>Man,</hi> is crude, and needs a further digestion, before it can be converted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the substance of Man, or into a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Medicine; so that a <hi>Physician</hi> ought to be so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65768:3"/>
skill'd in <hi>Nature</hi>'s path, as to imitate and assist <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that all crude bodies, in order to <hi>Medicine,</hi> may without the kitchin of the stomach be set to putrify, to be digested and so dissolved, that their spiritual nature may after that solution, be easily extracted and taken out of them; and so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the several parts of the body.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose <hi>Chymistry</hi> serves; for, by the help of this Art, we know how to digest, to dissolve, to putrify, to separate the pure from the impure, and so to come by perfect <hi>Medicines:</hi> For all bodies, more or less, partake of the grosness and terrestriety of their <hi>Matrixes;</hi> but after their principles are separated from that terrestriety ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering, which they drew from their <hi>Matrixes,</hi> they make it plain enough by their powerfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that it is to this state they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, before they can work with efficacy, and yet they still retain their <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>Internal Idea.</hi> Thus will a little quantity of such a well prepared <hi>Medicine</hi> manifest its self, in the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full operating and assisting of <hi>Nature,</hi> to cast off her enemies <hi>(viz.</hi> Diseases) with speed and safety.</p>
            <p>But verily so great and precious a blessing as this, <hi>God</hi> never bestows nor imparts to any of those fraudulent Tyrants, who would limit the Holy one of <hi>Israel,</hi> and stop and stifle those noble improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Physick,</hi> which themselves neither do, nor can understand, whilst they remain proud usurpers and worshippers of <hi>Mammon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Give ear, you <hi>Pedantick Galenists,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65768:4"/>
               <hi>Chymicophants,</hi> of the pretended Colledge, who persecute this Divine Science, and the Professours thereof; give ear, I say, and tell me with what conscience can you prosess your selves to be <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,</hi> seeing that all Medicines or Physick are without <hi>Chymistry,</hi> imperfect; Without that <hi>Chymistry,</hi> I say, which out of the Manifest Light of Nature hath its invincible Grounds and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, laid down in those, excellent Writings of the <hi>Hermetick</hi> Philosophers; for,</p>
            <p>This is the only Art (which by supplying us out of the Light of Nature, with convenient means and particular Natures to separate the pure from the impure) will teach us; first how to heal all the Diseases of the <hi>Macrocosmicall</hi> substances, and afterwards by examples and experiments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from those exteriour Cures, will shew us the right and infallible cure of all <hi>Diseases</hi> in our own Bodies.</p>
            <p>He that knows not how to purge and heal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, how can he restore the decay'd or weakned Radical <hi>Balsam</hi> in Man, and repair it by comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and concordant <hi>Medicines,</hi> to perform per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly all its appointed functions; which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be put into action, before any Disease can be expelled: he that knows not what that is in <hi>Antimony,</hi> which purges <hi>Gold,</hi> how can he come by an effectual and wholesom Medicine that will purge and cast out those extrarious peccant causes that afflict and destroy he Body of Man? He that knows not how to fix <hi>Arsenick,</hi> or to take away the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65768:4"/>
corrosive nature of Sublimate, or to coagulate sulphureous spirits, and by a convenient speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical <hi>Medium</hi> to break and dissolve stones in the greater World, will never in the Body of Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and tame the Arsenicall Spirits of the <hi>Microseo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic Salt,</hi> nor take away venemous indispositions of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> nor dissolve the Stone in the Bladder, and drive it out being dissolved. Now, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Philosophers, who knew Nature indeed, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their noble Medicines by the strict &amp; exact observations of Nature in her own path; how that kind was multiplied by kind, and without putrefaction there could be no generation; and as they found out excellent Medicines, by doing all things in the Metallick Kingdom, according to the possibility of nature: so if you would have <hi>A Medicine,</hi> indeed, although inferiour to theirs, whether of the <hi>Mineral, Animal,</hi> or <hi>Vegetable</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, you must proceed in the same method; for as I said before, as <hi>kind is multiplied by kind,</hi> and not without putrefaction; so if we will exalt any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete to make it a friendly <hi>Medicine,</hi> whether Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, Animal, or Mineral, it must be in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's path, <hi>kind with kind,</hi> and that by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, let me compare Notes, and examine the Modern <hi>Goose-quil</hi> Doctor by the Chymist, to see unto which the name <hi>Quack</hi> belongs; for, so they call all other <hi>Physicians,</hi> that are not of their Tribe of <hi>Pedants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this, give me leave to make use of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65768:5"/>
that worthy Philosopher Dr. <hi>G. Starkey,</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Nature</hi>'s <hi>Explication,</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi>'s <hi>Vindication, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, saith he, the whole of a real or pretended <hi>Physician,</hi> may be referr'd to these two Heads, namely <hi>the knowledge of the Diseases, and the finding out the Remedy: The latter of which, is either Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retically to know the Medicine, or practically to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, prepare, and apply the same.</hi> Then first of all, we differ from the <hi>Goose-quil Doctor</hi> or Tribe, in the Theoretical Discovery of <hi>Diseases;</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the Practical Cure of them. Now, as to the <hi>Theory</hi> of Diseases, and the Philosophicall Contemplation of <hi>Simples,</hi> it is not essential to a <hi>Physician;</hi> for a Man may know the Remedies by which a <hi>Disease</hi> is cured, and yet erre very much in the Discovery of the cause. And now I think on't, I must desire the Pedantick Methodist, to tell me where the Seats and Seeds of Diseases are; and whether they do not mistake, and take a <hi>Cause</hi> for an <hi>Effect,</hi> and an <hi>Effect</hi> for a <hi>Cause.</hi> But to our former Discourse; the Remedy being to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, as water to fire, which will undoubtedly quench it: and as a Man may know certainly by water to quench fire, and yet erre in the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick apprehension of the same; so may a Man by a proper Remedy, rightly prepar'd, and in due proportion apply'd, certainly cure the Disease, and he able to distinguish the same generally, though he be not able to find out and apprehend the manner of its originall, with its occasional
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65768:5"/>
causes, progress, and variation. So then the Absolute things requisite in one that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably undertake the Sick, are first to know how to unlock those Medicines, which the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> hath created, and how to prepare them, and when, and to whom to apply them; and how to order and dispose the Patient so, as that he may reap that good from them, which by careful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of them is expected.</p>
            <p>For every Artist is properly to be judged by his Works, and not by his words; for, whatever is meerly notional, are but vain <hi>Chymeras,</hi> unworthy for a serious Man to busy his time in learning, lest he <hi>Imbrace a cloud for Juno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the misery of our Schools and <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,</hi> that the one teach <hi>barely words,</hi> and the other <hi>bare notions;</hi> which indeed are nothing but empty shadows; for he that seeks to <hi>Apply</hi> them to practice, beyond vain Disputation, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further. Away then with all those foolish, though specious pretences and curiosities, by which a Man is never the nearer any practical verity.</p>
            <p>So then, <hi>Medicine</hi> is the Art of healing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing all defects, to which Mankind is subject to, in reference to the Body.</p>
            <p>And healing or curing, is taking care of the Sick, and applying such Medicines, with dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for ordering the Patient, that Recovery may be with speed and safety.</p>
            <p>And this Restoring of the Sick, is a grand mark

of a <hi>True Son of Art;</hi> it's his <hi>Diploma,</hi> by which he appears to be one created of <hi>God,</hi> and not by the Schools; for their Creatures they adorn with empty titles, and <hi>God</hi> graceth his with real abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>But as Dr. <hi>Huybert</hi> saith in his Book, called the <hi>Corner Stone, There is such adoe about this fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Cap, called a Doctor of Physick, that I could wish,</hi> saith he, <hi>that it might be despised, by the People of</hi> England; <hi>for if they knew so well as I do, of how light esteem it is beyond Sea, and how easy to be gain'd, so many would not dote, as they have done, upon so many that run loose from being School-Masters, or Preachers, or University Men, in</hi> England, <hi>to be made Doctors at</hi> Leyden, <hi>and the like places beyond Sea; and by reading of a few Books and prating, intrude into a Calling, which is not to be acquired but by Years of labour and study, of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental, not School Philosophy. And truly such Men ought to be ordained of</hi> God <hi>in Nature for that purpose; for, of the other tatling book Doctors, the world is too full of. And too many of them have crept in, from time to time, to be principal Fellows; of the pretended Colledge, to which they have been, and are admitted, upon producing a</hi> Diploma, <hi>with good store of white and yellow metallick seals to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the publick Seal of the University to the</hi> Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>which they obtain for about ten pound, and the answering of a few slight questions about Doctrine and method.</hi>

And now, to set up his Trade, he begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult <hi>Nurses, Midwives, and the Interests of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and acquaint himself with an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">See the Book <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> written by an Apothecary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Doctors.</note> who usually furnishes him a room or two <hi>gratis,</hi> (and this must be consider'd in the <hi>Apothecary</hi>'s Bills) he must also be attended on by his Servants, and by the Mistress into the bargain, if necessity urgeth: And now, besides his Fees, he must <hi>go-snips</hi> with the <hi>Apothecary</hi> in his gains, as about 5 shillings or a Noble the pound. And this way the <hi>Pedant</hi> may come by Money to buy a little coach and pair of Horses; and thus going to visit a Patient, the half piece is but ill taken, and pop'd into the left pocket, and possibly may cause the Patient to send to his worship, before he shall see his face again, to the hazard of another Angel: But this must be done with a <hi>Diploma</hi> in his pocket to authorize the Fop.</p>
            <p>But it becomes not them (as worthy Dr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamont Nedham</hi> saith) to set their hands to work, to attain a true knowledge of mixt Bodies by <hi>Chymicall Anatomy.</hi> No, no, their Sectators ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they should wrong their Gravity, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral state, to defile and foul their fists with the blackness of charcoal. No, now he must make it part of his business to inquire what Practitioners are about the City, and who hath most Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whether such Men are <hi>Chymists,</hi> and who are of the Tribe, and who not. And as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65768:7"/>
many as they can hear of, that are any whit Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for doing <hi>Good</hi> in their Generation, then to mark such Men on the back with the black coal of Ignorance and Envy, in all Ale-Houses, Coffee-Houses and Taverns, where they frame Discourses of such Men; and the best word they have for them is, <hi>Quack, Empirick Mountebanck Illiterate cheat, &amp;c.</hi> and if there be any notorious <hi>ignoramus,</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that Noble Faculty of <hi>Physick</hi> about the City, other Men must becompar'd with them, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd all alike. But, by your leave, <hi>Mr. Pedant,</hi> 'tis apparently manifest, that the greatest part of your Colledge, are equally ignorant in the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> to your Brother <hi>Dunce Jones</hi> of <hi>Moorfields,</hi> and <hi>Hatten Garden,</hi> and <hi>Gray</hi> the <hi>Q.</hi> with which Paper sculs, some of your Brethren have folded me in their pittyfull Broad-side, Intituled <hi>Some Reasons of the present Decay of the Practise of Physick in learned approv'd Doctors, by A. B. C. D. Doctor</hi> and <hi>Apothecary</hi> truly so called. And thus the Younger Fry spend their time, never seeking any further into the knowledge of things; but rest in their meer received traditional Doctrine, and phantastick opinions wrap'd up in general conclusions and definitions, grounded upon meer pretended principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the courses of the <hi>Chymical</hi> Philosophers have been, and are quite contrary; their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lies not in Philosophical Maxims, raised by meer Contemplation, but are perswaded, that Operation ought to be joyn'd to it, to attain full
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65768:7"/>
delight and satisfaction, and lay firm, sound and sure foundations to their Reasonings, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to build upon the quick-sands of vain, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and phantastick opinions; which makes them willing to undergo the charges, toil and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of practical <hi>Chymistry,</hi> the sooner to attain to a solid knowledge of the works of Nature, and find out by several Experiments of their works and process, the abstruse causes of her wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effect. For, it is a very difficult matter for any to attain to the exact knowledge of things Natural, without the guidance of <hi>Chymistry,</hi> and an acquaintance therewith: Neither can any be reckon'd a perfect <hi>Physician,</hi> without the help of <hi>Hermetick Philosophy;</hi> since it is the truest Ground of <hi>Physick,</hi> without which no Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can deserve any other name or title, than that of <hi>Emperick, or Quack; for it is not a Gown, nor Degrees taken in a University, which makes a Man</hi> a Physician, <hi>but a solid knowledge in Nature,</hi> grounded upon Reason, improved by long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Experience. And as the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> in his Preface to the Advancement of Learning makes <hi>Sense the surest Guide for our Understanding,</hi> in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovering the Secrets of Nature, and proves at large, that if we will have any sound knowledge of Nature, there is a necessity of deriving Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy <hi>from sensible Experiments,</hi> we must use our own Industry, and trust our own eyes and observations, because they produce to us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is certain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But let me a little inquire into some of the Writings, and complaints of some of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Colledge, when the great fudes were between them and the <hi>Apothecaries;</hi> for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they speak the sense of the whole. Doctor <hi>Merret</hi> in his <hi>Short View of the frauds and abuses committed by Apothecaries,</hi> pag. 7. thus writes:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In these ensuing Papers, I hope to prove</hi> (saith he) <hi>that these abuses complain'd of by all sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, arise from this cause;</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> Physicians <hi>dispence not themselves such Medicines as they use for the relief of the Sick, but commit this work to the</hi> Apothecaries, <hi>or rather to their Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Pag. 27.] <hi>The desire of most Persons, and the Censure of all wise men, is towards us, who say we are wanting to our own Interest, if we make not use of the Remedies in our own hands, performing our Art in all its members, whereof making Medicines is a chief one.</hi> The <hi>Kings Physicians</hi> formerly made the <hi>Kings Medicines;</hi> as 'tis manifest by the <hi>Lord Coke</hi> in his Institutes, Book the fourth, part fourth, pag. 251.</p>
            <p>[Pag. 36.] <hi>He may so contrive his</hi> Medicines, <hi>first, that they may be taken in small quantities, and be made more gratefull to the tast and stomack, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form more then those of the</hi> Apothecaries, <hi>commonly slovenly made, and themselves nauseous and sluggish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Pag. 41.] <hi>Physicians</hi> will strive who shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed each other in Noble Remedies, and from thence render a full and happy Improvement of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65768:8"/>
whatsoever <hi>God</hi> hath created for the recovery of Man's health.</p>
            <p>[Pag. 44.] <hi>He will gain Reputation to his Art, by restoring it to its first Institution and Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Pag. 45.] <hi>By constant practise with such Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, he will find out a better method of cure, and thereby arrive at the true causes of Diseases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Patient will have a better opinion of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and confidence in the use of them, and the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian will be more satisfied in conscience, and better as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the success.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Pag. 46.] <hi>He will have more scope to be charitable to the Poor, and may cure them</hi> gratis, <hi>and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for little charge.</hi> And another of your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge tells us thus; <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Goddard</hi> in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, p. 36. <hi>There is one further advantage of great importance, by the Physician giving his own preparations, that is, the certainty he shall be at in all his Medicaments, as to their efficacy, strength, and operations, much beyond what can be in the way of Writing Bills to</hi> Apothecaries; <hi>for, a rational and judicious choice of one, or a very few Medicines, may signify much more to the good of the Patient, than a Luxuriant variety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same Dr. sayes pag. 29. <hi>If the Patients knew all, they would not be satisfied in the greatest number and variety of Medicines, and the most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent plying them therewith. For this is done of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in some Physicians, to render themselves the more acceptable to</hi> Apothecaries <hi>in general, or upon some
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65768:9"/>
combination between the</hi> Apothecary <hi>and</hi> Physician, <hi>mutually to advance each other; for the principal Art of all is, for the</hi> Apothecary <hi>to cry up, and bring into the Patients such</hi> Physicians, <hi>who through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign must comply with the</hi> Apothecaries <hi>interest; and such Practisers they extol, and cry up for good</hi> Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, <hi>(as indeed they are for their advantage, but not for the Patient's health, ease, or Purse, unless to empty it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now this Good</hi> Apothecaries <hi>Doctor they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe by his frequent, though needless visits, and multitude of Bills, to be a very careful, diligent, and painful man, for he visits twice or thrice a day, and still is writing of new Bills for more Medicines; when perhaps not half or none of the former have been used, making the Patient's House like an</hi> Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie'<hi>s Shop, planting the Cupboards, Tables, and Windows, with pots and glasses; and thus the</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician <hi>never goes away from his Patient without a Bill, lest the</hi> Apothecary <hi>should grumble, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self want his fee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus burdening the Sick with multiplicity of Medicines, often contrary and destructive one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then the worst mischief of all is, if we may believe what drop'd from a Quil pluck'd from the right wing of their own Body; <hi>viz.</hi> their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Merret,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That these</hi> Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>counterfeit their Medicines, both Simple and Compound, and sell one thing for another;</hi> viz. <hi>They
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65768:9"/>
sell</hi> Myrtle leaves <hi>for</hi> Sena, <hi>a</hi> Binder <hi>for a</hi> Purger; Mushroms <hi>of the Oak rubb'd over with chalk for</hi> Agarie; Hemlock, Dropwort <hi>Roots, for</hi> Paeony <hi>Roots,</hi> Poysons <hi>for wholesome</hi> Medicines, Dog-Berries, <hi>for</hi> Buck Thorn; <hi>no</hi> Purgers <hi>for streng ones;</hi> Sheeps lungs <hi>for</hi> Fox lungs; <hi>the hone of an</hi> Ox, <hi>for that of a</hi> Stags Heart, Damsons <hi>for</hi> Damase <hi>prunes, Syrup of</hi> Limons, <hi>for Syrup of</hi> Citrons; Briony <hi>Roots for</hi> Mechoacan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They falsify the Grand Compositions of the</hi> London Dispensatory, <hi>it being a common trade with the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries <hi>to buy unsound and decay'd drugs, and to return back to the Drugest so much of the Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as will pay for the Simples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis common with them to load Medicines, with great quantity of Hony and other cheap ingredients, and to leave out the whole, or part of them, of greater value in</hi> Ruffus'<hi>s pill and</hi> Oxycroceum <hi>Plaster, they colour with</hi> Turmeric <hi>and</hi> sanders <hi>instead of</hi> Saffron; Diascordium <hi>made only with Honey and</hi> Bole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick. <hi>Many of the</hi> London, <hi>and most of the Country</hi> Apothecaries, <hi>buy of the whole Salemen in</hi> London, <hi>who affirm, that they cannot sell their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines honestly made at so low a rate as they do, but the retail</hi> Apothecary <hi>will give no better price, and they must have them to keep custom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it were true, that all Medicines in the <hi>London Dispensatory</hi> were truly made; yet if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may believe another of the Colledge Brethren; <hi>viz. Dr. Goddard</hi> in his Discourse, setting forth the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65768:10"/>
unhappy condition of the Practise of <hi>Physick</hi> in London, tells us thus, pag. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who ever with judgment</hi> (saith he) <hi>peruseth the</hi> London Dispensatory, <hi>may soon estimate to what an Epitome it may be reduced; how many Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be spair'd, how many Ingredients almost in every Composition. And as to the forms or Receipts of which it is made up, it was never judged other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by able Physicians, but that there are in them many ingredients impertinent, and some contrary to the main intention for which they are in use, besides their Irrational proportions and quantities, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This being the condition and state of that Book, the Colledge of Physicians have no such cause; as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People may think, to envy them the Translation of it; nor have they any such Treasure of it, as they may suppose themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not high time then for People to be well advised what <hi>Physicians</hi> they make use of, seeing these grand abuses are committed by those which pretend a law, to impose upon all People such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and do sue and molest at Law all Persons better informed, that make it their sole business to serve their Generation, with a better method and Medicines than themselves understand; and if such Men have a Law to molest such Men, is it that good reason that Magistrates, be informed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at such <hi>monopolies</hi> are injurious to the Publick, and that they may with good reason make such void and of non effect; but I highly question,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65768:10"/>
whether there be any such Law or not, as these Men pretend; for their Brother Doctor <hi>Goddard</hi> pleads thus, speaking for Liberty for <hi>Improvers,</hi> pag. 16. <hi>All Laws</hi> (saith he) <hi>of Nature and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; all Justice, Equity and Reason of Mankind, do allow to every Person the benefit of his own industry; which, if it be of that nature, that the bringing of it into use and practice, doth necessarily import the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it, according to our Laws, Patents for terms of years are granted; but if an invention be of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it may be concealed in the use and practice, no limitation for private advantage or profit thereby, is set by Law; it is only Honesty and Ingenuity, that can restrain Men from making unreasonable or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable advantage thereof in such a case. Now, any Medicine or Recepts for Cure of Diseases, invented by</hi> Physicians, <hi>or coming to their private knowledge only, or any new use or virtue of an old known Medicine discovered by any</hi> Physician, <hi>as far as they are of any consideration or virtue, are of this nature, that is, they are inventions that may be kept secret by them, and whereof nothing hinders them from the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The Law of the Land (as well as in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) allowing and authorizing</hi> Physicians <hi>to practise their Art in all its parts and members; and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to make any Medicine themselves; and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister them to the good of the Poor for nothing; and to others for reasonable reward.</hi>

            <p>And now you persecuting Colledge, what can you say for your selves? are not your own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

Are you not like your Fathers, who persecuted the worthies of old? are you not like the <hi>Jews,</hi> who killed the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and when the great <hi>Physician</hi> appeared, killed him?

Do not you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute all at Law that are not of your Tribe, or owne not obedience to you? but thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> millions are better perswaded; But I cannot but wonder at many worthy Persons of this City, that they should be so blind as to make use of these Persons: but they will tell me, the reason why they advise with them, is, Because they believe them to be Learned Men: But by the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel line, why do you not advise with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave of Cardinals of Rome,</hi> for the health of your Souls, as well as with the pretended Colledge, for the health of your Body? for, they have but one and the same traditional Education and Root, and if you abhor the one, how can you, if you do but well consider, be satisfied with the other? would they not bind all People to make use of them, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65768:11"/>
no other? Do they not go about to prohibit all People from consulting with, or making use of those whom they are satisfied, are both honest and able?</p>
            <p>Oh Monsters in Nature! Good People look not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your purses, but to your Lives also: For, what pretenses can these Men have for their persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dr. <hi>Huybert</hi>'s and the worthy Dr. <hi>M.

            <p>LEst the Reader should be mistaken, &amp; think, that I speaking against those <hi>Pedantick</hi> usurping prescribing <hi>Heteromethodists,</hi> and such <hi>Apothecaries</hi> as are in combination with them:</p>
            <p>That thereby, I mean all manner of Persons that profess <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Phylosophy,</hi> that have been educated in Universities, or that I mean <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries</hi> in general. No, many of these Men have been studious and elaborate inquirers into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Practical <hi>Philosophy;</hi> these Men, I say, with many of our <hi>London Chirurgians,</hi> are better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded than to follow the old <hi>Pedantick</hi> way: and such worthy Men as these, I both owne and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as Persons fit to undertake the Sick.</p>
            <p>But I only mean those <hi>Envious Ignorants,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Physicians</hi> or <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> who being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd by the authority &amp; custom of other blind Guides, and who having been beguil'd with their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65768:13"/>
covetous crafty deceits, are clearly of opinion, that there is no more truth to be found in <hi>Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Philosophy,</hi> than in the pretended Philosophick principles of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi> such as Doctor <hi>Cox-Comb,</hi> the late <hi>Chymick Renegado</hi> by virtue of <hi>Matrimonial Contract,</hi> &amp; most of the prescribing pretended <hi>Colledge,</hi> with their Confederates, such <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> who perversly maintaining of, and persisting in the great and manifest errours of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s <hi>Physicks,</hi> and the evident imperfections <hi>of the Galenical Medicines,</hi> out of a leud disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or malignity of mind, and wilfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, do persecute and bespatter those better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and disswade other growing and hopeful <hi>Wits,</hi> from applying themselves to the study of the <hi>Hermetick</hi> Science.</p>
            <p>Those are the men whom I aim at, as being Sophisters and deceivers in <hi>Physick;</hi> a sort of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> being bred up like a Carrier's Horse to foot it in a common Road, and if he goes besides it, he then loses his way, and is in amaze; and by way of Distinction from those that are indeed <hi>Physicians,</hi> let them be called <hi>PEDANTS,</hi> for such they are indeed; therefore let that be the <hi>word</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>England</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>But one word more to the <hi>Reader:</hi> And that is to inform him what a <hi>Pedant</hi> is in <hi>Phylosophy</hi> and <hi>Physick:</hi> He is a Creature half learned, and half unlearned; that is to say, learned in Letters, old Rules, and speculations of old Authors, so far as he has conversed with them, yet that is usually

not very far; and were he never so far or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly studied in them, it would be to little use or purpose, for the benefit of Mankind; so that the other half of the Ridiculous monster, after he hath been trickt up with all the trappings of his Academick Authors Formalities and Notions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be unlearned in Things, Realities, Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forms, Intimate Vertues, and powers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural subjects, and ignorant which way to educe and reduce them to practice for a publick good: so that for the honour of this University way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and of his Doctorships <hi>Diploma,</hi> he and his old Doctrine, are fit for little but to make good the old Proverb, <hi>Merus Scholastious merus Asinus;</hi> for, trimed up with his gayeties of very little <hi>Latine,</hi> and less <hi>Greek Rhombus,</hi> through all his <hi>Purple-habiliments</hi> you may spy what sort of Creature 'tis; especially if you turn your eyes upwards, you will be more evidently informed, when you view his <hi>Ears</hi> peeping through his <hi>Velvet-cushion-cap-case.</hi>

            <p>Talk he can, and prate as a Man: So could <hi>Balaam</hi>'s <hi>Ass;</hi> but he poor Animal lived out his time, then died, and for all his talk and jogging on the road, could never make a <hi>Physician.</hi>—I met t' other day with a Gentleman, who bad me salute all the Doctor <hi>Pedants</hi> thus in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine, LOGIATRI, VALETE;</hi> and tell them, that not many of them are able to construe the <hi>English</hi> of it without much conning and thumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Lexicon.</hi>

            <head>One word yet more to the Reader.</head>
            <p>I am newly informed, that the Collegiates, being all <hi>sick of the Stone,</hi> I mean of that notable Book called <hi>Dr. Huybert</hi>'s <hi>Corner-Stone,</hi> lately published, &amp; not daring to venture to cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with any things of their own, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd themselves to the use of <hi>Goddard</hi>'s <hi>Drops</hi> in <hi>Good-Ale,</hi> in <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> where dwells that pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Distiller,</hi> A <hi>Smal Quack,</hi> that would fain curry favour with the greater ones, to gain their custom: where note, that the <hi>Pedants</hi> will (as they ever have done) kiss the breech of any <hi>Quack,</hi> so it be in private, that can help them with a Medicine; but if their Disease were curable, as 'tis not, Alas! what can <hi>Good-Ale</hi> wit <hi>Drops</hi> doe, after they have been smiten under the fifth Rib by the hands of <hi>Huyberts?</hi> Their next fate will be, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the City, without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: <note n="*" place="margin">M. <hi>Bayes</hi> may do well to crown their funeral, and <hi>Marvel</hi> not, if you find on their Tombe-stone for a memorial (because most of them are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scholars) these words, <hi>This is GOLGOTHAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEMULAM,</hi> which if <hi>Mr. Franckland P. D.</hi> Solliciter happen to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, he may interpret if he be able.</note> And does he think they will be satisfied with <hi>Good Ale,</hi> instead of wine at such funeral? But more planly thus, Dr. <hi>Huy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts,</hi> in his Book (which is a Book that concerns every Man in this Nation to read) having stript naked their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorships, and their fallacies, their imperfections, and their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65768:14"/>
arrogant persecuting of him, and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious persons, without Reason, or ground of Law, he then saluted them with two remarkable Challenges, which are these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He challenges them; <hi>To nominate any one Particular of improvement, that their Society hath made in the Art of Curing, since their first Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, to this day: And thereupon he will prove the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whereas they pretend to have done much in discovcries by Anatomy: And whereas Mr.</hi> Boyle, <hi>in his Book of Experimental Philosophy, saith; he doth not see wherein by those new Discoveries, they have done any thing to better the Cure of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> Huyberts <hi>also saith; that if the Masters of the Anatomical Stage, please to justifie themselves, he is ready to refute them, and manifest publickly in Print, that they have not done any thing worth a Straw beyond what was done by the Ancients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Challenges; but why do they not accept and enter upon the Combate? Is it for the Honour of their Worships, to admit a Puny Drop-Seller to be their Champion, and then under hand to supply him as I am told with Materials, to patch up a Pamphlet with a bold face of a Lame Answer? This is their way of Answering; And thus I remember, they served worthy Dr. <hi>Marchamont, Nedham's</hi> Book ten years ago called <hi>Medela Medicinae;</hi> which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65768:15"/>
remains yet unanswered, and approved by all but themselves: for instead, of returning a solid and through answer by some of their <hi>Grandees,</hi> which was a Task becoming the best Heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, they employed four of their Puny <hi>Members</hi> to whisle with some Pareels, and Sentences, instead of an orderly Demoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ground work, the design, and stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the whole Book, as becomes men that would pretend to be Scholars.</p>
            <p>Those Puny Scriblers were men scarce known, and so could lose no Reputation, in case they made, as they did, very frivolous Answers to some parts, without considering the entire Composition of the whole: And Doubtless the <hi>Grandees</hi> dealt very warily, to decline an engaging themselves, and to set on their Underlings to Write against a Book which they well knew was not to be answered yet they had the impudence to cry in all places, that they had confuted the Doctor in four several An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers. This was the Art used then to save their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits, with the Injudicious &amp; weaker sort of people.</p>
            <p>And now seeing I hear they are upon practising that same trick again, by employing against <hi>Huyberts;</hi> one <hi>Goodale</hi> from whom is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any tolerable Answer; and he being none of the Colledge, Dr. <hi>Huyberts</hi> is not concerned to make any Reply to ought that shall be Written on that account, unless it shall appear in Print owned under the name of the Colledge, or of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65768:15"/>
some one of their number, on their behalf. For, the Doctor is resolved not to take notice of that Drop-seller, but will commit the care of a Reply unto a Man of his own, whose name is <hi>Jack Straw.</hi> A fit man to Foile such a Champion, being able to deal with Mr. <hi>Goodale,</hi> and his good Masters too; in case they deal with him now, as formerly they did with Dr. <hi>Nedhams</hi> Book, that is, if they shall cry up this their new Treatise, which is now forming by that incompetent Adversary, to be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Answer.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I cannot but take notice, by way of Admiration, of the condition of that worthy and Ancient Company of Chirurgeons of <hi>London,</hi> what a base thing it is, that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as they, should suffer so long a time as they have done, under the Insolence and Pride of the Pedants, who have for a hundred and fifty Years past, made attempts from time to time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave and debar them from the practise of Physick, in following their Profession; which to do, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely a great Burthen to the Subject, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There being no reason why a Chirurgical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, should be put to the charge of <hi>a Fop Doctor;</hi> Ignorant of Chirurgery (as most of them are) when as if occasion require a Doctor, the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon may be Chyrurgeon and Doctor too; for so they are, and ought to be at Sea; or else his Majesty, and the Merchants, may lose their Men that dayly go forth in their services. And how shall they be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65768:16"/>
fit for Sea, if they and their Masters that Breed them, have not a freedom to practise both ways by Land as well as by Sea. Besides, Physick and Surgery were everheretofore in one hand, till the idle Pride of <hi>Pedants</hi> made a Distinction: From which arose the destruction of Physick in all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. And it will never be well till they run both again in on Channel.</p>
