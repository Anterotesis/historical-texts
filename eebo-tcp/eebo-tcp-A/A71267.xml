            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </add>. D<add>urfey</add>.</hi> Sir <hi>CRITICK CATCALL</hi> sends Greeting.</head>
            <p>YOV have shown your self so Penitent after the Poetical Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection you received from me, that to retaliate (tho late) the Honour you did me in chusing me for your Patron, I return you Epistle for Epistle, and make you the Patron of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Dialogue: It reflects on a certain Namesake and Country man of yours, and some Plays of his lately Launch'd out; but that's all one, since it may turn to as good an account to you as some of yours; and your own practise of sacrificing your friends, to your own, and the Town's Jests, justifies it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I must confess, 'tis a sad Age we live in, since the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of the Town, from Exalted Box, to more Exalted upper Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, the routing the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> stilling the Criticks, and drowning their Hisses, by the loud repeated Claps of the lusty fisted Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your Party, able to have drown'd those of Thunder it self, and all the Kitts and Fiddles of your Antagonists of the nimble Craft; I say, 'tis a sad Age <hi>seriously,</hi> since all this cannot secure a man from censure, or a Play from being taken to pieces, which altogether made so pretty a figure: 'tis as uncharitable as the exposing the false Hair, Teeth, Calves, Eyes, and Eye-brows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of our antiquated <hi>Beaux</hi> and Ladies.</p>
            <p>Such is the malice of some prying envious Persons, not having the fear of Satyrists before their Eyes, that they most feloniously, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and wickedly, like Rival Women, search for, nay, make and


<pb facs="tcp:42858:3"/>
find faults in others, as industriously as they seek to hide their own But what shall I say to it? Alas! 'tis the general custom of you Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, (the more's the pity) like Mastives you bark at, claw and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one another, whilst others cry hollow, and heartily laugh at you for your pains. Other Societies protect and shoulder one another, but you, like so many Game Cocks turn'd loose together, fall foul of the next you meet: Or to speak more Poetically, like <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, cut and slash your fellows without mercy. Is there no means to stop this fury? From the Cobler that mends your Shooes, to the rich Goldsmith that keeps your <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, there are Halls for their Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>London;</hi> 'tis pitty yours in <hi>Beotia</hi> is not removed a little nearer, or that your Master <hi>Apollo</hi> doth not send from <hi>Parnassus</hi> some Deputy to govern you here, that being once united, as much as you are divided, the Trade (for by your leave, 'tis now a Trade as much as those I Nam'd) may flourish, and the Proverb be a Lyar, which bars Poets from becoming Aldermen. This would be very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at present that the Indisposition of the Laureat is like to spill as much Blood as Ink among you; for from the Modern Play-writers, to the high toppers of the Profession, I expect to find you all at Daggers drawing; should he be so civil to you to leave us in haste <hi>(I hope he will not)</hi> to make a visit to his Brothers <hi>Terence,</hi> and <hi>Ben Johnson,</hi> in the <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Mushroom hopes all this will attone for his presumption; he desired me to recommend it to you to have it made into a Play, and hopes you may prove as prevailing a Patron, as your Party was to get yours a Name, and a third day, and hinder it from sinking under the weight of those who did not like it: some of whom were something sawcy, and us'd these words out of a Play of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Poet, who before the Poll Acts, used to write himself <hi>T. D.</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: That, <hi>should we not sometimes dive into the secrets of Wit, and reprove mistakes, these Rascally Poets would grow Insolent; we should be perpetually tormented with Lampoons.</hi> It was hard in them to reverse the saying upon its Author, tho amongst Authors, 'tis no more than the reflections of Lawyers against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Bar. It helps to make you famous, and I am much mistaken, if some of you would not be as thankful for a severe Criticism in Print, as for a Copy of Verses in praise of your Works.</p>
            <p>Had my Author attach'd your friend in his worst Plays, he could


<pb facs="tcp:42858:3"/>
have had a cheaper Victory, and the other a greater Overthrow; but he has done as those Generals who slight little weak Towns to set down before the Capital City; which may please the Party concern'd, as much as it would the Governour of the Town to see it attack'd on the strongest side. I need not then Apologize to any of the Fraternity for my friends Observations on that score, but rather to the Town, for telling them 'tis dark at Midnight, that crack'd Skulls are not found, and that some Writers Vpper-rooms are unfurnish'd. This undigest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed product of a few spare hours, is as needless to some Criticks, as a Treatise of the bulk of the Book of Martyrs, to prove that <hi>Maevius</hi> was a bad Poet, or a Lecture of War to a great Commander. But tho they do not want to inform their Iudgments, they may something to make chem merry, when they have as little to do as my friend when he writ it; had he been Master of leisure enough to have revised it, it would have appeared in a better Dress, and have had less roughness in the Style, and perhaps more in the Satyr. The smoothness of your Pen may Redress the first, and if you think he has been too mild in the other, which I must confess was at my Request, let me know it, and you will have no cause to complain to my knowledge, this being at the best but a Rough-draught or the <hi>Sketch</hi> of his Poet. I think there is enough drawn to discover who sat for it, and tho the finishing strokes being wanting, it may well be said that the Picture is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unlike; I dare say 'tis after the way of our Modern Painters, and of you Freeholders of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> in the Panegyricks of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and consequently not for the worse, my friend having us'd yours more kindly than your Abdicated Brother <hi>Bays</hi> hath been, and made him speak a Language he hath no cause to be asham'd of, tho perhaps he himself may.</p>
            <p>I hope the Name of <hi>Stutter</hi> will no more offend than that of <hi>Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silion, Poet Belly, Lady Stroddle, Coopee,</hi> &amp;c. which bear your Stamp, but if you think that of <hi>Balladwright</hi> or <hi>Maggot</hi> properer, you may new Nick-name that worthy Person, my friend not designing it as a mock upon any infirmity of speech (a thing to be pitied) but as a distinguishing mark of his Hero, who Stutters more in sence yet than in Elocution.</p>
            <p>The Plot he leaves to you, who have such a Collection of yours and other mens in your head, your Invention seldom coming so short of your Imagination, but that the supply of a good memory makes you


<pb facs="tcp:42858:4"/>
amends: He knows you can as little want the addition of Songs and Dances to adorn it, as a Scholar newly returned from the Vniversity, his Tropes and Figures, or a Girl just Ween'd from the Boarding-School her Mennet or Rigodoon.</p>
            <p>Here I should inlarge upon your Merits, your Indefatigable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in spight of all discouragements, the substance of your Wit, the Ingenuity of your Conversation, your generosity in the profuse and continual distribution of your Songs, the mildness of your Satyrs, the solidity of your Burlesque, the niceness of your Politicks, your care in obliging both Parties with your Poems: But above all, the fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Style, and your Laborious Industry in tacking together pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and remnants of Plots and Humours, and making them your own for the diversion of those who had never seen them, in the state of their first Creation. But all this were fitter from your own Pen, and I hope you will not be so far wanting to your self, as not to oblige us with it one day, since no other Pen yet ever dared undertake it; tho I must confess, such Salutes amongst Authors, are as unnecessary as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men of War at Sea, 'tis but wasting Powder which may be put to a more profitable use, therefore they may better be reserv'd for the future Epistle to the Patron of this Embryo; and who knows (between you and I) but it may hook in <hi>20</hi> Guinea's, if you Cull your man right.</p>
            <p>And now I think it high time to take my leave, for 1 perceive my Epistle is swell'd to a bulk, and it only belongs to such as can Wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them to the purpose, to hold us at the Door as long as they please, for in an unknown Scribbler 'tis as unmannerly as a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids Chat, when you are impatient to be admitted into her Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Bed-chamber. For my part, I generally pass them over as some do <hi>Greek</hi> when they don't understand it, with a <hi>Transeat Graecum est,</hi> they being as little to the purpose as the Prologues to some of our Plays; but lest I be task'd with the fault of those, who with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of words blame others overtalk, I have done, and according to the form of Letters, rest</p>

               <p>Oh Sir! as long as Scribblers can find Booksellers to buy them, and they Fools to read 'em, they need not care, what the wiser part will say, they are Case-harden'd, and you need

not expect them to leave Writing, till they leave dull Flattery, Whores their Jilting, Lawyers refuse bribes, or the House to act their Plays, as I believe they will for the future, lest all others, tho good, fall into disrepute; and the House be as empty at a new good Play in Winter, as it is at a bad one in the Long Vacation.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Ay, and there is need they shou'd; but the Town of late, have like true Libertines, shunn'd Faces and Plays once seen, whether good or bad, and serv'd them all alike; but there's hopes they'll Recant, and after their roving fit, they may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; for to be tir'd with change, is the first step towards the settling our affections; and since when we have been but one Week in the Country, we find so much the want of the Play-House, that the very Strowlers are then welcome to us. I dare say, the Town can no more be without Plays, than a brisk young Widdow without a Husband or a Gallant.</p>

               <p>Authors and Satyrists do you call them?

               <p>Oh, I have found out another use for them; formerly I cou'd not sleep, tho I desired it; but having bought a Book call'd <hi>The Moralist,</hi> I began to read it one Night, having no other by my Bed side, when even Opium cou'd not purchase me sleep, and before I had read two Pages, I slept so fast, that I found the next Morning my Candle in the Socket, and the Book in the Chamber-pot.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>Poet Stutter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
               <p>Then I don't wonder 'tis such—Why, he can't Write—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>What do you mean? He was Prentice to a Scriviner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
               <p>I mean, he can't write sence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore he's the fitter to Write such things; they only seem calculated for the Meridian of the City Coffee-Houses, where sense is as great a stranger as amongst the true bred <hi>Teagues,</hi> or the <hi>Bethlemitish</hi> Collegians; who yet sometimes will drop you a Witticism by chance. One while he rails at the Priests, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the <hi>French,</hi> laughs at the <hi>Irish;</hi> and in the whole, banters all, and the work's done. They are all alike, from the first to the last; I wou'd confine him to <hi>Scotch</hi> Songs, I mean such of them as our Gay People of both Sexes call <hi>Scotch,</hi> tho' they want as much the Dialect, as the sense of some of that Country.</p>

               <p>Prithee why?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>Because, as I said, he much wanting sense, is the fitter to write them, it being an essential part of them to have none; and the more, since his faculty of Singing renders him the more capable to fit a Horse to a Saddle; that is, words to a Tune.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, yes, he's not a little proud of that: I believe that in the <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields, he'll hardly give the Wall to <hi>Horace,</hi> or any of the Lyrick Poets. He contradicts his Notion of Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and gives his noted <hi>Omnibus hoc vitium</hi> the Lye, tho no man verifies it more than himself. Indeed, he is a Tolerable Eccho, his only quality is a Voice.</p>

               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>

humour, and the malice and dangerous Notions of his first Libel, he ought, I think, to attribute its Reception with some people, as much as his Under-Brothers of the Scribbling Herd, the Sale of their Parabolizing Bears, Puppies and Magpies.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42858:7"/>
Morality teaches us to use others, as we would be us'd our selves: What now if some one or other should stick to your skirts and expose you as much?</p>

               <p>That may well be, because perhaps you never had any; but for your principles, I am sure you have alter'd them more in two years, than the Taylors have the fashions since the Restauration—but that's no newer thing to some of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, than to a true Courtier in times of change—</p>

It doth not signify a farthing (from whence it comes,) 'tis like Musick, the different and thwarting parts set one another off. Do you think Rats and Weesils, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizing Atheists, dull Panegyricks, worse than Lampoons and Lampoons, more glorious to those they are meant to, than Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks by those hands?

               <p>I believe so; 'tis as diverting and natural as any thing you ever writ, principally the Fencing Masters with the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffs: All that's good in the Play must be yours, and what's bad <hi>Chapmans.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Ay, I think the Comical part is very well brought in, and much to the purpose, tho I ask'd one his Opinion of it, and the ignorant fool told me 'twas pretty Farce: Ah ah ah.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, what did you bring the Fencing Master and the Steward upon the Stage for?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>Why to talk together and Fence, what should I bring them there for else?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
               <p>I do not perceive your drift in it, for they never appear afterwards; and I think a Scene between Monsieur and <hi>Dambois,</hi> about the killing the King his brother, well wrought, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to prepare the events (which are brought in abruptly) and to avoid dull Narrations had been more to the purpose; it makes those that are Judges say, that were it not for Mr. <hi>M—fords</hi> excellent acting, which is the Soul of the Play, it would have been still-born. And to speak in your style, <hi>it now hath a World of spots,</hi> and could have been <hi>a World without spots,</hi> and have had nothing to do with <hi>Heavens strait Axle-tree,</hi> and the World of Fustian you have either made or left in it. I have heard of the World turn'd into <hi>a withdrawing Room,</hi> but never till now of Heaven made a Coach with its Axle-tree. Some Criticks are as angry with you for that, as the Dissenters with Queen <hi>Bess,</hi> for the Relicks of Ceremonies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>Being in haste, I overlookt some of the old stuff, and could not well avoid it, for had I taken it all out, there had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nothing old in the Play but the Name, and I had done like the fellow who bought him a new outside to his Lining, and


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42858:16"/>
a new Lining to his outside; tho I as much hate to wear an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors old Socks, as to sing anothers words, a fault you'll seldom find me guilty of. There is a great deal of Art in altering a Play for the better, and you may almost as soon make an old face look young again; but I think no old Author ever suffer'd much under my hands.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But the Audience did—
<stage>aside</stage>
—Oh, no: one would think you had bath'd them in that Fountain which turns decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Age to sprightly Youth: for when they have been as it were Bedridden, and confin'd in Closets to the Dead Letter half an Age, you bring them on the Stage Singing and Dancing like mad; and like you, as full of Bell Air, and as spruce, as if they were just shot out of a Bow from <hi>Paris,</hi> and so Rhetorical, that in a series of Complemental Phrases, <hi>Verborum Ambagibus,</hi> we are lost in amazement, before we can reach the middle of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; you have found out the Transfusion of Wit and Style, I think, better than the Physicians have done that of the blood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! those things cost me nothing, my Genius lyes that way, but the Toyl lyes in Teaching the Actors, in Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling them right, and bringing them on; 'tis a sad drudgery, one must as it were clap them on the back, and spit in their mouths, to incourage them, tho they are marring a good thing, and murthering a Part: I Teach them like Parrots, tho to deal plainly with you, I am affraid some of them most ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, laugh at me behind my back, and are so us'd to counterfeit upon the Stage, that they can no more leave it off when they are from it, than an <hi>Irish-man</hi> his Accent, a thorough-pac'd swearer his Oaths, and your Yea and Nay Quaking Friend, his Cant and Formality. I believe 'tis they have possess'd the Town with the Report of my want of Wit; they Interlope in our Trade as you know. Now should I speak any witty thing to them, it may be; as they have good memories, they would at Night set it down to deck their Plays, or treat every company they come into with it, and so make any fine thing common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and unfit to be us'd by me when I have company that deserves it; for, like a hidden store, I reserve them for my friends, and always one finer than all the rest at parting, like a Grace-cup, to leave a good relish of my sense when I am gone,


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42858:17"/>
as I observe that a good round Jest at the end of a Scene, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a Clap. Indeed, those things, like Coronation Robes, are more for state than use, and must not be worn thredbare—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>So that sometimes, my friend, you take as much pains to hide your VVit, as you do at others to show it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>And with good reason too, when I am with the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Gad, tho it were but before the Candle-snuffer, I dare not utter one good word—who can tell but he hath a Play upon the stocks, and ready to be Launch'd next Term.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>Come, say no more of it, I am sure they have done you a great deal of Justice, and I know some of them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your esteem; you must do like that King who would not remember the wrongs done him when a Duke. And so the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Love for Money,</hi> must forget the dejected and wrong'd Duke of <hi>Dunstable.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
               <p>But pray, by the by, why from one Gentleman of <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s, did you make three Dukes? Methinks it seem'd too great an Imposition on the sense of the Audience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>VVhy? <hi>Bays</hi> gave you two Kings of <hi>Brentford,</hi> and three Dukes, I think, was more surprizing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you, Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> for hitting my true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that was a good Play! but those Scenes of <hi>Basset,</hi> which gave offence to a very great Lady, were the Ruine of it, tho no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be prettier. And that with a great deal more, is my own: but now that Lady is gone, I will have it revived before I oblige the Stage with another Play.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>So you may, as well as <hi>Bussy Dambois,</hi> and with as much Justice have the <hi>Banditti</hi> too; I believe the one will take as much as t'other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>Now you make me sigh when you speak of the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti,</hi> that poor Play fell a sacrifice to the Criticks, they envy me because I think my self as good as they, as in reason I am, and perhaps better too. They Martyrized my Play to pull down my Reputation, which began to eclipse that of the most Celebrated Dramatick Authors; but I think I fitted them in my Epistle Dedicatory to the Foreman of my Partial Jury, <hi>Sir Critick Cat-call</hi>; you have read it without doubt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Ay, ay, you puzzled them I'm sure, with your <hi>Visible</hi>

and <hi>Invisible Patrons,</hi> and gave them three or four sheets of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and VVitticisms they could not understand, nor have the the patience to read, without taking Snuff.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>They had better ne'r have meddled with me, I stung them to the quick, and had I had no more Wit than they, I had had more Duels to fight than any desperate Bravo, or quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Gamester, e're fought or bragg'd of in their Lives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Johnson.</speaker>
               <p>How did you put them off then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stutter.</speaker>
               <p>Very easily I'saith: I told them that if Fighting was their Province, Writing was mine. That I invaded no mens proprieties, but if they would attack me at my own Weapon, I was ready to give them the satisfaction of an Author, draw my Pen in the Quarrel, and give them dash for dash, but that I had too great a veneration for the Ladies, to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any thing they were pleas'd to set a value on. And in short, at any thing else I begg'd their pardon, and was their humble servant—And this, with abdicating the Coffee-house, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing their Company, for the Society of the more sober and tractable Gentlemen of the Country and City, quasht the business. Tho now I dare appear; and tho a Star of the first magnitude shines so bright among you, that even in its eclipse I fear'd, before, 'twould shine brighter than I. Now I think my Boarding-School may make as great a blaze as his <hi>Spanish</hi> Frier.</p>

               <p>Sir, I have grafted of twig upon him, which I have called his <hi>Ghost,</hi> and for all your opinion, I believe that if any man hath come to his heighth, 'tis I have done it; no Author ever exploded my Works, nor writ against them so as to come to particulars, which is no small pride and comfort to me, since the most celebrated Pens have been often carp'd at, and examin'd, even in the best of their Works; and Indictments of Poetical Thefts, Murders and Treasons drawn against them. No man was ever yet so bold as to answer me, so that sometimes I have


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42858:18"/>
been forced to answer my self, when my hand was in. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they have lookt on my Poetry, as Armies on those Towns they dare not Besiege; I have had now and then a Bomb thrown at me, but tho surrounded with Enemies, none of them ever presumed beyond a Blocade, for had they made a formal attack, they had certainly lost by it, and been repulsed worse than the <hi>Turks</hi> were at <hi>Vienna.</hi>

The flying squadrons of your Songs form'd into bodies of light Horse, your Ballads into Dragoons, your Lampoons into Horse Granadeers, and Catches into Volonteers, would have made work with them: Your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine and smutty Copies of Verses, had been your <hi>Enfans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> the Burlesque Poems led the Van, your Comedies had made your main body of Foot join'd with the book you writ in praise of <hi>Archers,</hi> to darken the Sky with its Arrows, and all those Plays you have altered had been Auxiliaries, whilst you at the head of your <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> mounted on a <hi>Weesil,</hi> with an <hi>Owl</hi> for your Emblem display'd in your Standard, a Life Guard of <hi>Scotch</hi> Songs, your Satyrs for your Artillery, the Siege of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis</hi> bringing up the rear, and your Odes and other Poems in the body of Reserve, would have made altogether so bold, spruce, and numerous an Army, that <hi>Xerxes, Darius,</hi> or the <hi>Madianites,</hi> never muster'd the like, and he must have been more than a <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas,</hi> an <hi>Alexander,</hi> or a <hi>Gideon,</hi> that dared encounter you.</p>
