            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

on them: this is that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
the practice whereof in this
moral precept or advice the <hi>Royal
Preacher</hi> doth recommend unto us;
being indeed an eminent vertue, of
very general use, and powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the management of all
our affairs, or in the conduct of our
whole life.</p>
            <p>Industry, I say, in general touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all matters incident, which <hi>our
hand findeth to doe,</hi> that is, which
dispensation of providence doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
or which choice of reason em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth,
for employing our active
powers of soul and body, the <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
doth recommend; and to pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the observance of his advice
(waving all curious remarks either
<hi>Critical</hi> or <hi>Logical</hi> upon the words)
I shall presently apply my discourse,
proposing divers considerations apt
to excite us thereto; onely first let
me briefly describe it, for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
apprehension of its true notion
and nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53984:4"/>
By Industry we understand a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and steady application of mind,
joined with a vigorous exercise of
our active faculties in prosecution
of any reasonable, honest, usefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
in order to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or attainment of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
good; as for instance, a
<hi>Merchant</hi> is industrious, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
intent and active in driving
on his trade for acquiring wealth; a
<hi>Souldier</hi> is industrious, who is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for occasion, and earnest in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
toward obtaining the victory;
And a <hi>Scholar</hi> is industrious, who
doth assiduously bend his mind to
study for getting knowledge.</p>
            <p>Industry doth not consist merely
in action; for that is incessant in all
persons,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chrys. <hi>in</hi> Act. <hi>Or. 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> our mind being a restless
thing, never abiding in a total ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
from thought or from design,
(being, like a ship in the sea, if not
steered to some good purpose by
reason, yet tossed by the waves of
fancy, or driven by the winds of
temptation somewhither.) But the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53984:5"/>
direction of our mind to some good
end, without roving or flinching,
in a streight and steady course, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after it our active powers in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
thereof, doth constitute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;
the which therefore usually
is attended with labour and pain;
for our mind (which naturally doth
affect variety and liberty, being apt
to loath familiar objects, and to be
weary of any constraint) is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
kept in a constant attention to
the same thing; And the Spirits
employed in thought are prone to
flutter and fly away, so that it is
hard to fix them; And the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
instruments of action being
strained to a high pitch, or detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a tone will soon feel a lassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
somewhat offensive to nature;
Whence labour or pain is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reckoned an ingredient of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
and laboriousness is a name
signifying it; upon which accompt
this vertue (as involving labour)
deserveth a peculiar commendation;
it being then most laudable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53984:5"/>
the dictates of reason, when so
doing is attended with difficulty
and trouble.</p>
            <p>Such in general I conceive to be
the nature of Industry; to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
whereof the following conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
may induce.</p>
            <p>1. We may consider that Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
doth befit the constitution and
frame of our nature; all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our soul and organs of our
body being adapted in a congruity
and tendency thereto: Our hands
are suted for work, our feet for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
our senses to watch for occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of pursuing good and eschewing
evil; our reason to plod and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
ways of employing the other
parts and powers; all these, I say,
are formed for action; and that not
in a loose and gadding way, or in
a slack and remiss degree, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to determinate ends, with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
requisite to attain them; and
especially our appetites do prompt
to industry, as inclining to things
not obtainable without it; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53984:6"/>
to that Aphorism of the <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>—
<hi>The desire of the slothfull killeth him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 25. 13. 4.</note>
               <hi>for his hands refuse to labour;</hi> that is,
he is apt to desire things which he
cannot attain without pains; and
not enduring them, he for want
thereof doth feel a deadly smart and
anguish: wherefore in not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
we defeat the intent of our
Maker; we pervert his work and
gifts; we forfeit the use and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of our faculties; we are bad hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
of nature's stock.</p>
            <p>2. In consequence hereto Industry
doth preserve and perfect our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
keeping it in good tune and
temper; improving and advancing
it toward its best state. The labour
of our mind in attentive meditation
and study doth render it capable
and patient of thinking upon any
object or occasion; doth polish and
refine it by use; doth enlarge it by
accession of habits; doth quicken
and rowse our Spirits, dilating and
diffusing them into their proper
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53984:6"/>
chanels: The very labour of our
body doth keep the organs of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sound and clean, discussing fogs
and superfluous humours, opening
passages, distributing nourishment,
exciting vital heat: Barring the use
of it, no good constitution of soul
or body can subsist;<note place="margin">

God did not intend that man

that had we continued happy, we

concurrence of ordinary means;
By supporting our active powers,

God for all those things, for the

            <p>Hence although we should cast

yet we must not so trust

the means, which he doth offer,
of relieving our selves; to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
slothfull, being no less
blameable, than to be distrustfully
carefull.</p>
            <p>Hence God in all such cases, when
we do need any good thing, is said
to be our helper and succourer to
the obtaining it; which doth imply
that we must co-operate with him;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53984:12"/>
and join our forces to those, which
He doth afford; so that as we can
doe nothing without him, so he
will doe nothing without us; yea
so that sometime we are said also to
help God; <hi>Curse ye Meroz, curse

            <p>In fine, it is very plain both in
common experience, declaring the

               <hi>Wealth</hi> is that, which generally
men of all things are wont to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and covet with most ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
as the great store-house of their
needs and conveniences; the sure
bulwark of their state and dignity;
the universal instrument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
their designs, and pleasures;
And most evident it is, that in the
natural course of things industry is
the way to acquire it, to secure it,
to improve and enlarge it; the
which course pursued innocently
and modestly, God will be so far
from obstructing, that he will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and bless it; for that indeed
it would be a flaw in providence,
if honest industry, using the means
it affordeth should fail of procuring
a competency; which joined with
a pious contentedness in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
computation is <hi>great wealth.</hi>

            <p>Another darling of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
(and a jewel indeed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
worth and use in our life)
is <hi>honour,</hi> or reputation among men:
this also plainly, after the common
reason and course of things, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
and preserved by industry;
For he that aspireth to worthy
things, and assayeth laudable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
pursuing them steadily with
serious application of heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
activity, will rarely fail of
good success, and consequently will
not miss honour, which ever doth
crown victory; And if he should
hap to fail in his design, yet he will
not lose his credit; for having meant
well, and done his best, all will be
ready to excuse, many to commend
him; The very qualities which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
doth exercise, and the effects
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53984:15"/>
which it doth produce, do beget
honour; as being ornaments of our
person and state. God himself (from
whom <hi>honour cometh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 11.</note> and whose spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
prerogative it is to bestow it,<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 18.</note>
he,<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 19.</note> as King of the World, being the

to dignifie an industrious
management of his gifts with that
natural and proper recompence
thereof; conducting him, who fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treadeth in the path of honour,
that he shall safely arrive unto it.
It is therefore a matter of easie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
which the wise <hi>Prince</hi> doth
prompt us to mark; <hi>Seest thou a

               <hi>he shall

before mean men;</hi> that is, diligence,
as it is the fairest, so it is the surest
way to the best preferment; as it
qualifieth a man for employment,
and rendreth him usefull to the
World, so it will procure worthy
employment for him, and attract
the World to him; as the same

again doth observe and tell us;
<hi>He that waiteth on his master,</hi> (that

            </p>
            <p>No industrious man is contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for he is ever looked upon as
being in a way of thriving, of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself out from any straits, of

But without industry we
cannot expect any thing, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect,

truth which it seeketh commonly
doth not lie in the surface, obvious

dependeth on a simple consideration
of few things; but is lodged deep
in the bowels of things, and under
a knotty complication of various
matters; so that we must dig to

            <p>If we will have it, we must get
it as <hi>Solomon</hi> himself did, that great
Master of it;<note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 17. 2. 3.</note> how was that? <hi>I gave,</hi>

               <hi>out of his

yet even he, did first give
his heart to it, before it was given
into his heart: he did not onely
gape for it, to receive it by mere
infusion; but he worked and studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hard for it: he was indeed a
great student, an inquisitive searcher
into nature, a curious observer of
the World, a profound considerer
and comparer of things; and by
that industrious course, promoted

by divine blessing, he did arrive to
that great stock of so renowned a

            <p>And the same method it is, which
he prescribeth to us for getting it;

of vertue doth consist in the
most difficult and painfull efforts of
soul; in the extirpating rooted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
and notions from our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
in bending a stiff will,
and rectifying crooked inclinations;
in over-ruling a rebellious temper;
in curbing eager and importunate
appetites; in taming wild passions;
in withstanding violent temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
in surmounting many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and sustaining many troubles;
in strugling with various unruly
lusts within, and encountring many
stout enemies abroad, which assault
our reason, and <hi>war against our soul:</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53984:20"/>
In such exercises its very being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
its birth, its growth, its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
dependeth on them; so that
from any discontinuance or remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them it would soon decay,
languish away, and perish.</p>
            <p>What attention, what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,
and vigilancy of mind,
what intention of spirit, what force
of resolution, what command and
care over our selves doth it require,
to keep our hearts from vain
thoughts, and evil desires; to guard
our tongue from wanton, unjust,
uncharitable discourse; to order our
steps uprightly and steadily in all
the paths of duty? <gap reason="foreign">

must it self be a great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which is the mother, the nurse,

which indeed is an ingredient and

for if vertue were easily obtaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or practicable without a good
measure of pains, how could it be
vertue? what excellency could it
have, what praise could it claim,
what reward could it expect? God
hath indeed made the best things
not easily obtainable, hath set them
high out of our reach, to exercise
our industry in getting them, that
we might raise up our selves to them,
that being obtained they may the
more deserve our esteem, and his
reward.</p>

and, in the close of God's Book it is

            <p>Thus do the choicest good things,
of which we are capable, spring
from industry, or depend upon it;
and no considerable good can be
attained without it; thus all the
gifts of God are by it conveyed to
us, or are rendred in effect benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to us; for the gifts of nature
are but capacities, which it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;
the gifts of fortune or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
are but instruments, which

of grace are the supports and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours

glory is its fruit and recompence.</p>
            <p>There are farther several other

to the same end.</p>
            <p>1. We may consider, that Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
is productive of ease it self, and
preventive of trouble: It was no
less solidly, than acutely and smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advised by the Philosopher <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>

               <hi>Whether</hi> (said he) <hi>labour be to
be chosen, labour; or whether it be
to be eschewed, labour, that thou mayst
not labour; for by not labouring, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is not escaped, but is rather pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued;</hi>
and St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth upon
the same consideration urge Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chrys. <hi>in</hi> Joh. <hi>Orat.</hi> 36.</note>
because <hi>Sloth</hi> (saith he) <hi>is wont
to spoil us, and to yield us much pain;</hi>
No man can cozen nature, escaping
the labour to which he was born;
but rather attempting it will delude
himself, then finding most, when
he shunneth all labour.</p>
            <p>Sloth indeed doth affect ease and
quiet; but by affecting them doth
lose them; It hateth labour and
trouble, but by hating them, doth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53984:25"/>
incur them; It is a self-destroying
vice, not suffering those, who che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
it, to be idle, but creating much
work, and multiplying pains unto
them; engaging them into divers
necessities and straits, which they
cannot support with ease, and out
of which without extreme trouble
they cannot extricate themselves:
of this the <hi>Preacher</hi> doth afford us
a plain instance;<note place="margin">Eccles 10. 18.</note> 
               <hi>By much slothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
(saith he) <hi>the building decayeth,
and through idleness of the hands the
house droppeth through;</hi> A little care
taken at first about repairing the
house, would have saved its decay
and ruine; and consequently the
vast charge and trouble, becoming
needfull to re-edify it: and the like
doth happen in most other cases
and occurrences of life; idleness
commonly doth let slip opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and advantages, which cannot
with ease be retrieved; it letteth
things fall into a bad case, out of
which they can hardly be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53984:26"/>
The certain consequences of it
(disgrace, penury, want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
disobliging and losing friends,
with all the like mischiefs) cannot
be supported without much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet;
and they disable a man from
redressing the inconveniences into
which he is plunged.</p>
            <p>But Industry by a little volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
labour taken in due place and
season doth save much necessary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
afterward, and by moderate
care doth prevent intolerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress;
And the fruits of it (wealth
reputation, skill and dexterity in
affairs, friendships, all advantages of
fortune) do enable a man to pass his
life with great ease, comfort and
delight.</p>
            <p>2. Industry doth beget ease by
procuring good habits, and facility
of acting things expedient for us to
doe. By taking pains to day we
shall need less pains the morrow;
and by continuing the exercise,
within a while we shall need no
pains at all, but perform the most
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53984:26"/>
difficult tasks of duty, or of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to us with perfect ease, yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
with great pleasure. What
sluggish people accompt hard and
irksome (as to rise early, to hold
close to study, or business, to bear
some hardship) will be natural and
sweet; as proceeding from another
nature, raised in us by use.</p>
            <p>Industry doth breed assurance and
courage, needfull for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and prosecution of all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
business, or for the performance
of all duties incumbent on us.</p>
            <p>No man can quite decline busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or disengage himself from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without infinite damage and
mischief accruing to himself; but
these an industrious man (confiding
in this efficacious quality) will set
upon with alacrity, and dispatch
with facility; his diligence voiding
obstacles, and smoothing the way
to him; whenas idleness finding
some difficulties, and fansying more,
soon disheartneth, and causeth a
man to desist from action, rather
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53984:27"/>
chusing to crouch under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
then by endeavour to carry it
through to discharge himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:

            <p>The very settlement of our mind

            <p>The reflexion upon our having

our time accomptably, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

this is beyond any imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

a power of doing what

his sloth is disabled from doing any
thing, wherein he can find any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
satisfaction, the veriest slave
that can be; from which slavery
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53984:30"/>
industry freeing us, and disposing
us to perform chearfully whatever
is convenient, thereby doeth us a
great pleasure. Farther.</p>
            <p>6. Let us consider, that industry
doth afford a lasting comfort, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited
in the memory and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of him, that practiseth it. It
will ever-upon his reviewing the
passages of his life, be sweet to him
to behold in them testimonies and
monuments of his diligence; it will
please him to consider, that he hath
lived to purpose, having done some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
considerable; that he hath
made an advantageous use of his
time; that he hath well husbanded
the talents committed to him; that
he hath accomplished (in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure)
the intents of God's bounty,
and made some return for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
gifts. What comfort indeed
can any man have, yea how sore
remorse must he feel in reflecting
upon a life spent in unfruitfull and
unprofitable idleness? How can he
otherwise than bewail his folly and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53984:31"/>
baseness in having lived (or rather
having onely been) in vain;<note place="margin">Diu fuit, non diu vixit.</note> as the
shadow and appearance of a man;
in having lavished his days, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
buried his talents, in having
imbezilled his faculties of nature,
and his advantages from provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
in having defeated the good
will of God, and endeavoured no
requital to the munificent goodness
of his Maker, of his Preserver, his
benign Lord and Master,<note place="margin">Matt. 25. 26.</note> his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Saviour and Redeemer? How
without confusion, can he in his
mind revolve, that he hath no-wise
benefited the World, and profited
his neighbour, or obliged his friends,
or rendred to his Countrey, (to the
society, or community of which he
is a member) amends for all the
safety and quiet, the support, the
convenience, and the pleasure he
hath enjoyed under its protection,
and in its bosome? that he hath not
born a competent share in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
burthens, or paid a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
of his care and labour to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53984:31"/>
the publick welfare? how can such
a man look inward upon himself
with a favourable eye, or pardon
himself for so loathsome defaults?</p>
            <p>7. Let us consider, that industry
doth argue a generous and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
complexion of soul.</p>
            <p>It implieth a mind not content
with mean and vulgar things (such
as nature dealeth to all, or fortune
scattereth about) but aspiring to
things of high worth, and pursuing
them in a brave way, with adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
courage, by its own forces,
through difficulties and obstacles.</p>
            <p>It signifieth in a man a heart, not
enduring to owe the sustenance or
convenience of his life to the labour
or the liberality of others; to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a livelyhood from the World;
to reap the benefit of other mens
care and toil, without rendring a
full compensation, or out-doing his
private obligations by considerable
service and beneficence to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53984:32"/>
A noble heart will disdain to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
like a drone upon the hony ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by others labour; like a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to filtch its food out of the
publick granary; or like a shark to
prey on the lesser fry; but will, one
way or other earn his subsistence;
for he that doth not earn, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
own his bread, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 12.</note>
when he saith, <hi>Them that are
such we command and exhort by our
Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>

               <hi>that with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they work, and eat their own

            </p>
            <p>Of this generous ingenuity we
have a notable instance in that
great <hi>Apostle</hi> himself;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 15.</note> which he
doth often represent as a pattern to
us, professing much complacence
therein; He with all right and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

subsistence from his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 9.</note>
in recompence for the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
benefits he did confer on
them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 11.</note> and of the excessive pains
he did endure for their good;<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 6.</note> this
he knew well, but yet did rather
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53984:32"/>
chuse to support himself by his own
labour, than any-wise to seem bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome
or troublesome to them;
<hi>These hands</hi> (said he) <hi>have ministred

               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 34, 35. 18. 3.</note>

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and to remember
the words of our Lord Jesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 9.</note> 
               <hi>how he
said,</hi>

               <hi>It is more blessed to give than
to receive.</hi> This was the practice of
him, who was <hi>in labours most abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant;</hi>
and such is the <hi>genius</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, who upon principles of
conscience, reason and honour, is
industrious. Of him it may be said,
as of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s good housewife, <hi>She
seeketh wool and flax,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 13. 14, 27.</note> 
               <hi>and worketh
willingly with her hands; she is like
the merchants ship, she bringeth her
food from afar; she looketh well to
her household, and eateth not the
bread of idleness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sloth is a base quality, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a mind wretchedly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and mean; which is content to
grovel in a despicable state; which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53984:33"/>
aimeth at no worthy thing, nor
pursueth any thing in a laudable
way; which disposeth a man to live
<hi>gratis</hi> (precariously) and ingrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the publick stock; as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant

of our heart, keeping off the

in honest employment, and
seriously intent thereon, his mind
is prepossessed and filled, so that
there is no room or vacancy for ill

rather than doe nothing, he was

to employ his thoughts, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

into his heart, and transported him
to that disastrous wickedness, which
supplied matter to so many trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
And the like instance the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

which did create to him so much
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53984:34"/>
sorrow, did make such a spot in his
life, and leave such a blur on his
memory; whence yet we may draw
some benefit, taking it as a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
document and warning, how
idleness doth expose the best men
to danger.</p>
            <p>Idleness is indeed the nursery of
sins, which as naturally grow up
therein as weeds in a neglected field,
or insects in a standing puddle;
<hi>Idleness teacheth much evil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus 33. 27.</note> It is the
general trap, whereby every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the mind being loose from care, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is ready to step in with his sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,

allurements, fleshly desires rise up;
proud, froward, wanton cogitations
slip in; ill company doth entice, ill
example is regarded, every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth object and impress it self
with great advantage and force;
men in such a case being
apt to close and comply
with temptations even to
divert their mind;<note place="margin">

Hence in places, where there
is least work, the worst sins do most
prevail; and idleness therefore was
by the Prophet reckoned one of the
three great sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> parents of
the rest,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 49.</note>

be too busie in matters not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, intruding themselves
into the affairs of their neighbours;
for there is a natural connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these things; since every

must be saying somewhat, to
spend his leisure, to uphold conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
to please himself and gratifie
others, to appear some-body among

of being quite out of employment;
wherefore not having the heart to

the boldness to meddle with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of other men; If he cannot

In fine, whoever hath no work at

chattings, the rash cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
the spitefull detractions which
are so rife in the World, and so
much poison all conversation, we
shall find the main root of them to
be a want of industry in men, or of
diligent attendance on their own
matters; which would so much
take up their spirit and time, that
they would have little heart or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to search into, or comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other mens actions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53984:36"/>
10. Let us consider that industry
is needfull in every condition and
station, in every calling and way
of life, in all relations, for our good
behaviour, and right discharge of
our duty in them. Without it we
cannot in any state act decently, or
usefully, either to the benefit and
satisfaction of others, or to our own
advantage and comfort.</p>
            <p>Are we rich? then is industry
requisite for keeping and securing
our wealth, for managing it wisely,
for employing it to its proper uses,
and best advantages; (in the service
of God, in beneficence to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
in advancing publick good)
so that we may render a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
to him, who hath entrusted
us with the stewardship thereof
Industry is very needfull to guard
us from the temptations and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
to which wealth doth expose
us, that it do not prove a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
snare, an unwieldy burthen, a
destructive poison and plague to us,
throwing us into pride and vanity,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53984:36"/>
into luxury, into stupidity, into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
solicitude, into a base
worldly and earthly temper of
heart, into a profane oblivion of
God, and of our own souls.</p>
            <p>Are we in conspicuous rank of
dignity, or in honour and repute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men? then is industry requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to keep us fast in that state, to
hold us from tumbling from that
pinnacle down into extreme dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
for then all eyes are upon
us, strictly observing what we doe,
and ready to pass censure on our
actions; so that great diligence is
necessary to approve our selves, and
shun obloquy.<note place="margin">
                  <l>Vitrea fama.</l>
                  <bibl>Hor.</bibl>
               </note> Nothing is more
brittle than honour, every little
thing hitting on it,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10. 1.</note> is able to break
it, and therefore without exceeding
care we cannot preserve it; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more variable or fickle than
the opinions of men (wherein ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
consisteth) it is therefore no
easie matter to fix, or detain them
in the same place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53984:37"/>
Honour cannot live without food,
or fewel; it must be nourished by
worthy actions; without a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
supply of them, it will decay,
languish, and pine away: Industry
therefore is required to keep it;
and no less is necessary to use it
well, in a due subordination to God's
honour, and reference to his service;
that instead of an ornament and
convenience, it do not prove a bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
mischief to us; puffing up our
minds with vain conceits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies,
inclining us to arrogance
and contempt of others, tempting
us by assuming to our selves to rob
God of his due glory; to decline
which evils great care is requisite;
we must have a steady balast, and
we must hold the rudder warily,
when we carry so great sail.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, are we poor,
and low in the World; or do we
lie under disgrace? then do we
much need industry to shun extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of want and ignominy; that
that we be not swallowed up, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53984:37"/>
overwhelmed by need or contempt;
to support us under our pressures,
to keep up our spirits from dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and disconsolateness; to preserve
us from impious discontentedness
and impatience: Industry is the
onely remedy of that condition,
enabling us to get out of it, retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a competence of wealth or
credit; or disposing us to bear it
handsomely, and with comfort; so
as not to become forelorn or abject
wretches.</p>
            <p>It is so needfull to every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and it is so for all vocations;
for,</p>
            <p>Is a man a Governour, or a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
in any capacity? then what
is he, but a publick servant, doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to continual labour, hired for the
wages of respect and pomp to wait
on his people; in providing for
their needs, protecting their safety,
preserving their peace and welfare?
where is he but on a stage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he cannot well act his part,
without vigilant attendance to his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53984:38"/>
charge, and constant activity in
performing all the functions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
He is engaged in great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and necessities of using ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
diligence; both in regard to
himself, and others. <hi>Homer</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of a Prince is a good one;
<hi>one who hath much people, and many
cares committed to him;</hi>
               <q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</q>
He must watchfully look to his own
steps, who is to guide others by his
authority, and his example. All his
actions require special conduct, not
onely his own credit and interest,
but the common welfare depending
thereon. He must heedfully advise
what to doe, he must diligently
execute what he resolveth on. He
hath the most ticklish things that
can be (the rights and interests,
the opinions and humours of men)
to manage. He hath his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to curb and guide, that
they be not perverted by any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53984:38"/>
respects, not swayed by any
unjust partiality, not corrupted by
flattery or fear. He will find, that
to wield power innocently, to bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
the sword of justice discreetly
and worthily, for the maintenance
of right, and encouragement of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
for the suppression of injury,
and correction of vice is a matter
of no small skill, or slight care.</p>
            <p>Industry is indeed a quality most
proper for persons of high rank and
dignity, or of great power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
who have special opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to employ it in weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to great advantage; whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
being of vast moment
do need answerable efforts to move
and guide them: The industry of
a Mechanick, or a Rustick, acting
in a low and narrow sphere can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
no great matter, and therefore
it self need not to be great; but the
industry of a Prince, of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
of a Gentleman may have a
large and potent influence, so as to
render a Nation, a County, a Town
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53984:39"/>
happy, prosperous, glorious, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in peace, in plenty, in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
it therefore for atchieving such
purposes need be, and should be
proportionably great; a small power
not being able to move a great
weight, nor a weak cause to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a mighty effect. Wherefore
<hi>Cicero</hi> recommending <hi>Pompey</hi> for a

I need not shew how needfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53984:39"/>
is for them: who knoweth
not that to be a good subject, doth
exact a carefull regard to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of superiours, and a painfull
diligence in observing them? that
to make a good servant fidelity and
diligence must concur; whereof the
first doth suppose the last, it being
a part of honesty in a servant to be
diligent; whence <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Neither can a man be a true
friend, or a good neighbour, or
any-wise a good relative, without
industry disposing him to undergo
pains, in performing good offices,
when-ever need doth require, or
occasion invite.</p>
            <p>In fine, it is palpable, that there
is no calling of any sort, from the
sceptre to the spade, the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof with any good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53984:40"/>
any credit, any satisfaction
doth not demand much work of the
head, or of the hand, or of both.</p>
            <p>If wit or wisedom be the head, if
honesty be the heart, industry is
the right hand of every vocation;
without which the shrewdest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
and the best intention can exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
nothing.</p>
            <p>A sluggard is qualified for no
office, no calling, no station among
men; he is a mere no-body; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up room, pestering and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the World.</p>
            <p>11. It also may deserve our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that it is industry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the publick state of the World,
and of each Commonweal therein
is indebted for its being, in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
and embellishments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to life, advanced above rude
and sordid barbarism; yea whereto
mankind doth owe all that good
learning, that morality, those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements

us beyond brutes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53984:40"/>
To industrious study is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
the invention and perfection
of all those arts, whereby humane
life is civilized, and the World cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
with numberless accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
ornaments and beauties.</p>
            <p>All the comely, the stately, the
pleasant, and usefull works, which
we do view with delight, or enjoy
with comfort, industry did contrive
them, industry did frame them.</p>
            <p>Industry reared those magnificent
Fabricks, and those commodious
houses; it formed those goodly
Pictures and Statues; it raised those
convenient Causeways, those Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
those Aqueducts; it planted
those fine Gardens with various
Flowers and Fruits; it cloathed
those pleasant Fields with Corn and
Grass; it built those Ships, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we plow the Seas, reaping the
Commodities of foreign Regions.
It hath subjected all Creatures to
our Command and Service, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

to catch the wildest, to render the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53984:41"/>
gentler sort most tractable, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to us. It taught us from the
wool of the sheep, from the hair of
the goat, from the labours of the
silk-worm to weave us cloaths, to
keep us warm, to make us fine and
gay. It helped us from the inmost
bowels of the Earth to fetch divers
needfull tools and utensils.</p>
            <p>It collected mankind into Cities,
and compacted them into orderly
Societies, and devised wholsome
Laws, under shelter whereof we
enjoy safety and peace, wealth and
plenty, mutual succour and defence,
sweet conversation and beneficial
commerce.</p>

We may easily observe every

toward the end for which it
was designed, indefatigably exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the powers, with which it is
endewed; diligently observing the

by considerations peculiar to us as

13. Lastly, If we consider, we
shall find the root and source of all
the inconveniences, the mischiefs,
the wants, of which we are so apt
to complain, to be our sloth; and
that there is hardly any of them,
which commonly we might not
easily prevent or remove by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry:
Why is any man a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
why contemptible, why igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
why vitious, why miserable?
why, but for this one reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is slothfull; because he will
not labour to rid himself of those
evils? What could we want, if we
would but take the pains to seek it,
either by our industry, or by our
devotion? for where the first will
not doe, the second cannot fail, to
procure any good thing from him,
who giveth <hi>to all men liberally,</hi>

            <p>INdustry is a very eminent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
being an ingredient (or
the parent) of all other vertues,
of constant use upon all occasions,
and having influence upon all our
affairs.</p>
            <p>For it is our nature framed; all
our powers of soul and body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fitted for it, tending to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53984:46"/>
it for their preservation and
perfection.</p>
            <p>We were designed for it in our first
happy state; and upon our lapse
thence were farther doomed to it,
as the sole remedy of our needs and
the inconveniences, to which we
became exposed. For</p>
            <p>Without it we cannot well su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
or secure our life in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any comfort or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
we must work to earn our
food, our cloathing, our shelter;
and to supply every indigency of
accommodations, which our nature
doth crave.</p>
            <p>To it God hath annexed the best,
and most desirable rewards; success
to our undertakings, wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
wisedom, vertue, salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all which as they flow from God's
bounty, and depend on his blessing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so from them they are usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to us through our industry,
as the ordinary chanel and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of attaining them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:53984:46"/>
It is requisite to us even for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
ease, and preventing a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of immoderate labour.</p>
            <p>It is in it self sweet and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory;
as freeing our mind from
distraction, and wrecking irresolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as feeding us with good hope,
and yielding a foretaste of its good
fruits.</p>
            <p>It furnisheth us with courage to
attempt, and resolution to atchieve
things needfull, worthy of us, and
profitable to us.</p>
            <p>It is attended with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and chearfull reflexions, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
well spent our time, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
our talents to good advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>It sweetneth our enjoyments, and
seasoneth our attainments with a
delightfull relish.</p>
            <p>It is the guard of innocence, and
barreth out temptations to vice, to
wantonness, to vain curiosity and
pragmaticalness.</p>
            <p>It argueth an ingenuous and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
disposition of soul; aspiring
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53984:47"/>
to worthy things, and pursuing
them in the fairest way; disdaining
to enjoy the common benefits, or
the fruits of other mens labour
without deserving them from the
World, and requiting it for them.</p>
            <p>It is necessary for every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and station, for every calling,
for every relation; no man without
it being able to deport himself well
in any state, to manage any busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to discharge any sort of duty.</p>
            <p>To it the World is indebted for
all the culture, which advanceth it
above rude and sordid barbarism;
for whatever in common life is
stately, or comely, or usefull, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
hath contrived it, industry
hath composed and framed it.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to us by all
sort of patterns considerable; for
all nature is continually busie and
active in tendency toward its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
designs; Heaven and Earth do
work in uncessant motion; Every
living Creature is employed in prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
for its sustenance; The blessed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53984:47"/>
Spirits are always on the wing in
dispatching the commands of God,
and ministring succour to us; God
himself is ever watchfull, and ever
busie in preserving the World, and
providing for the needs of every
Creature.</p>
            <p>The lives of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi>
of all the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
have been more exemplary;
no vertue being more conspicuous
in their practice than industry in
performing the hard duties, and
painfull tasks imposed on them for
the service of God, and the benefit
of mankind.</p>
            <p>Such is the vertue upon which
I have formerly discoursed in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and at large, but shall now more

(that is to undertake it) this is the
rule; the nature and needfulness
whereof we shall declare.</p>

every good purpose and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

            <p>But our business, according to the

is suited; in which station he

providence fairly doth translate
him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 22.</note> and during his abode therein
diligently to execute the work

            <p>Every man is a member of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

and of the Christian-church;
in relation to the latter whereof
St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us (and what he saith

endowed with competent abilities to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53984:61"/>
discharge some function, usefull to
common good, or at least needfull
to his own sustenance; to every one
some talent is committed, which in
subordination to God's service he
may improve to the benefit of the
World, God's temporal, or of the
Church, God's spiritual Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is plainly necessary, that the
greatest part of men should have a
determinate work allotted to them,
that they may support their life and
get their food without being injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
offensive, or burthensome to
others; for their living, they must
either follow some trade, or they
must shark and filch, or they must
beg, or they must starve.</p>
            <p>And the rest are obliged to doe
somewhat conducible to publick
good, that they may deserve to live:
for a drone should not be among the
bees; nor hath right to devour the
hony: If any man doth pretend, or
presume that he hath nothing to
doe but to eat, to sleep, to play, to
laugh; to enjoy his ease, his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53984:62"/>
his humour, he thereby doth
as it were disclaim a reasonable title
of living among men, and sharing
in the fruits of their industry; he,
in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s judgment, should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
of food, for <hi>this</hi> (saith the
Holy <hi>Apostle) we commanded you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>that
if any man would not work, neither
should he eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an one in the body of men,
what is he but an unnatural excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,
sucking nutriment from it,
without yielding ornament or use?
what is he but a wen deforming and
encombring the body, or a canker
infesting and corrupting it?</p>
            <p>As no man (at least with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
convenience and comfort) can
live in the World, without being
obliged to divers other men for their
help in providing accommodations
for him, so justice and ingenuity
(corroborated by divine sanctions)
do require of him, that in commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he, one way or other, should
undertake some pains redounding to
the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:53984:62"/>
So hath the great Authour of
Order distributed the ranks and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of men in order to mutual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and comfort; that one man
should plow, another thresh, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grind, another labour at the
forge, another knit or weave; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sail, another trade, another su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravise
all these, labouring to keep
them all in order and peace; that
one should work with his hands
and feet, another with his head
and tongue; all conspiring to one
common end, the welfare of the
whole, and the supply of what is
usefull to each particular member;
Every man so reciprocally obliging
and being obliged; the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to the Husbandman for
his bread, to the Weaver for his
cloaths, to the Mason for his palace,
to the Smith for his sword; those
being all obliged to him for his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
care in protecting them; for
their security in pursuing the work,
and enjoying the fruit of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:53984:63"/>
So every man hath a calling, and
proper business; whereto that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
is required, I need not much
to prove, the thing it self in reason
and experience being so clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
for what business can be well
dispatched, what success can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to any undertaking, in what
calling can any man thrive without
industry? what business is there that
will go on of it self, or proceed to
any good issue, if we do not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
look to it, steadily hold it in
its course, constantly push and drive
it forward? It is true as in nature,
so in all affairs, <hi>Nihil movet non
motum,</hi> nothing moveth without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moved.</p>
            <p>Our own interest should move
us to be industrious in our calling,
that we may obtain the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
of being so in a comfortable
and creditable subsistence; that we
may not suffer the damages and
wants, the disappointments and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
ensuing on sloth; but the
chief motive should be from piety
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53984:63"/>
and conscience; for that it is a duty
which we owe to God. For God
having placed us in our station;
he having apportioned to us our
task, we being in transaction of our
business his servants, we do owe to
him that necessary property of good
servants, without which fidelity
cannot subsist; for how can he be
looked on as a faithfull servant,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 2.</note> who
doth not effectually perform the
work charged on him? or diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
execute the orders of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth injoin servants, that
they should <hi>in all things obey their
Masters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 22.</note> with conscientious regard
to God,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 5.</note> as therein performing ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 22, 23.</note> and expecting recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
from him; And of Princes
he saith, that they in dispensation
of justice, enacting Laws, imposing
Taxes, and all political administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 6.</note>
are <hi>the Ministers of God,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>attending constantly upon
this very thing:</hi> And if these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
the highest and lowest of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53984:64"/>
all vocations, are services of God;
if the highest upon that score be
tied to so much diligence, then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all middle places, upon the same
accompt of conscience toward God,
do exact no less.</p>
            <p>If he that hath one talent, and
he that hath ten must both improve
them for God's interest, then he
that hath two, or three, or more, is
obliged to the same duty proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.</p>
            <p>Every one should consider the
World as the family of that great
<hi>Pater-familias (of whom the whole
family in heaven and earth is named</hi>)
and himself as an officer or servant
therein,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 15.</note> by God's will and designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
constituted in that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
into which providence hath

            <p>And he that with diligence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
his respective duty (be it
high and honourable, or mean and
contemptible in outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)
will please God, as keeping
good order, and as being usefull to
his service; so that upon the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
God will say to him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Well
done good and faithfull servant, thou
hast been faithfull over a few things;

things;</hi>

(behaving himself carelesly, or slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishly
in his business) will offend
God, as committing disorder, and
as being unprofitable;</p>
            <p>He committeth disorder accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>We hear
there are some, which walk among you

words are spoken in relation to one,
who being a flatterer or sluggard in
his calling did not improve the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
talent entrusted with him for
God's service.</p>
            <p>In fine, if we are conscientiously
industrious in our vocation, we shall
assuredly find the blessing of God
thereon; and that he thereby will
convey good success, comfort, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
wealth, a fair reputation, all
desirable good unto us; for as all
these things are promised to indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
so the promise especially doth
belong to that industry, which a
man doth exercise in an orderly
course of action in his own way;
or rather in God's way, wherein
divine providence hath set him.</p>
            <p>An irregular or impertinent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriousness,
out of a man's calling
or sphere; a being diligent in other
mens affairs, invading their office,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53984:65"/>
(as if I a Priest will be trading, a
Layman preaching) may not claim
the benefit of those promises, or
the blessings of industry; But a
Husbandman, who (with conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
regard to God, and confidence
in him) is painfull in tilling his
ground,<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 11.</note> may expect a good crop; a
Merchant who (upon the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
with the like disposition)
earnestly followeth his trade, may
hope for safe voyages and good
markets;<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 4. 13. 11.</note> a Prince carefully mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his affairs may look for peace
and prosperity to his countrey; a
Scholar studying hard may be well
assured of getting knowledge, and
finding truth; all who with honest
diligence constantly do pursue their
business may confidently and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
hope to reap the advantages
sutable to it from the favourable
blessing of God. So that we have
all reason to observe the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s
precept, <hi>not to be slothfull in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:53984:66"/>
I should apply this doctrine to
our own case, urging its practice
by considerations peculiar to our
vocation; but having already passed
the bounds of time, I reserve the
doing it to another opportunity.</p>
            <p>Now the God of peace sanctifie you

INDUSTRY
IN OUR
Particular Calling,
AS
GENTLEMEN.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ROM. XII. 11.</bibl>
               <q>Not slothfull in business.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have largely treated upon the
duty recommended in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and urged the observance
of it in general, at a distance; I
now intend more particularly and
closely to apply it, in reference to
those persons, who seem more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
obliged to it, and whose ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it may prove of greatest
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53984:67"/>
consequence to publick good; the
which application may also be most
sutable and profitable to this audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
those persons are of two
sorts; the one <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the other
<hi>Scholars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The <hi>First</hi> place, as civility
demandeth, we assign to <hi>Gentlemen;</hi>
or persons of eminent rank in the
World, well allied, graced with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and furnished with wealth;
the which sort of persons I conceive
in a high degree obliged to exercise
industry in business.</p>
            <p>This at first hearing may seem a
little paradoxical and strange; for
who have less business than Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who do need less industry,
than they? He that hath a fair estate,
and can live on his means, what hath
he to doe, what labour or trouble
can be exacted of him; what hath
he to think on, or trouble his head
with, but how to invent recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and pastimes to divert himself,
and spend his wast leisure pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53984:67"/>
why should not he be allowed
to enjoy himself, and the benefits,
which nature or fortune have freely
dispenced to him, as he thinketh
best, without offence? why may he
not say with the rich man in the
<hi>Gospel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 12. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Soul thou hast much goods laid
up for many years; take thine ease,
eat, drink and be merry?</hi> Is it not
often said by the <hi>Wiseman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles 2. 24. 3. 22. 5. 18. 8. 15.</note> that there
is <hi>nothing better under the sun, than
that a man should make his soul to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
good</hi> in a chearfull and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
fruition of his estate? Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the passable notion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,
<hi>What is a Gentleman but his
pleasure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be true, if a Gentleman be
nothing else but this; then truly he
is a sad piece, the most inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the most despicable, the most
pitifull and wretched Creature in
the World: If it is his privilege to
doe nothing, it is his privilege to
be most unhappy; and to be so will
be his fate, if he live according to
it; for he that is of no worth or
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53984:68"/>
use, who produceth no beneficial
fruit, who performeth no service
to God, or to the World, what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
can he have to happiness, what
capacity thereof? what reward can
he claim, what comfort can he
feel? to what temptations is he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
what guilts will he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur?</p>
            <p>But in truth it is far otherwise;
to suppose that a Gentleman is loose
from business is a great mistake;
for indeed no man hath more to
doe, no man lieth under greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
to industry than he.</p>
            <p>He is deeply obliged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
busie in more ways than
other men who have but one sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
calling or occupation allotted to
them; and that upon a triple ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt;
in respect to God, to the
World, and to himself.</p>
            <p>1. He is first obliged to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
employment in respect to
God.</p>
            <p>He out of a gratefull regard to
divine bounty for the eminency of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53984:68"/>
his station, adorned with dignity
and repute, for the plentifull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
and comforts of his
life, for his exemption from those
pinching wants, those meaner cares,
those sordid entertainments, and
those toilsome drudgeries, to which
other men are subject, is bound to
be more diligent in God's service,
employing all the advantages of his
state to the glory of his munificent
benefactour, to whose good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
alone he doth owe them; for
<hi>who maketh him to differ</hi> from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note>
and <hi>what hath he that he did
not receive</hi> from God's free bounty?</p>
            <p>In proportion to the bulk of his
fortune his heart should be enlarged
with a thankfull sense of God's
goodness to him; his mouth should
ever be filled with acknowledgment
and praise, he should always be
ready to express his gratefull resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so great and peculiar obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
            <p>He should dedicate larger portions
of that free leisure, which God hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53984:69"/>
granted to him, in waiting upon
God, and constant performances of
devotion.</p>
            <p>He in frequently reflecting on the
particular ample favours of God to
him should imitate the holy <hi>Psalmist,</hi>
that illustrious pattern of great and
fortunate men; saying after him,
with his spirit, and disposition of
soul;<note place="margin">Psal. 71. 21-</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast brought me to great
honour, and comforted me on every
side, therefore will I praise thee and
thy faithfulness, O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 30. 7-</note> by thy favour thou hast made
my mountain to stand strong:<note place="margin">Psal. 31. 8.</note> Thou
hast set my feet in a large room:<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 5.</note> Thou
preparest a table before me;<note place="margin">Psal. 30. 12.</note>—thou
anointest my head with oil, my cup
runneth over;—to the end that my
glory may sing praise unto thee, and
not be silent: The Lord is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mine inheritance, and of my
cup; thou maintainest my lot; The
lines are fallen unto me in pleasant
places,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 5.</note> yea I have a goodly heritage;
<hi>therefore</hi> I will bless the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:53984:69"/>
In conceiving such meditations
his head and his heart should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
be employed; as also in
contriving ways of declaring and
discharging real gratitude; asking
himself,<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 12.</note> 
               <hi>What shall I render unto the
Lord for all his benefits?</hi> What shall
I render to him, not onely as a man
for all the gifts of nature, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
for all the blessings of grace,
but as a Gentleman also, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
advantages of this my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
beyond so many of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
by special providence indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to me?</p>
            <p>He hath all the common duties
of piety, of charity, of sobriety to
discharge with fidelity; for being a
Gentleman doth not exempt him
from being a Christian, but rather
more strictly doth engage him to
be such in a higher degree than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
It is an obligation peculiarly
incumbent on him, in return for
God's peculiar favours, to pay God all
due obedience, and to exercise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in all good works; disobedience
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53984:70"/>
being a more heinous crime in him
than in others, who have not such
encouragements to serve God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His obedience may be inculcated
by those arguments which</hi> Joshua
<hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>did use in pressing it on
the</hi> Israelites;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 24.</note> Onely (<hi>said</hi> Samuel)
fear the Lord and serve him in truth,
for consider how great things God hath
done for you; <hi>and,</hi> I have given you
(<hi>saith God by</hi> Joshua) a land for
which ye did not labour;<note place="margin">Josh. 24. 13.</note> and cities
which ye built not, and ye dwell in
them; Of the vineyards and olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
which ye planted not, do ye
eat; Now therefore fear the Lord,
and serve him in sincerity and in
truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His disobedience may be aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 9. 25—(Isa. 63. 9. Psal. 106. 6. Jer. 2. 7. Ezek. 16. 7—1 Sam. 15. 17. 2 Sam. 12. 7. 1 King. 16.—) 26, 35.</note>
               <hi>as</hi> Nehemiah <hi>did that of the</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
They took strong cities, and
a fat land, and possessed houses full of
all goods, wells digged, vineyards

so they did eat and were

themselves in thy great goodness; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53984:70"/>
they were disobedient and
rebelled against thee, and cast thy

estate, be carefull to preserve it, for
the same good purpose.</p>
            <p>It is his business to cultivate his
mind with knowledge, with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
dispositions, with all worthy
accomplishments befitting his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53984:73"/>
and qualifying him for honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
action; so that he may excell,
and bear himself above the vulgar le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
no less in real inward worth, than
in exteriour garb; that he be not a
Gentleman merely in name or shew.</p>
            <p>It is his business (and that no
slight and easie business) to eschew
the vices,<note place="margin">Arduae nam res est opibus non tradere mores.</note> to check the passions, to
withstand the temptations, to which
his condition is liable; taking heed,
that his wealth, honour and power
do not betray him unto pride, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or contempt of his poorer
brethren; unto injustice, or oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
unto luxury, and riotous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
unto sloth, stupidity, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of God, and irreligious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness.</p>
            <p>It is a business especially incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on him to be carefull of his
ways, that they may have good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on others, who are apt to
look upon him as their guide and
pattern.</p>
            <p>He should labour and study to be
a leader unto vertue, and a notable
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53984:73"/>
promoter thereof; directing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
men thereto by his exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conversation; encouraging them
by his countenance and authority;
rewarding the goodness of meaner
people by his bounty and favour:
He should be such a Gentleman as
<hi>Noah,</hi> who <hi>preached righteousness</hi> by
his words and works before a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
World.</p>
            <p>Such particular affairs hath every
person of quality, credit, wealth
and interest, allotted to him by
God, and laid on him as duties; the
which to discharge faithfully will
enough employ a man, and doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
industry, much care, much
pains, excluding sloth and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
so that it is impossible for a
sluggard to be a worthy Gentleman,
vertuously disposed, a charitable
neighbour, a good patriot, a good
husband of his estate; any thing of
that, to which God, by setting him
in such a station, doth call him.</p>
            <p>Thus is a Gentleman obliged to
industry in respect of God, who just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53984:74"/>
doth exact those labours of piety,
charity, and all vertue from him.
Farther,</p>
            <p>2. He hath also obligations to
mankind, demanding industry from
him, upon accompts of common
humanity, equity and ingenuity.
For,</p>
            <p>How can he fairly subsist upon
the common industry of mankind
without bearing a share thereof?
how can he well satisfie himself to
dwell statelily, to feed daintily, to
be finely clad, to maintain a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
retinue merely upon the sweat
and toil of others, without himself
rendring a compensation, or making
some competent returns of care and
pain, redounding to the good of his
neighbour?</p>
            <p>How can he justly claim, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expect from the World the
respect agreeable to his rank, if he
doth not by worthy performances
conduce to the benefit of it? can
men be obliged to regard those, from
whom they receive no good?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53984:74"/>
If no Gentleman be tyed to serve
the publick, or to yield help in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
the common burthens, and
supplying the needs of mankind,
then is the whole order merely a
burthen and an offence to the World;
a race of drones, a pack of ciphers
in the commonwealth, standing for
nothing, deserving no consideration
or regard: And if any are bound,
then all are; for why should the
whole burthen lie on some, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are exempted?</p>
            <p>It is indeed supposed, that all are
bound thereto, seeing that all have
recompences publickly allowed to
them upon such consideration; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
respects and privileges peculiar
to the order, grounded upon this
supposition, that they deserve such
advantages by conferring notable
benefit to the publick; the which
indeed it were an arrogance to seek,
and an iniquity to accept for doing
nothing.</p>
            <p>It is an unsufferable pride for any
man to pretend or conceit himself
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53984:75"/>
to differ so much from his brethren,
that he may be allowed to live in
ease and sloth, while the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are subject to continual toil and
trouble. Moreover,</p>
            <p>3. A Gentleman is bound to be
industrious for his own sake; it is a
duty which he oweth to himself, to
his honour, to his interest, to his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
He cannot without industry
continue like himself, or maintain
the honour and repute becoming his
quality and state; or secure himself
from contempt and disgrace; for to
be honourable and slothfull are
things inconsistent; seeing honour
doth not grow, nor can subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
undertaking worthy designs,
constantly pursuing them, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
atchieving them; it is the fruit
and reward of such actions, which
are not performed with ease.</p>
            <p>External respect, and semblance
of honour, for the sake of publick
order, may be due to an exteriour
rank, or title; but to pay this is not
to honour the person, but his title,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53984:75"/>
because it is supposed that men of
real worth and use do bear it; or
lest by refusing it to one, the
whole order may seem disrespected;
but yet true honour or mental e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
is not due upon such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts;
nor is it possible to render
it unto any person, who doth not
by worthy qualities, and good deeds
appear to merit it.</p>
            <p>Nor can a Gentleman without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
uphold his real interests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the attempts of envy, of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
of flattery, of sycophantry, of
avarice, to which his condition is
obnoxious; to preserve his wealth
and estate, which are the supports
of his quality, he must endure care
and pains; otherwise he will by
greedy harpyes and crafty lurchers
be rifled or cozened of his substance;
it will of it self go to wreck, and be
imbezill'd by negligence.</p>
            <p>He cannot without industry guard
his personal welfare from manifold
inconveniences, molestations and
mischiefs; Idleness it self will be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53984:76"/>
very troublesome and irksome to
him. His time will lie upon his
hands, as a pestring encumbrance.
His mind will be infested with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
distractions and distempers;
vain and sad thoughts, foul lusts,
and unquiet passions will spring up
therein, as weeds in a neglected soil.
His body will languish, and become
destitute of health, of vigour, of
activity, for want of due exercise.
All the mischiefs which naturally
do spring from sloth and stupidity
will seise upon him.</p>
            <p>4. Thus upon various accompts
a Gentleman is engaged to business,
and concerned to exercise industry
therein; we may add, that indeed
the very nature of gentility, or the
true notion of a Gentleman doth
imply so much.</p>
            <p>For what, I pray, is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
what properties hath he, what
qualities are characteristical or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to him, whereby he is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from others, and raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the vulgar? are they not espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53984:76"/>
two, <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Courtesie?</hi>
which he that wanteth is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than equivocally a Gentleman,
as an Image or a Carkase is a Man;
without which gentility in a conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
degree is no more than a vain
shew or an empty name: And these
plainly do involve industry, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
slothfulness; for <hi>Courage</hi> doth
prompt boldly to undertake, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
to dispatch great enterprises,
and employments of difficulty; It is
not seen in a flaunting garb, or strut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
deportment; not in hectorly,
ruffian-like swaggering or huffing;
not in high looks, or big words;
but in stout and gallant deeds, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
vigour of mind and heart
to atcheive them; how can a man
otherwise approve himself for cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous,
than by signalizing himself
in such a way?</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Courtesie,</hi> how otherwise
can it be well displayed, than in
sedulous activity for the good of
men? It surely doth not consist in
modish forms of address or comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53984:77"/>
expressions, or hollow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
(commonly void of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or of sincerity;) but in real
performances of beneficence, when
occasion doth invite, and in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for opportunities to doe good;
the which practice is accompanied
with some care and pain, adding a
price to it; for an easie courtesie is
therefore small because easie, and
may be deemed to proceed rather
from ordinary humanity, than from
gentile disposition; so that in fine
he alone doth appear truely a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who hath the heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
hard tasks for publick good,
and willingly taketh pains to oblige
his neighbours and friends.</p>
            <p>5. The work indeed of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is not so gross, but it may be
as smart and painfull as any other.
For all hard work is not manual;
there are other instruments of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
beside the plow, the spade, the
hammer, the shuttle; nor doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
work produce sweat, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
tiring of body; the head may
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53984:77"/>
work hard in contrivance of good
designs, the tongue may be very
active in dispensing advice, persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
comfort, and edification in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
A man may bestir himself in
<hi>going about to doe good;</hi> these are
works employing the cleanly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>6. In such works it was, that the
truest and greatest pattern of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
that ever was did employ
himself: who was that? Even our
Lord himself; for he had no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
trade, or profession; no man
can be more loose from any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to the World than he
was; no man had less need of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
or pains-taking than he; for
he had a vast estate, being <hi>heir of
all things,</hi> all the World being at his
disposal, yea infinitely more, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his power with a word to
create whatever he would to serve
his need, or satisfie his pleasure;
Omnipotency being his treasure and
supply; He had a retinue of Angels
to wait on him, and minister to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53984:78"/>
him; whatever sufficiency any man
can fansie to himself to dispense
with his taking pains, that had he
in a far higher degree; Yet did he
find work for himself, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
was employed in performing
service to God, and imparting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to men;<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 11.</note> nor was ever indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
exercised upon Earth compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen therefore would doe
well to make him the pattern of
their life, to whose industry they
must be beholden for their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
in order whereto we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them to his grace.</p>

            <p>I Proceed to the other sort of
persons, whom we did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
namely</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Scholars,</hi> and that on them
particularly great engagements do
lie to be industrious, is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
from various considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:53984:79"/>
The nature and design of this
calling doth suppose industry; the
matter, and extent of it doth require
industry; the worth of it doth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserve industry. We are in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
gratitude to God, in charity to
men, in due regard to our selves
bound unto it.</p>
            <p>1. First, I say, the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of our calling doth suppose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry:<note place="margin">Eccles 2. 21.</note>
               <hi>There is</hi> (saith the divine
<hi>Preacher) a man, whose labour is in
wisedom, in knowledge, and in equity;</hi>
Such men are Scholars; so that we
are indeed no Scholars, but absurd
usurpers of the name, if we are not
laborious; for what is a Scholar,
but one who retireth his person, and
avocateth his mind from other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations,
and worldly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

that he may <gap reason="foreign">

on study and learning, in the
search of truth, the quest of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the improvement of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Wherefore an idle Scholar, a
lazy student, a sluggish man of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is nonsense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:53984:79"/>
What is learning but a diligent
attendance to instruction of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
skilled in any knowledge, and
conveying their notions to us in
word or writing?</p>
            <p>What is study, but an earnest,
steady, persevering application of
mind to some matter, on which we
fix our thoughts, with intent to see
through it; what in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
are these <hi>Scholastick</hi> occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Prov. 2. 2.</note>
but <hi>inclining the ear,</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
our heart to understanding?</hi>
than which commonly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more laborious, more strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nature, and more tiring our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
whence it is well compared
to the most painfull exercises of
body and soul.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wise-man</hi> advising men to
seek wisedom, the which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
design of our calling, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
that work to be like digging
in the mines for silver, and like
searching all about for concealed
treasure; than which there can
hardly be any more difficult and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53984:80"/>
painfull task, <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou
seekest her as silver,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and searchest for
her as for hid treasures, then shalt
thou understand</hi>—Otherwhere he
compareth the same work to assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
watching and waiting, like that
of a guard or a client, which are
the greatest instances of diligence,
<hi>Blessed</hi> (saith he; or wisedom by
him saith,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 34.</note> blessed) <hi>is the man that
heareth me, watching daily at my
gates, waiting at the posts of my
doors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore if we will approve
our selves to be what we are called,
and what we pretend to be, if we
will avoid being Impostours, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a name not due to us, we
must not be slothfull. Farther,</p>
            <p>2. The matter and extent of our
business doth require industry from
us: the matter of it, which is truth
and knowledge; the extent, which
is very large and comprehensive,
taking in all truth, all knowledge;
worthy our study, and usefull for
the designs of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:53984:80"/>
Our business is to find truth;
the which (even in matters of high
importance) is not easily to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
being (as a vain of silver,
encompassed with earth, and mixed
with dross) deeply laid in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
of things, wrapt up in false
appearances, entangled with objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and perplexed with debates;
being therefore not readily discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
especially by minds clouded
with prejudices, lusts, passions, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
affections, appetites of honour
and interest; whence to descry it
requireth the most curious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and solicitous circumspection
that can be; together with great
pains in the preparation and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our minds toward the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
of it.</p>
            <p>Our business is to attain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
not concerning obvious and
vulgar matters, but about sublime,
abstruse, intricate and knotty sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
remote from common obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and sense; to get sure and
exact notions about which will try
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53984:81"/>
the best forces of our mind with
their utmost endeavours; in firmly
setling principles, in strictly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
consequences, in orderly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting
conclusions, in faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
what we learn by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
and study.</p>
            <p>And if to get a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
about a few things, or to be
reasonably skilfull in any sort of
learning, be difficult, how much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
doth it require to be well
seen in many, or to have waded
through the vast compass of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in no part whereof a Scholar
may conveniently or handsomely
be ignorant; seeing there is such a
connexion of things, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of notions, that one part of
learning doth confer light to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that a man can hardly well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any thing without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divers other things; that he will
be a lame Scholar, who hath not an
insight into many kinds of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that he can hardly be a good
Scholar, who is not a general one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:53984:81"/>
To understand so many Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(which are the shells of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,)
to comprehend so many
Sciences (full of various theoremes
and problemes) to peruse so many
Histories (of ancient and modern
times;) to know the World, both
natural and humane; to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the various inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
inquiries, opinions and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of learned men; to skill the
arts of expressing our mind, and
imparting our conceptions with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
so as to instruct or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
others; these are works in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
which will exercise and strain
all our faculties (our reason, our
fancy, our memory) in painfull
study.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of such things is
not innate to us; it doth not of
it self spring up in our minds; it
is not any-wise incident by chance,
or infused by grace (except rarely
by miracle;) common observation
doth not produce it; it cannot be
purchased at any rate, except by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53984:82"/>
that, for which it was said of old,
<hi>the gods sell all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dii laboribus omnia ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt.</note> that is for
pains; without which the best wit
and greatest capacity may not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a man learned; as the best soil
will not yield good fruit or grain,
if they be not planted or sown
therein.</p>
            <p>Consider, if you please, what a
Scholar <hi>Solomon</hi> was; Beside his skill
in <hi>politicks,</hi> which was his principal
faculty and profession, whereby he
did with admirable dexterity and
prudence manage the affairs of that

            </p>
            <p>He was well versed in <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
for it is said,<note place="margin">1 Kings 4. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

skill he left for a monument
the most glorious structure that
ever stood on earth.</p>
            <p>He was very skilfull in Poetry

            <p>He had great ability in Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;<note place="margin">Sap. 7. 15.</note>
according to that in <hi>Wisedom,
God granted me to speak as I would;</hi>
and that in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The Preacher
sought to find out acceptable words;</hi>
a great instance of which faculty
we have in that admirable Prayer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53984:83"/>
of his composure,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8.</note> at the dedication
of the Temple.</p>
            <p>He did wonderfully excell in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks;</hi>
concerning which <hi>he spake
three thousand Proverbs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 4. 32.</note> or moral
Aphorisms;<note place="margin">Eccles 2. 9.</note> and <hi>Moreover</hi> (saith
<hi>Ecclesiastes) because the preacher was
wise, he still taught the people know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
yea he gave good heed, and
sought out, and set in order many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs;</hi>
the which did contain a
great variety of notable observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and usefull directions for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
life, couched in pithy expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Theology,</hi> as the study of
that was the chief study to which
he exhorteth others (as to <hi>the head,</hi>
or principal part <hi>of wisedom</hi>) so
questionless he was himself most
conversant therein;<note place="margin">Prov. 2. 5-</note> for proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he did leave so many excellent
theoremes, and precepts of divinity
to us.</p>
            <p>In fine, there is no sort of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to which he did not apply
his study; witness himself in those
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53984:83"/>
words,<note place="margin">Eccles 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>I gave my heart to seek and
search out by wisedom concerning all
things, that are done under heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a Scholar was He; and such
if we have a noble ambition to be,
we must use the course he did;
which was first in his heart to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
wisedom before all worldly
things; then to pray to God for it,
or for his blessing in our quest of it;
then to use the means of attaining it,
diligent searching, and hard study;
for that this was his method he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 25.</note> 
               <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>applyed my
heart, to know, and to search, and to
seek out wisedom, and the reason of
things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such considerations shew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of industry for a Scholar;
but</p>
            <p>3. The worth, and excellency,
and great utility, together with the
pleasantness of his vocation, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the highest industry, do super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add
much obligation thereto.</p>
            <p>We are much bound to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
out of ingenuity, and in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53984:84"/>
to God, who by his gratious
providence hath assigned to us a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
so worthy, an employment so
comfortable, a way of life no less
commodious, beneficial and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to our selves, than serviceable
to God, and usefull to the World.</p>
            <p>If we had our option and choice,
what calling could we desire before
this of any whereto men are affixed?
how could we better employ our
mind, or place our labour, or spend
our time, or pass our pilgrimage in
this World, than in scholastical oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations?</p>
            <p>It were hard to reckon up, or to
express the numberless great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of this calling, I shall therefore
onely touch some, which readily
fall under my thought, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
its value to us.</p>
            <p>It is a calling, the design whereof
conspireth with the general end of
our being; the perfection of our
nature in its endowments, and the
fruition of it in its best operations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:53984:84"/>
It is a calling, which doth not
employ us in bodily toil, in worldly
care, in pursuit of trivial affairs, in
sordid drudgeries; but in those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
operations of soul, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of truth, and attainment
of wisedom; which are the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
exercises of our reason, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
entertainments of our mind;
the most pretious wealth, and most
beautifull ornaments of our soul;
whereby our faculties are improved,
are polished and refined, are enlarged
in their power and use by habitual
accessions: the which are conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our own greatest profit and
benefit, as serving to rectify our
wills,<note place="margin">Prov. 2. 4, 10.</note> to compose our affections, to
guide our lives in the ways of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
to bring us unto felicity.</p>
            <p>It is a calling, which being duly
followed will most sever us from the
vulgar sort of men, and advance us
above the common pitch; endew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us with light to see farther than
other men, disposing us to affect
better things, and to slight those
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53984:85"/>
meaner objects of humane desire,
on which men commonly dote:
freeing us from the erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
and from the perverse affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of common people. It is said
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>men of learning are double-sighted;</hi>
but it is true, that in many cases they
see infinitely farther than a vulgar
sight doth reach; and if a man by
serious study doth acquire a clear
and solid judgment of things, so as
to assign to each its due weight and
price; if he accordingly be inclined
in his heart to affect and pursue
them; if from clear and right noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things a meek and ingenuous
temper of mind, a command and
moderation of passions, a firm inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
and a cordial love of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
do spring, he thereby becometh
another kind of thing, much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from those brutish men (beasts
of the people) who blindly follow
the motions of their sensual appetite,
or the suggestions of their fancy, or
their mistaken prejudices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:53984:85"/>
It is a calling which hath these
considerable advantages, that by
virtue of improvement therein, we
can see with our own eyes, and
guide our selves by our reasons,
not being led blindfold about, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
precariously on the conduct
of others in matters of highest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to us. That we are exempted
from giddy credulity, from waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
levity, from fond admiration
of persons and things, being able
to distinguish of things, and to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
our judgments about them, and
to get an intimate acquaintance
with them, assuring to us their true
nature and worth: that we are also
thereby rescued from admiring our
selves, and that overweening self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedness,
of which the <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">Prov. 26. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The sluggard is wiser in his
own conceit, than seven men that can
render a reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a calling, whereby we are
qualified and enabled to doe God
service; to gratify his desires, to
promote his honour, to advance his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53984:86"/>
interests; to render his name glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the World; by teaching,
maintaining and propagating his
truth; by persuading men to render
their due love, reverence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him; than which we can
have no more honourable or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
employment; more like to
that of the glorious and blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>It is a calling, the due prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof doth ingratiate us with
God, and procureth his favour;
rendring us fit objects of his love,
and entitling us thereto in regard to
our qualities, and recompence of our
works;<note place="margin">Sap. 7. 28. (Psal. 5. 5.) Prov. 3. 4.</note> for <hi>God loveth none but him
that dwelleth with wisedom;</hi> and, <hi>So
shalt thou find favour and good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the sight of God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a calling, whereby with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
advantage we may benefit men,
and deserve well of the World;
drawing men to the knowledge and
service of God, reclaiming them
from errour and sin, rescuing them
from misery, and conducting them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53984:86"/>
to happiness; by clear instruction,
by faithfull admonition, by power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
exhortation; And what can be
more noble, than to be the lights of
the World, the guides of practice to
men, the authours of so much good,
so egregious benefactours to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
            <p>It is a calling most exempt from
the cares, the crosses, the turmoils,
the factious jars, the anxious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
the vexatious molestations
of the World; its business lying out
of the road of those mischiefs;
wholly lying in solitary retirement,
or being transacted in the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and ingenuous company.</p>
            <p>It is a calling least subject to any
danger or disappointment; wherein
we may well be assured not to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
or lose our labour; for the
Merchant indeed by manifold acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
may lose his voyage, or find
a bad market; the Husbandman may
plow and sow in vain; but the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hardly can fail of improving
his stock, and reaping a good crop
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53984:87"/>
of knowledge; especially if he study
with a conscientious mind, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reverence to God, imploring his
gratious help and blessing.</p>
            <p>It is a calling, the industry used
wherein doth abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
it self, by the pleasure and
sweetness; which it carrieth in it; so
that the more pains one taketh, the
more delight he findeth, feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
proportionably to grow in
knowledge; and that his work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
continually more easie to
him.</p>
            <p>It is a calling, the business where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
doth so exercise as not to weary,
so entertain as not to cloy us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not (as other occupations are)
a drawing in a mill, or a nauseous
(tedious) repetition of the same
work; but a continued progress to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fresh objects; our mind not
being staked to one or a few poor
matters, but having immense fields
of contemplation,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

everlastingly expatiate, with great
proficiency and pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:53984:87"/>
It is a calling which doth ever
afford plentifull fruit, even in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the conveniences of this
present and temporal state; the
which sufficiently will requite the
pains expended thereon: for if we
be honestly industrious we shall not
want success; and succeeding we
shall not want a competence of
wealth, of reputation, of interest
in the World: for concerning wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which is the result of honest
study, the <hi>Wise-man</hi> telleth us,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 18. 3. 16. 4. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and honour are with her, yea
durable riches, and righteousness:
Length of days are in her right
hand, and in her left hand riches
and honour: Exalt her, and she
shall promote thee, she shall bring
thee to honour, when thou dost em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
her; she shall give to thine
head an ornament of grace; a crown
of glory shall she deliver to thee;</hi> In
common experience, the wealth of
the mind doth qualifie for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which have good recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
annexed to them; and neither

It was a ridiculous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

as renowned for teaching the

for conquering it with his Sword?
is not one far oftner mentioned,
than the other; do not men hold
themselves much more obliged to
the learning of the Philosopher,
than to the valour of the Warriour?
Indeed the fame of all others is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to the pains of the Scholar,
and could not subsist but with and
by his fame, <hi>Dignum laude virum

it self and its subject together,

            <p>It is a calling that fitteth a man
for all conditions and fortunes; so
that he can enjoy prosperity with
moderation, and sustain adversity
with comfort; He that loveth a
Book will never want a faithfull
friend, a wholesome counsellour, a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53984:89"/>
chearfull companion, an effectual
comforter. By study, by reading,
by thinking one may innocently
divert, and pleasantly entertain
himself, as in all weathers, so in
all fortunes.</p>
            <p>In fine, it is a calling, which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>These things and much more
may be said of learning in general;
but if more distinctly we survey
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53984:90"/>
each part and each object of it; we

               <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation

observing the various appearances

enlarge our minds and advance
them above vulgar amusements,
and the admiration of those petty
things, about which men cark and

            <p>The study of <hi>Moral Philosophy,</hi>
how exceedingly beneficial may it
be to us, suggesting to us the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of reason concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and faculties of our soul, the
chief good and end of our life, the
way and means of attaining happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the best rules and methods of
practice; the distinctions between
good and evil; the nature of each
vertue, and motives to embrace it;
the rank wherein we stand in the
World, and the duties proper to
our relations; by rightly understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and estimating which things
we may know how to behave our
selves decently and soberly toward
our selves, justly and prudently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
our neighbours; we may
learn to correct our inclinations, to
regulate our appetites, to moderate
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53984:93"/>
our passions, to govern our actions,
to conduct and wield all our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
well in prosecution of our end;
so as to enjoy our being and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of life in constant quiet
and peace, with tranquillity and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of mind?</p>
            <p>But especially the study of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,</hi>
how numberless unexpressible
advantages doth it yield? for,</p>
            <p>It enlightneth our minds with the
best knowledge concerning the most
high and worthy objects, in order
to the most happy end, with the
firmest assurance.</p>
            <p>It certainly and perfectly doth
inform us concerning the nature and
attributes, the will and intentions,
the works and providence of God.</p>
            <p>It fully declareth to us our own
nature, our original, our designed
end, our whole duty, our certain
way of attaining eternal life, and
felicity.</p>
            <p>It exactly teacheth us how we
should demean our selves in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
piously toward God, justly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53984:93"/>
and charitably toward our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
soberly toward our selves;
without blame in the World, with
satisfaction of our conscience, with
assured hope of blessed rewards.</p>
            <p>It proposeth those encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and exhibiteth assurances of
those helps, which serve potently
to engage us in all good practice.</p>
            <p>It setteth before us a most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
and lively pattern of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
apt most clearly to direct,

to engage us thereto; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
instructing and inclining to
the practice of the most high and
hard duties, meekness, humility,
patience, self-denial, contempt of all
worldly vanities.</p>
            <p>It discovereth those sublime my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and stupendious wonders of
grace, whereby God hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
an incomprehensible kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to mankind,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 12.</note> and our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to correspondent gratitude.<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It representeth manifold argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and incentives to love God
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53984:94"/>
with most intense affection, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in him with most firm assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to delight in him continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>with joy unspeakable;</hi> which are
the noblest, the sweetest, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

            <p>It engageth us to study the Book

the contemplation of such objects?
Especially considering that this stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

by our guidance and incouragement

Now then, considering all these
advantages of our calling, if we by
our negligence or sluggishness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
do lose them, are we not very
ingratefull to God, who gave them,
as with a gratious intent for our
good, so with expectation that we
should improve them to his service?
If God had allotted to us the calling
of Rusticks, or of Artificers, we had
been impious in not diligently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it; but we are abominably
ingratefull in neglecting this most
incomparably excellent vocation.</p>
            <p>Are we not extremely defective
to our selves, if indulging a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
humour of laziness we will not
enjoy those sweet pleasures, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
those great profits to which
God in mercy calleth us?</p>
            <p>If <hi>Solomon</hi> said true,<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 8.</note> 
               <hi>He that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
wisedom, loveth his own soul, he
that keepeth understanding shall find
good;</hi> how little friends are we to
our selves, how neglectfull of our
own welfare, by not using the means
of getting wisedom?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:53984:96"/>
               <hi>The heart of him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>

what a fool then is he that
shunneth it? who, though it be his
way, and his special duty to seek it,
yet neglecteth it; chusing rather to
doe nothing, or to doe worse.</p>
            <p>And do we not deserve great
blame, displeasure and disgrace from
mankind, if having such opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of qualifying our selves to doe
good, and serve the publick, we by
our idleness render our selves worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and useless?</p>
            <p>How, being slothfull in our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
can we answer for our viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the wills, for abusing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for perverting the charity and
bounty of our worthy Founders and
Benefactours, who gave us the good
things we enjoy, not to maintain us
in idleness, but for supports and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
of our industry? how
can we excuse our selves from disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
and perfidious dealing, seeing
that we are admitted to these enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
under condition, and upon
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53984:96"/>
confidence (confirmed by our free
promises, and most solemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
of using them according to
their pious intent, that is in a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
prosecution of our studies, in
order to the service of God, and of
the publick?</p>
            <p>Let every Scholar, when he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
an hour, or sluggeth on his
bed but imagine, that he heareth
the voice of those glorious Kings,
or venerable Prelates, or worthy
Gentlemen, complaining thus, and
rating him; why, sluggard, dost
thou against my will possess my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state?
why dost thou presume to
occupy the place due to an industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
person? why dost thou forget,
or despise thy obligations to my
kindness? thou art an usurper, a
robber, or a purloiner of my goods,
which I never intended for such as
thee; I challenge thee of wrong to
my self, and of sacrilege toward my
God, to whose service I devoted
those his gifts to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:53984:97"/>
               <hi>How reproachfull will it be to us,
if that expostulation may concern
us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 16.</note> Wherefore is there a price in the
hand of a fool to get wisedom, seeing
he hath no heart to it?</p>
            <p>If to be a dunce, or a bungler in
any profession be shamefull, how
much more ignominious, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
to a Scholar to be such? from
whom all men expect, that he should
excell in intellectual abilities; and
be able to help others by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and advice.</p>
            <p>Nothing surely would more grate
on the heart of one, that hath a spark
of ingenuity, of modesty, of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
good nature, than to be liable
to such an imputation.</p>
            <p>To avoid it therefore (together
with all the guilt, and all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
attending on sloth) let each
of us in God's name, carefully mind
his business; And let the grace and
