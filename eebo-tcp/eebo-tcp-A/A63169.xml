            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>What an argument is that? You expect we ſhould prove you a Prieſt by witneſſes, which ſaw you take orders, but we know ſo much of your Religion, that none undertake to give the Sacrament in a wafer, or ſay Maſs, but a Prieſt: and you gave the Sacrament to that woman in a wafer, therefore you are a Prieſt.</p>

There needs not much to perſwade you that he who gives the Sacrament is a Prieſt, for in their Church they allow no one but a Prieſt to give the Sacrament, ſo there is one expreſs evidence againſt him: And now I muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you in one thing, that you are to give a Verdict not that he is a Prieſt, but that you believe him in your Conſcience upon the whole Evidence, to be a Prieſt. To make you do this here is one Poſitive Evidence.</p>
                  <p>The other man, when I came to examine him whether he ever heard the Priſoner ſay Maſs; he anſwered, that he heard him ſay ſomething in an unknown tongue, and that he was in a Surplice. This is as much as we could expect from one of their own Religion, who dare ſay no more than their Prieſts will give them leave to do. So Gentlemen I muſt leave it to you, whether or no you will not believe the Teſtimony of this real poſitive Witneſs, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Evidence of the other man: For you ſee in what dangers we are, I leave it upon your Conſciences whether you will let Prieſts eſcape who are the very peſts and dangers of Church and State; you had better be rid of one Prieſt than three Felons, ſo Gentlemen, I leave it to you.</p>

                  <p>Look you Gentlemen of the Jury, Here is as full and as poſitive an Evidence as can be againſt the Priſoner: The two firſt Witneſſes, <hi>Wilden</hi> and <hi>Jarvis,</hi> are poſitive. <hi>Wilden</hi> ſwears he heard him ſay his Prayers in an unknown Tongue; and further ſays, that he gave the Sacrament to ſeven or eight according to the manner of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in a Wafer, at Mrs. <hi>Stamford</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhampton. Jarvis</hi> the other Witneſs, ſwears that he hath been at Confeſſion with him, and hath oftentimes received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. Here are two other honeſt men, that ſpeak very full as to Circumſtances; ſo that in the whole you cannot have a more clear Evidence: And Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, it is to theſe ſorts of men we owe all the troubles and hazards we are in, the fear of the Kings Life, the Subverſion of our Government, and the loſs of our Religion. It is notorious by what they have done, that they are departed from the meekneſs and ſimplicity of Chriſts Doctrine, and would bring in a Religion of Blood and Tyranny amongſt us. As if God almighty were ſome Omnipotent Miſchief, that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and would be ſerved with the Sacrifices of humane blood. I need not ſay more to you, the matter's plain; I think you need not ſtir from the Bar, but do as you will.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, the maid when I came in, was making a Cheeſe in the Dairy, and I askt for Mrs. <hi>Monington,</hi> and ſhe told me ſhe was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſtraightway brought me up to her: Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi> in a little time fell into diſcourſe with me about Religion; and underſtanding what I was, deſired me to go into the Chamber with her.</p>

                  <p>I will give an account of it as well as I can remember: When we came up ſtairs, we turn'd in at a door on the right hand the Altar ſtood juſt before the door; it was richly adorn'd, the Altar-Cloth was white, and a fine Cruciſix on the Altar.</p>

                  <p>With a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of pictures: I think the window was on the left hand of the Altar.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Mon.</speaker>
                  <p>She has fail'd in the firſt deſcription, for we go not off the Stairs into the Chappel, as ſhe ſays; neither is it adorn'd in the manner as ſhe ſays it is, nor is there any Needle-work.</p>
                  <p>Here is a maid that I deliver all my medicines to, that perhaps can give a better account whether this woman were at my houſe, than I can.</p>

                  <p>Now Gentlemen, I deſire you to take into conſideration whether my Blood ſhall be drawn by the Evidence of a woman, that ſays ſhe ſaw me give a Wafer; or on that Evidence of the other, who ſays ſhe heard me read ſhe knows not what through a wall: My Lord, it is an oppreſſion that Statutes ſhould be conſtrued otherwiſe than they are intended. I hope my Lord, that the Statute will not take hold of a man for ſaying Maſs, for many ſay Maſſes that are not in order.</p>

                  <p>It is one of the greateſt Evidence to prove a man to be a Prieſt that can be, for we cannot think of bringing witneſſes who ſaw you take Orders: Do any ſay Maſs but Prieſts? Is it lawful for any one but a Prieſt to ſay Maſs?</p>

                  <p>Then Gentlemen of the Jury, The matter you are to try is, whether <hi>Charles Kerne</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, be a Popiſh Prieſt: An Engliſhman I ſuppoſe he does not deny himſelf to be; the queſtion is then if he be a Romiſh Prieſt? If ſo, he is guilty of High Treaſon by the Statute of 27 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> This was a Law made for the preſervation of the Queen, for the preſervation of our Religion, and for the preſervation of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. The Witneſſes are <hi>Margaret Edwards</hi> and <hi>Mary Jones: Margaret</hi> ſays, the firſt time that ſhe ſaw the Priſoner was at Mr. <hi>Wigmore</hi>'s, who told her it was Mr. <hi>Kerne;</hi> and ſhe ſays that ſhe hath ſeen him ſeveral times ſince; twice or thrice at <hi>Weobley,</hi> and the laſt time was the twenty ninth of <hi>May</hi> was Twelvemonth at Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi>'s, where ſhe ſaw him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Wafer, which is the Sacrament, to four perſons that were there, but ſhe her ſelf did not receive it; and then ſhe gives you an account of the reaſon of her coming then to Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi>'s, which was at the requeſt of one <hi>Harris</hi> whoſe Wife was ſick, to ſeek ſome Remedy from Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi> for the ſick woman: She tells you how the maid brought her up to her Miſtriſs, how ſhe acquainted her with her errand, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi> gave her for the ſick woman, and how that Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi> underſtanding what Religion ſhe was of, took her into the Chappel, whereof ſhe gives you a deſcription. 'Tis very probable ſhe may go on ſuch an Errand, and yet Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi> not know her; but Mrs. <hi>Monington</hi> cannot poſitively ſay, but believes ſhe was never there: Mr. <hi>Kerne,</hi> I ſuppoſe, will not deny but that he who gives the Wafer is a Prieſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
                  <p>There is bleſſed Bread which others may give.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>L. Ch.</hi> J.</speaker>
                  <p>When you give ſuch Bread, do you not ſay <hi>Accipe Corpus Chriſti?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
                  <p>We uſe no ſuch words. (But it appeared upon his own repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Latin words they uſed upon the giving the Sacrament, that thoſe were part of the words.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>L. Ch.</hi> J.</speaker>
                  <p>The Priſoner made an offer to prove ſome diſagreement between the Witneſſes; 'tis true, they did differ in ſome ſmall things, as the ſaying the word Maſs, but from hence can no great matter be infer'd againſt the Evidence; ſo here is one poſitive Evidence.</p>
                  <p>There muſt indeed be two Witneſſes; now the queſtion will be about the ſecond womans Teſtimony: She ſays ſhe knew Mr. <hi>Kerne</hi> about eight years ago, when ſhe lived at Mr. <hi>Somerſets,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Kerne</hi> lived in the houſe about half a year: She tells you that ſhe hath ſeen ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come thither, and amongſt the reſt ſhe ſays, that one Sunday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Perſons came thither and went up with Mr. <hi>Kerne,</hi> and that ſhe was ſo curious as to hearken, and did hear Mr. <hi>Kerne</hi> ſay ſomething in an unknown Tongue: <hi>Kerne</hi> objects that ſhe could not know it was his voice, but for that, I think men are eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their voices, but that I muſt leave to your conſideration.</p>
                  <p>But now the main queſtion will be, what it was ſhe heard him ſay? Mr. <hi>Kerne</hi> ſays that in times of ſtraitneſs, Perſons that are not Prieſts may read Prayers, and ſo perhaps he may be then Reading the Collects.</p>
                  <p>But then again: She ſays there was a Child Chriſtned in the Houſe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65428:11"/>
and no one there but <hi>Mr. Somerſet</hi> and his Wife, <hi>Mr. Latchet</hi> and his Wife, and <hi>Mr. Kerne,</hi> to do it: She did not ſee him Chriſten it, and 'tis true likewiſe what he ſays, that in their Church they allow others, as Midwives, to Chriſten <hi>in extremis;</hi> not that he confeſſes he did Chriſten.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Call <hi>Mary Jones</hi> again. <hi>Mary Jones,</hi> was it a ſickly Child?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lord.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Then that is anſwered: So that if you believe that he did Chriſten the Child, there are two Witneſſes againſt him: I muſt leave it with you as a tender point on both ſides; I would not ſhed innocent Blood, neither would I willingly let a Popiſh Prieſt eſcape: There is one poſitive Witneſs, and if you believe upon the womans hearing his voice, that he did ſay Maſs, or did Chriſten, for I muſt confeſs ſhe ſays ſhe did not ſee him Chriſten, then you muſt find him Guilty: So I leave it to you upon the whole matter.</p>
