            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Interests of the Several Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> with respect to the Succession of the Crown of <hi>SPAIN,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE present Indisposition of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> seems to put a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> into a Consternation: The Apprehension the most Judicious Persons have of a Breach in the short Tranquility this part of the World has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, makes the Concern be very just: For they who know how ill we are able to enter upon a Second War, and what deep Incisions the Last has made into the soundest Members of the Confederacy, have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be very chary of the present Peace. 'Tis true, our Adversaries have felt the Effects of the War, as well as We; and 'tis reasonable to suppose, have as little need of another, as they had real need of the Peace. But what we know of <hi>that</hi> is but suppos'd; what we feel, we are sensible and sure of. Besides, the Case here would exceedingly differ; for the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> which perhaps were it rightly managed, is the Richest as well as the Largest Government in the World, is a thing so valuable, that 'tis presum'd there is no Monarch in <hi>Christendom,</hi> were he in the King of <hi>France</hi>'s stead, but would push for it at the extremest hazard. And the present King of <hi>France</hi> has never given the World any reason to expect he will omit the Addition of such
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54807:4"/>
a Trophy to his Glory, especially when he has so high Pretensions to the Claim.</p>
            <p>In this Case it seems very proper to enquire a little into the present Prospect of Affairs, as they respect the several Interests of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and what probable Effects the Decease of his Catholick Majesty may have, as to <hi>Peace, War, and Trade;</hi> that from thence we may judge what we ought to expect from such an Event.</p>
            <p>To come at a full understanding of the Case in hand, 'tis necessary to take a short View of the Succession of the Royal Family of <hi>Spain,</hi> and enquire who has the fairest Claim, in case of the Demise of the present King.</p>
            <p>The House of <hi>Austria</hi> have had an undoubted Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth being chosen Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> enjoy'd a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the largest Extent, perhaps that ever any One Prince in the World had under his Government: For he had at once the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> of <hi>Spain, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> all the present <hi>United Provinces</hi> under the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> all <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the Countries of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh, Franche Comte,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy;</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> the Islands of <hi>Sardinia, Corsica, Majorca</hi> and <hi>Minorca,</hi> with a boundless Empire in <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru;</hi> besides a multitude of Petty Sovereignties, Dukedoms, and Principalities. All this Vast Dominion, <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of</hi> Germany <hi>and its Dependancies excepted,</hi> descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Son <hi>Philip;</hi> who added to it the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by his Marriage with Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but that unhappy Match neither raising him any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54807:4"/>
nor keeping him in any long Possession of this Crown, he lost it by her Death; and in the next Reign, lost the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> also, and by that long War so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish'd his own Kingdom, that it never recovered it to this hour. After his Decease, he left his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> and he to <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, Father of the present <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, who has yet no Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth left One Son and Two Daughters; the Eldest Daughter, <hi>Maria Teresia,</hi> was married to the present <hi>French</hi> King, and was Mother to the present <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> and in case of the Death of the present King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is Heir Apparent to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to all its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and, one Clause excepted, has an Unquestion'd Title to the Succession of the said Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>But in answer to the Succession of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> 'tis objected, That at the Marriage of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>France,</hi> with <hi>Maria Teresia</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> aforesaid, his Most Christian Majesty, with all the Princes of the Blood, did by a Writing under their Hands and Seals, ratified and exchang'd on the Borders, and firm'd by their Solemn Oath at <hi>Fonterabia,</hi> in the Year 1659, renounce and relinquish all Right or Title, Claim and Pretensions for himself or his Successors, which they or any of them had or should have, by reason of any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance from the said Marriage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State who foresaw the possibility of a Claim upon the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> from the Children of that Match, took all the care imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to bind His most Christian Majesty from so much as a Pretension to it, and to that end made the Words of that Oath as full, and the Ceremony of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Exchanging it, as Solemn and as Publick as possible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54807:5"/>
How far His Most Christian Majesty will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bound by such an Oath, time must determine. I know 'tis Argued, that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> and his Sons can be no way obliged by an Oath made by their Father or Grandfather before they were born; and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could only relinquish for himself, but not for them, on whom the Right of Succession devolv'd long after the Oath of their Father: That the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance was a Natural Right to them, which their Predecessors had no power to dispense with; and therefore they are no way concern'd in the Oath of Renunciation, but ought to Succeed, as if no such Oath had been taken.</p>
            <p>Though much might be said on this Point, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the Design of this Paper, I shall only Note this; That whether the Oath by which His Most Christian Majesty Renounced the said Succession be binding to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> and his Sons or no; this is certain, That it is effectually binding to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if there be any such thing as a binding Force in the Obligation of the most solemn and sacred Oaths in the World.</p>
            <p>Now if the Obligation be so sacred as to the Most Christian King himself, 'tis most certain the <hi>Dauphin</hi> or his Sons will never be Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> if the said Most Christian King be so just to his Obligation as not to aid and assist them in pushing at the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
            <p>The Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> who is the next Branch of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> is Heir to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> in case the Title of the said <hi>Maria Teresia</hi> be laid aside, being the immediate Line of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Son to <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and not only so, but his Issue has a Claim by Virtue of his Marriage with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54807:5"/>
               <hi>Margaret Teresia,</hi> the Second Daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, by whom he had One Daughter, who was Married to the present Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be amiss to Answer here a Question which seems very naturally to be drawn from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, <hi>Viz.</hi> Why should the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bar the Claim of the <hi>French</hi> by the Issue of a Daughter, and not the Claim of the Emperor whose Right is also by the Issue of a Daughter.</p>
            <p>This is expresly Answered by the Preamble to that Treaty in these Words: <hi>Estant les Deux Couronnes si Grandes et si puissantes qu' elles ne puissent estre Reunies en Une seule et a fin que dez a present on previenne les Occasions d'une pareille jonction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Donques attendues les susdites justes raisons et Notamment de L'egalité qui se doit Conserver leurs Majestez accordent et arrestent par Contract et pacte Conventionnel entre elles qui aura Lieu force et Vigueur de la loy ferme et stable a tout jamais qui la serenissime</hi> Infante d'Espagne <hi>ni ses Enfans et leur descendants en quel degrè ils se puissent trover Voir a tout jamais ne puissent succeder es royaumes estats seigneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries et domination,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>qui appartiennent et appartiendront a sa</hi> Majesté Catholique <hi>tant dedans que dehors le royaums</hi> d'Espagne <hi>Non obstant toutes Loix ou Coutumes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>aux quelles leurs Majestez derogent,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>English</hi> thus: <q>The Two Crowns being so great and so puissant that they cannot be united into One Kingdom, and that to the end that from this present all Occasion of such a Conjunction may be avoided, therefore upon due consideration had of the aforesaid reasons, especially that of Equality, which ought to be preserved; it is Accorded between both their Majesties, and by Mutual Covenant and Contract Ordained, which shall continue in the full force and vigor of a Law for ever, <hi>That the most Serene</hi> Infanta
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54807:6"/>
                  <hi>of</hi> Spain, <hi>her Children, nor Descendants, in what Degree soever, shall never Succeed in the Kingdoms, Signiories, or Dominions, which do or shall belong to his</hi> Catholick Majesty, <hi>as well within as without the Kingdom of</hi> Spain; <hi>notwithstanding any Law or Custom, which hereby their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties do Abolish.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain from this branch of the Contract, that a Union between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> has been accounted by both Nations an improper, if not an impracticable thing. A Union with <hi>Germany</hi> has been known, and is coherent enough; but the Nature and Interest of the Two Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> seem to have some particular Circumstances which would make a Union fatal to them both; and therefore <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> the great Minister of State for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> insisted on this Article with a great deal of Zeal.</p>
            <p>I confess it seems to me that <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Minister, acted very different from the Character he had in other his Publick Management of the Affairs of <hi>Spain;</hi> for he who past for one of the greatest Masters in Politicks of his Age, and was the only man in all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, who was thought to be a Match for Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> in the Famous Peace of the <hi>Pyrennes,</hi> was sure very ill read in the Maxims of Princes, to think that a Treaty of Renunciation would ever be esteem'd of force enough to limit the Ambition of Future Times, and to oblige Princes who were not then born. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were never taken for a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Nation, and how they should come to be drawn into such a folly, seems very unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. No doubt <hi>Cardinal Mazarine,</hi> who discover'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54807:6"/>
well enough the Event, suffered the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries to go on at their own rate, and to call in the help of all the <hi>Civilians</hi> in the Two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to make an Instrument of Renunciation, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well enough that Titles to Crowns are generally disputed by the Sword, not by Deeds and Instruments; and that the Succession to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> if ever it fell by the Demise of the Incumbents to the Heirs of that Marriage, would receive very little Obstruction from so weak a Defence as the Paper of a Renunciation; for we find Contracts and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of that Nature, have very little effect against a Title to a Crown backt with an Army of 50000 men. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers acted the parts of men of Honour indeed, but not at all of Politicians.</p>
            <p>Why also that refin'd Politician should Marry the Eldest Daughter, where the Succession should require so strict a Bar, remains undetermined; had he given the <hi>Infanta</hi> to the Emperor, and the Younger Daughter to the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Debate had been prevented; but possibly other reasons might govern him, which we cannot judge of at this distance of time; and the <hi>Infanta</hi> being Married to the Most <hi>Christian King</hi> Six Years before the Younger Daughter was Married to the Emperor, that Match might be made before a Marriage with the Emperor was in view.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it appears by this short view of the Succession of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Two Daughters of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, are the Immediate Heirs of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the present King, in case he Dies without Issue; the Eldest, who marri'd the King of <hi>France,</hi> has renounced her Claim for her self and her Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and the next Right must devolve upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54807:7"/>
whose Title Descends to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am also to observe that the pretence, of <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the King of</hi> France, <hi>not being bound by the Oath of their Father, and therefore their Succession being clear,</hi> seems fully answered thus.</p>
            <p>The Renunciation was not so much a Personal Deed of the present King of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> as it was a mutual Compact between both <hi>Kingdoms</hi> pass'd by a Treaty of Peace, and became a Law of each Country, made so by a publick Instrument Sign'd by the Nobility on each side, and agreed by a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Plenipotentiaries of both Parties, in the XXXIII<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Article of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty, in these words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the end this Peace and Union, Confederation and good Correspondence, might, as it is desired, be so much the more firm, lasting, and indissolvible, both the said Principal Ministers, the Cardinal Duke, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Earl Duke, by virtue of the special Power they have had for that end of the Two Lords and Kings, have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and Agreed in their Names, the Marriage of the Most</hi> Christian <hi>King with the Serenis.</hi> Infanta <hi>the Lady</hi> Maria Teresia, <hi>Eldest Daughter to the</hi> Catholick King, <hi>and the same Day bearing the Date of these Presents, have Made and Subscrib'd a particular Treaty, whereunto they refer themselves touching the mutual Conditions of the said Marriage, and the time of its Celebration; which Treaty by it self, and Capitulation of Marriage, are of the same Force and Vigor with the present Treaty of Peace, as being the Chiefest Part thereof, and the most worthy as well as the greatest and most precious earnest of the surety of its duration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54807:7"/>
This makes it appear that the Treaty of Marriage was really a part of the Treaty of Peace, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a publick Stipulation between the two Kingdoms, and an Act of the generality; so that not the King and Queen of <hi>France</hi> only personally, but the very King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> did solemnly concern it self in the Renunciation of an Union of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> as a thing not fit to be done, for the Reasons expresly set down in the Preamble quoted before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> having thus renounced the Crown, and all Claim to the Kingdoms and Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Second Daughter comes in with her Claim; and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Teresia</hi> stands with respect to <hi>Spain,</hi> as if she had dyed without Issue. The Second Daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, was <hi>Margaret Teresia,</hi> married to <hi>Leopold</hi> the Sixth, present Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> by whom he had Three Sons and One Daughter; which Daughter, the Sons all dying young, was married to the present Duke Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and died in 1691, leaving him one Son, to whom the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> descends by a plain and direct Title, founded on the Renunciation agreed on by the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty.</p>
            <p>If the Son of this Princess dies without Issue, the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Line of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> succeeds, deriv'd from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Son of <hi>Philip</hi> the First, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who left Three Sons,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> succeeded his Father in the Empire, and left it to <hi>Rodulph</hi> the Second, his Son; and he dying a Batchelor, <hi>Matthias</hi> his Second Son succeeded in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54807:8"/>
and he also dying without Children, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second Son of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the First, was chosen Emperor, who had several Children, but all died without Issue; so the Family was preserv'd in <hi>Charles</hi> the Third Son of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the First, who among Fifteen Children had one Son, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third of the Family, but as Emperor was known by the Name of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, who was Father to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, and he to the present Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Leopold</hi> the Sixth of the Family, but the first Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Name, whose Eldest Son <hi>Joseph</hi> is King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and King of the <hi>Romans;</hi> whose Right to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> is Clear and Unquestion'd, still founded upon the former Renunciation.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has also some Pretension to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> as he is Great Grandson of <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by <hi>Katherine,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>The Titles being thus discuss'd, we come to examine how the several Interests of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> stand, with respect to the Succession, in case his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majesty should dye.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and first with <hi>Savoy:</hi> The Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have always upheld their Fortunes by the Antipathies of the powerful Princes by whom they are environ'd, the <hi>Emperor, Spain,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> either of them singly have had both Power and Will to crush the <hi>Savoyard,</hi> but neither enduring to let the other seize him, he has ever had a Protector of 'the one, when he has had an Invader of the other. Tis true, this has often made his Country the Seat of the War, and his very Capital City <hi>Turin</hi> has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately Garison'd by <hi>French, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54807:8"/>
The present Duke is entirely in the <hi>French</hi> Interests and in a fair way to leave his Dominions in the <hi>French</hi> Possession, having married his Daughter to the Hopes and Fortune of <hi>France:</hi> But if he has yet any Sons, it cannot be his Interest to have the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> fall into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who will then perfectly environ him in their own Territories: Princes may take this of that Party, with respect to Wars foreign to their own Dominions; but in their own particular Cases they are always governed by their Interests. If the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> has any regard to the Succession of his own Family he cannot but know that if the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> falls into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Milanese</hi> does so also; and he and his Successors are as absolutely in the power and at the dispose of the King of <hi>France,</hi> as any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a Province in his own Countrey; and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Assistance of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is for ever sunk as to him; so that it cannot consist with the Safety of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to have the <hi>French</hi> possess <hi>Spain.</hi> 'Tis true, the Emperor may assist him, but the <hi>Grisons</hi> must be ask'd leave to admit Succours through their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; which though they do generally grant, yet such an Aid is remote, and the Motions of the <hi>Germans</hi> very slow: So that indeed to have the <hi>French</hi> possess'd of <hi>Spain,</hi> is to put the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> under an Absolute Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Power and Will of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dukes of <hi>Mantua, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> with the Republick of <hi>Genoa,</hi> will be in little better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Countries of <hi>Savoy, Piedmont,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> have always been a Frontier to them, to defend them from the Insults of the <hi>French;</hi> as may very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the care they took this last War, to get rid of the <hi>French</hi> Garison in <hi>Casal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54807:9"/>
In the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>East</hi> parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Case will be little better; for with the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> become likewise <hi>French;</hi> the first of which admits them into the heart of <hi>Italy,</hi> where they may shake hands with the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> on one side the Great Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi> on the other, and the Ecclesiastical Territories on <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> other; and the last gives him an entire Dominion over the whole Trade of the West part of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. In a word, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominions in <hi>Italy</hi> falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> would so involve the whole Country, that it would lie wholly at his Mercy, and depend entirely upon his Favour; and whoever gives himself leave to consult the Histories of the Wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> the many attempts made by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> to get but a footing in that Delicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may with ease conclude what use they would make of so advantageous a Seisure as this. <hi>Francis</hi> the First, was the most eager Competitor with the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, for the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Italy;</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Lombardy</hi> owe their present Establishment and Tranquility to the Success of the Emperor's Forces in that great Battel of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via;</hi> for had King <hi>Francis</hi> gain'd that Battel, 'tis more than probable he had united all the North of <hi>Italy</hi> to his Crown; and this very humour of King <hi>Francis,</hi> who was a Warlike and an Ambitious Prince, was the very reason why he was not Elected Emperor in the stead of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, lest he should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slight or attempt the subduing of the Petty-States of the Empire; though they mended not the matter, the very same Design being afterwards formed by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, whom they Elected at that time. And thus 'tis in <hi>Italy</hi> now the petty Princes of <hi>Italy</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54807:9"/>
are neither willing nor able to injure <hi>France,</hi> and are very well satisfied with being screen'd behind the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanese</hi> by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Savoyard</hi> from an Irruption from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> has several times been Master of a great part of <hi>Italy. Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> having Conquer'd the <hi>Longobards,</hi> gave all the Ecclesiastical-Territory in <hi>Italy</hi> to the Chair; and since that, <hi>Italy</hi> has been often changing Masters, and the Popes have as often been harass'd, one while by the Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> and other while by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Power; and to prevent the like for the future, the constant Maxim of the Ecclesiastical Councils, has been to keep a due Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance between those Three Powers, that neither of them may be too powerful for one another, and then he is sure the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> shall not be disturb'd. In this case the ingenious <hi>Puffendorff</hi> in his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the History of <hi>Europe,</hi> gives his Opinion thus: <hi>I am apt to believe,</hi> says he, <hi>the Popes would be glad the</hi> Spaniards <hi>were driven out of</hi> Italy, <hi>especially out of the Kingdom of</hi> Naples; <hi>but it is scarce to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed he should be able to do it in his own strength; and to make use of the</hi> French <hi>would be to fall out of the Frying-pan into the Fire; therefore all the Pope can do is to take care that</hi> Spain <hi>may not Encroach upon others in</hi> Italy; <hi>and there is no question but if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>should attempt any such thing,</hi> France <hi>and all the other</hi> Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>States would be ready to oppose their design; neither can it be pleasing to the Pope, if the King of</hi> France <hi>should get so much Footing in</hi> Italy, <hi>as to be able to sway Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there according to his pleasure, which the Pope ought to prevent with all his might.</hi> If this be true, what then can the Pope or any of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> should be united,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54807:10"/>
and Encroach upon them in one body, they would effectually drive them all out of <hi>Italy</hi> whenever they pleased? All the Refuge they could have, would be the Empire, which how able it would be to Cope with <hi>France,</hi> in such a Case, time only can determine. To me it seems more than probable, that a Union of the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> would be an entire Reduction of whole <hi>Italy</hi> under the same Power; for there is not that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which the Monarch of that Union would not really have some Dormant Pretension to, either as King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or King of <hi>France,</hi> or King of <hi>Naples,</hi> or Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> except the Territories of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and some of them would not be entirely free neither.</p>
            <p>The next Country which is most nearly concern'd against this Union, and in most danger from it, is the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal.</hi> As the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is now a poor and effeminated Nation, <hi>Portugal</hi> is secured by its own strength. In the time that the Power of <hi>Spain</hi> was formidable to <hi>Europe, Philip</hi> the Second no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Invaded <hi>Portugal,</hi> than he subdued it; for there is no Comparison between the Forces of the Two Kingdoms; and had not the <hi>Spanish</hi> Power been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by other fatal Losses against <hi>England</hi> and the Low-Countries, I suppose 'twould not be improper to say <hi>Portugal</hi> had remain'd a Province of <hi>Spain</hi> to this day. In th year 1640; while <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in several Troubles, as in particular the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>Catalonians</hi> the <hi>Portuguese</hi> shook off the <hi>Spanish</hi> Government, and set up <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza;</hi> and yet even this Revolt had not been able to have been made good, had not the <hi>French</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately assisted them under the Command of Duke
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54807:10"/>
               <hi>Scomberg,</hi> by whose Conduct they won the famous Victory of <hi>Villa Vitiosa;</hi> and yet after this, had not the Diversion the <hi>French</hi> made in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> willing to clap up a Peace with <hi>Portugal</hi> on any terms, the <hi>Portuguese</hi> could not have held out. The Sum of all is this, That <hi>Portugal</hi> is not able to support it self against <hi>Spain</hi> without a Foreign Assistance. Now if <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> Unites under one Power, whenever that Power pleases to demand the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> it must and will be surrendred to it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore 'tis the Interest of <hi>Portugal</hi> by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to prevent this Union; what those means are, I refer to its proper Head.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swiss,</hi> the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> are the next concern'd in this Affair: I know some are apt to say, that the greatest loss the <hi>Swiss</hi> are like to have on this occasion, will be want of Employment, which they have always found in the Wars between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> but, perhaps, it might be answered by saying, They may chance to find Employment enough in defending their own Countrey; for it is not to be questioned but the King of <hi>France,</hi> who would then be Lord of all the Countries <hi>Southward</hi> of the <hi>Grisons</hi> and <hi>Swiss,</hi> would be very fond of making that Warlike People his Subjects, both for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having a power to force them into his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and also of stopping the passage of the <hi>Germans</hi> that way into <hi>Italye,</hi> and indeed the impossibility that seems to lie on the <hi>Swissers</hi> of maintaining their Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, makes it almost natural to believe the New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch will attempt all feasible methods to bring them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54807:11"/>
over to him, if it be only to anticipate the <hi>Germans</hi> and prevent their being Parties with the Emperor.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the <hi>Swiss</hi> are a Fighting People and not easily conquered, and a Poor People not worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering; there is nothing to be had from them but Blows and barren Mountains; but yet the Reasons abovesaid would, in case of such a Union as we speak of, make it absolutely necessary to the <hi>French</hi> to make themselves Masters of them, cost what it would. 'Tis confess'd some of the most Powerful Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> have attempted the <hi>Swiss</hi> in vain; as <hi>Leopold</hi> Archduke of <hi>Austria,</hi> whom they defeated and kill'd at the Battel of <hi>Sempach, Anno</hi> 1444. And <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Granson</hi> was routed by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> though he was a Gallant Soldier, and had in his Army an 100000 Men; and it would be a very difficult thing for the strongest Power of <hi>Europe</hi> to make a Conquest of them by Force; but the present King of <hi>France</hi> has found other ways to Conquer, besides downright Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the <hi>Swiss</hi> who are a needy People, may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be as easily divided as another Nation, by the help of Money especially, their Government being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of two different Religions; and each Party very positive and zealous in their own. If therefore the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchies should unite, the <hi>Swiss</hi> may find it very difficult to maintain their Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, either from the Force or the Subtilty of their Great Neighbour: For in case of such a Union, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of that Empire will presently see, that to get the <hi>Swiss Cantons</hi> under his Power, will be the first and most necessary work to employ his Politicks; for it would be the only way to secure himself from any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance in his entire Reduction of <hi>Italy.</hi> So that it must be of the last Consequence to the <hi>Swiss Cantons,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54807:11"/>
to prevent such a mighty Union in <hi>Europe,</hi> which seems to bring with it a necessity of involving them in a War with the most Invincible Power of Two united Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies; in which War they must of necessity at last sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or be conquer'd; for a Victory obtain'd by them, could have no other Tendency, than to make their Terms of Accord the easier; which they must always be bound to preserve at the Price of a War, whenever their Potent Neighbour please to impose upon them. As to Trade indeed, the <hi>Swiss</hi> are not much concern'd, because they Trade little but among themselves, nor have no Sea-Port for Foreign Trade, nor any Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures to export.</p>
            <p>The Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> is the next to be consider'd: The Conjunction of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> seems to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <hi>Germany</hi> with a fatal and a bloody War; the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> united, extend in length, fronting the Limits of the Empire, for a contiguous Range of near a Thousand Miles, if the <hi>Swiss Grisons</hi> and the <hi>North-East</hi> part of <hi>Italy</hi> are included, as they are of necessity to be.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> is not under an absolute necessity of quarrelling with this supposed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but the Circumstances of <hi>Italy,</hi> which has so many Fiefs and Dependancies on the Empire in it, are such, that it seems impossible, speaking of common Politicks, that the <hi>French</hi> should possess the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and not commence a War with the Emperor of <hi>Germany;</hi> for the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes cannot subsist in <hi>Italy,</hi> without being incroach'd upon in such a case; and the only Prince they can have recourse to for Protection, is the Emperor: Possibly it may be the truest Interest of the Emperor to lye still at this time, and rather prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54807:12"/>
his Wars against the <hi>Turks</hi> with his utmost Vigor, by which he gains an extraordinary Glory as well as Revenue; and that being once happily finished, he may be the better able to cope with such an United Power: For as he is now engaged in his Wars in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> it must be own'd that the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> would be in very great danger, and a very unequal Match to the <hi>French</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi> It is without question the present Interest of the Emperor to preserve his Peace, because the Towns which are to be restored by the present Peace are not yet quitted by the <hi>French;</hi> but that once done, the Emperor might with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage preserve the Peace of the Empire, and transfer the War into <hi>Italy,</hi> where the <hi>Germans</hi> always fight cheapest, and the <hi>French</hi> dearest.</p>
            <p>The Emperor's Interest in this Affair lies distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd with respect to the several parts of the Empire. The States of the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> whose Troops, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Swabian</hi> and <hi>Franconian</hi> Circles, compose the Forces on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> are maintain'd by <hi>Quota's</hi> at the Charge of the several Princes of the Empire, and the same Princes are an inexhaustible Magazine of Men and Money, and perhaps well united are invincible as to the <hi>French.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> can maintain the War three parts in five cheaper than the <hi>French,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Feudatories of the Empire bear their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But if the <hi>French</hi> by this Conjunction unite also the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, the Heat of the War between the Emperor and the <hi>French</hi> is most probable to lye on the Frontiers of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or the Lower Parts of <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Emperor's Hereditary Dominion, which indeed is the tenderest place the Emperor can be touch'd in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54807:12"/>
'Tis true, that <hi>Germany</hi> united is a most formidable Empire; but the present Condition of the Empire, very much weakned by this last War, and involved in a vigorous War against the <hi>Turks,</hi> is such as renders it in but an ill Condition to engage in so bloody and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive a War as this would be. 'Tis therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Empire with all its Might, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, to secure the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> that by such an addition the <hi>French</hi> Greatness might be curb'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd, and the <hi>French</hi> anticipated in all their vast and ambitious Designs upon <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> seems to be the only Prince that will be easy at this Union, and that only as it serves his present purpose, by diverting the <hi>French</hi> from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing him in the peaceable Possession of his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Kingdom. The disorders of his Government seem to grow upon him, and the Party of the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> or the Cardinal Primate rather, are only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by their expectation of Succors from <hi>France,</hi> in order to dispossess the present King: Now this Union of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> may be beneficial to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> only as it may divert the Court of <hi>France</hi> from raising and encouraging Rebellions and Disorders in his Affairs, before he is well settled in his new-gotten Dominions: And yet the King of <hi>Poland</hi> will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this Conjunction, as a Friend to the <hi>French</hi> Interest, nor any way, but as he would be glad of any Circumstance that would divert the <hi>French</hi> from giving him disturbance in the particular Settlement which he has before him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> are the next State most concern'd in such a Conjunction; were it not for <hi>Flanders</hi> the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54807:13"/>
               <hi>Dutch</hi> would have no manner of concern upon them, but what respected Trade only; of which by it self. But as they now stand with respect to the several Provinces of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> to have those large and populous Countries fall into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> would be of the most fatal Consequence to their Affairs of any other event that could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly befal them.</p>
            <p>Their Territory is entirely encompass'd with the <hi>Flemings, Legois,</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> and that subtle Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have at all times taken special care to keep off the Neighbourhood of the <hi>French,</hi> and have ever so ordered the matter, that they have had some or other strong Town of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to stand between them and danger; what they are to expect from the Neighbourhood of the <hi>French,</hi> they have room enough to judge from their own sad Experience in 1672, when the <hi>French</hi> broke into the Bowels of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and like a Torrent bore down all before them; if then the <hi>Spanish</hi> Low-Countries fall into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> as by such a Union they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately do, the <hi>Dutch</hi> would be even Besieged by the <hi>French</hi> Power from the Mouth of the <hi>Scheld</hi> to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and have no Frontier but their own Towns; and on the least breach between them and the <hi>French,</hi> their own fruitful Countries which they have hitherto been so Chary of, would become the Seat of the War, and be impoverisht and over-run with the Numerous Armies of <hi>Franc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word; It does not seem very probable that the <hi>Dutch</hi> can maintain their Commonwealth, but will fall a certain Prey at some time or other, to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Greatness of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy; for they have but two ways of supporting themselves, by War
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54807:13"/>
or Peace; the first must be Precarious, and at the Absolute Will of the <hi>French;</hi> and the last will be destructive to them. There is a vast differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Charge of a War maintain'd Abroad, and the Desolations of a War brought Home to our own doors. While the <hi>Dutch</hi> maintain'd their Army, and sent them into <hi>Flanders</hi> to Fight; the War, though it was long and very bloody, yet was easy to them; but to have the <hi>French</hi> Army in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of their Country, leaves nothing but Ruin and Desolation behind; witness the Rage of the <hi>French</hi> Armies at <hi>Swamerdam</hi> in the Years 1672, and 1673.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> by their hired Troops are a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful State; but are on the other hand the worst of any Nation in the World to entertain a War in their own Dominion, because they are so exceedingly dependant upon the openness and freedom of Trade, which if it be once Obstructed, as to be sure it must be by such a kind of a War, they are presently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverisht. The Uniting the <hi>Spanish Netherlands</hi> to <hi>France</hi> by this Succession, would leave <hi>Holland</hi> in a manner quite naked of all its defence, and exposed to the Will of the <hi>French;</hi> for if <hi>Flanders</hi> be lost, all the Blood and Treasure spent by the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy in Three long and chargeable Wars, for the rescuing <hi>Flanders</hi> out of the <hi>French</hi> hands, would be lost, and all the labour of the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Armies would be utterly lost.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> are certainly exposed to the last degree, and in so much danger of being absolutely subdued in such a case, that I think they are concern'd in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, to prevent, if possible, such an Union as that, which would to them be the most fatal thing in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:54807:14"/>
We come in the next place to examine how <hi>England</hi> stands with respect to such an Union; <hi>England</hi> is not one jot less concern'd in the matter than <hi>Holland;</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> whose Hazards in <hi>Flanders</hi> may seem needless to those who understood no better, has given sufficient. Testimony of his Opinion how much the safety of <hi>England</hi> depends upon maintaining the Frontier of <hi>Flanders</hi> as a Barrier for the Kingdom against the Insults of the <hi>French</hi> Nation: and indeed, if nothing but the prodigious increase of the Naval Strength, which <hi>France</hi> would attain by such an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were considered, it would be sufficient to make all the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Europe</hi> join their Interest against it. I noted in the Article about the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the naked Condition they would be in with respect to a War by Land; but should the <hi>French</hi> once make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and of some of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ports and Harbours in the <hi>Scheld,</hi> or the <hi>Maez,</hi> the addition of their Naval Strength would make them too great a Match for all <hi>Europe</hi> at Sea.</p>
            <p>The present Conjunction of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets have not without great difficulty preserved the Command of the Sea during this War; the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges gain'd by it are visible to the meanest understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I question whether it would be possible to maintain that Command in case of such a Union. The present growing greatness of the <hi>French</hi> Genius infus'd by vigorous Councils into the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> may once again make them, as they formerly were, the most Powerful Nation in the World, both at Land and Sea; if then the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> United, should make themselves in proportion too strong at Sea for the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> they may bid very fair for a Universal Empire over this part of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54807:14"/>
Our Interests in the <hi>West-Indian</hi> Colonies of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> come next into Consideration. 'Tis abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary for the security of our Plantations, whose extent is exceeding great, that no Union be made between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominions; otherwise the whole Trade from these parts of the World, to both <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> may lie at the mercy of the <hi>French:</hi> For <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> being Nations subsisting and depending wholly upon Trade and Foreign Negoce, any Union in the World, which shall be too strong for them at Sea, may in the end reduce both those Nations to what Terms and what Subjection they please. And this leads us to the other great Consideration of this Union, as it respects</p>
            <l>
               <hi>The Interest of Trade in the World.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>The Interest of Trade is the Interest of Nations: Peace is the end of War, <hi>or at least ought to be so:</hi> Trade is the end of Peace, and Gain is the end of Trade.</p>
            <p>The Trade of <hi>Europe</hi> is principally in the hands of the <hi>English, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> from the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the latter, in Manufactures of their own Growth and Operation. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are a Nation that make the best Return in Trade of any Nation in the World, <hi>namely, Bullion,</hi> may be said to suffer us to Trade with them, rather than they to Trade with us: They are a subtle, but a very slothful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they buy almost all their necessary things of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, they have in a manner no Manufacture among them, they hardly make their own Cloaths; and in return, the Growth of their Countrey, as Wines, Oyls, and Fruits, are brought back, and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54807:15"/>
Overplus made up by Exchange, supplied by the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of their <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a further demonstration of the ill husbandry of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Trade, it appears that all the Trade carried on with them by the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> is carried on upon our own Stocks; and some have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to say, that the <hi>English</hi> Effects in <hi>Spain</hi> do not amount to less than 50 Millions <hi>sterl.;</hi> which way of Trade has always been the greatest Ligament of the Peace between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard:</hi> For on the first occasion of a Rupture with these Countries, the immediate course the <hi>Spaniard</hi> takes, is to seize upon all the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, and confiscate their Effects, which are always so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as that those Nations have no Equivalent to lay hold on by way of Reprisal. 'Tis true, they have taken their Plate-Ships, and sometimes plunder'd the Coast-Towns in the <hi>Spanish West-Indies,</hi> which at best would be but a small Amends, to the Seizure of the Effects of so many Merchants.</p>
            <p>Nay, they are not only so ill Merchants as to suffer Strangers to engross their Trade, but even those Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were neither able to manage, nor fit to be trusted with Business, employ all Agents, Factors, and Servants of their own, sent over and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident among them, with the same Methods: as they Plant amongst the most barbarous Nations of <hi>Africa;</hi> and by this Method the Trade of <hi>Spain</hi> is so managed, that whatever it be to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, 'tis certainly a Trade exceeding gainful to the Merchants of these Countries in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it occasions the Consumption of their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and from thence the Improvement of their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54807:15"/>
Stocks at home; by which the whole Countries are enrich'd, and the Poor employ'd and supported.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it makes a Return of Bullion, which is the greatest Advantage that can accrue to Trade; for Manufactures exported, and Bullion return'd, make always an Account of Profit to the Publick Stock of a Nation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An Increase of Navigation, and Encouragement to Seamen; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not only Trading with us all in our own Vessels, but employing our Ships in their own Affairs from Port to Port, in <hi>Italy</hi> especially.</p>
            <p>In case of a Union with <hi>France,</hi> 'tis very probable the Channel of Trade to <hi>Spain</hi> may be entirely alter'd: The <hi>French</hi> are a busy Trading Nation themselves, and are very apt to vye with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Manufactures: And to go no further, when 'tis in their power to admit their own Merchants to import their Manufactures Custom-free, while we shall pay 23 <hi>per Cent.</hi> 'tis easy to see that our Trade thither must dye.</p>
            <p>I know it will be objected here, That the chief Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>English</hi> Manufactures is to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> for the Trade by the Galeons to <hi>New Spain, &amp;c.;</hi> and that if the <hi>French</hi> should by their Conjunction any way discourage that Trade, it is but our opening a Correspondence from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to their <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and we should be as great Gainers, and the Trade from <hi>Spain</hi> by the Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be very much impair'd.</p>
            <p>By the Treaty of Commerce between the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is stipulated in particular, <hi>That the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>shall not permit any of his Subjects to Trade, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond, or Sail to or with any of the Subjects of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majesty in the</hi> West-Indies: The reason was, that the Trade from hence to <hi>Spain</hi> being so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the way of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and the return so good,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54807:16"/>
keeping it in that Channel, would be the only way to maintain that beneficial Negoce to advantage: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as supplying the <hi>Indies</hi> directly from <hi>England,</hi> would be very prejudicial to the particular Trade of <hi>Spain</hi> it self, the Navigation from <hi>Cadiz</hi> to the <hi>Havana,</hi> and in general to the whole Trade.</p>
            <p>Now the most effectual Method of prohibiting this Trade, has appear'd to be observing the Prohibition strictly at our Colonies and Islands in <hi>America, Jamaica</hi> in particular: For did our Government give the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Trade from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to <hi>New Spain</hi> directly, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are so eager to Trade, that all the Precaution their own Government could use to prevent it, would be to no purpose: And there is this reason to be given for it; That the Sale from the <hi>English</hi> by the way of <hi>Jamaica</hi> is so much cheaper than that by way of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and yet our Merchants great Gainers too, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> of <hi>America</hi> will run all hazards to get our Goods on shore, and coming off to us in Sloops and Canoes, they Trade <hi>super altum mare,</hi> bartering immediate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for our Commodities at an extraordinary Rate.</p>
            <p>The reason is plain; because Goods sent from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> there paying Freight and Charges, with a Custom of 23 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards reshipt on board the Galeons, paying a second Freight, with some Indulto at their lading on board, and again at their landing in <hi>America,</hi> must of necessity be sold dearer than Goods brought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Prohibition on our side be but removed, the Trade of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> as far as respects <hi>English</hi> Goods, would be ruined.</p>
            <p>'Tis acknowledg'd this would be very detrimental to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Trade; but a Trade carried on by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54807:16"/>
Stealth could be neither very durable, nor very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and therefore could never amount to an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the Loss of that great Branch of our Trade from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Answer may be given as to the Damage of Trade, That a Powerful Union between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> for the Augmentation of their Naval Strength, in order to preserve always the Command of the Seas, will be effectual either to prescribe the <hi>French,</hi> though they are united with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> within the Ancient Regulations of Trade, or to prohibit their own Trade to their <hi>American</hi> Colonies, nay, even to take all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>To this I say, <hi>Spain</hi> indeed, as now consider'd in the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> has but an inconsiderable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Power; but <hi>Spain</hi> in the hands of the <hi>French</hi> must be otherwise consider'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are a Nation who improve every thing to the utmost; they are a diligent indefatigable people; if it be possible to recover the Naval Power of <hi>Spain</hi> (as no doubt it is), they will recover it: And what a prodigious Extent of the Sea will they possess by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous Coast from <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>Streights-</hi>mouth; (for I must suppose <hi>Portugal</hi> to be swallow'd up by them, it cannot be avoided, the Pretensions to that Crown are so great, and the Power to oppose them so small;) and from the <hi>Streights-</hi>mouth, a few small Ports excepted, quite to <hi>Loretto</hi> on the <hi>East</hi> side of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> almost to <hi>Venice:</hi> They must be a more slothful People than the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if they do not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the strongest Nation at Sea in the World.</p>
            <p>And if they are so, no Trade can be secur'd to us, but such as some particular advantage to themselves, makes it their Interest to permit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54807:17"/>
In a word, It seems to me that Trade in general will lie too much at the Mercy of the <hi>French</hi> ever to be of any Advantage to their Neighbours, and I'll in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in one particular Trade, in which at present we rival that Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Fishing.</p>
            <p>We take our Fish on the Banks of <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and on the Coast of <hi>New England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> do the like; the Market is general, and equal to both Nations; if there be any advantage, 'tis on the side of the <hi>English;</hi> but if <hi>Spain,</hi> which is the place where all this Fish is disposed of, falls into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> 'tis but Prohibiting Fish, excepting in their own Bottoms, and all our <hi>Newfoundland</hi> Colonies must sink and be deserted, and Three hundred Sail of Ships be at once unemployed.</p>
            <p>That such a Prohibition would be the consequence of such a Union, is as natural as can be, and no one could blame the <hi>French</hi> neither, for we would do the same our selves.</p>
            <p>The Trade to <hi>Venice,</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> and to <hi>Turkey,</hi> would have like Circumstances and Consequences, for the <hi>French</hi> would keep the Key of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and they would be very much to blame if they let any pass the <hi>Streights</hi> Mouth without paying them such a Toll, as that all those Trades should be managed by us under considerable disadvantage, if they were not entirely lost.</p>
            <p>To speak of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whose Fishery in a great measure is the staple of their Navigation, this Fishery depends as much upon their St. <hi>Ubies</hi> Fleet for Salt, as the Brewers in <hi>London</hi> do upon the <hi>New-Castle</hi> Fleet for Coals: Should this Union of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> succeed, and <hi>Portugal</hi> be subdued, 'tis in the power of the <hi>French</hi> to destroy all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fishery, by laying a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54807:17"/>
great Duty on the Salt at St. <hi>Ubies,</hi> while their own Subjects shall have it as before; by which means the <hi>French</hi> shall bring their Herrings Cheaper to Market, and consequently have all the Trade.</p>
            <p>The Instances which might be given of this nature are too many to be included in this short Discourse, and too plain to need it; a very mean capacity as to Trade may make a judgment of it.</p>
            <p>From the whole I take the freedom to draw this Conclusion, that such a Union of Two such Powerful Monarchies as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> would be very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the Trade of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> in general, and absolutely destructive to some branches of it in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; it would be hazardous to the Peace and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and absolutely inconsistent with the Ballance of Power in <hi>Europe;</hi> it would be fatal to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal;</hi> 'twould be very troublesome and uneasy to the Empire, and would very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the Liberty of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if so, then it must be the Interest of all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to join their Forces with the utmost vigour, and endeavour to prevent it.</p>
            <p>'Tis certainly the Interest of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> to preserve the Freedom of their Commerce and their Empire of the Seas; and I see no event in the World that is in the least probable to deprive 'em of it but this; no Union in the World but this can put any Prince or People, or Confederacy in a condition so much as to dispute it with them; <hi>France</hi> by it self cannot do it, as has appear'd this last War; <hi>Spain</hi> is in no probable Circumstances for it; but <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> together seems to be plac'd in a Scituation for the Universal Government of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54807:18"/>
'Tis certainly the Interest of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> by all that is possible for them to do, to prevent this Union; and that is so plain from all the Histories of those Countries as to the Times when the <hi>French</hi> were Masters of the greatest part of <hi>Italy,</hi> that it needs no other demonstration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Portugal</hi> has nothing to protect her, but the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between those Two Nations, as I noted of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that when she is Opprest by one, she may have Succour from the other; for I think it can hardly be supposed that the <hi>French</hi> King would omit uniting that small Kingdom to his Empire, having a kind of a Right to it by a former Possession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Germany</hi> has various Reasons to oppose this Union. First, Because the real Right is in the Emperor or Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or both, rather than <hi>France,</hi> if the Article of the Renunciation be good, as no doubt it is. Now the Title to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced before it was really a Title, seems to take off all Pretences of Exception; for the King of <hi>France</hi> did not quit a Title which he had, but agreed to remain without a Title which he had not; and the Renuncation was made by the Two Kings, not by the <hi>Infanta</hi> only, but by her Father too; as appears by the particular Words of the Renunciation, which are as follow: <hi>Placuit utrique Regi pactione instar legis semper valiturâ sancire, ne unquam serenissima Infans Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resa, aut posteri ejus ulli, ad seros usque Nepotes, quocunque gradu sint, admittantur ad successionem ullam, sive Regno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, sive Principatuum, Provinciarum, Ditionum, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniorum quorumcunque Regis Catholici, non obstante lege ulla, consuetudine aut alis Jure in contrarium, cui</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54807:18"/>
               <hi>utriusque Regis authoritate plenissimè derogatur, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platione dictae aequalitatis, &amp; publicae utilitatis quae inde emanatura speratur. It was consented to by both their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties, and by them confirm'd, that neither the most Serene Infanta</hi> Teresa, <hi>nor any of her Issue or Posterity, in what degree soever, be admitted to succeed in any of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Dukedoms, Provinces, or Dominions of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majesty, any other Custom, Constitution, or Law to the contrary notwithstanding: So that if any such Custom or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution were, it was by authority of both Kings abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely annull'd and destroyed. And this only to adjust the Dominion of both Crowns, so as each of them might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an equal benefit by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, 'Tis the Interest of <hi>Spain</hi> it self to oppose this Union; for whereas it is not an addition of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> but of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> it changes it from a Soveraign Self dependant Kingdom, and one of the most powerful in the World to a Province of the <hi>French</hi> Empire; to be subject to the Laws and Maxims of a Nation, whose Genius and Tempers are as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to one another, as Heat and Moisture, as Light and Darkness; 'tis Subjecting the <hi>Spanish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a People for whom they have ever had a stated mortal aversion, from whom they differ in every thing that Nature can contrive two opposite Constitutions to partake of; differ in Complexion, differ in Temper, differ in Customs, in Habits, in Manners, in every thing but Religion.</p>
            <p>To Conclude; I firmly believe that to all this may be added, That notwithstanding the <hi>French</hi> Greatness and Policy, 'tis no difficult matter effectually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this Union, if His Catholick Majesty should dye,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54807:19"/>
and that without involving <hi>Europe</hi> in a new War, unless the Most Christian King should resent any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive Methods to such a Degree, as to declare War himself against the Confederates.</p>
            <p>How this may be done, is not the business of this Paper; nor is it an Affair proper for a Pamphlet. I doubt not but those Princes which God has plac'd at the Helm of Government in <hi>Europe,</hi> understand both the Means and the Time for such a Work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more without Council to Direct, than without Power to Perform; and to them I refer it.</p>
