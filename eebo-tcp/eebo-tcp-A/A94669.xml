            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by Extemporarie prayers, groundleſly without a Liturgy, preſuming
(as they ſuppoſe) to imitate the miraculous Founders of Chriſtian Religion,
who then for planting of Churches had ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, by which
many ſigns,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 26.</note> wonders and miracles were wrought, for they then ſpake as the Spirit
gave them utterance: But our Divines wanting thoſe Apoſtolicall gifts, neither in
veritie have they the holy Ghoſt as the Apoſtles had, whereby their utterance and
fraile memories might be helped, and underſtandings from errors be preſerved, but
in theſe things are ſubject to miſcarriages, and therefore according to their weake
abilities as they ſtand opinionated in judgements, a ſtrange worſhip of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
is oftentimes produced, whereby it comes to paſſe, that in praying they have
ſtrange words and paſſages, not according to godlines, but inſtead of a ſolemne
ſacred Service to a Divine Majeſty (as our former Prayers were, compoſed by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive
help of many men learned and holy,<note place="margin">Mart. 2. Vol. pag. 660. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. 1641.</note> yea ſuch as were Martyrs, and who as
the Author of the Book of Martyrs ſaith, and the Act of Parl. made to confirme
that Service in the time of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. performed it through the aid of the

performed a holy ſacrifice to God: But your Petitioners tremble, they ſhould now
be forced, or the Almighty limited in his publique Worſhip, to ſuch Prayers and
ſtrange Service, which till this Age neither they nor their Fore-fathers ever knew.
Moreover, if the memory or utterance of thoſe Divines that be orthodox and
godly ſhall faile, then doth the ſolemne worſhip of Almighty God which the
Directory hath made to depend upon thoſe mens weak memory fail alſo. This much
troubleth your Petitioners, who finding the prayers of theſe former rehearſed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated
men, the moſt part naught, &amp; theſe laſt though they be for life and doctrine
unblameable, yet by reaſon of an unperfect or weake memory, their extemporarie
prayers, to which our Synod hath limited Gods publique Worſhip, prove not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
good. And beſides, your Petitioners in hearing ſtrange men, or every day new
extemporarie prayers, whilſt their underſtandings are exerciſed, how lawfully to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
paſsages and Petitions they may ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> their devotions in the meane time
which with zeale and fervencie ought to be fixed upon the Almighty God, are by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered

            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore the inconvenience of extemporary prayers being conſidered, we your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
Members of the Church of England, doe humbly pray for the ſake of God
and our Saviour Chriſt, and for that Mother-Churches ſake wherein your ſelves have
received Baptiſme, Faith, and Grace, whereby you ſtand ſtated in hope of the glory
of God, yea that Chriſtian Proteſtant Church, Reformed not by the blood of others, but
her owne patient ſufferings in her owne blood, that you will ſuffer her children to worſhip
God in their accuſtomed reverentiall manner: And we humbly pray that you would be
pleaſed to conſider, that the Judaicall Chriſtians were not forced to leave their Jewiſh

matters of Religion doth not force men. Yea the very Church of Rome, although they
