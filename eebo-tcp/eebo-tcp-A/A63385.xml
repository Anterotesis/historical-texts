            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Kitley</hi> of <hi>Barkin</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in forms, That one Mris. <hi>Yazly,</hi> a

                  <hi>William Ducket</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Member of the Houſe, informs, That
one <hi>Henry Baker</hi> of <hi>Chippenham</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> coming
from Market with one <hi>John Woodman</hi> of <hi>Kelloway</hi> in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Thurſday before the Fire began in <hi>London,</hi> they had ſome
diſcourſe about the buying of a yoke of fat Bullocks, wherein they
differed, becauſe <hi>VVoodman</hi> who was to ſell them was deſired to
keep them a while in his hands; But the ſaid <hi>VVoodman</hi> denied ſo
to do, for that as he alleadged, he could not ſtay in the Country till
that time which <hi>Baker</hi> would have them delivered to him in, and
being asked whither he was going, he refuſed to tell, Asking what
he had to do to make that queſtion; But riding a little further, the
ſaid <hi>Woodman</hi> expreſt theſe words, <hi>You are brave Blades at</hi> Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penham,
<hi>you made Bonfires lately for beating the</hi> Dutch; <hi>But ſince you
delight in Bonfires, you ſhall have your Bellies full of them ere it be long:</hi>
Adding, <hi>that if he lived one week longer, he ſhould ſee</hi> London <hi>as
ſad a</hi> London <hi>as ever it was ſince the World began. And in ſome
ſhort time after, he ſhould ſee as bloody a time as ever was, ſince</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>was</hi> England. This diſcourſe was not much taken notice of at
that time it was ſpoken, But when the City of <hi>London</hi> was Burnt,
the ſaid <hi>Henry Baker</hi> gave this Information to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Ducket,</hi>
and whereupon he iſſued out his Warrant to apprehend <hi>Woodman,</hi>
but he was gone out of the Country, and cannot be heard of
ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> who acknowledged that
he was one of thoſe that Fired the Houſe of <hi>Mr. Farryner</hi> a Baker
in <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> from whence the Fire had its beginning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that he came out of <hi>France</hi> with one <hi>Stephen Piedloe</hi> about
four months before the Fire, and went into <hi>Sweden</hi> with him, where
he alſo ſtaid with him as his Companion four months, and then
they came together into <hi>England</hi> in a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ship called the <hi>Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
where he ſtaid on board with the ſaid <hi>Piedloe</hi> till that <hi>Saturday</hi>
night, in which the Fire brake out. When <hi>Peidloe</hi> taking him
out of the Ship, carried him into <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> and he being
earneſt to know whither he would carry him? he would not ſatisfie
him till he had brought him to the place, and then he told him, that
he had brought three Balls, and gave him one of them to throw
into the houſe. And he would have been further ſatisfied in the
deſign, as he ſaid, before he would execute it: But <hi>Peidloe</hi> was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40386:5"/>
ſo impatient that he would not hear him, and then he did the <hi>Fact,</hi>
which was, That he put a Fire-Ball at the end of a long Pole,
and lighting it with a piece of Match, he put it in at a Window,
and ſtaid till he ſaw the Houſe in a flame. He confeſſed that there
were <hi>Three and Twenty Complices,</hi> whereof <hi>Peidloe</hi> was the <hi>Chief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Graves</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Merchant living in St. <hi>Mary Axe,</hi> Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Committee, that he had known <hi>Hubert</hi> ever ſince he was
four years old, and hath ever obſerved him to be a perſon of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
inclination, and therefore fit for any villanous enterprize;
And becauſe of his knowledge he had of him, he went to viſit him
in Priſon, where when he ſaw him, he could not but commiſerate
the condition whereinto he had brought himſelf. And for his better
diſcovery of the <hi>Fact,</hi> he told him the ſaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> that he did not
believe he had done that of which he confeſſed himſelf guilty. To
which <hi>Hubert</hi> replyed, <hi>Yes Sir, I am guilty of it, and have been
brought to it by the inſtigation of Monſieur</hi> Peidloe; <hi>but not out of any
malice to the Engliſh Nation, but from a deſire of Reward which he
promiſed me upon my Return into France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that this miſerable creature who confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Committee to be a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and dyed ſo.
And as for the aforeſaid <hi>Peidloe,</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> informed,
that he had had a full knowledge of him, and knew him to be a very
Deboiſt Perſon, and apt to any Wicked Deſign. Moreover, for a
clear conviction of the Guilt of the aforeſaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
the Keeper of the <hi>VVhite-Lion</hi> Priſon, was appointed to ſet
him upon a horſe, and to go with him, and ſee if he could find out
the place where he threw the <hi>Fire-Ball.</hi> Upon which, <hi>Hubert</hi> with
more readineſs than thoſe that were wel acquainted with the place,
went to <hi>Pudding-lane,</hi> unto the very place where the houſe that was
firſt fired ſtood, ſaying, <hi>here ſtood the houſe.</hi> The Jaylor endeavoured
to draw him from that belief, and put him upon ſeeking for ſome
other place: But he poſitively perſiſted in what he had firſt ſaid;
and affirmed that to have been the ſaid Houſe. It being intimated
to the Committee, That notwithſtanding the Confeſſion of the ſaid
<hi>Hubert,</hi> it was confidently reported the <hi>Fire</hi> in the forementioned
<hi>Farryners</hi> houſe began by accident. The Committee therefore ſent
for him the ſaid <hi>Farryner</hi> before them, who being examined, ſaid,
That it was impoſſible any Fire ſhould happen in his Houſe by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
for he had after Twelve of the Clock that night gone through
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40386:5"/>
every Room thereof, and found no Fire, but in one Chimney, where
the Room was paved with Bricks, which Fire he diligently raked
up in Embers. He was then asked, whether no Window or Door
might let in wind to diſturb thoſe Coals? He affirmed there was
no poſſibility for any wind to diſturb them: and that it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
ſet on fire of purpoſe.</p>

                  <hi>Dawes Weymanſel</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace,
informed, That he ſaw a man apprehended in the time of the Fire,
near the Temple, with his Pockets ſtuft with <hi>combuſtible matter,</hi>
made of Flax, Tow, and ſuch-like materials.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>John Packer</hi> informs, That he ſaw a Perſon in the time of
the Fire, throw ſome <hi>combuſtible matter</hi> into a Shop in the <hi>Old Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
which he thinks was the Shop of an Apothecary; and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
thereupon he ſaw a great ſmoak, and ſmelt a <hi>ſmell of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</hi>
The Perſon that did this, immediately ran away; but upon
the out-cry of the People he was taken by the Guards.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haſlem,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humphry Bowyer,</hi> do all agree,
That they ſaw a perſon flinging ſomething into a Houſe near St.
<hi>Antholines</hi> Church; and that thereupon the Houſe was on fire, and
the ſmoak thereof infeſted the adjacent Houſes. And when this was
done, there was <hi>No fire near the place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Michael March,</hi> an Officer in the Trained Bands in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Sir <hi>Richard Browns,</hi> apprehended a <hi>Walloon</hi> in the time of
the Fire, at the Nags-Head in <hi>Leaden-hall-Street,</hi> with an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
like a dark Lanthorn, made (as is conceived) to lay a Train
of Powder, and it was filled with Gun-powder. There were two
more of the ſame Nation in his company. They being asked to what
uſe they employed the ſame Inſtrument, would give no Account
thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Newton Killingworth</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> informed, That he apprehended a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
during the fire, about whom he found much <hi>combuſtible matter,</hi>
and certain <hi>black things, of a long figure,</hi> which he could not indure
to hold in his hand, by reaſon of their extream heat. This Perſon
was ſo ſurprized at firſt, that he would not anſwer to any queſtion;
But being on his way to <hi>White-hall,</hi> he acted the part of a Mad-man,
and ſo continued while he was with him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> a Member of this Houſe, affirms, That he had
ſome of that combuſtible matter in his hands; and though it were in
its natural ſubſtance, and unfired, yet the heat of it was ſcarcely to
be endured by the touch.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Freeman <hi>of</hi> Southwark <hi>Brewer, (whoſe Houſe was lately fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
informs, That on the day his Houſe was fired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (about a quarter
of an hour before that happened) a Paper with a Ball of Wildfire,
containing near a pound weight wrapped in it, was found in the</hi>
Nave of a Wheel, <hi>in a Wheelers-yard, where lay a great quantity of
Timber. How his Houſe was fired he knoweth not; but this he
affirmed to the Committee,</hi> That it could not be by accident, becauſe
there had not been any Candle or Fire in the Houſe where the Hay lay,
that whole day; and that the Hay being laid in very dry, and before
Midſummer, could not poſſibly be ſet on fire within it ſelf. <hi>Moreover
he ſaid,</hi> That the Hay-loft was on fire on the top of the Houſe, and that
the Fire ſpread from the one end of the Roof to another in an instant.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Harwood</hi> informs, That being near the Feathers
Tavern by <hi>St. Pauls,</hi> upon the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> he ſaw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
through a Grate in a Celler, like Wild-fire, by the ſparkling
and ſpitting of it he could judge it to be no other; Whereupon
he gave notice of it to ſome Souldiers that were near the place, who
cauſed it to be quenched.</p>
               <p>I had order from the Committee to acquaint you, That we traced ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Perſons apprehended upon ſtrong ſuſpition (during the Fire) to the
Guards, but could not make further diſcovery of them.</p>
               <p>Thus far was the Report: What follows was given in to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
but not by them Reported to the Houſe at that time..</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <p>IN obedience to an Order directed to me, from the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of the Houſe of Commons, then ſitting in the Speakers Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
of the ſecond of <hi>October,</hi> 1666. I did carry <hi>Robert Hubert to</hi>
St. <hi>Katherines Tower</hi> by Water, to let me know the place where the
Swediſh Ship lay, that brought him and other Frenchmen from <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi>
and he brought me to the Dock over-againſt Mr. <hi>Corſellis</hi> his
Brew-houſe, and did then verifie to me, and Mr. <hi>Corſellis,</hi> That the
Ship lay there, until ſuch time as he with Mr. <hi>Peidloe</hi> and others did
go and ſet fire to a Houſe. And this <hi>Hubert</hi> did then further ſay, That
Mr. <hi>Peidloe</hi> did fix two Fire-Balls to a long Pole, and put them into a
Window; and that he the ſaid <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> did fire one in the ſame
manner, and put it in at the ſame Window. But with all the inquiry and
dilligence that I could uſe, I could neither find nor hear of any ſuch Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.
And from thence I carried the ſaid <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> to <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40386:6"/>
and did then deſire him to ſhew me the Houſe that they did fire, and
he ſaid, That it was near the Bridge. So we went along <hi>Thames-ſtreet</hi>
towards the Bridge; but before we came to the Bridge, the ſaid <hi>Robert
Hubert</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Houſe was up there</hi> (pointing with his hand
up <hi>Pudding-lane:)</hi> So I bid him go to the place, and he went along
the Bricks and Rubbiſh, and made a ſtand. Then did I ask one <hi>Robert
Penny,</hi> a Wine-Porter, which was the Bakers Houſe? and he told me,
That was the Houſe where the aforeſaid <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> ſtood. So I went
to <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> and ſtood by him, and turned my back towards the
Bakers Houſe, and demanded of him, which Houſe it was that he fired,
(directing to other Houſes contrary to that Houſe) But he turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
about ſaid, <hi>This was the Houſe</hi> (pointing to the Bakers Houſe)
that was first fired. Then by reaſon of his lameneſs I ſet him on a Horſe,
and carried him to ſeveral other places, but no other place he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
but rode back again to the Bakers Houſe, and ſaid again,
<hi>That that was the Houſe</hi> (pointing at the Bakers Houſe) And this I
do humbly certifie to this Honourable Committee.</p>

Fired the City, or had a hand therein, or any privity or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any that had deſigned the ſame; or words to that effect:
The ſaid perſon anſwered a great while in a perverſe manner, quite
different from the queſtion. But being further preſſed to tell the
truth; and being told, that if he were guilty, it would be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to ſave his Life: He did at firſt obſtinately deny, that he
knew any thing of any Plot. Whereupon a Young man took the
Priſoner aſide to the end of the Room, and after ſome private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
between them; they both returned to this Informant and the
reſt of the Company, and the ſaid Young man ſpake openly to us,
in the hearing of the Priſoner, That the ſaid <hi>Frenchman</hi> and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
had confeſſed, <hi>there were Three hundred Frenchmen that were
in a Plot or Conspiracy to fire the City.</hi> Upon which this Informant
and others ſpake to the ſaid <hi>Frenchman</hi> in theſe words, or to the
ſame effect: <hi>Well Monſieur, you have done very well to confeſs what
you have done, and no doubt but you may have your Pardon, if you will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40386:7"/>
confeſs all you know of this Plot:</hi> And thereupon further asked him,
<hi>Are there no more than three hundred perſons in the ſaid Plot?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>There are no more than three hundred Perſons.</hi> Then we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
who they were, and how he came to know they were <hi>Three
huudred?</hi> To which he would give no direct Anſwer, but put it off
with other extravagant diſcourſe. And being asked why he came
to St. <hi>Giles</hi> Pariſh (where he was apprehended?) He told a ſtory,
that he came from <hi>Iſlington-Fields,</hi> where his Maſters Goods were;
But the Goods were now removed, but he could not tell whither;
and that his Maſter bid him go up and down the Fields, but would
not declare upon what occaſion, or for what end he was ſo to do:
And being asked whether there were <hi>three hundred</hi> perſons engaged
in this Deſign or Plot? He replied, that there were <hi>Three hundred</hi>
engaged in it.</p>

hears a Woman cry out againſt a <hi>Frenchman</hi> for throwing <hi>Fire-balls,</hi>
he runs after him, and lays hold of him. He asked him what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
he had for ſo doing? He anſwered, that <hi>his Commiſſion was
in his Cheſt.</hi> The People coming in, they ſearch'd him, and found
<hi>Fireballs</hi> in his pockets. He was delivered to the Guard in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi>

                  <p>A Citizen being fired out of his Houſe, had hired a Lodging in
<hi>Queens ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden;</hi> and going up <hi>Holborn</hi> (there being
a Crowd of people) ſteps in amongſt them, and hears a Woman ſay,
that ſhe had a hand in Firing the City. The People askt her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe were an Anabaptiſt? She ſaid No: Are you an Independent?
She ſaid No: Are you a Preſbyterian? She ſaid No: Are you a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick?</hi> to which ſhe would give no anſwer. The Citizen
asked her, but Miſtris had you a hand in Burning the City? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
what would you have me to ſay? <hi>I have confeſſed it already,
and do deſerve to Dye for it:</hi> this ſhe ſaid with great trembling, and
ſeemed to be much troubled. The Citizen enquires for a Conſtable,
the People reply, there was one gone for, But a Gallant comes,
and takes her by the Arm, and leads her away, ſaying he would
have her examined, and forthwith another Gallant cloſeth with him,
and they both carryed her to the <hi>Griffin</hi> Tavern in <hi>Holborn.</hi> The
Citizen follows them, to ſee the reſult of the buſineſs. But, they, with
the Maſter of the Houſe, ſhut out the Company (all but the Citizen,
ſuppoſing him to be one of their own Company) but asking one the
other concerning him, and finding him not of them, put him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Whereupon he goes to the next Company of Souldiers, and
inquires for their Captain, who replyed, he was not there, but told
him, Yonder is my Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> unto whom the Citizen repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and acquainted his Lordſhip, That there was a Woman appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
(and reſcued by a couple of Gallants) that had Confeſſed
ſhe had a hand in Burning the City, and was at ſuch a Tavern.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40386:9"/>
Whereupon the Lord <hi>Craven</hi> called to a Captain in the ſtreet, and
ordered him to go with that Man and apprehend the Woman that
he ſhould direct him to; Whereupon he goes with the Citizen, and
takes her with the firſt Gallant, who ſtood up highly in her defence,
and carries them both to an Alehouſe on the other ſide of the way.
The Citizen perceiving that nothing would be done with her, leaves
his name with the Captain, and where he might be found, but was
never called for to Juſtifie the words ſpoken by her.</p>
                  <p>A Woman ſtanding in <hi>White-Chappel</hi> with a Company about her,
was askt what the matter was? She ſaid, that ſhe met two young
men in that place, and asked them how it was with the Fire: They
anſwered, <hi>Its now almoſt out, if it can be kept ſo, but the Rogues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
it with their Fireballs.</hi> Ay ſaith another Woman, Young men,
if you have a heart to it, you may be hyred to throw <hi>Fire-balls</hi> too;
For I know where twenty were hired yeſterday to throw them. It
was askt her, what was become of the Woman that ſpake thus? She
anſwered, That ſhe had apprehended her and delivered her to the
under Beadle of <hi>White-Cappel</hi>-Pariſh. The Woman falling under
the accuſation (not being able to deny it) there being many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

Sir, do you think this a great matter? I uſe all this my ſelf;
But if you did ſee all the great quantities I have made elſewhere, in three

anſwered, <hi>I make of all ſorts; ſome that will burn and make no crack at
all, but will fly up in a pure Body of flame, higher then the top of</hi> Pauls,
<hi>and Waver in the Ayre.</hi> Says the Citizen, Mr. <hi>Belland,</hi> when you
make your Shew, ſhall I ſee it? Yes, ſaid <hi>Belland,</hi> I promiſe you, and
gave him his hand upon it. Which Citizen in the time of the Fire,
being upon the <hi>Thames</hi> in a Boat, ſaw, to his great amazement, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
bodyes of Fire, burning above the Fire of the Houſes <hi>as high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
as Pauls, Wavering in the Ayre,</hi> directly according to <hi>Bellands</hi>
deſcription.</p>
                     <p>And after the Burning of the City, the Stationer and the other
Citizen agreed to go to <hi>Maribone,</hi> to ſpeak with this <hi>Belland;</hi> and by
the way met with his two Maids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Boy: And having ſome
knowledge of them, asked for young Mr. <hi>Belland,</hi> who told them, he
was not at home, neither knew they where he was. But the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens
obſerving that they carryed with them Rabbets and Capons
ready dreſt, concluded, they were going to him, and told them ſo.
Whereat, they were ſurly and bad them go look him, for they would
not tell them where he was. Upon that, the Citizens reſolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, and did, till they came to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The Servants went up
ſtairs and down ſtairs, on purpoſe to have loſt them, but could not,
for they kept cloſe to them. And at laſt, one of the Maids went to
a door and knock'd, Crying out, <hi>They were dogg'd by two men, that
they could not be rid of;</hi> With that young Mr. <hi>Belland</hi> opened the
door ſaying to one of the Citizens, <hi>Sir your Servant, how do you do?</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40386:11"/>
One of them anſwered, <hi>Both I and many Thouſand Families more are
the worſe for you; for you under pretence of making Fire-works for the
King, have Deſtroyed a Famous City, and Ruined a Noble People.</hi> To
which <hi>Belland</hi> replyes, <hi>I make nothing but Innocent Things, that will
do no harm; for which I have a Pattent from the King.</hi> But the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
anſwered, <hi>If the King gave you a Patent, it was but for your ſelf:</hi>
Who anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> Said the Citizen, <hi>What made you then to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ſo many men, in ſo many places?</hi> No, ſaid <hi>Belland, I ſet no man to
work, neither know I any Man that makes of them, but my ſelf;</hi> though
he had often before ſaid otherwiſe. While they were thus diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
Old <hi>Belland</hi> looks from under the Hanging, Sir, ſaid he, <hi>I hear
you charge my Son with Suſpition of Burning the City, I pray you ſpeak
lower</hi> (caſting his Eyes about, fearing the Ladies paſſing by might
hear) and ſaid, <hi>My Son doth nothing but what he hath a Pattent from
the King for, and ſhall have an Order to Sue any man, that ſhall accuſe
him.</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>My Son is no Priſoner, but Lodged here to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
him from the Rage of the Common People.</hi> Well, ſaid the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
<hi>You muſt give an Account for what you have done.</hi> And ſo they
ſhut the Door upon them. The Citizens went and enquired whoſe
Lodgings they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were told, they belonged to the Lady <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legrew.</hi>

                  <head>The Information of <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> Chyrurgeon, late Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

                  <p>I The ſaid <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> do hereby certifie, that upon the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in the afternoon (the day wherein the dreadful fire brake out
in <hi>Pudding-Lane</hi> which conſumed the City) hearing the general out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry,
that the City was fired by <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> I repaired to the
top of a Church Steeple near the <hi>Three Cranes</hi> in the <hi>Vintrey,</hi> where
my ſelf and ſeveral others obſerved the motion of the <hi>Fire</hi> for two
or three hours together, and we all took notice, that the <hi>Fire</hi> did
break forth out of ſeveral houſes, when the houſes which were then
burning were at a good diſtance from them every way, and more
particularly, I ſaw the fire break out from the inſide of <hi>Lawrence-Pountney</hi>
Steeple, when there was no fire near it. Theſe and ſuch
like Obſervations begat in me a Perſwaſion, that the <hi>Fire</hi> was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by deſign. Upon <hi>Munday</hi> I repaired again into the City,
and found as the day before, that the <hi>Fire</hi> did break forth in freſh
houſes at a great diſtance one from another. And as I was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40386:12"/>
home, paſſing through <hi>Watling-Street</hi> by a Tobacco Merchants
houſe, I ſaw the Maſter of the houſe come down ſtaires, driving a
young fellow before him, ſaying to him, <hi>You Rogue, do you come to
Rob me? what did you do in my Garret?</hi> or words to that purpoſe, and
puſhed him out of doors: All which I obſerved, and he ſeemed to be
a Frenchman: He was a ſhort black fellow of about 22 years of Age:
and as ſoon as he was out of the houſe, he having a looſe coat on,
in a way of Privacy, Shuffles ſomething under his Coat, whereupon
I laid hold of him, and ſaid, <hi>Sirrah, what have you there?</hi> The fellow
replyed, <hi>What is that to you, the Maſter of the Houſe knows me:</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that I asked the Mr. of the Houſe whether he knew the fellow, he
anſwered, <hi>he knew him not.</hi> Whereupon I ſearched the fellow, and
found a horn of powder about him, and as ſoon as the powder was
diſcovered, he fell a rubbing his hands, they being all black with
powder: He had alſo about him, a Book intituled, <hi>The Jewiſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
I charged him that he was a Frenchman, becauſe he ſpake
broken Engliſh; but he denyed it, and did much Vaunt himſelf.
There coming a Conſtable by with his Staffe, I Required him to
carry him to Priſon, and I would aſſiſt him; So we conveyed him to
<hi>Old Bridewel,</hi> and by the way, the People were ready to kill him,
calling him <hi>French-Raſcal.</hi> I prayed them to forbear, for Juſtice
would give him his Reward. I told the fellow he would be hanged;
he made ſlight of it, ſaying, <hi>If I dye my Soul ſhall be Saved, but yours
ſhall be Damned.</hi> And when he was put into <hi>Bridewel,</hi> I deſired that
he might be ſecured and none ſuffered to ſpeak with him, till he were
Examined before a Magiſtrate, becauſe the Tobacco-Merchants
Houſe was preſently Burned upon it. But ſo it happned on the next
day that the fire came on, and conſumed my Houſe and Goods, ſo
that I was forced with my Family to fly into the Country, and what
became of the Fellow I know not, <hi>Old Bridewel</hi> being burnt alſo.
And underſtanding that the Parliament hath appointed a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
to enquire after the Actors in, and Fomenters of that Terrible
Fire, I thought good to inform the Honourable Committee thereof,
that they may ſend for the Keeper of the ſaid <hi>Bridewel,</hi> to know
what became of the Fellow, that he might receive Juſtice accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his demerit. Thus much I thought my ſelf obliged to do, as
in Duty bound to God and my Country. All which I am ready to

                  <p>IN the time of the Fire, near <hi>Bridewell,</hi> there was a man ſadly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning
the great Loſs he was like to ſuſtain (the Fire then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within five or ſix houſes of him) did beſeech the people for Gods
ſake, they having no Goods of their own in danger, to come in and
help him to throw out Trunks, Cheſts, Beds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out at a window,
having procured two <hi>Carts</hi> or <hi>Waggons</hi> to carry them away. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I ran into his Houſe with ſeveral others, broke down his
Windows, threw out his Goods, and loaded the Carts; and there
being ſome interval of time before the return of the Carts, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Room wherein were many Books and looſe Papers (which
ſeemed to be a Library) I went in and took down a Book, which
proved to be <hi>Ovids Metamorphoſis,</hi> and while I was looking upon it,
there came into the ſame Room an Old Man of low ſtature, with a
white Frock, who looked alſo on the Book as it was in my hand; I
took him in my mind to be ſome Groom come out of a Stable, and
thought him to be preſumptuouſly fooliſh, ſuppoſing ſuch a mean-like
old man ignorant of that language in which the Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
it being Latine, but I ſpoke not to him: In the mean time,
there brake forth a Fire amongſt the Papers which were behind us,
there being none in the Room but he and I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereupon the reſt of
the people coming in, cryed out, we had ſet the Room on fire,
and ruſhing in upon us, put out the fire with their feet: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I took hold of the Old Man by the buttons under the throat,
and ſaid, <hi>How now Father, it muſt either be you or I muſt fire theſe
Papers.</hi> There was a ſmall thing of a Black matter, which looked
like a piece of a Link, burning, which queſtionleſs ſet fire on
the Papers, but it was immediately trod out. A multitude of people
thronged in; and when I ſaid, <hi>How now Father,</hi> &amp; took hold of him,
he ſaid, <hi>Parce mihi Domine:</hi> The people which did not underſtand
it, cryed out, <hi>He is a Frenchman, kill him,</hi> and with pulling of him,
his Perriwig fell off; then appeared a bald Skull, and under his
Frock he had black Clothes, I think of Biſhops Sattin, whereupon
he ſeemed to be a grave Eccleſiaſtick Perſon. I had much ado to
ſave him from the people, but at laſt brought him before the Duke
of <hi>York:</hi> we found in his pocket a bundle of Papers cloſed up with
Wax like a Packet, which was delivered to the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> I
know not what was written in them, neither do I know what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man
he was; but methoughts he looked ſomething Jeſuitical-like.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40386:13"/>
This I am certain of, that when I went into the Room there
was no fire in it, and it was fired when there was none but he and I
in it, yet I cannot ſay I ſaw him do it, though I cannot but ſuſpect
he did it, and the rather, becauſe there were ſeveral houſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched
betwixt this houſe, and where the fire was coming on,
when the Papers in the Library were thus on fire as I have related.

<q>I will not ſay that I am a Papiſt; but this I will ſay, that
I had rather dye the death of a Papiſt, and that my Soul ſhould
be raiſed with their Reſurrection, Than either to be Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Independent or Anabaptiſt. And I tell you, the Papiſts have
hitherto been his Majeſties beſt Fortification. For when Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,
Independent, and Anabaptiſts oppoſed him, then they
ſtood by him and helped him. And he is now reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelf into their hands. And take it upon my word, in a
ſhort time, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will lay you as low as that houſe; pointing
to a houſe that was demoliſh'd; For they are able to raiſe Forty
thouſand men. And I believe the next work will be cutting of

objected, That he intended to practiſe the Law, which he could not
do, if he turned <hi>Papiſt,</hi> becauſe he muſt take the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi>
at his being called to the Bar: and if he were a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> he muſt not
take it. Mr. <hi>Jeviſton</hi> replied, <hi>Why not take the Oath? It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Oath, and void</hi> ipſo facto; and after ſome pauſe, ſaid further,
<hi>Firſt take the Oath, and then I will Convert you.</hi> He ſaid further,
<hi>The King will not own himſelf to be Head of the Church.</hi> And ſaid

of the Order of the Jeſuites, and Commiſſioned from the Pope
to be Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> and Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armaugh)</hi> and
falling into ſome diſcorſe with him, he told him that there had been
a difference betwixt him and ſome other of the Jeſuits in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
that part of the occaſion was, That one <hi>Father Welch</hi> and ſome other
of the Jeſuites there, did diſpence with the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> to take
the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy, by vertue of a <hi>Standing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
from the Pope which he had to do it, <hi>During this Kings

Pope <hi>every Year to do it.</hi> And likewiſe that he brought eight Boyes
out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom he intended to carry for <hi>Flanders,</hi> to breed
up in ſome of the Colledges there. And at his taking Shipping to
go for <hi>Flanders, He ſhaked his Foot towards England,</hi> terming it <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>

A <hi>French</hi> Merchant, being a Papiſt, living in <hi>St. Michaels-Lane

Zeal for their horrid Principles, had too great a ſhare in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the City; And did intend to do further miſchief to the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> (of which I am now, and ever ſhall be a Member) do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
abhorrency of that Villany, and Religion that hath moved me to
it, declare to all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the Approach of their Sudden Ruine,
that it may be prevented, if it be not too late.</p>
                              <p>When I, together with other <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both <hi>French, Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
fired the City; others were imployed to maſſacre the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
we thinking thereby to deſtroy the Heads of your Religion;
but the Maſſacre was diſappointed by the Fear of him who was the
chief Agent in this Villany. And the <hi>Fire</hi> not having done all its
Work, they have often endeavoured to fire the remaining part.
They intend likewiſe to land the <hi>French</hi> upon you: To whoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
they all intend to come, and for that purpoſe are ſtored
with Arms: And have ſo far deceived the King, that they have the
