            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe firſt Tryal was of a young fellow that on the 25. of <hi>May</hi> laſt came early in the morning to drink with one of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and afterwards the ſame forenoon came again all alone by himſelf, call'd for a Pot of drink and muſt needs have a Cup to drink out of, they brought him a ſilver Beaker valued at 35 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, he pretended to wait for his friend, lingered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſometime, but at laſt ſpying an opportunity when the Maid of the houſe was gone into the Stables, ſtole the plate and left his reckoning to pay, he made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſlight ridiculous Excuſes, as that he was drunk, that his friend came and took it away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he himſelf offered the plate to ſale, and thereupon was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>The next was a pickpocket who on the 2. of <hi>May</hi> ſeeing a young maiden dancing with the Milkwoman made ſhift to ſteal a box and 21 ſhillings 6. pence in money out of her Pocket, and according to method, forthwith delivered it to a boy his Confederate, who immediately ran away and is not yet taken. But our young practitioner was not ſo much Mr. of Art as to

perform the Exploit clerely, for he was both perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Girl, diving in her pocket and ſeen by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliver away the prize, ſo that he was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>A young Girl of St. <hi>Giles Cripplegate</hi> pariſh was Indicted for ſtealing at ſeveral times 3 ounces of their ſilver Plate, ſhe very ſorrowfully confeſt the Fact, and declared that 2 apple women that received it of her prompted and encouraged her to it ſaying, 'tis a good Girl get ſome more, The Jury found that value under 10 pence ſo that ſhes only like to be whipt, But her wicked deducers deſerve a ſeverer Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Middleſex</hi> was Arraigned a Highway-man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly as he pretended belonging to the Guard, but now priſoner to the fleet, but being not in Execution upon bail had favour or I know not how, got his Liberty, which he made this ill uſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> having got a confederate not yet taken being both well mounted about 3 miles on this ſide <hi>

Anſwer'd very complyingly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them they had but very little money but the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingman being a ſturdy fellow forthwith drew his ſword, which the highway men perceiving rode up to him, and a fierce conflict began between them for almoſt a quarter of an hour the fellow driving them

before them attempted to ſhoot him, but their piſtols did not go off; at laſt they rid away about a Furlong fitted up their Piſtols, and ſo came down again; one of them skirmiſhes the Man, whilſt the other ranſacks the Maſter and his fellow Traveller. From one they took ſix ſhillings, or thereabouts; from the other, only ſome ſilver halfted Knives, a ſilver Box, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for in the mean time they had both convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away what Money conſiderable they had about them: Then both attaqu'd the Servingman, and no intrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

So that he was deſervedly found Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106395:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>A Victualer in St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the fields was Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for killing a Woman by beating her when ſhe came to pay reſtitution of her goods, which he had ſeized being her Landlord, and at the ſame time caſt her Husband into Goal for Rent. It was proved, That he did fling her down and beat her, but ſhe lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a quarter of a year after, <hi>viz.</hi> from the 28 of <hi>December</hi> to the 5. of <hi>May,</hi> That on <hi>Candlemas-day</hi> ſhe was delivered of a Child, which lived 9 or 10 days. There was ſome diſcourſe that ſhe was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward delivered of ſeveral parts of a dead Child, but that did not ſufficiently appear, nor any poſitive proof that ſhe died of this beating, but rather circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the contrary. Upon all which, after many Witneſſes heard on his behalf, the Priſoner was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
            <p>After this was the Tryal of a Midwife of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of St. <hi>Giles Cripplegate,</hi> who was Indicted by her ſelf, and immediately after two very aged poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being Searchers towards <hi>Wapping</hi> Indicted joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for murdering a certain male Child by choaking the ſame with their hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some account has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been given in Print of this buſineſs, but very falſe and imperfect, upon full Evidence it appeared only to be thus. This Midwife whether to ſatisfie her husband (as ſhe now alleadges) who was very Impatient to have a child, or whether it were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her credit in her imploy which ſhe thought ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prejudiced by the imputation of barrenneſs, I cannot ſay, but ſo it was ſhe reſolved to pretend to have a Child, in order hereunto by wearing a ſmall Pillow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhe had perſwaded many of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106395:4"/>
that ſhe was great, and about a week before her pretended Labour enquired very earneſtly of a poor Woman if ſhe could not help her to a young Child as ſoon almoſt as born, either alive or dead, For ſays ſhe there is a Lady whoſe husband will not live with her becauſe ſhe never had a Child, and he is now in the Country and if I could get a Child, I ſhould do a good office in rendering love between them, and get ſomething my ſelf, but this Woman as ſhe now ſwore, refuſed not knowing how to aſſiſt her; whereupon it ſeems ſhe applyed her ſelf to the two Searchers of <hi>Whitechappel,</hi> who having gratified her extravagant deſires, on the 18. of <hi>April</hi> our Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife pretends to fall in labour, but would not let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the women touch her; and having diſmiſt all ſave one in the Chamber, when ſhe was got to bed, pretending great pains, her friend offering to put her hands into the Bed for better ſatisfying her ſelf of her condition, ſhe cried out <hi>Murder! Murder!</hi> which raiſing a further ſuſpicion in the woman, ſhe did at laſt take out of the Bed a cold naked dead Child, which had, as appeared, been wrapt up in a Cloth, and ſeemed to have been a day or two old; whereupon ſhe told the Priſoner this could be none of her child, who wickedly replyed with a horrid Curſe and Imprecation on her ſelf, if it were not her own child, born of her own body: However Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours being called, ſeveral ſober Matrons now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that having ſearched her, they were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhe had no child at all, and that this was ſome other perſons child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Priſoner being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande where ſhe had the child, declared of the

two Searchers, which they being called to the Bar acknowledged, and that they brought it to her the ſame day, and had 20 <hi>s.</hi> being promiſed 9 <hi>l.</hi> more: That they had it on <hi>Saltpeter Bank.</hi> The Mother appeared in Court, and her Midwife, who teſtified it to be ſtill born, and that they coming to ſearch it, and ſeeing her a very poor woman, told her they would ſave her the charge of a Burial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Mother denyed ſhe had any money for it: Upon full examination of all which no ſuſpicion of murder appearing, but only a ſtrange extravagant humour, both the Midwife and two Searchers were by the Jury brought in Not Guilty of the ſeveral Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereof they ſtood charged.</p>
