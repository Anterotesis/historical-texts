            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE chief part of this following Diſcourſe, being preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and that upon an occaſion which you are obliged to conſider, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1.) being called to publiſh it, I thought it meet to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it firſt to your hands, and to take this opportunity, plainly and ſeriouſly to exhort you in ſome matters that your preſent and everlaſting peace is much concerned in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59502:4"/>Credible fame reporteth you to be a people not all of one mind, or temper in the matters of God: but that 1. Some of you are Godly, Sobe, and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: 2. Some well-meaning and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but addicted to diviſions. 3. Some Papiſts. 4. Some <hi>Hiders,</hi> ſeduced by your late deceaſed neighbour <hi>Clement Writer,</hi> (to whom the Quakers do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in many opinions,). 5. And too many prophane and obſtinate perſons, that are heartily and ſeriouſly of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but take occaſion from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the reſt, to deſpiſe or neglect the Ordinances of God, and join them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to no Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>1. To the firſt ſort (having leaſt need of my exhortation,) I ſay no more, but, As you have received Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him, rooted and built up in him, and ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving: and beware leſt any man ſpoil you by deceit, &amp;c.] <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. Walk as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59502:4"/>
a choſen generation, a royal Prieſt-hood, a holy Nation, a peculiar people, to ſhew forth the praiſes of him that hath called you out of darkneſs into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light; having your converſation honeſt among the ungodly, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are apt to ſpeak againſt you as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doers, they may by your good works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of viſitation; For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9, 11, 12, 15. Your labour and patience is known to the Lord; and how ye cannot bear them which are evill, but have tried them which ſay they ſpeak from the Lord, and are Apoſtles, and are not, and have found them lyars; even the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that is ſuffered to teach and ſeduce the people, calling her ſelf a Propheteſs, who ſhall be caſt into a bed of tribulation, and all that commit adultery with her, except they repent; and her children ſhall be killed with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59502:5"/>
death; and all the Churches ſhall know that Chriſt is he which ſearcheth the reines and hearts; and will give to every one according to their work. As for your ſelves, we put upon you no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burden, but that which you have already; Hold faſt till the Lord come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. Be watchfull, that ye fall not from your firſt Love: and if any have declined and grown remiſs, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how you have received and heard, and hold faſt, and repent, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the things that remain, which are ready to die, leſt your Candleſtick ſhould be removed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs; but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17, 18. And I beſeech you brethren, do all things without murmurings and diſputings, that ye may be blameleſs, and harmleſs, the Sons of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke in the midſt of a crooked
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59502:5"/>
and perverſe Nation, among whom you (and your brethren) ſhine as lights in the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And if in well doing you ſuffer, think it not ſtrange, but rejoyce that ye are partakers of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, ye are happy, for the Spirit of glory and of God reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon you, being glorified on your part, while he is evil ſpoken of on theirs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>2. To the <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> (inclinable to diviſions) let me tender the Counſel of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 1. My brethren be not many Maſters (or Teachers) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ye ſhall receive the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.] The wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, and then Peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy &amp; good fruits, without partiality, and without hipocriſie: And the fruit of Righteouſneſs is ſown in peace, of them that make peace. Who then is the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59502:6"/>
wiſe and knowing man amongſt you? Let him ſhew out of a good converſation, his works with meekneſs of wiſdom. But if ye have bitter envying and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not againſt the truth: This wiſdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth not from above, but is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſenſuall, deviliſh: For where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work.] Look on thoſe Aſſemblies, where the people profeſſing the fear of God are of one heart and mind, and walk together in Love and holy Order, and people give due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obedience to their faithful Guides; and compare them with the Congregations where profeſſors are ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited, unruly, proud, and addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to oſtentation of themſelves, and to diviſions: and ſee which is likeſt to the Primitive pattern, and in which it is that the power of godlineſs proſpereth beſt, and the beauty of Religion moſt appears, and Chriſtians walk as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed. If pride had not brought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59502:6"/>
the heavy judgment of infatuation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility on many; the too clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the fruits of diviſions in the numerous and ſad experiences of this age, would have cauſed them to be abhorred as odious and deſtructive, by thoſe that now think they do but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend their lower brethren in holineſs and zeal. [I beſeech you therefore brethren, by the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you all ſpeak the ſame thing and that there be no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among you, but that you be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10.] The God of patience and conſolation grant you to be like minded one towards another, acording to Chriſt Jeſus; that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorifie God,] <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 5, 6. And I beſeech you brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you: And eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake, and be at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59502:7"/>
peace among your ſelves, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. And mark thoſe that cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, &amp; avoid them <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. And if there be any conſolaton in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye our joy, that ye may be like minded having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind: Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain glory, but in lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better then themſelves. Look not every man on his own things (his own gifts and graces) but every man alſo on the things (the graces and gifts) of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Let this mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no reputation (or, emptied himſelf of all worldly glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 2, 3, 4. As if he had had no form or comlineſs, and no beauty to the eye, for which we ſhould deſire him: but was deſpiſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59502:7"/>
&amp; rejected of men, &amp; not eſteemed,) <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. It is not (as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) your extraordinary Knowledg, Zeal, and Holineſs, that inclineth you to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and to cenſuring of your brethren; but it is Pride, and Ignorance, and want of Love: and if you grow to any ripeneſs in Knowledg, Humility, Self-denial, and Charity, you will bewail your divide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inclinations and courſes; and reckon them among the greater and grievous of your ſins, and cry out againſt them as much as your more charitable and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced brethren do.</p>
            <p>3. To the third ſort, (the Papiſts) I ſhall ſay nothing here, becauſe I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they ſhould read it and conſider it: and becauſe we are ſo far diſagreed in our Principles that we cannot treat with them on thoſe rational terms as we may do with the reſt of the inhabitants of the world, whether Chriſtians, Infidels or Heathens. As long as they build their faith and ſalvation on this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the eyes, and taſte, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59502:8"/>
of all the ſound men in the world, are deceived in judging of Bread and Wine; and as long as they deny the certaine experience of true believers (telling us that we are void of Charity and unjuſtified becauſe we are not of their Church;) and as long as they fly from the judgment and Tradition of the ancient and preſent Church (unleſs their ſmall part may be taken for the whole, or the major Vote;) and as long as they reject our appeal to the holy Scriptures: I know not well what we can ſay to them which we can expect they ſhould regard, any more than muſick is regarded by the deaf, or light by the blind, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by the diſtracted. If they had the moderation and charity impartially to peruſe our writings, I durſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently promiſe the recovery of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them, by the three Writings which I have already publiſhed, and the more that others have ſaid againſt them.</p>
            <p>4. And for the fourth ſort (the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59502:8"/>
Hiders, and the Quakers) I have ſaid enough to them already (in my Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infidelity and thoſe againſt Popery and Quakers,) but in vain to thoſe that have ſinned unto death.</p>
            <p>5. It is the fifth ſort therefore that I ſhall cheifly addreſs my ſpeech to; who, I fear are not the ſmalleſt part. It is an aſtoniſhing conſideration to men that are awake, to obſerve the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupidity of the ignorant, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſenſual part of men; How little they Love or Fear the God whom their tongues confeſs; How little they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, or mind, or ſeek the everlaſting glory, which they take on them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; How little they fear and ſhun thoſe flames which muſt feed for ever on the impenitent and unholy; How little they care or labour for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoules, as if they were of the Religion of their beaſts: How bitterly many of them hate the holy wayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord: while yet they pretend to be themſelves his Servants, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59502:9"/>
to take the Scriptures to be his word: How ſottiſhly and contemptuouſly they neglect and ſleight the Holineſs without which there is no ſalvation; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. How eagerly they deſire and ſeek the pleaſing of their fleſh, and the matters of this tranſitory life, while they call them <hi>vanity and vexation;</hi> How madly they will fall out with their own ſalvation; and from the errours and ſins of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites or others, will pick quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine, and Ordinances, and waies of God; as if other mens faults ſhould be exceeded by you, while you pretend to loath them. If it be a ſin to crack our faith by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular error, what is it to daſh it all to peices? If it be odious in your eyes, to denie ſome particular Ordinance of God, what is it to neglect or Prophane them all? If it be their ſin that quarrel in the way to Heaven, and walk not in companie as love requireth them; what is it in you to run towards hell, and turn your backs on the holie Laws
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59502:9"/>
and waies of God? If it be ſo lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Nation and themſelves, that ſo many have faln into ſchiſm and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; what is it then that ſo many are ungodlie, ſenſual, and worldlie, and have no true Religion at all, in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and life, and power? Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is all Hereſie tranſcendently in the lump, and that in Practice. A man that is ſo fooliſh as to plead that Arſnick is better then bread, may yet live himſelf if he do not take it: but ſo cannot he that eateth it inſtead of bread. Hereticks only in ſpeculation may be ſaved: but practical hereticks cannot. You think it hainous to denie with the mouth that there is a God, who made us, and is our only Lord and Happineſs (and ſo it is.) And is it not hainous then to denie him with the heart and life; and to denie him the love and obedience that is Properly due to God? It is odious idolatrie to bow to a creature as to God; and is it not odious to love, and honour, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey a creature before him, and to ſeek it more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59502:10"/>
eagerly, and mind it more ſeriouſly then God? If it be damnable Infidelity to denie Chriſt to be the Redeemer, it is not much leſs to turn away from him, and make light of him and refuſe his grace, while you ſeem to honour him. If it be damnable blaſphemy to deny the Holy Ghoſt; what is it to reſiſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him when he would ſanctifie you, and perhaps to make a ſcorn of holineſs? If it be Hereſie to denie the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and the Communion of Saints; what is it to hate the Holy members of the Church, and to avoid, if not deride, the Communion of Saints? Be not deceived, God is not mocked: A mock-Religion, and the name of Chriſtianity will never ſave you. Do you know how near you are to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will you fearleſly thus heap up wrath, and lay in fewel for the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting flames? Do you know how ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily you ſhall wiſh in the bitterneſs of your ſouls, that you had heard, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and laboured as for your lives, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59502:10"/>
redeemed your time, and obeyed your Teachers? and yet will you now ſtand loitering; and quarrelling, and jeſting, and dallying in the matters of ſalvation? and will you live as if you had nothing but the world to mind, when you are even readie to ſtep into the endleſs world? O Sirs, do you know what you are doing? You are abuſing the living God, and wronging the Lord Jeſus, and trampling upon that mercy which would comfort you in your extremity, a drop of which you would then be glad of: You are grieving your poor Friends, and Teachers, and preparing for your endleſs grief. Alas, what ſhould a faithfull Miniſter do, for the ſaving of your ſouls? He ſeeth you befooled in your ſecurity, and careleſly paſſing on towards Hell, and cannot help it: He ſees you poſting to your miſery, where you will be out of the reach of all our exhortations, and where mercie will not follow you to be accepted or rejected: and though he ſee you almoſt paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59502:11"/>
he cannot help you. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, when he ſpeaks to you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever he ſhall ſpeak unto you more, and whether ever you ſhall have another call and offer; and therefore he would fain ſpeak effectually if he could; but it is not in his power. He knows, that the matter ſticks all at your own wills, and that if he could but procure your own conſent, to the moſt reaſonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary buſineſs in the world, the work were done, and you might ſcape the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting flames: And yet this is it that he cannot procure! O wonderful, that any man ſhould be damned; Yea that many men, and moſt men ſhould be damned, when they might be ſaved if they would, and will not! Yea that no ſaying will ſerve to procure their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and make them willing! That we muſt look on our poor miſerable neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in Hell, and ſay, they might have been ſaved once, but would not! they had time, and leave to turn to God, and to be holy and happy as well as others, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59502:11"/>
we could never prevaile with them to conſent, and know the day of their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation! O what ſhould we do for the ſaving if careleſs, ſenſeleſs ſouls? Muſt we let them go? Is there no remedie? Shall Miniſters ſtudy to meet with their neceſſities, and tell them with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plainneſs and compaſſion, of the evil that is a little before them, &amp; teach them how they may eſcape it? Why, this they do from day to day, and ſome will not hear them, but are tipling, or idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or making a jeaſt of the Preacher at home, and others are hearing with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and contempt, and moſt are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a ſenſeleſs deadneſs, and all ſeems to them but as an emptie ſound: and they are ſo uſed to hear of Heaven and Hell, that they make as light of them as if there were no ſuch States! Alas, that while millions are weeping and wailing in utter deſperation, for the neglecting of their day of grace, and turning away from him that called them, our poor hearers at the ſame time ſhould
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59502:12"/>
wilfully follow them, when they are told from God what others ſuffer! Alas, that you ſhould beſleepy &amp; dead under thoſe means, that ſhould waken you to prevent eternal death! and that ever you ſhould make merry ſo near damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be ſporting your ſelves with the ſame kind of ſins that others at the ſame hour are tormented for? And is ſuch madneſs as this remedileſs, in people that ſeem as wiſe as others for worldly things! Alas, for any thing that we can do, experience tells us that with the moſt it is remedileſs! Could we reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die it, our poor people ſhould not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully run from Chriſt, and lie in the flames of Hell for ever. Could our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and entreaties help it, they ſhould not for ever be ſhut out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when its offered to them as well as others. We bewail it from our hearts before the Lord, that we can entreat them no more earneſtly, and beg not of them as for our lives to look before them, and hearken to the voice of grace
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59502:12"/>
that they may be ſaved. And a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times in ſecret we call our ſelves hard-hearted, unmerciful, and unfaithful, (in too great a meaſure) that ſpeak no more importunatelie for the ſaving of mens ſouls, when we know not whether we ſhall ever ſpeak to them any more. Is this all that we can ſay or do in ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a caſe, and in a matter of ſuch weight as mens ſalvation! The Lord forgive our great inſenſibilitie, &amp; awaken us, that we may be fit to waken others; But yet for all this, with grief we muſt complain, that our people feel not when we feel, and that they are ſenſeleſs or aſleep when we ſpeak to them as ſeriouſly as we can, and that tears and moans do not prevail, but they go home and live as ſtupidlie in an unconverted ſtate, as if all were well with them, and they were not the men we ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>O that you knew what a fearful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, to be forſaken of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you would have none of him; and to be given up to your hearts luſts, to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59502:13"/>
walk in your own Counſells, becauſe you would not hearken to his voice, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 81. 11, 12, 13. and to have God ſay, Let thoſe wretches be ignorant, and careleſs, and fleſhly, and worldly, and filthy ſtill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. O that you knew (but not by experience) what a heavie plague it is to be ſo forſaken, as to have eyes that ſee not, or ſeeing do not percieve; and to have ears that hear not, or to hear and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſo to be unconverted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healed, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 12. and to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and condemned by the word, and patience, and mercies that do ſoften and ſave others, and ſhould have ſaved you! Take heed leſt Chriſt ſay, [I have ſent them my meſſenger, long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in vaine; From henceforth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fruit grow on them: Becauſe they would not be converted, they ſhall not.] Take heed leſt he take you away from means, and quickly put an end to your opportunities. You ſee how faſt men paſs away, but little do you know how
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59502:13"/>
manie are lamenting that they made no better uſe of time, and helps, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies while they had them. O hear while you may hear, for it will not be long: Read while you may read, and pray while you may pray, and turn while you may turn, and go to your Chriſtian friends &amp; teachers, and enquire of them, what you muſt do to be ſaved, before enquiring be too late. Spend the Lords Day, and what other time you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, in holy preparations for your end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Reſt, while you have ſuch a happie day to ſpend. O ſleep no longer in your ſins, while God ſtands over you, leſt before you are aware you awake in Hell. Patience and Mercie have their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, and will not alway wait and be deſpiſed. O let not your Teachers be forced to ſay, [We would have taught them publikelie and privatelie, but they would not: We would have Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the ignorant, and exhorted the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, but ſome of them would not come near us, and others of them gave
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59502:14"/>
us but the hearing, and went away ſuch as they came.] If once by forfeiting the Goſpel the Teachers whom you ſlight be taken from you, you may then ſin on and take your courſe, till time, and help, and hope are paſt.</p>
            <p>The providence that called me to this work, was ſome warning to you. Though it was not the calling away your Teacher, it was a removing of his <hi>helper,</hi> a pattern of meekneſs, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and charitie; and he is left the more diſconſolate in the proſecution of his work. God hath made him faithful to your ſouls, and careful for your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: He walks before you in humilitie and ſelf-denial, and Patience, and peaceableneſs, and in an upright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive life: He is willing to teach you publicklie and privatelie, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: He manageth the work of God with prudence &amp; modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet with Zeal, carefullie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding both ungodlineſs and ſchiſm, or the countenancing of either of them:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59502:14"/>
Were he not of eminent wiſdom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, his name would not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted in a place where Dividers, and Diſputers, Papiſts, and Quakers, and ſo manie bitter enemies of godlineſs, do watch for matter of accuſation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach againſt the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt. As you love the ſafetie and happineſs of your City, and of your ſouls, undervalue not ſuch mercies, nor think it enough to put them off with your commendations and good word: It is not that which they live, and preach, and labour for; but for the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Edification, and Salvation of your ſouls. Let them have this, or they have nothing, if you ſhould give them all you have. The enemies of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel have no wiſer Cavil againſt the painful Labourers of the Lord, then to call them Hirelings, and blame them for looking after Tithes, and great matters in the world. But as among all the faithful Miniſters of this Countrie, through the great mercie of God theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59502:15"/>
adverſaries are now almoſt aſhamed to open their mouths with an accuſation of Covetouſneſs: So this your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, faithful Teacher, hath ſtopt the mouth of all ſuch calumnie, as to him. When I invited him from a place of leſs work, and a competent maintenance, to accept of leſs then half that mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with a far greater burden of work among you, he never ſtuck at it, as thinking he might be more ſerviceable to God, and win that which is better then the riches of this world. And if now you will fruſtrate his expectations, and diſappoint his labours and hopes of your ſalvation, it will be eaſier for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in the day of judgment then for you. Alas how ſad is it to ſee a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter longing and labouring for mens ſalvation, and manie of them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting him, and others picking ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs quarrels; and the proud unrulie ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh part, rebelling and turning their backs upon their Teachers when ever they will not humour them in their own
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59502:15"/>
wayes, or when they deal but faithfullie with their ſouls! Some (even of thoſe that ſpeak againſt diſobedience, conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and ſchiſm,) turn away in diſdain, if their Children may not be needleſlie baptized in private houſes, and if that ſolemn Ordinance may not be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Parlour-Conventicle. How manie refuſe to come to the Miniſter in private to be inſtructed or Catechiſed, or to confer with him about their nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie preparation for death and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Is not this the caſe of manie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you? Muſt not your Teachers ſay, He ſent to you, and was willing to have done his part, and you refuſed? Little will ye now believe how heavie this will lie upon you one day, and how dear you ſhall pay for the cauſleſs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and diſappointment of your guides. It is not your ſurlineſs and paſſions that will then ſerve turn to anſwer God. Nor ſhall it ſave you to ſay, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were of ſo manie minds and wayes, that you knew not which of them
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59502:16"/>
to regard: For it was but one way, that God in the holy Scripture did preſcribe you: and all faithful Miniſters were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in the things which you reject, and in which you practicallie differ from them all. What? are we not all agreed, that God is to be preferred before the world? and that you muſt firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God &amp; his Righteouſneſs? &amp; that no man can be ſaved except he be converted and born again? and that he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. and that you and your houſholds ſhould ſerve the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. Are we not all agreed that the Law of the Lord muſt be your delight and that you muſt meditate in it day and night? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2, 3. and that you muſt be conſtant and fervent in Prayer? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that all that name the name of Chriſt, muſt depart from iniquitie? and that if you live after the fleſh ye ſhall die? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. You ſhall find one day,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59502:16"/>
that it was you only, &amp; ſuch as you, that practicallie differed from us in theſe points; but we differed not in theſe, or ſuch as theſe, among our ſelves. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read that a man ſhall not ſee God, becauſe he is Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Independant, no nor Anabaptiſt: or becauſe he readeth not his Prayers, or ſuch like: But I read that no man ſhall ſee God without holineſs, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12. 14.</p>
            <p>It will not ſerve your turn in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſay that you were for this ſide, or that ſide, and therefore you hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to the other ſide; as long as all thoſe ſides agree in the neceſſitie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs which you neglect. Why did you not learn of <hi>your own ſide,</hi> at leaſt to forſake your tipling, and ſwearing, and worldly-mindedneſs, and to make it the daily trade of your lives to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for life everlaſting, and make ſure work in the matter of your ſalvation? If you had learnt but this much of <hi>any ſide,</hi> you would caſt <hi>away</hi> your <hi>ſiding</hi> more,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59502:17"/>
and have loved and honoured them that fear the Lord, of what <hi>ſide</hi> ſoever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. and have contemned the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as vile perſons, though they had been of your <hi>ſide.</hi> The Catholick Church is <hi>One,</hi> and containeth all that heartilie and practicallie believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, and live a holy heavenlie life. Leave off your ſiding, &amp; keep this bleſſed ſimple Unity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; you will then be wiſer then in a paſſion to caſt your ſelves into Hell, becauſe ſome fall out in the way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Nor will it ſerve your turn at the bar of God, to talk of the miſcarriages or ſcandalls of ſome, that took on them to be godly, no more then to run out of the Ark for the ſake of <hi>Cham,</hi> on out of Chriſts familie for the ſake of <hi>Judas.</hi> What ever men are, God is Juſt, and will do you no wrong; and you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Believe in God, and to ſerve him, and not to believe in men. Nothing but wickedneſs could ſo far blind men,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59502:17"/>
as to make them think they may caſt off their love &amp; ſervice to the Lord, becauſe ſome others have diſhonoured him: Or that they may caſt away their ſouls by careleſneſs, becauſe ſome others have wounded their ſouls by particular ſins. Do you diſlike the ſins of Profeſſors of Godlineſs? So much the better: We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you not to agree with them in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Joyn with them in a Holy life, and imitate them ſo far as they obey the Lord; &amp; go as far beyond them in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſins that you are offended at, as you can, and this is it that we deſire. Supoſe they were Covetous, or Liars, or Schiſmatical: Imitate them in holy duties, and fly as far from Covetouſneſs, Lying, and Schiſm, as you will.</p>
            <p>You have had Learned and Godly Biſhops of this City: Search the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thoſe of them that have left any of their labours to poſterity, and ſee whether they ſpeak not for the ſame ſubſtantials of faith and godlineſs, which are now Preacht to you, by thoſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59502:18"/>
that you ſet ſo light by. Biſhop <hi>Lait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Parrey, Babington, &amp;c.</hi> while they were Biſhops; and <hi>Rob. Abbot, Hall,</hi> &amp;c. before they were Biſhops, all Excellent, Learned, Godly men, have here been Preachers to your Anceſtors: Read their Books, and you will find that they call men to that ſtrictneſs and holineſs of life which you cannot abide. Read your Biſhop <hi>Babington</hi> on the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſee there how zealouſly he condemneth the Prophaners of the Lords Day, and thoſe that make it a day of idleneſs or ſports. And what if one man think that one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhould have hundreds of Churches under his ſole juriſdiction, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man think that every full Pariſh-Church ſhould have a Biſhop of their own, and that one Pariſh will find him work enough, be he what he will be, (which is the difference now amongſt us) is this ſo heinous a diſagreement, as ſhould frighten you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59502:18"/>
from a holy life which <hi>all agree</hi> for?</p>
            <p>To conclude, remember this is the day of your ſalvation: Miniſters are your Helpers: Chriſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are your way: Scripture is your Rule: the Godly muſt be your company, and the Communion of Saints muſt be your deſire: If now any ſcandals, diviſions, diſpleaſures, or any ſeducements of ſecret or open adverſaries of the truth, or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, the world, or fleſh whatſoever, ſhall prevaile with you to loſe your day, to refuſe your mercies, and to neglect Chriſt and your immortal ſouls, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and undone; and your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath his will; and the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently and fearleſly you brave it out, the more is your miſery; for the harder are your hearts; and the harder is your cure; and the ſurer and ſorer will be your damnation. I have purpoſely avoided the enticing words of worldly wiſdom, and a ſtile
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59502:19"/>
that tends to claw your ears, and gain applauſe with aery wits; and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen theſe familiar words, and dealt thus plainly and freely with you, becauſe the greatneſs of the cauſe perſwaded me, I could not be too ſerious. Whether many of you will read it, &amp; what ſucceſs it ſhall have upon them, or how thoſe that read it will take it, I cannot tell: But I know that I intended it for your good; and that whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear, the Miniſters of Chriſt muſt not forbear to do their duty, nor be rebellious themſelves: but our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhall be acceptable with our Lord, and you ſhall know, that his Miniſters were among you, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. [Yet a little while is the Lightwith you: Walk while ye have the Light, leſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come upon you; for he that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth.] <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 35.

It hath deprived a ſorrowful husband of a wife, &amp; deprived us all of a faithful friend: but it hath thereby brought us to the houſe of mourning, which is better for us than the houſe of teaſting, (a Paradox to the fleſh, but an undoubted truth:) for here we may ſee the end of all men, and we that are yet living may lay it to our hearts, <hi>Eceleſ.</hi> 7. 2, 3.

               <p>Its like you'l think to tell men of the evil or enmity of Death, is as needleſſe a diſcourſe as any could be choſen: For who is there that is not naturally too ſenſible of this? and who doth not dread the name, or at leaſt the face of Death? But there is accidentally a greater evil in it, than that which nature teacheth men to fear: And while it is the King of terrours
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59502:22"/>
to the world, the moſt are ignorant of the <hi>greateſt</hi> hurt that it doth them, or can do them; or at leaſt it is but little thought on; which hath made me think it a needful work, to tell you yet of much more evil, in that which you abhor as the greateſt evil: But ſo as withall to magnifie our Redeemer, that overſhooteth death in its own bow; and cauſeth it, when it hits the mark, to miſs it: and that cauſeth health by loathſome medicines; and by the dung of our bodily corruption manureth his Church to the greater felicity.</p>
               <p>Such excellent skill of our wiſe Phyſician, we find expreſt and exerciſed in this Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where an unhappy errour againſt the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, hath happily occaſioned an excellent diſcourſe on that weighty Subject, which may ſtabliſh many a thouſand ſouls, and ſerve to ſhame and deſtroy ſuch hereſies, till the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection come, and prove it ſelf.

               </p>
               <p>The terms of the Text have no difficulty in them. The Doctrine which they expreſſe, muſt be thus unfolded. 1, I muſt ſhew you that <hi>Death is an Enemy,</hi> and what is meant by this expreſſion, and <hi>wherein its Enmity doth conſiſt.</hi> 2, I ſhall ſhew you that it is an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be deſtroyed;</hi> though <hi>laſt,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> and by what <hi>degrees</hi> it is <hi>deſtroyed.</hi> And then we ſhall make application of it to your further Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Edification.</p>
               <p>1. That you may know what is meant by an <hi>Enemy</hi> here, you muſt obſerve, that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into ſin and miſery, and Chriſt having undertaken the work of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, the Scripture oft ſpeaketh of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and recovery Metaphorically in military terms: And ſo Satan is ſaid to take us <hi>captive,</hi> and we to be his <hi>ſlaves,</hi> and Chriſt to be the <hi>Captain</hi> of our Salvation, and to <hi>redeem</hi> us from our bondage, and thus our ſin and miſery, and all that hindereth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ends of his undertaking, are called
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59502:23"/>
                  <hi>Enemies. Death</hi> therefore is called <hi>an Enemy to be deſtroyed,</hi> that is, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>al evil to <hi>be removed</hi> by the Redeemer in order to our recovery and the glory of his grace. 1. It is an Evil. 2. A puniſhment procured by our ſin, and executed by Gods Juſtice. 3. It is an Evil that hindereth our felicity. Theſe three things are included in the <hi>Enmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Death is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> is a thing that all underſtand: but all conſider not how it is an Enemy to our <hi>Souls</hi> to the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace,</hi> and conſequently to the <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of glory.</hi> I ſhall therefore, having firſt ſpoken briefly of the ſormer, inſiſt a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon the latter.</p>

                  </gap>. How great an <hi>Enemy</hi> Death is unto <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> doth eaſily appear, in that. It is the Diſſolution of the <hi>Man.</hi> It maketh a <hi>Man</hi> to become No <hi>Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> by ſeparating the Soul from the Body and diſſolving the Body into its principles.

maintain the Oyl? and Death extinguiſheth them at a blaſt. How noble a creature doth it deſtroy? To day our parts are all in order, and buſie about their ſeveral tasks; our Hearts are moving, our Lungs are breathing, our Stomacks are digeſting, our Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by aſſimilation making more: and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row death takes off the poiſe, and all ſtands ſtill; or draws the pins, and all the frame doth fall to pieces. We ſhall breath no more; nor ſpeak, nor think, nor walk no more: Our pulſe will beat no more: Our eyes ſhall ſee the light no more: Our ears ſhall hear the voice of man, delightful ſounds and melody, no more: we ſhall taſte no more our meat or drink: Our appetite is gone: Our ſtrength is gone: Our natural warmth is turned into an earthly cold: Our comelineſs and beauty is turned into a ghaſtly loathſome deformity: Our white and red doth ſoon turn into horrid blackneſs: Our tender fleſh hath loſt its feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and is become a ſenſeleſs lump, that feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whether it is carried, nor how it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: that muſt be hidden in the earth, leſt it annoy the living: that quickly turns to loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome putreſaction; and after that to common earth. Were all the once-comely bodies that now are rotting in one Church-yard, uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and here preſented to your view, the fight
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59502:24"/>
would tell you more effectually than my words do, what an Enemy Death is to our <hi>Nature.</hi> When corruption hath finiſhed its work, you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> that once was fleſh: you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>bones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>skulls;</hi> you <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>holes</hi> where once were brains, and eyes, and mouth: This change Death makes: And that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, and unavoidably. The Prince cannot reſiſt it by his Majeſty; for he hath ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the higheſt Majeſty: The ſtrong can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt it by their ſtrength: For it is the Meſſenger of the Almighty. The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſt obey it: The Conquerours muſt be conquered by it. The Rich cannot bribe it: The Learned Orator cannot perſwade it to paſs him by. The skilful Phyſician cannot ſave himſelf from the mortal ſtroke. Neither fields nor gardens, earth or ſea affordeth any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to prevent it. All have ſinned, and all muſt die: Duſt we are, and to duſt we muſt return, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. And thus ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, if the Lord of Life ſhould not revive us.</p>
               <p>2. And it is not only to the Body, but to the <hi>Soul</hi> alſo that Death is naturally an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Soul hath naturally a Love and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to its Body: and therefore it feareth a Separation before, and deſireth a Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afterward. Abſtracting Joy and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59502:25"/>
Heaven and Hell, in our conſideration, the ſtate of <hi>Separation</hi> as ſuch, is a natural evil: even to the humane Soul of Chriſt it was ſo, while his Body remained in the grave: which ſeparated ſtate is the <hi>Hades,</hi> that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> calleth <hi>Hell,</hi> that Chriſt is ſaid to have gone into. And though (the Soul of Chriſt, and) the ſouls of thoſe that die in him, do paſſe into a far more happy ſtate, than they had in fleſh, yet that is accidentally, from Rewarding Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the Bounty of the Lord, and not at all <hi>from</hi> Death as Death: the ſeparation as ſuch is ſtill an evil. And therefore the Soul is ſtill deſirous of the Bodies Reſurrection, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that its felicity will then be greater, when the re-union, and glorification hath perfected the whole man. So that Death as Death is unwelcome to the ſoul it ſelf, though Death as accidentally gainful may be deſired.</p>
               <p>3. And to the unpardoned unrenewed ſoul, Death is the paſſage to everlaſting miſery, and in this regard is far more terrible, than in all that hitherto hath been ſpoken. Oh could the guilty ſoul be ſure that there is no Juſtice to to take hold on it after death, and no more pain and ſorrow to be felt, but that man dieth as a beaſt, that hath no more to feel or loſe then Death would ſeem a tolerable evil. But its the living Death, the dying Life, the endleſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59502:25"/>
woe, to which death leads the guilty ſoul, that makes it to be unſpeakably terrible. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs, the unquenchable fire, the worm that dieth not, the everlaſting flames of the wrath of God, theſe are the chief horrour and ſting of death, to the ungodly. O were it but to be turned into Trees or Stones, or Earth, or nothing, it were nothing in compariſon of this. But I paſs by this, becauſe it is not (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly) intended in my Text.</p>
               <p>4. The Saints themſelves being ſanctified but in part, are but imperfectly aſſured of their Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as they remain in doubt, or unaſſured, Death may be a double terror to them. They believe the threatenings, and know more than unbelievers do, what an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſufferable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is to be deprived of the celeſtial glory and what an unſpeakable miſery it is, to bear the endleſs wrath of God! And therefore ſo far as they have ſuch fears, it muſt needs make death a terrour to them.</p>
               <p>5. But if there were nothing but Death it <hi>ſelf</hi> to be <hi>our Enemy, foreknowledge</hi> of it would increaſe the miſery. A Beast that <hi>knoweth not</hi> that he muſt die is not tormented with the fears of death (though nature hath poſſeſſed them with a ſelf preſerving fear, for the avoiding of an invading evil.) But man
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59502:26"/>
                  <hi>foreknoweth,</hi> that he muſt die: He hath ſtill occaſion to anticipate his terrors: that which <hi>will be,</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>ſhortly will be,</hi> is in a manner, as if <hi>it were</hi> already. And therefore <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> makes us as if we were alway dying: We ſee our Graves, our weeping Friends, our ſore-deſcribed corruption and diſmal ſtate, and ſo our life is a continual Death. And thus Death is an enemy to Nature.</p>
               <p>2. But this is not all, nor the greateſt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> that Death hath to the godly. It is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable hinderance to the work of Grace, as I ſhall ſhew you next in ten particulars.</p>

We look up to Chriſt and the Holy City, as to a precious Pearl in the bottom of the Sea; or as to a dear and faithful Friend, that is beyond ſome dreadful gulf: Fain we would enjoy him, but we dare not venture; we fear this diſmal <hi>enemy</hi> in the way.

Were it but to go to the top of a Mountain, and there ſee Chriſt with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> in a glimpſe of Glory, as he did the three Diſciples, Who would not make haſte, and ſay, <hi>It is good for us: to be here,</hi> Matth, 17. 1, 4? But to travel ſo chearfully with <hi>Abraham</hi> to the Mount of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah;</hi> to ſacrifice an only Son, or with a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr to the flames, is a harder task. This is the principal <hi>enmity</hi> of death; it deterreth our deſires and thoughts from Heaven: and maketh it a far harder matter to us, to long after God, than otherwiſe it would be: Yea it cauſeth us to flie from him, even when we truly love him: And, where Faith and Love do work ſo ſtrongly as to overcome theſe fears, yet do they meet with them as an enemy, and muſt fight before they overcome.</p>
               <p>2. And as this Enemy dulleth our Deſires, ſo doth it conſequently cool our Love, as to the exerciſe; and it hindereth our hope, and much abateth the complacency and Joy that we ſhould have in the believing thoughts of Heaven: when we ſhould be rejoycing in hope of the glory of God, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2.) the face of death appearing to our thoughts, is naturally an enemy to our joy: When we think of the grave, and of diſſolution and corruption,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59502:27"/>
and of our long abode in the places of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of our contemned duſt, and ſcattered bones, this damps our joyful thoughts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if ſupernatural grace do not make us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours.</p>
               <p>But if we might paſs from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as from one room to another, what haſte ſhould we make in our deſires? How joyfully ſhould we think and ſpeak of Heaven? Then we might live in the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, and eaſily delight our ſelves in God, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort would be our daily food.</p>
               <p>3. Moreover, as our Natural Enemy doth thus occaſion the abatement of Deſire, and Love, and Joy, ſo alſo of our Thankfulneſſe for the Glory that is promiſed us. God would have more praiſe from us, if we had more pleaſing joyful thoughts of our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. We ſhould magnifie him from day to day, when we remember how we ſhall magnifie him for ever. Our hearts would be turned into thankfulneſſe, and our tongues would be extolling our dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and ſounding forth his praiſe whom we muſt praiſe for ever, if dreadful Death did not draw a veil, to hide the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory from us.</p>
               <p>4. And thus the diſmal face of Death, doth hinder the heavenlineſſe of our Converſation.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59502:28"/>
Our <hi>Thoughts</hi> will be diverted, when our complacency and deſire is abated: Our minds be willinger to grow ſtrange to Heaven, when Death ſtill mingleth terrour in our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Whereas if we could have come to God in the way that was firſt appointed us, and could be cloathed with glory, without being ſtript of our preſent cloathing, by this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand, how familiarly ſhould we then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe above? How readily would our Thoughts run out to Chriſt? Meditation of that glory would not be then ſo hard a work: Our hearts would not be ſo backward to it, as now they are.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Faith</hi> is much hindered, and <hi>Infidelity</hi> much advantaged by Death: Look either to the ſtate of <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>body,</hi> and you will eaſily perceive the truth of this. The ſtate of a <hi>Soul</hi> incorporated, we know by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: what kind of apprehenſions, volitions, and affections belong to a ſoul while it acteth in the Body, we feel or underſtand: But what manner of <hi>Knowledge, Will,</hi> or <hi>Love;</hi> what Joy, what ſorrow, belong to ſouls that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Bodies, it is not poſſible for us now diſtinctly and formally to conceive. And when men find themſelves at a loſs about the <hi>manner,</hi> they are tempted to doubt of the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf. The ſwarms of irreligious Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59502:28"/>
that have denied the Immortality and ſeparated exiſtence of the Soul, are too full a proof of this: And good men have been haunted with this horrible temptation. Had there been no death, we had not been liable to this dangerous aſſault. The opinion of the ſleeping of the ſoul, till the Reſurrection, is but a ſtep to flat Infidelity; and both of them hence receive their life, becauſe a ſoul in fleſh, when it cannot conceive, to its ſatisfaction, of the being, ſtate, or action of a ſeparated ſoul, is the eaſier drawn to queſtion or deny it.</p>
               <p>And in regard of the Body, the difficulty and tryal is as great: That a corps reſolved into duſt, and perhaps firſt devoured by ſome other body, and turned into its ſubſtance, ſhould be re-united to its ſoul, and ſo become a glorified body, is a point not eaſie for unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified nature to believe. When <hi>Paul</hi> preached of the Reſurrection, to the learned <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſome mocked; and others turned off that diſcourſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 32. It is no eaſier to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Reſurrection of the Body, than the Immortality or ſeparated Exiſtence of the Soul. Moſt of the world, even Heathens and Infidels do confeſs the latter, but few of them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively believe the former. And if ſin had not let in Death upon our Nature, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59502:29"/>
difficulty had been prevented: Then we ſhould not have been puzled with the thoughts of either a corrupted Body, or a ſeparated Soul.</p>
               <p>6. And conſequently by all this already mentioned, our <hi>Endeavors</hi> meet with a great impediment. If <hi>Death</hi> weaken <hi>Faith,</hi> Deſire, and Hope, it muſt needs dull our <hi>Endeavors.</hi> The deterred, diſcouraged ſoul moves ſlowly in the way of life: Whereas if <hi>Death</hi> were not in our way, how chearfully ſhould we run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven? our thoughts of it would be ſtill ſweet, and theſe would be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spring to action? When the <hi>Will</hi> goes with full Sails, the commanded faculty will the more eaſily follow. We ſhould long ſo earneſtly to be in Heaven, if Death were not in the way, that nothing could eaſily ſtop us in our courſe. How earneſtly we ſhould pray? How ſeriouſly ſhould we meditate and confer of Heaven? and part with any thing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it? But that which dulls our Deſires of the End, muſt needs be an <hi>Enemy</hi> to holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and dull us in the uſe of means.</p>
               <p>7. This <hi>Enemy</hi> alſo doth dangerouſly tempt us to fall in love with preſent things, and to take up the miſerable Portion of the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: when it hath weakened faith, and cooled our deſires to the life to come, we ſhall be:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59502:29"/>
tempted to think that its beſt take ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as may here be had, and feed on that where a ſenſual mind hath leſs diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereas, if Death did not ſtand in the way, and darken Heaven to us, and turn back our deſires, how eaſily ſhould we get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe triftes, and perceive the vanity of all below, and how unworthy they are to be once regarded!</p>
               <p>8. Moreover, it is much long of! this <hi>laſt</hi> Enemy, that <hi>God is ſo diſhonoured</hi> by the <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>droopings</hi> of believers. They are but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly yet freed from this bondage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accordingly they walk. Whereas if the King of terrours were removed, we ſhould have leſs of <hi>Fear,</hi> and more of Love, as living more in the ſight and ſenſe of Love: And then we ſhould glorifie the God of Love, and appear to the world as men of another world, and ſhew them the faith and hope of Saints, in the heavenly chearfulneſs of our lives; and no more diſhonour the Lord and our Profeſſion, by our uncomfortable deſpondencies as we do.</p>
               <p>9. Moreover, it is much long of this <hi>laſt Enemy</hi> that many true Chriſtians cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their own ſincerity, but are overwholm'd with doubts and troubleſome fears, leſt they have not the faith and hope of Saints, and leſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59502:30"/>
the Love of God abide not in them, and leſt their hearts are more on Earth than Heaven. When they find themſelves afraid of dying, and to have dark amazing thoughts about eternity, and to think, with leſs trouble and fear, of earth than of the life to come; this makes them think that they are yet but worldlings, and have not placed their happineſs with God: when perhaps it is but the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>death</hi> that cauſeth theſe unjuſt concluſions. Chriſtian, I ſhall tell thee more anon, that God may be truly loved and deſired by thee, and Heaven may be much more valued than Earth, and yet the natural fears of death that ſtandeth in thy way may much perplex thee, and make thee think that thou art averſe from God, when indeed thou art but averſe from Death, becauſe yet this Enemy is not overcome.</p>
               <p>10. Laſtly, this <hi>Enemy</hi> is not the ſmalleſt cauſe of many of our particular ſins, and of the apoſtacy of many hypocrites. Indeed it is one of the ſtrongeſt of our temptations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man ſinned, none could take away his life but God, and God would not have done it for any thing but ſin. So that man had no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation from the malice of enemies, or the pride of Conquerours, or the ſury of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, or the power of Tyrants to be afraid of death, and to uſe any unlawful means to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59502:30"/>
ſcape it. An <hi>avoidable</hi> death from the hand of God, he was obliged moderately to fear; that is, to be afraid of ſinning leſt he die (elſe God would not have threatned him, if he would not have had him make uſe of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting fear.) But now we have an <hi>unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> death to fear, and alſo an untimely death from the hand of man by Gods permiſſion: And the fear of theſe is a powerful temptation. Otherwiſe <hi>Abraham</hi> would not have diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively equivocated as he did to ſave his life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 11. and <hi>Iſaac</hi> after him do the ſame, when he ſojourned in the ſame place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 7. If the fear of <hi>Death</hi> were not a ſtrong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Peter</hi> would not have thrice denyed Chriſt, and that after ſo late a warning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement: nor would all his Diſciples have forſaken him and fled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 56. Nor would Martyrs have a ſpecial reward, nor would Chriſt have been put to call upon his Diſciples, that they <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body,</hi> Luke 12. 4. and to declare to men the neceſſity of <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> in this point of Life, and that none can be his Diſciple, that loves his Life before him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 39. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. He is a Chriſtian indeed that ſo Loveth God, that he will not ſin to ſave his Life. But what is it that an hypocrite will not do to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape Death? He will equivocate and forſwear
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59502:31"/>
himſelf with the Jeſuite and Familiſt: He will forſake not only his deareſt friend, but Chriſt alſo and his Conſcience. What a multitude of the moſt hainous ſins are daily committed through the fears of death? Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands where the Inquiſition ruleth are kept in Popery by it: And thouſands are kept in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm by it: Thouſands are drawn by it to betray their Countries; to deny the truth; to betray the Church and Cauſe of Chriſt; and finally to betray their ſouls unto perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſome of them preſume to deny Chriſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, becauſe that <hi>Peter</hi> had pardon that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him through ſurprize, and through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: But they will not Repent with <hi>Peter,</hi> and die for him after their repentance. He that hath the power of an Hypocrites life, may preſcribe him what he ſhall believe and do; may write him down the Rule of his Religion, and tell him what changes he ſhall make, what oaths he ſhall take, what party he ſhall ſide with, and command him ſo many ſins a day, as you make your horſe go ſo many miles. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, no doubt, had much experience of the power of this temptation, when he boaſted ſo confidently of it againſt <hi>Job</hi> (2. 4.) <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath; he will give for his life:</hi> And its true, no doubt, of thoſe that love nothing better than their lives. Satan
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59502:31"/>
thought that the fear of Death would make a man do any thing: And of too many he may boldly make this boaſt, [<hi>Let me but have power of their Lives, and I will make them ſay any thing, and ſwear any thing, and be for any Cauſe or Party, and do any thing againſt God or man.</hi>] When leſſer matters can do ſo much, as common ſad experience ſheweth us; no wonder if the fear of death can do it.</p>
               <p>In brief, you may ſee by what is ſaid, that <hi>Death</hi> is become an Enemy to our Souls, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt the <hi>Enemy</hi> of our Natures: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our Bodies works much on our Souls, much more the Intereſt of the whole man. The principle of ſelf-love was planted in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in order to ſelf-preſervation, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world: Nature doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily abhor its own deſtruction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this deſtruction ſtanding in the way, is become an exceeding great hinderance to our affections, which takes them off from the life to come.</p>
               <p>1. It is a very great hinderance to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of thoſe that are yet carnal, impriſoned in their unbelief. It is hard to win their hearts to ſuch a ſtate of Happineſs, that cannot be obtained but by yielding unto Death.</p>
               <p>2. And to the truly godly it is naturally an impediment, &amp; a great temptation in the points
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59502:32"/>
before expreſſed: And though it prevail not againſt them, it exceedingly hindereth them. And thus I have ſhewed you, that Death is an Enemy, further than, I doubt, the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of.</p>
               <p>If the unbeliever ſhall here tell me, that Death is not the fruit of ſin, but natural to man, though he had never ſinned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I lay all this on God: I anſwer him, that Mortality, as it ſignifieth a <hi>poſſe mori,</hi> a natural capacity of dying, was natural to us in our innocency: or elſe Death could not be threatned as a penalty: And if I grant as much of a natural diſpoſition in the Body to a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, if not prevented by a Glorifying Change, it will no whit advantage their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious cauſe. But withall, man was then ſo far <hi>Immortal,</hi> as that he had a <hi>poſſe non mori,</hi> a natural capacity of not dying, and the <hi>mo ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vel non morietur,</hi> the actual event of Life or Death, was laid by the Lord of Life and Death, upon his obedience or diſobedience. And man having ſinned, Juſtice muſt be done, and ſo we came under a <hi>non poſſe non mori,</hi> an impoſſibility of eſcaping death (ordinarily) becauſe of the peremptory ſentence of our Judge: But the day of our deliverance is at hand, when we ſhall attain a <hi>non poſſe mori,</hi> a certain conſummate Immortality, when the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59502:32"/>
laſt Enemy Death ſhall be deſtroyed: and how that is done, I ſhall next enquire.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>Meritoriouſly</hi> Death is conquered by Death. The Death of ſinners, by the Mediators Death. Not that he intended in his <hi>Meritorious</hi> work, to ſave us from the ſtroke of death by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but to deliver us from it after by a Reſurrection. For <hi>ſince by man came death, by man alſo came the Reſurrection from the dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21. <hi>For aſ much as the children were</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59502:33"/>
                  <hi>partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe took part with them, that he might deſtroy him through death, that had the power of death, that is, the Devil; and deliver them, who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject unto bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14, 15. Satan as Gods Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, and as the proſperous tempter, is ſaid to have had the power of death: The fears of this dreadful Executioner, are a continual bondage, which we are liable to through all our lives, till we perceive the deliverance which the Death of the Lord of Life hath purchaſed us. 1. By Death Chriſt hath ſtis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Juſtice that was armed by ſin againſt us. 2. By <hi>Death</hi> he hath ſhewed us, that Death is a tolerable Evil, and to be yielded to in hope of following life.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Actually</hi> he conquered <hi>Death</hi> by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. This was the day of Grace's tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: This day he ſhewed to Heaven, to Hell, and to earth, that death was conquerable; yea, that his perſonal Death was actually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The bleſſed ſouls beheld it to their Joy, beholding in the Reſurrection of their Head, a virtual Reſurrection of their own Bodies. The Devils ſaw it, and therefore ſaw that they had no hopes of holding the Bodies of the Saints in the power of the grave. The damned ſouls were acquainted with it, and therefore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59502:33"/>
knew that their ſinful bodies muſt be reſtored to bear their part in ſuffering. The Believing Saints on earth perceive it, and therefore ſee that their bonds are broken, and that to the <hi>righteous there is hope in death,</hi> and that our Head being actually riſen, aſſureth us that we ſhall alſo Riſe. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus died and Roſe again; even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 14. <hi>And as Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him:</hi> So ſhall we Rſie and die no more. This was the beginning of the Churches Triumph. <hi>This is the day that the Lord hath made</hi> (even the day which the Church on Earth muſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, with joy and praiſe, till the day of our Reſurrection) <hi>We will be glad and rejoyce therein,</hi> Pſal. 118. 24. The Reſurrection of our Lord hath 1. Aſſured us of the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his ſatisfacttion. 2. Of the truth of all his Word, and ſo of his promiſes of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. 3. That Death is actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and a Reſurrection poſſible. 4. That believers ſhall certainly Riſe, when their Head and Saviour is Riſen, to prepare them an everlaſting Kingdome, and to aſſure them, that thus he will Raiſe them at the laſt. A bare promiſe would not have been ſo ſtrong a help
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59502:34"/>
to Faith, as to the actual Riſing of Chriſt, as a pledge of the performance: <hi>But now Chriſt is riſen and become the firſt fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20. <hi>For becauſe he Liveth, we ſhall live alſo,</hi> John 14. 19.</p>
               <p>3. The next degree of deſtruction to this <hi>Enemy,</hi> was by the gift of his Juſtifying and Sanctifying Grace. Four ſpecial benefits were then beſtowed on us, which are Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Enmity</hi> of Death. 1. One is, the gift of ſaving Faith, by which we look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave, as far as to eternity. And this doth moſt powerfully diſable Death to terrifie and diſcourage us; and raiſeth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Natural fears, and ſheweth us (though but in a glaſs) the exceeding eternal weight of glory which churliſh Death ſhall help us to. So that when the eye of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer looketh no further than the grave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſouls can enter into Heaven, and ſee their glorified Lord, and thence fetch Love, and Hope, and Joy, notwithſtanding the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of interpoſing death. The eye of Faith foreſeeth the <hi>ſalvation ready to be revealed in the laſt time, and cauſeth us therein greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, though now for a ſeaſon (if need be) we are in heavineſs through manifold temptations.</hi> And ſo victorious is this Faith againſt all the ſtorms that do aſſault us, <hi>that the tryal</hi>

O grave, where is thy Victory!</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55. <hi>For this cauſe we faint not, though our outward man periſh, our inward man is renewed day by day: For our light affliction (though it reach to death) which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things that are ſeen; but at the things which are not ſeen: for the hings which are ſeen are temporal</hi> (and therefore not worthy to be looked at) <hi>but the things that are not ſeen are eternal,</hi> and therefore, more prevalent with a believing Soul, than either the enticing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, or the light and ſhort afflictions, or the death that ſtandeth in our way, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond Antidote againſt the Enmity of Death, that is given us at the time of our Converſion, is, <hi>The Pardon of our ſins, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of our perſons, by the blood and merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When once we are <hi>forgiven,</hi> we are out of the reach of the <hi>greateſt</hi> terrour, being ſaved from the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> Though we muſt feel the <hi>killing</hi> ſtroke, we are delivered from the <hi>damning</hi> ſtroke. Yea more than ſo, it ſhall <hi>ſave</hi> us by <hi>deſtroying</hi> us: It ſhall let us
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59502:35"/>
into the glorious preſence of our Lord, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from the preſence of our mortal friends: It ſhall help us into <hi>Eternity,</hi> by cutting off our <hi>Time.</hi> For in the hour that we were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and made the <hi>Adopted Sons of God,</hi> we were alſo made the <hi>Heirs</hi> of Heaven, <hi>even Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt, and</hi> ſhall be <hi>glorified with him,</hi> when we have <hi>ſuffered with him,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. As Death was promoting the Life of the world, when it was killing the Lord of Life himſelf: So is it haſtnening the deliverance of <hi>believers,</hi> when it ſeems to be undoing them. No wonder if Death be that mans terrour, that muſt be conveyed by it into Hell, or that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth that he ſhall periſh as the beaſt: But to him that knows, it will be his paſſage into Reſt; and that Angels ſhall convey his Soul to Chriſt, what an Antidote is there ready for his Faith to uſe againſt the enmity and exceſs of fears? Hence faith proceedeth in its triumph, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 56, 57. <hi>The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law: But thanks be to God that giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let him inordinately fear Death, that is loth to be with Chriſt, or that is yet the heir of Death eternal: Let him fear that is yet in the bondage of his ſin, and in the power of the Prince of darkneſs, and is not by Juſtification delivered from the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59502:36"/>
curſe: But joy and holy triumph are more ſeemly for the Juſtified.</p>
               <p>3. A third Antidote againſt the Enmity of Death, is the <hi>Holineſs of the ſoul:</hi> By <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Power of ſin</hi> is <hi>mortified;</hi> and therefore the fears of Death cannot actuate and uſe it, as in others they may do: By this the Intereſt of the fleſh is caſt aſide as nothing, and the fleſh it ſelf is crucified with Chriſt: and therefore the deſtruction of the fleſh will ſeem the more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and the fears of it will be a leſs tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to the Soul. By this we are already <hi>crucified to the world, and the world to us:</hi> and therefore we can more eaſily leave the world: <hi>We now live</hi> by another Life than we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; being <hi>dead</hi> in our ſelves, <hi>our life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> and being <hi>crucified with Chriſt, we now ſo Live, as that it is not we, but Chriſt Liveth in us: the life which we Live in the fleſh is by the faith of the Son of God that hath loved us,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. The things that made this life too dear to us, are now as it were annihilated to us; and when we ſee they are <hi>Nothing,</hi> they can <hi>do nothing</hi> with us. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification alſo maketh us ſo weary of ſin, as being our hated enemy, that we are the more willing to die, that <hi>it</hi> may die that cauſeth us to die. And eſpecially, the Holy Ghoſt, which we then receive, is in us a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59502:36"/>
Divine and heavenly Nature, and ſo inclineth us to God and Heaven. This Nature princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conſiſteth in the ſuperlative Love of God. And Love carrieth out the ſoul to the beloved. As the Nature of a priſoner in a dungeon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth him to deſire Liberty and Light; ſo the Nature of a holy Soul in fleſh, inclineth it to deſire to be with Chriſt. As Love maketh husband and wife, and deareſt friends to think the time long while they are aſunder; ſo doth the Love of the Soul to God. How fain would the holy loving Soul behold the pleaſed face of God, and be glorified in the beholding of his glory, and live under the fulleſt influences of his Love! This is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over the Enmity of Death. As ſtrong as Death is, Love is ſtronger, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 6, 7. <hi>Love is ſtrong as Death—the coals thereof are coals of fire, a moſt vehement flame</hi> (which will not by the terrible face of Death be hindered from aſcending up to God.) <hi>Many waters cannot quench Love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for Love</hi> (that is, to bribe it and divert it from its object) <hi>it would utterly be contemned.</hi> If the Love of <hi>David</hi> could carry <hi>Jonathan</hi> to hazard his life, and deny a Kingdom for him, and the Love of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abſalom</hi> made him wiſh that he <hi>had died for him,</hi> and the Love of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59502:37"/>
friends, (yea luſtful love) hath carried many to caſt away their lives; no wonder if the Love of God in his Saints prevail againſt the fear of Death. The power of holy Love made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, <hi>Elſe let my name be blotted out of the Book of Life.</hi> And it made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, That <hi>he could wiſh that he were accurſed from Chriſt, for his brethren and kindred according to the fleſh.</hi>] Rom. 9. 3. And doubtleſs he felt the fire burning in his breaſt, when he broke out into that triumphant challenge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35, 36. to the end [<hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? (As it is written, For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as Sheep to the ſlaughter.) Nay in all this we are more then Conquerours through him that loved us: For I am perſwaded that neither Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>] You ſee here what it is that conquereth the enmity of death, in our ſanctification; even that powerful love of God that is then given us, which will go to him through the moſt cruel death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59502:37"/>4. A fourth Antidote that is given us by Chriſt, againſt the Enmity of Death, is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as he is the <hi>Comforter</hi> of the Saints. He makes it his work to corroborate and confirm them: As ſin hath woven calamities into our lives, and filled us with troubles, and griefs, and fears; ſo Chriſt doth ſend his ſpirit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do theſe works of Satan, and to be a <hi>Comforter</hi> as well as a <hi>Sanctifier</hi> to his members. As the <hi>Sanctifying</hi> Spirit ſtriveth againſt the <hi>entiſing ſinful</hi> fleſh, ſo the <hi>Comforting</hi> Spirit ſtriveth againſt the <hi>troubling</hi> fleſh; as alſo againſt the <hi>perſecuting,</hi> as well as the <hi>tempting</hi> world; and the <hi>vexing</hi> as well as the <hi>tempting</hi> Devil. <hi>And greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world;</hi> 1 John 4. 4. The Spirit of Chriſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the <hi>diſquieting</hi> as well as the <hi>tempting</hi> Spirit: But with ſome difference; becauſe our <hi>comforts</hi> are not in this life ſo neceſſary to us as <hi>our Holineſs:</hi> Joy, being part of our Reward, is not to be expected certainly or conſtantly, in any high degree, till we come to the ſtate of our Reward: And therefore, though the Holy Ghoſt will carry on the work of <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> univerſally, conſtantly, and certainly in the Elect; yet in many of them his <hi>Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> work is more obſcure, and interrupted: And yet he is a Conquerour here. For his works muſt be judged of in reference to their ends:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59502:38"/>
And our comfort on earth is given us for our encouragement in holy wayes, that we be not ſtopt or diverted by the fear of enemies: and alſo to help on our love to God, and to quicken us in thanks, and praiſe, and draw up our hearts to the life to come, and make us more ſerviceable to others: And ſuch a meaſure of comfort we ſhall have as conduceth to theſe ends, and is ſuitable to our preſent ſtate, and the employment God hath for us in the world, if we do not wilfully grieve our Comforter, and quench our joyes.</p>
               <p>So that when Death and the Grave appear before, and our fleſh is terrified with the ſight of theſe <hi>Anakims,</hi> and ſay, [<hi>We are not able to overcome them</hi>] and ſo brings up an evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port upon the promiſed Land, and caſts us ſometime into murmuring, lamentation and weakning-diſcouragements, yet doth the Ho-Ghoſt cauſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> (as <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>) to <hi>ſtill</hi> the ſoul, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 13.) and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to contemn theſe Gyants, and ſay [<hi>Let us go up and poſſeſs it, for we are well able to overcome it.</hi>] <hi>Ver.</hi> 30. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Spirit ſheweth us his death, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered death, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15.) even the Croſs on which he triumphed openly, when he ſeemed to be conquered, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. He ſheweth us the glorious Reſurrection of our Head, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59502:38"/>
his promiſe of our own Reſurrection: He ſheweth us our glorified Lord, to whom we may boldly and confidently commend our departing ſouls, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 59. And he ſheweth us the Angels that are ready to be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy: And he maketh all theſe Conſiderations effectual, and inwardly exciteth our Love and heavenly deſires, and giveth us a triumphing Courage and Conſolation: So that <hi>Death</hi> doth not encounter us alone, and in our own ſtrength, but finds us armed and led on by the Lord of life, who helps us by a ſling and ſtone to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer this <hi>Goliah.</hi> If a draught of Wine, or ſome ſpiritful reviving liquor can take off fears, and make men bold; what then may the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt do by his powerful encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and comforts on the ſoul? Did we but ſee Chriſt or an Angel ſtanding by our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, and ſaying [<hi>Fear not: I will convoy thy ſoul to God: this day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>] What an unſpeakable comfort would this be to a dying man? Why, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is Chriſt's Agent here on earth: and what the Spirit ſpeaks, Chriſt ſpeaks: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may take its comforting words, as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us by Chriſt himſelf; who ſpoke the like to the penitent Thief, to ſhew bellevers the virtue of his Croſs, and what they alſo may expect from him in their extremity.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59502:39"/>
And our Phyſician is moſt wiſe, and keeps his Cordials for a fainting time: The Spirit uſeth ſo ſuſtain and comfort us moſt, in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neceſſities. We need not comforts againſt death, ſo much in the time of proſperity and health, as when death draws neer. In health we have ordinarily more need of quickening than of comforting: and more need to be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from ſecurity to a due preparation for death, than to be freed from the terrible fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of it: though inordinate fears of death be hurtful to us, ſecurity and deadneſs hurts us more. And therefore the Spirit worketh accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our neceſſities: And when Death is neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and like to be moſt dreadful, he uſually giveth the livelieſt ſenſe of the joyes beyond it, to abate the enmity, and encourage the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul. And if the comfort be but ſmall, it is precious, becauſe it is moſt <hi>pure,</hi> as being then mixed with no carnal joyes; and becauſe it is moſt <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> in ſo great a ſtrait. If we have no more but <hi>meer ſupport,</hi> it will be yet a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mercy. And thus I have done with the third degree of the deſtruction of Deaths Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by theſe four Antidotes, which we receive at our Converſion, and the Conſequents thereof.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth degree of this Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is, by <hi>it ſelf,</hi> or rather by Chriſt at the time, and by the means of death, which contrary
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59502:39"/>
to its nature, ſhall advantage our felicity. When Death hath done its worſt, it hath half killed it ſelf in killing us: It hath then diſmiſſed our impriſoned ſouls, and ended even our fears of death, and our fears of all the evils of this life. It hath ended our cares, and griefs, and groans. It hath finiſhed our work, and ended all our wearineſs and trouble. And more then this, it ends our ſinning, and ſo deſtroyeth that which cauſed it, and that which the inordinate fears of it ſelf, had cauſed in us. It is the time when ſin ſhall gaſp its laſt, and ſo far our Phyſitian will perfect the cure; and our greateſt enemy ſhall follow us no further. It is the door by which the ſoul muſt paſs to Chriſt in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>If any Papiſt ſhall hence plead that therefore allmenmuſt be perfect without ſin before death or elſe go to Purgatory to be cleanſed, becauſe as we die, ſo Chriſt will find us: or if they ask, How death can perfect us? I anſwer them: It is Chriſt our Phyſitian that finiſheth the cure, and Death is the time in which he doth it. And if he undertake then do it, it concerns not us to be too inquiſitive, how he doth it. What if the patient underſtand not how blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting cureth the infected blood that is left behind? Muſt he therefore plead againſt his Phyſician? and ſay, It will not be done, becauſe he knoweth not how its done?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59502:40"/>
We feel that here we have our ſinful imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: we have for all that a promiſe that we ſhall be with Chriſt, when death hath made its ſeparation; and we are aſſured that no ſin doth enter there. And is not this enough for us to know?</p>
               <p>But yet I ſee not why the difficulty of the Objection ſhould trouble us at all. Death doth remove us from this ſinful fleſh, and admits the ſoul into the ſight of God. And in the very inſtant of its remove, it muſt needs be perfected, even by that remove, and by the firſt appearance of his bleſſed face. If you bring a candle into a dark room, the acceſs of the light expelleth the darkneſs, at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: And you cannot ſay that they conſiſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one moment of time. So, cold is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the approach of heat. And thus when death hath opened the door, and let us into the immortal light, neither before nor after, but in that inſtant all the darkneſs and ſinful imperfections of our ſouls are diſſipated. Throw an empty Bottle into the Sea, and the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ceaſeth by the filling of the water; neither before nor after but in that inſtant.</p>
               <p>If this ſhould not ſatisfie any, let it ſatisfie them, that the Holy Ghoſt in the inſtant of death can perfect his work.</p>
               <p>So that we need not aſſert a perfection on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59502:40"/>
earth, (which on their grounds, muſt be the caſe of all that will eſcape Hell and Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;) nor yet any Purgatory-torments after death, for the deliverance of the ſoul from the relicts of ſin; ſeeing at the inſtant of death, by the ſpirit, or by the depoſition of the fleſh, or by the ſight of God, or by the ſight of our glorified Redeemer, or by all, this work will be eaſily and infallibly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>5. The laſt degree and perfect conqueſt will be at the Reſurrection. And this is the victory that is mentioned in my Text. All that is fore-mentioned doth abate the enmity, and conquer death in ſome degree: But the enmity, and the enemy it ſelf is conquered at the Reſurrection, and not till then. And therefore Death is the laſt enemy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The Body lyeth under the penal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſin, till the the Reſurrection. And it is penal to the ſoul to be in a ſtate of ſeparation from the Body, though it be a ſtate of glory that its in with Chriſt: For it is deprived of the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of glory, which it ſhall attain at the Reſurrection, when the whole man ſhall be perfected and glorified together. Then it is that the Mediators work will be accompliſhed; <hi>and all things ſhall be reſtored; All that are in</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59502:41"/>
                  <hi>the graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and ſhall come forth,</hi> John 5. 28. <hi>For this is the Fathers will that ſent him, that of all that he hath given him, he ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day,</hi> John 6. 39, 40. <hi>We have hope towards God, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> Acts 25. 15. <hi>As by man came death, ſo by man came alſo the Reſurrection from the dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21. <hi>Then ſhall there be no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, nor pain,</hi> Rev. 21. 4. <hi>No more diſeaſes, or fears of death, or grave, or of corruption.</hi> No terrible enemy ſhall ſtand betwixt us and our Lord, to frighten our hearts from looking towards him. O what a birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day will that be! when Graves ſhall bring forth ſo many millions of ſons for Glory! How joyfully will the ſoul and body meet, that were ſeparated ſo long? Then ſin hath done its worſt, and can do no more! Then Chriſt hath done all, and hath no more to do, as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, but to juſtifie us in judgement, and give us poſſeſſion of the joy that he is preparing. And then he will deliver up the Kingdom to the Father.</p>
               <p>If you expect now that I ſhould give you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Death is the laſt Enemy to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though much might be ſaid from the nature of the matter, the Wiſdom and will of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59502:41"/>
God ſhall be to me inſtead of all other Reaſons, being the fountain and the ſumm of all. He knows beſt the Order that is agreeable to his Works and Ends, to his honour, and to our good: and therefore to his Wiſdom we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in the patient expectance of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his promiſes.</p>

               <p>I Now come to ſhew you the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Doctrine, the for further Information of our underſtandings, the well ordering of our hearts, and the reforming of our lives. And firſt, you may hence be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reſolved; <hi>Whether Death be truly penal to the godly?</hi> which ſome have been pleaſed to make a Controverſie of late: though I am paſt doubt, but the hearts of thoſe men do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it as a puniſhment, whoſe tongues and pens do plead for the contrary. <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt ſhalt thou return,</hi> was part of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt on <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity; which then proved it a puniſhment, and it was not remitted to <hi>Adam,</hi> that at the ſame time had the promiſe of a Redeemer, nor is it remitted to any of us all. Were it not for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59502:42"/>
ſin, God would not inflict it; who hath ſworn that he takes <hi>no pleaſure in the death of ſinners;</hi> And that <hi>he afflicts not willingly, nor grieves the ſons of men.</hi> But my text it ſelf decides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: Sin and puniſhment are the evils that Chriſt removeth: And if <hi>death</hi> were no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as it is no ſin,) how could it be an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the <hi>laſt enemy to be deſtroyed</hi> by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer? When we feel the <hi>Enmity</hi> before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed againſt our ſouls, and alſo know its Enmity to our bodies, we cannot think that God would do all this, were it not for ſin: eſpecially when we read that <hi>death paſſeth upon all, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 11, 12. and that <hi>death is the wages of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. Though Chriſt do us good by it, that proveth it not to be no puniſhment: For caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory puniſhments are purpoſely to do good to the chaſtiſed. Indeed we may ſay, <hi>O Death, Where is thy ſting?</hi> becauſe that the mortal evil to the Soul is taken out; and becauſe we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the Reſurrection by faith, when we ſhall have the victory by Chriſt. But thence to conclude that Death hath no ſting now to a believer, is not only beſides, but againſt the text; <hi>which telling us that the ſting of death is ſin,</hi> and <hi>that the ſtrength of ſin is the Law,</hi> doth inform us, that Death could not kill us, and be Death to us, if ſin gave it not a ſting to do
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59502:42"/>
it with: as ſin could not oblige us to this puniſhment, if the threatning of the Law were not its ſtrength. But Chriſt hath begun the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and will finiſh it.</p>
            </div>

               <head type="sub">Uſe 2.</head>
               <p>FROM all this Enmity in Death, we may ſee what it is that ſin hath done: and conſequently how vile and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is, and how we ſhould eſteem and uſe it. Sin hath not only forfeited our Happineſs, but laid thoſe impediments in the way of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, which will find us work, and cauſe our danger and ſorrow while we live. And Death is not the leaſt of theſe impediments. O fooliſh man, that ſtill will love ſuch a mortal Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If another would rob them but of a groat, or defame them, or deprive them of any accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, how eaſily can they hate them, and how hardly are they reconciled to them? But ſin depriveth them of their lives, and ſeparates the ſoul and body aſunder, and forfeiteth their everlaſting happineſs, and ſets death betwixt them and the Glory that is purchaſed by Chriſt, and yet they love it, and will not leave it.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59502:43"/>
Though God have made them, and do ſuſtain them, and provide for them, and all their hope and help is in him, they are not ſo eaſily drawn to love him: And yet they can love the ſin that would undo them. Though Chriſt would deliver them, and bring them to everlaſting bleſſedneſs, and hath aſſumed fleſh, and laid down his life, to teſtifie his Love to them, yet are they not eaſily brought to love him; but the ſin that made them enemies to God, and hath brought them ſo near to everlaſting miſery, this they can love, that deſerves no love. A Miniſter or other friend that would draw them from their ſin to God, and help to ſave them, they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt, as if he were their enemy: but their fooliſh companions, that can laugh and jeſt with them at the door of Hell, and clap them on the back, and drive away the care of their ſalvation and harden them againſt the fear of God, theſe are the only acceptable men to them. O Chriſtians leave this folly to the world, and do you judge of ſin by its ſad effects. You feel (if you have any feeling in you) in ſome meaſure, what it hath done againſt your Souls! The weakneſs of your faith and love; the diſtance of your hearts from God; your doubts and troubles tell you that it is not your friend; You muſt ſhortly know what it will do to your bodies. As it keeps them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59502:43"/>
in pain, and wearineſs, and weakneſs, ſo it will ere long deliver them up to the jaws of death, which will ſpare them no more then the beaſts that periſh. Had it not been for ſin, we ſhould have had no cauſe to fear a diſſolution; nor have we had any uſe for a coffin or a winding-ſheet, nor been beholden to a grave, to hide our carkaſſes from the ſight and ſmell of the living. But as <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were tranſlated when they had walked with God, even ſo ſhould we: as <hi>thoſe ſhall that are alive and remain at the coming of Chriſt, ſhall be caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and ſo ſhall they ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 17.</p>
               <p>Uſe ſin therefore as it will uſe you. Spare it not, for it will not ſpare you. It is your murderer, and the murderer of the world: Uſe it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a Murderer ſhould be uſed. Kill it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it kills you; and then, though it kill your bodies, it ſhall not be able to kill your ſouls; and though it bring you to the grave, as it did your Head, it ſhall not be able to keep you there. If the thoughts of death, and the grave, and rottenneſs be not pleaſant to you, let not the thoughts of ſin be pleaſant. Hearken to every temptation to ſin, as you would hearken to a temptation to ſelf-murder:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59502:44"/>
And as you would do if the Devil brought you a knife, and tempted you to cut your throat with it; ſo do when he offereth you the bait of ſin. You love not Death: Love not the cauſe of Death. Be aſhamed to ſtand weeping over a buried friend, and never to weep over a ſinning or ungodly friend, nor once to give them a compaſſionate earneſt exhortation, to ſave their Souls. Is it nothing to be <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes?</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1, 5. Col. 2. 13. Yea, it is a worſe Death than this, that is <hi>the wages of ſin,</hi> and <hi>the fruit which it brings forth,</hi> Rom. 6. 21, 23. and 7. 5. Surely, God would never thus uſe mens bodies, and forſake them ſoul and body for ever, if ſin were not a moſt odious thing. What a poyſon is this that kills ſo many millions, and damneth ſo many millions, and cannot be cured but by the blood of Chriſt! that killed our Phyſician that never taſted it, becauſe he came ſo near to us! O unbelieving ſtupid ſouls, that ſmart and ſin, and groan and ſin, and weep and lament our bodily ſufferings, and yet ſin ſtill! that fear a grave, and fear not ſin! that have heard, and ſeen, and felt ſo much of the ſad effects, and yet ſin ſtill! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 32. Alas that murderers ſhould be ſo common, and that we ſhould be no wiſer, when we have paid ſo dear a price for wiſdom!</p>

               <p>FROM the Enmity of Death we may further learn that <hi>Man hath now a need of Grace for ſuch exceeding difficulties which were not before him in his ſtate of innocency.</hi> Though <hi>Adam</hi> was able to have obeyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, without ſin, and had Grace ſufficient to have upheld him, and conquered temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if he had done his part, which by that Grace he might have done; yet whether that Grace was ſufficient to the works that we are called to, is a doubt that many have been much troubled with. It is certain that he was able to have done any thing that was ſuitable to his preſent ſtate, if it were commanded him: And it is certain, that much that is now our duty, would have been unſuitable to his ſtate. But whether it belonged to his perfection, to be able and fit for ſuch duties (that were then unſuitable to him) on ſuppoſition they had been <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>duties,</hi> this is the difficulty: which ſome make uſe of to prove that ſuch works cannot now be required of us, without ſuitable help, becauſe we loſt no ſuch grace in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59502:45"/>
                  <hi>Adam.</hi> But this need not trouble us: For 1, Though <hi>Adam</hi> was put on no ſuch difficulty in particular, as to encounter death; yet the perfect obedience to the whole Law, required a great degree of internal Habitual holineſs: and to determine the caſe, Whether our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular difficulties, or his ſinleſs perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, required <hi>greater</hi> ſtrength and help, is a matter of more difficulty then uſe. For 2. It is but about the <hi>Degrees</hi> of Holineſs in him and us, and not about the <hi>Kind,</hi> that the difficulty lyeth. For it is the ſame <hi>End</hi> that he was created for and diſpoſed to by Nature, and that we are redeemed for and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to ſupernaturally.</p>
               <p>But yet it is worthy our obſervation, what a difficulty ſin hath caſt before us in the way of life, which <hi>Adam</hi> was unacquainted with: that ſo we may ſee the nature of our works, and the excellency of the Redeemers grace. <hi>Adam</hi> was but to ſeek the continuance of his life, and a tranſlation to Glory, without the terrors of interpoſing death: He was never called to prepare to die; nor to think of the ſtate of a ſeparated Soul; nor to mind, and love, and ſeek a glory to which there is no (ordinary) paſſage but by <hi>death.</hi> This is the difficulty that ſin hath cauſed, againſt which we have need of the ſpecial aſſiſtance,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59502:45"/>
of the example, and doctrine, and promſe, and Spirit of the Redeemer. <hi>Adam</hi> was never put to ſtudy how to get over this dreadful gulf. The threatning of death was to raiſe ſuch a fear in him as was neceſſary to prevent it: But thoſe fears did rather hold him cloſer to the way of life, then ſtand between him and life to his diſcouragement. But we have a death to fear that <hi>muſt</hi> be ſuffered, that <hi>cannot</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. The ſtrange condition of a ſeparated ſoul (ſo unlike to its ſtate while reſident in the body) doth require in us, a <hi>ſpecial Faith</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, and a <hi>ſpecial revelation</hi> to diſcover it. To deſire, and love, and long for, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after ſuch a time as this, when one part of us muſt lie rotting in the grave, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Soul muſt be with Chriſt alone till the Reſurrection, and to believe and hope for that Reſurrection, and to deny our ſelves, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all the world, and lay down our lives when Chriſt requireth it, by the power of this faith and hope; this is a work that innocent <hi>Adam</hi> never knew: This is the high employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Chriſtian. To have our hearts and converſations in Heaven, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20) when Death muſt firſt diſſolve us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can poſſeſs it, here is the noble work of faith.</p>

               <p>MOreover, this Enmity of Death may <hi>help us to underſtand the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſufferings and Death of Chriſt.</hi> That he gave his life a Ranſome for us, and a Sacrifice for ſin, and ſo to make ſatisfaction to the offended Majeſty, is a truth that every Chriſtian doth believe. But there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon of his death, that all of us do not duly conſider of, and improve to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Sanctification as we ought. Death is ſo great an Enemy, as you have heard, and ſo powerful to deter our hearts from God, and dull our deſires to the heavenly felicity, that Chriſt was fain to go before us, to embolden the hearts of believers to follow him: He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Death (with the reſt of his afflictions) to ſhew us that it is a tolerable evil: Had he not gone before and overcome it, it would have detained us its Captives: Had he not merited and purchaſed us a bleſſed Reſurrection, and opened heaven to all believers, and by Death o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him that had the power of death (as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59502:46"/>
Gods executioner) that is, the Devil, we ſhould all our life time have been ſtill ſubjected unto bondage by the fears of Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. But when we ſee that Chriſt hath led the way, as the victorious Captain of our Salvation, and that he is <hi>made perfect by ſufferings</hi> (in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement unto glory) and that <hi>for the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of death</hi> (which <hi>by the grace of God he taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for every man</hi>) <hi>he is crowned with glory and honour,</hi> Heb. 2. 9, 10. this puts a holy valour into the ſoul, and cauſeth us chearfully to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Had <hi>we</hi> gone <hi>firſt,</hi> and the task of conquering Death been ours, we had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. But he that hath led us on, hath hew'd down the enemy before him, and firſt prepared us the way, and then called us to follow him, and to paſs the way that he hath firſt made ſafe, and alſo ſhewed us by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that it is now made paſſable. For it was one in <hi>our Nature,</hi> that calleth us his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that took not the nature of Angels, but of the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, that is one with us, as the Sanctifier and the ſanctified are, and to whom as children we are given, Who <hi>hath</hi> paſſed through Death and the Grave before us, and therefre we may the boldlier follow him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11; 12, 13, 16. <hi>Being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59502:47"/>
                  <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name,</hi> Phil. 2. 8, 9. Hereby he hath ſhewed us that Death is not ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing, but that voluntary obedience may and muſt ſubmit unto it. As <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith and obedience was tryed, in the offering up his Son to death, at Gods command: ſo the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the heirs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, muſt follow him in offering up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if God require it, and in ſubmitting to our natural death (for that he doth require of all.) Examples work more then bare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: and the Experiments of others, do take more with us than meer directions. It ſatisfieth a ſick man more to read a Book of Medicinal Obſervations, where he meets with many that were in his own caſe, and finds what cured them, then to read the <hi>Praxis</hi> or medicinal Receipts alone. It encourageth the Patient much, when the Phyſitian tells him, [I have cured many of your diſeaſe, by ſuch a Medicine; nay I was cured thus of the ſame my ſelf.] So doth it embolden a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to lay down his Life, when he hath not only a promiſe of a better life, but ſeeth that the promiſer went that way to Heaven before him. O therefore let us learn and uſe this choiſe remedy, againſt the immoderate fear of Death! Let Faith take a view of him
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59502:47"/>
that was dead and is alive, that was buried and is riſen, and was humbled and is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted? Think with your ſelves, when you muſt think of dying, that you are but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Conquering Lord, and going the way that he hath gone before you, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he underwent and conquered: And therefore though you walk through the valley of the ſhaddow of death, reſolve that you will fear no evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. And if he call you after him, follow him with a Chriſtian bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, As <hi>Peter</hi> caſt hinſelf into the Sea, and walkt on the waters, when he ſaw Chriſt walk there, and had his command; ſo let us venture on the jaws of death, while we trace his ſteps, and hear his encouraging commands and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>John</hi> 21. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 28, 29.</p>

               <p>MOreover from this Doctrine we may be informed, <hi>of the miſtakes of many Chriſtians, that think they have no ſaving grace, becauſe they are afraid of dying, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe fears deterr their ſouls from deſiring to be with Chriſt:</hi> And hence they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there is another cauſe of theſe Diſtempers, even the <hi>ENMIMY of</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59502:48"/>
                  <hi>Death</hi> that ſtandeth in the way. You think that if you had any Love to Chriſt, you ſhould more deſire to be with him; and that if your treaſure were in heaven, your hearts would be more there; and that if you truly took it for your felicity, you could not be ſo unwilling to be removed to it; for no man is unwilling to be happy, or to attain his end. But ſtay a little, and better conſider of your Caſe. Is it Chriſt that your heart is thus a verſe to, or is it only <hi>Death</hi> that ſtandeth in the way? You are not, I hope, unwilling to ſee the face of God, nor unwilling to be tranſlated from earth to heaven, but unwilling to <hi>die.</hi> It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you love the creature better then the Creator, but becauſe you are afraid of <hi>Death.</hi> You may love God, and long to be perfected in holineſs, and to ſee his Glory, and to have the moſt near Communion with him, and yet at the ſame time you may fear this Enemy that ſtandeth in your way: I mean, not only the <hi>Pain</hi> of death, but principally the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our natures, and the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, and its abode in a ſeparated ſtate, and the bodies abode in duſt and darkneſs. Grace it ſelf is not given us to reconcile us to corruption, and make <hi>death as death</hi> to ſeem deſirable, but to cauſe us patiently to <hi>bear</hi> the <hi>evil,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59502:48"/>
of the <hi>good</hi> that is beyond it. It is not our <hi>duty</hi> to love <hi>death</hi> as <hi>death.</hi> Had it not been naturally an evil to be dreaded and avoided, God would not have made it the matter of his threatning; nor would it have been a fit means to reſtrain men from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. To threaten a man with a benefit as ſuch, is a contradiction. Enquire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into your hearts, whether there be not a belief of heaven, a love to God, a deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and pleaſe him, even while you draw back and ſeem to be a verſe? and whether it be not only a lothneſs to <hi>die,</hi> and not a lothneſs to <hi>be with Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the fuller diſcovery of this (becauſe I find that our comfort much dependeth on it) I ſhall try you by theſe following Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is it that is ungrateful to you in your meditations of your change? Is it God and Heaven, or is it Death?</hi> If it be only <hi>Death,</hi> it ſeems it is not the want of Love to God, and Heaven, that cauſeth your averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: If it be <hi>God himſelf</hi> that is ungrateful to your thoughts, it is becauſe you <hi>deſire not</hi> his nearer preſence, or communion with him in the ſtate of glory? or is it only becauſe you <hi>fear</hi> leſt you have no intereſt in his Love, and ſhall not attain the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59502:49"/>
which you deſire? If it be the firſt, I muſt confeſs it proves a graceleſs ſoul, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the want of Love to God. But if it be the latter only, it may ſtand with grace: For Deſire is a true ſignification of Love, though there be doubts and fears leſt we ſhall miſs the attainment of thoſe deſires.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Would you not gladly hear the news of your removal, if you might be changed without Death; and tranſlated to heaven as</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>were, and as Chriſt at his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion?</hi> Had you not far rather be thus changed then abide on earth? If ſo, then it ſeems, it is not God and Heaven that you are againſt, but death. Nay if you could reach Heaven by travelling a thouſand miles, would you not gladly take the journey as ſoon as you had got aſſurance of your title to it, and done the work of God on earth? If it were but a <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to go with Chriſt into an exceeding high Mountain, and there to ſee him in glory, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 12.) would you not gladly do it? It ſeems that thou deſireſt to ſee the Lord, and thy love is to him, though thou be afraid of death.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. Conſider of the Nature of the Heavenly felicity, and try whether thou love it in the ſeveral parts. One part is <hi>our</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59502:49"/>
                  <hi>perſonal Perfection;</hi> that ourſouls ſhall be free from ignorance, and error, and ſin, and ſorrow, and enlarged for the perfect Love of God; and our bodies at the Reſurrection, made like the glorious body of our Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. and wouldſt thou not be thus perfected in ſoul and body? Another part is, that <hi>we ſhall live with the ſociety of Angels and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints:</hi> And wouldſt thou not have ſuch company of ſinners, and enemies, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Saints on earth? Another part is, <hi>we ſhall ſee our glorified Head, and be with him where he is, that we may behold his glory.</hi> And doth not thy heart deſire this? But the perfection of our Happineſs is, that we ſhall ſee <hi>the face of the glory of God,</hi> which is the light of that world, as truly as the Sun is the light of this: and that we ſhall be filled up with the feeling of his Love and abound with Love to him again, and perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in this Communion of Love, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in the Praiſes of the LORD, and thus make up the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where GOD will place his glorious preſence, and in which he will for evermore take pleaſure. And is there any thing in this that thy ſoul is againſt, and which doſt not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue above this WORLD? If thou
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59502:50"/>
find that all the parts are ſweet, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Heaven is moſt grateful to thee, and that this is the ſtate that thou wouldſt be in, it ſeems then it is not <hi>Heaven</hi> but <hi>Death</hi> that thou art averſe from, and that maketh thee ſo loth to hear the tydings of thy change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Couldſt thou not joyfully ſee the coming of Chriſt, if it were this day (if thou have done thy work, and art aſſured of his love?) The Apoſtle hath told us by the word of the Lord, that <hi>the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God: and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: and then they which are alive and remain ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord,</hi>] 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 15, 16, 17. And this is the doctrine that comforteth believers, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. Would it not rejoyce your hearts, if you were ſure to live, to ſee <hi>the coming of the Lord,</hi> and to ſee his <hi>glorious appearing</hi> and retinue? If you were not to die, but to be caught up thus to meet the Lord, and to be changed immediately into an immortal, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible glorious ſtate, would you be averſe to this? would it not be the greateſt joy that you could deſire? For my own part, I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59502:50"/>
muſt confeſs to you, that death as death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to me as an enemy, and my nature doth abhor and fear it: But the thoughts of the Coming of the Lord are moſt ſweet and joyful to me, ſo that if I were but ſure that I ſhould live to ſee it; and that the Trumpet ſhould ſound, and the dead ſhould riſe, and the Lord appear before the period of my age, it would be the joyfulleſt tydings to me in the world. O that I might ſee his Kingdome come! It is the Character of his Saints to <hi>love his appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8, and to <hi>look for the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Tit. 2. 13. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come: Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly</hi>] is the voice of faith, and hope, and love, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 17, 20. But I find not that his ſervants are thus Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized, by their deſires to die. It is therefore the preſence of their Lord that they deſire: But it is <hi>Death</hi> that they abhor: And therefore (though they can <hi>ſubmit</hi> to death) it is the <hi>coming of Chriſt</hi> that they <hi>Love</hi> and long for; and it is interpoſing Death that cauſeth them to draw back. Let not Chriſtians be diſcouraged by miſtakes, and think that they love not God and glory, becauſe they love not this enemy in the way: nor think that they are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59502:51"/>
think that they are graceleſs or unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worldlings, becauſe they are afraid of death as death.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, that <hi>if grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not againſt the fears of death, then fear is predominant, and we are not ſincere.</hi> To which I anſwer, that you muſt diſtinguiſh between ſuch a prevailing as maintaineth our ſincerity, and ſuch a prevailing as alſo procureth our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and joy. If grace prevail not to <hi>keep us upright</hi> in a holy life, renouncing the world, and crucifying the fleſh, and devoting our ſelves entirely to God, though the fear of death would draw us from it, then it is a ſign that we are not ſincere. But if grace do this much, and yet prevail not againſt all <hi>fears and unwillingneſs to die,</hi> but leave us under uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hideous thoughts of death, this proves us not to be unſound. For the ſoul may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly love God, that is afraid of death: And he may truly love the <hi>End,</hi> that fears this dark and diſmal way. Yet muſt there be ſo much to prove our uprightneſs, as that in our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate choice, we will rather voluntarily paſs through death (either natural or violent) then loſe the happineſs beyond it: Though we love not death, yet we love God and Heaven ſo well, that we will <hi>ſubmit to it:</hi> And though we <hi>fear</hi> it and <hi>abhor</hi> it, yet not ſo much as we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59502:51"/>
fear and abhor the loſs of Heaven. Let not poor Chriſtians therefore wrong themſelves, and deny the graces of the Spirit, as if they had more mind of earth then heaven, and of things temporal then of things eternal, becauſe they are afraid to die. All ſuffering is grievous, and not joyous to our nature. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to be <hi>uncloathed,</hi> but <hi>clothed upon</hi> with our houſe which is from Heaven, that <hi>mortality might be ſwallowed up of life,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 2, 4. it being better to be <hi>abſent from the body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord.</hi> Even Chriſt himſelf had a <hi>will</hi> that deſired that the <hi>Cup might have paſſed from will,</hi> if it had been agreeable to his <hi>Fathers will,</hi> and the ends of his undertaken Office, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41, 42. Raiſe therefore no unjuſt concluſions from theſe natural fears, nor from the imperfection of our conqueſt: but praiſe him that relieveth us, and abateth the enmity of death, and furniſheth us with his Antidotes and will deſtroy this enemy at laſt.</p>

Though death be the enemy that ſeemeth to conquer us, and to deſtroy and utterly undo us, yet being conquered it ſelf by Chriſt, it is uſed by him to our great advantage, and ſanctified to be a very great help to our ſalvation. The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt himſelf was in the hour of his enemies, and the power of darkneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 53. which ſeemed to have prevailed againſt him; when yet it was but a deſtroying of Death by Death, and the purchaſing of life and ſalvation for the world. So alſo in our Death, though ſin and Satan ſeem to conquer, it is they that are conquered, and not we, who are ſupervictors through him that hath loved us, <hi>Romans</hi> 8. 37. They deſtroy themſelves when they ſeem
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59502:53"/>
to have deſtroyed us. As the Serpent brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but the heel of Chriſt, who bruiſed his head; ſo doth he bruiſe but our heel, who in that conflict, and by the means of his own execution through the ſtrength of Chriſt, do bruiſe his head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And this is the upſhot of all his enmity, againſt the womans holy ſeed. Though Death was unſuitable to innocent man, and is ſtill a natural enemy to us all; yet unto ſinners it is an evil that is ſuitable and fit to deſtroy the greater evil that did cauſe it, and to prevent the everlaſting evil. The fore-knowledee of our certain Death, is a very great help to keep us humble; and diſgrace all the ſeducing pleaſures of the fleſh, and all the profits and honours of the world, and ſo to enervate all temptations. It is a ſingular help to quicken a ſtupid care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſiuner, and to awaken men to prepare for the life to come, and to excite them to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and to give all diligence to make their calling and election ſure; and to conſider, ſeeing all theſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons they ought to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for, and haſtening to the coming of the day of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 11, 12. When we drop aſleep, the remembrance of Death may quickly awake us; when we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59502:54"/>
grow ſlack, it is our ſpur to put us on, to mend our pace. Who is ſo mad, as wilfully to ſin with Death in his eye? or who ſo dead, as with Death in his eye, to refuſe to live a godly life, if he have any ſpiritual light and feeling? Experience telleth us, that when health and folly cauſe us to promiſe our ſelves long life, and think that Death is a great way off, it lamentably cools our zeal, and ſtrengtheneth our temptations, and dulls our ſouls to holy operations: and the approach of Death puts life into all our apprehenſions and affections. It is a wonderful hard thing to maintain our lively apprehenſions, and ſtrong affections, and tenderneſs of conſcience, and ſelf-denyal, and eaſie contempt of earthly things, when we put far from us the day of Death. We ſee what a ſtir men make for the profits and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this world, and how faſt they hold their fleſhly pleaſures, while they are in health, and how contemptuouſly they ſpeak of all, and bitterly complain of the vanity and vexation, when they come to dye. And if our lives and the world be brought hereby into ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when men live ſo <hi>ſhore</hi> a time on Earth, what monſters of ambition, and covetouſneſſe, and luxury would men be, if they lived as long as before the FLOOD, even to Eight Hundred,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59502:54"/>
or nine hundred years of age? Doubtleſs long life was ſo great a temptation then to man, (in his corrupted ſtate) that it is no wonder if his wickedneſs was great upon the earth; and if it prepared for that great deſtruction of the univerſal deluge. Should men live now but to the age of three hundred, or four hundred years: I fear it would ſo tempt them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the world, and ſo embolden them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay repentance, that one would be as a Wolf to another, and the weak, but be a prey to the ſtrong, and wickedneſs would overwhelm the world, deſpiſing the reins, and bearing down Religious and Civil oppoſition. But when we ſtand over the grave, and ſee our friends laid in the duſt; how mortified do we ſeem? how do we even ſhake the head at the folly of ambitious and covetous worldlings, and are aſhamed to think of fleſhly luſts! So far are men from owning their vanities, when that ſilent teacher ſtandeth by. It is Death that helps to humble. the proud, and abate the arrogancy and obſtinacy of the wicked, and make them regard the meſſengers of Chriſt, that before deſpiſed them and their meſſage. It is Death that allayeth the ebullition of deſtracting thoughts and paſſions, and helpeth to bring men to themſelves, and fixeth giddy diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed minds, and helps to ſettle the light and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59502:55"/>
the unſettled; and to reſtrain the worſt. As we are beholden to the Gallows for our purſes and our lives; ſo are we to the grave and hell, for much of the order that is in the world, and our peace and freedom procured thereby. But it is a greater good that it procureth to believers.</p>
               <p>If you ask, How is all this to be aſcribed to Chriſt? I anſwer, many wayes: 1. It is he that hath now the Keys or power of Death and Hell, even he that liveth and was dead, and that liveth for evermore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. and therefore is to be feared by the world. 2. It is he that hath by his Blood and Covenant brought us the Hope of Everlaſting life; which is it that gives the efficacy to Death. Without this, men would be but <hi>deſperate,</hi> and think that it is better have a little pleaſure, than none at all; and ſo would give up themſelves to ſin, and deſperately gratifie their fleſh by all the wickedneſs they could deviſe. 3. And it ls Chriſt that teacheth men the right <hi>uſe</hi> of Death, by his holy Doctrine; having brought life and immortality to light by his Goſpel. 4. And it is Chriſt that ſendeth forth the holy Spirit, which only doth ſo illuminate the mind, and quicken and diſpoſe the heart, that Death may be ſavingly improved. The poyſon is our own, but it is his skill and love that hath made a Soveraign Antidote of it.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59502:55"/>
And let our bodies dye, ſo our ſin may dye. If the foreſight of Death deſtroy our ſin, and further our ſanctification, and the hour of Death doth end our fears, and enter us into the ſtate of glory, though we will love Death as Death never the better for this, much leſs the ſin that cauſed it; yet muſt we admire the love of our Redeemer.</p>
               <p>And it is not only the <hi>Peril</hi> but alſo the <hi>Terrous</hi> of Death that we are in part delivered from. Though Chriſt himſelf was in a bloody ſweat, in his Agony before his death, and cryed out on the Croſs, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me; becauſe he bore the ſins of the world: yet Death is welcome to many of his followers, that drink of his cup, and are baptized with his Baptiſm: For they taſte not of theſe dreggs which he drunk up, and they are ſtrengthned by his ſupporting grace. He that doth comfort them againſt ſin and Hell, doth alſo comfort them againſt Death. So great is the glory that he hath promiſed them, and ſo great is his comforting, confirming grace, that dreadful Death is not great enough to prevail againſt them. As it was too weak to conquer Chriſt; ſo is it too weak to conquer his Spirit in his peoples ſouls. Without Chriſt we could not live, and we durſt not die: but through him we can do and ſuffer all things,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59502:56"/>
and can boldly paſs through this dark and ſhady vail of death; yea, we can <hi>deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and to be with Chriſt as beſt for us: for to Live is Chriſt, and to die is gain,</hi> Phil. 1. 21, 23. <hi>For we know that if our earthly houſe of this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. And therefore ſometimes we can earneſtly groan, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven. And we are alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, knowing that whileſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord: we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the body and preſent with the Lord: and therefore labour, that whether preſent, or abſent, we may be accepted of him: For we walk by faith, and not by ſight: and it is God that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing, who alſo hath given us the earneſt of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1, to 10. Though we long not to <hi>dye,</hi> yet we long to <hi>ſee the face of God.</hi> And though we lay down our bodies with <hi>natural unwillingneſs,</hi> yet we lay down our ſin and ſorrows with gladneſs and ſpiritual delight. And though our hearts are ready to faint, as <hi>Peter's,</hi> when he walked to Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters, yet Chriſt puts forth his hand of love, and ſoon recovereth us from our fear and danger.</p>
               <p>Melancholy and Impatience may make men
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59502:56"/>
                  <hi>weary</hi> of their lives, and ruſh upon Death with a falſe conceit that it will end their ſorrows: But this is not to conquer Death, but to be conquered by a leſſer evil: and it is not an effect of fortitude, but of an imbecillity and impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of mind. And if a <hi>Brutus,</hi> a <hi>Cato,</hi> or a <hi>Seneca,</hi> be his own Executioner, they do but chuſe a leſſer evil, (in their conceits) even a Death which they accounted honourable, before a more ignominious Death, or a Life of ſhame, and ſcorn, and miſery. But the true believer is raiſed above the fears of Death, by the love of God, and the hopes of Glory; and Death (though ungrateful in it ſelf) is welcome to him, as the way to his felicity.</p>
               <p>Let Tyrants and Souldiers take it for their glory, that they can <hi>take away</hi> mens lives, (that is they have the power of a Serpent, or of Rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane) as if it were their honour to be their Countries peſtilence; and a <hi>Ruler</hi> and a <hi>Doſe of Poyſon,</hi> were things of equal ſtrength and uſe: But it is the Glory of Chriſt to enable his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to <hi>conquer Death,</hi> and bear the fury of the moſt cruel perſecutors. The Martyrs have been more joyful in their ſufferings, than the Judges that condemned them in their Pomp and Glory.

               <p>MOreover from the <hi>Enmity of Death, we may be directed which way to bend our cares:</hi> and ſeeing where our difficulty moſt lyeth, we may ſee <hi>which way our moſt diligent preparations muſt be turned. Death</hi> cannot be prevented, but the <hi>malignant influence</hi> of it on our <hi>ſouls</hi> may be much <hi>abated.</hi> If you let it work without an <hi>Antidote,</hi> it will make you live like unbelieving worldlings: It will deterr your hearts from Heaven, and dull your love to God himſelf, and make your meditations of him, and of your Everlaſting Reſt, to be ſeldom, and ungrateful to you; And it will make you ſay, <hi>Its good to be here;</hi> and have ſweeter thoughts of this preſent life, than of your inheritance: It will rob you of much of your heavenly delights, and fill you with ſlaviſh fears of Death, and ſubject you unto bondage all your lives, and make you dye with agony and horrour, ſo that your lives and deaths will be diſhonourable to your holy faith, and to your Lord.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59502:58"/>
If it were meerly our own ſuffering by fears and horrours, or meerly our loſs of ſpiritual delights, the matter were (great, but) not ſo great: But it is more than this. For when our joyes are overwhelmed with the fears of Death, and turned into ſorrows; our love to God will be abated, and we ſhall deny him the thanks and cheerful praiſes, which ſhould be much of the employment of our lives: and we ſhall be much diſcompoſed and unfitted for his ſervice, and ſhall much diſhonour him in the world: and ſhall ſtrengthen our temptations to the overvaluing of earthly things. Think it not therefore a ſmall, or an indifferent matter, to fortifie your ſouls againſt theſe malignant fears of death. Make this your daily care and work; your <hi>peace,</hi> your <hi>ſafety,</hi> your <hi>innocency,</hi> and <hi>uſefulneſs,</hi> and the <hi>honour of God,</hi> do much lie on it. And it is a work of ſuch exceeding difficulty, that it requireth the beſt of your skill and diligence; and when all is done, it muſt be the illuminating quickning beams of grace, and the ſhining face of the Eternal Love, that muſt dothe work; though yet your diligence is neceſſary, to attend the ſpirit, and uſe the means in ſubſervience to grace, and in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe oeleſtiall rayes.</p>
               <p>And above all, take heed leſt you ſhould think, that carnall mirth, or meer ſecurity,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59502:58"/>
and caſting away the thoughts of Death will ſerve to overcome theſe fears; or that it is enough that you reſolve againſt them. For it is your <hi>ſafety</hi> that muſt be lookt to, as well as your preſent eaſe and peace: and <hi>fear</hi> muſt be ſo overcome, as that a greater miſery may not follow: Preſumption and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity will be of very ſhort continuance. To dye without <hi>fear,</hi> and paſs into into endleſs <hi>deſperation,</hi> which fear ſhould have wakened you to prevent, is no deſirable kind of dying. And beſides reſolving againſt the terrours of Death, will not prevent them. When Death draws near, it will amaze you; in deſpight of all your reſolutions, if you are not furniſhed with a better Antidote. The more jocund you have been in carnal mirth, and the more you have preſumptuouſly ſlighted Death, it is likely your horrour will be the greater when it comes. And therefore ſee that you make a wiſe and ſafe preparation; and that you <hi>groundedly</hi> and <hi>methodically cure</hi> theſe fears, and not ſecurely caſt them away. Though I have given you, to this end, ſome Directions in other writings (in the <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> and in the Treatiſe of <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> and that of <hi>Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world,</hi>) yet I ſhall add here theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing helps, which faithfully obſerved and practiſed, will much promote your victory

               <p>TO Conquer the Enmity of Death, you muſt <hi>live by faith in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as men that are emptied of themſelves, and ranſomed from his hands that had the power of Death; and as men that are redeemed from the curſe, and are now made heirs of the grace of life, being made his members, who is the Lord of Life, even the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit. The ſerious believing ſtudy of his <hi>deſign</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> (to deſtroy ſin and death, and to bring many Sons to glory) and alſo of his voluntary ſuffering, and his obedience to the death of the Croſs, may raiſe us above the fears of Death. When we live by faith as branches of this bleſſed Vine, and are righteous with his righteouſneſs, juſtified by his blood and merits, and ſanctified by his Word and Spirit, and find that we are united to him, we may then be ſure that Death cannot conquer us, and nothing can take us out of his hands: For our life being hid with Chriſt in God, we know that we ſhall live, becauſe he liveth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. and that when Chriſt

And that <hi>he will change our vile bodies, and make them like to his glorious body, by his mighty power, by which he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3. 20, 21.

But being gathered under the wings of Chriſt, as the chickens under the wings of the Hen, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37.) and being <hi>found then in him, having the righteouſneſs which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith,</hi> we may boldly anſwer to all that can be charged on us to our terrour. If we <hi>know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, and are made conformable to his death,</hi> (Phil. 3. 9, 10.) if we are <hi>dead with him to the world, and riſen with him</hi> to a holy life; if we have believingly traced him in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and conqueſt, and perceive by faith how we participate in his victories, we ſhall then be able to grapple with the hands of Death; and though we know the grave muſt be for a

This maketh the Martyrs chearfully lay down their lives for Chriſt; and love is glad of ſo precious an opportunity for its exerciſe and manifeſtation. <hi>Love</hi> is a reſtleſs working thing, that will give you no reſt, till your deſires are attained, and you be with God. Nothing is ſo valiant as Love! It rejoyceth when it meeteth with difficulties, which it may encounter for the ſake of our beloved! It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth dangers: It glorieth in ſufferings: Though it be humble, and layeth by all thoughts of merit, yet it rejoyceth in ſufferings; for Chriſt, and glorieth in the Croſs, and in the participation of his ſufferings, and in the honourable wounds and fears which we receive for him that died for us.</p>

               <p>TO overcome the terrours and enmity of Death, it is neceſſary <hi>that we keep the Conſcience clear from the guilt of wilful ſin, and of impenitency.</hi> If it may be, ſee that you <hi>wound</hi> it not; if you have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wounded it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeek a cure: and live not in a wounded ſtate. The face of Death will waken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and cauſe it to ſpeak much lowder than it did in health and in proſperity: And then ſin will ſeem another thing, and wrath more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than it did in your ſecurity. Conſcience will do much to make your burden <hi>light</hi> or <hi>heavy.</hi> If Conſcience groundedly ſpeak peace, and all be ſound and well at home, Death will be leſs terrible, the heart being fortified againſt its enmity. But to have a pained body, and a pained ſoul; a dying body, and a ſcorched Conſcience that is afraid of everlaſting Death; this is a terrible caſe indeed. Speedily therefore get rid of ſin, and get your Conſciences through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleanſed, by ſound repentance and the blood of Chriſt. For ſo much ſin as you bring to your death-bed, ſo much bitterneſs will there be in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59502:63"/>
Death. Away then with that ſin that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells you of, and touch the forbidden fruit no more, and kindle not the ſparks of Hell in your ſouls, to make the ſting of Death more venemous. As it will quiet a believing ſoul through Chriſt, when he can ſay with <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> Iſa. 38. 3. <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight</hi>] and it will be <hi>our rejoycing if we have the teſtimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. So will it be moſt <hi>terrible</hi> to dye in the fears of unpardoned ſin, and to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſcourging us with the remembrance of our folly, when God is afflicting us, and we have need of a well-compoſed mind, to bear the troubles of our fleſh. A little from without is grievous, when any thing is amiſs within: Get home therefore to Chriſt without delay: and ceaſe not till you have peace in him, that Death may find your Conſciences whole.</p>

                  <hi>REdeeming time,</hi> is another means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the hurtful fears of Death. When we foreknow that it will ſhortly <hi>end</hi> our <hi>time,</hi> let us make the beſt of <hi>time</hi> while we have it. And then when we find that our work is <hi>done,</hi> and that we did not loyter nor loſe the time that God vouchſafed us, the end of it will be leſs grievous to us. A man that ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his duty, and ſpareth for no coſt or pains, and is as loath to loſe an hours, time as a covetous man is to loſe an hundred pound, will look back on his life, and look before him to his Death, with greater peace, and leſs perplexity, than another man. But the thoughts of Death muſt needs be terrible, to a man that hath trifled away his life, and been an unthrift of his time. To think when you muſt dye, that now you are at your laſt day or hour; and withall, to think how many hours you vainly loſt, and that you knew not the worth of time, till it was gone, will make Death more bitter than now you can imagine. What elſe is Deaah but

When we are looſe from all things under the Sun, and there is nothing that entangleth our affections on earth, a great part of the difficulty is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. But Death will tear the heart that is glued to any thing in this world. Poſſeſs therefore as if you poſſeſſed not, and rejoyce as if you rejoyced not, and uſe the world as not abuſingit: for the faſhion of this world doth paſs away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30, 31. It is much for the ſake of our fleſh that muſt periſh, that Death doth ſeem ſo bitter to us: If therefore we can throughly ſubdue the fleſh, and live above its pleaſure and deſires, we ſhall the

Shut up your ſenſes then a little more, and let your hearts grow ſtranger to this world; and if you have known any perſons, relations, accomodations after the fleſh, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know them ſo no more. How ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible is Death to an earthly-minded man, that had neglected his ſoul for a treaſure here, which muſt then be diſſipated in a moment? How eaſie is Death to a heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind, that is throughly weaned from this world, and taketh it but for his pilgrimage or paſſage unto life, and it hath made it the buſineſs of his dayes, to lay up for himſelf a treaſure in Heaven: He that hath unfeignedly made Heaven his end in the courſe of his life, will moſt readily paſs to it on the hardeſt terms: For every man is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to attain his end.</p>

               <p>IT will much help us againſt the enmity of Death, <hi>to be duly conformed to the Image of God, in the hatred of ſin, and love of holineſs; and in ſpecial in the point of Juſtice.</hi> When we hate ſin throughly, and find it ſo incorporated into our fleſh, that they muſt live and dye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it will make Death the more eaſie to us, becauſe it will be the dath of ſin; even of that ſin which we moſt hate, and that God hateth, and that hath coſt us ſo dear as it hath done. When we are in love with holineſs, and know that we ſhall never be perfect in it, till after Death; it will make Death the more welcome, as the paſſage to our deſired life. When the Juſtice, even the caſtigatory and vindictive Juſtice of God, is more amiable in our eyes, and we are not blinded by ſelf-love, to judge of God and of his wayes, according to the intereſt of our fleſh; we ſhall then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his diſſolving ſtroke, and that ſee the bitterneſs of Death proceedeth from that which is good in God, though from that which is evil in our ſelves. Doubtleſs, as Juſtice
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59502:66"/>
is one of the bleſſed Attributes of God, ſo ſhould it be amiable to man, there being nothing in God but what is lovely. It is the prevalency of <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> that makes men ſo inſenſible of the excellency of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, while they ſpeak ſo reſpectfully of his mercy. So far as men are carnal and ſelfiſh they cannot love that by which they ſmart, or of which they are in danger. But the ſoul that is got above it ſelf, and is united unto God in Chriſt, and hath that Image of God, which containeth the impreſs and effect of all his Attributes, hath ſuch an habit of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice</hi> in himſelf, and ſuch a hatred of ſin, and ſuch a deſire that the honour of God ſhould be vindicated and maintained, and ſuch an <hi>approbation</hi> of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, that he can the more eaſily conſent or ſubmit to the diſſolving ſtroke of Death: He hateth his own ſin, and loatheth himſelf for all his abominations, and is poſſeſſed with that <hi>Juſtice</hi> that provoketh him to <hi>ſelf revenge</hi> in an ordinate ſort, and therefore doth love and honour that <hi>Juſtice</hi> that inflicteth on him the penalty of Death; (Eſpecially ſince Mercy hath made it a uſeful Caſtigation.)

it that ſuch wonders and glorious appearances of God, as are contained in the incarnation, life and death of Chriſt; and in all the parts of the work of our Redemption, ſhould no more affect us than they do, nor take up our ſouls in more thankful admiration, nor raviſh us into higher joyes! Alas, that Heaven commands our ſouls no more from Earth! that ſuch an infinite glory is ſo near us, and we enjoy ſo little of it, and have no more ſavour of it upon our ſouls! That in the hands of God, and before his face, we do no more regard him!

O what a bleſſed day and duty would it be,

in which we could leave our ſin behind us; and converſe with God in ſpotleſs innocency, and worſhip and adore him without that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtrangeneſs, and unbelief, and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and doubtings, and diſtractions, that are now our daily miſeries?

Is there a gracious ſoul, that groaneth not under the burden of theſe miſeries? yea, in every prayer, what do we elſe but confeſs them, and lament them, and groan for help, and for deliverance? And yet ſhall we fear our day of freedom, and be loth that Death ſhould bring us news, that our prayers are heard, and our groans have reached up to heaven, and that the bonds of fleſh and ſin ſhall be diſſolved, and we ſhall have need to watch, and ſtrive, and fear, and complain, and ſigh, and weep no more? Shall the face of death diſcourage us from deſiring ſuch a bleſſed day? When we have ſo full aſſurance, that at laſt this enemy alſo ſhall be deſtroyed? The Lord heal and pardon the Hypocriſie of our complaints, together with the unbelief and cowardlineſs of our Souls! Do we ſpeak ſo much, and hear ſo much, and

ſeem to do ſo much againſt ſin, and yet had we rather keep it ſtill, then be ſtript of it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the rags of our mortality? and yet had we rather dwell with ſin, in tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, troubling, corruptible fleſh, then lay them by, and dwell with Chriſt? O Lord, how lamentably have we loſt our wiſdom, and drowned our minds in fleſh and folly, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking thee our light and life! How come our reaſonable ſouls to be ſo bewitched, as after all our convictions, complaints, and prayers, to be ſtill more willing of our ſickneſs then of the remedy, and more afraid of this bitter Cup, then of the poyſon that lodgeth in our bowels, which it would expel! and that after all the labour we have uſed, we had yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwell with our <hi>greateſt</hi> enemy, then by a <hi>leſs</hi> to be tranſmitted to our deareſt friend! and had rather continue in a troubleſome, weary, reſtleſs life, then by the ſleep of death to paſs to Reſt.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>ſin</hi> in <hi>others</hi> alſo is our trouble, though not <hi>ſo much</hi> as in <hi>our ſelves.</hi> It maketh thoſe our bitter enemies, whoſe good we moſt deſire and endeavour, and cauſeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful world to requite us with malicious uſage, For telling them the ungrateful truth, and ſeeking their ſalvation. It makes our friends to be but half-friends; and ſome of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59502:71"/>
them too, like our enemies. It puts a ſting into the ſweeteſt friendſhip, and mixeth ſmart with all our pleaſures; It worketh us grief from precious mercies; and abateth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our near Relations; So that our ſmart by the pricks, is often greater then our pleaſure in the ſweetneſs of the Roſe. No friend is ſo ſmoothed, and ſquared to the temper and intereſt of another, but that ſome inequality and unevenneſs doth remain, which makes the cloſure to be leſs near and ſtedfaſt. Even Family-relations are uſually ſo imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jointed and cemented, that when the when the winds of tryal are any thing high they ſhake the frame; and though they are but low, they find an entrance, and cauſe ſuch a coldneſs of affections, as is contrary to the nature and duty of the Relations. Either a contrariety of opinions, or of natural temperature and humours, or elſe of the diſpoſitions of the mind; Sometime croſs intereſts, and ſometime paſſions and croſs words, do cauſe ſuch diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and ſowrneſs, ſuch frowns, or jealouſies, or diſtances, that our neareſt friends are but as ſackloth on our skins, and as a ſhoo too ſtrait for us, or as a garment that is unmeet, which pinch and trouble us in their uſe: and thoſe that ſhould be to us as the Apple of our eyes, are as the duſt or ſmoak to them, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59502:71"/>
vex or blind them. And the more we Love them, the more it grieveth us to be croſſed in our love. There is ſcarce any friend ſo wiſe, ſo good, ſo ſuitable to us, or ſo near, that we can alwayes pleaſe. And the diſpleaſure of a friend is as gravell in our ſhoos, or as Nettles in our bed, oft-times more grievous then the malice of an enemy. There is no ſuch doing as this in heaven: becauſe there is no ſuch gueſt as ſin. We ſhall love each other far more then we do here; and yet that Love ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be inordinate, nor in the leaſt divert our love from God, but every Saint and Angel in the Society, ſhall be loved with moſt chaſte and pure affections, in a perfect ſubordination to the love of God, and ſo as that God himſelf in them, ſhall be the chiefeſt object of that love. It is there that our friends being freed from all their imperfections, do neither tempt us to a carnal Love, nor have any thing in them to diſcourage the love that is ſpiritual and pure. We have here our paſſionate friends, our ſelf-conceited friends, our unkind, unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſelfiſh friends; our mutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful friends; our contentions friends that are like to enemies: and <hi>who</hi> have uſed us more hardly then our friends; But when we come to God, we ſhall have friends that are like God, that are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59502:72"/>
good, and are participatively turned into Love; and having left behind them all that was unclean and noyſome, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to themſelves, they have alſo caſt off all that could be troubleſome to us. Our love will be there without ſuſpicions, without interruptions, unkindneſſes and diſcontents, without diſappointments, fruſtrations and diſſatisfactions: For God himſelf will fully ſatisfie us; and we ſhall love his goodneſs and glory in his Saints, as well as immediately in himſelf. Our friends are now loſt at the turning of a ſtraw: the change of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, their company, their opinions, the ſlanders of back-biters, and miſ-repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of malicious men, can cool their Love, and kill their friendſhip. But Heaven is a place of conſtant Love: The Love of Saints, as all things elſe, is there eternal: And yet it declineth not with age. It is a world of Love that we are haſting to: It is a life of love that we muſt there live; and a work of love, and perfect love that we muſt be there employed in for ever. If here we have a pure, a dear, a faithful friend; that is without falſe-heartedneſs and deceit, that loveth us as his own ſoul, how quickly is he ſnatcht away by death? and leaves us melted into tears, and mourning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his earthly relicts, and looking upward
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59502:72"/>
with grieved hearts, as the Diſciples did after their aſcending Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11. We are left almoſt as lifeleſs by ſuch friends, as the body is left by the departed ſoul: We have nothing but grief to tell us that we live, and that our ſouls are not departed with them: we are left in greater lamentation, then if we had never known a faithful friends. And alas, how quickly are they gone, when once God ſees them ripe for heaven? When Droans and Dullards live much longer. If we ſee a Saint thats clear of judgement, and low in humility, and naked-hearted in ſincerity, and that abounds in love to God and man, thats faithful and conſtant to their friend, and is above the pride and vanities of this world, and doth converſe by a life of faith, above, and is uſefull and exemplary in their generation; alas how ſoon are they ſnatcht away! and we are left in our temptations, ripening and murmuring at God, as <hi>Jonah,</hi> when his gourd was withered, as if the Lord had deſtinated this world to be the dwelling of unfaithfull, worthleſs men, and envied us the preſence of one eminent Saint, one faithful friend, and one that (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Muſt a Saint that is ripe be kept from Chriſt, and ſo long kept from his inheritance, from the company of Angels, and the face of God, and all, leſt <hi>we ſhould</hi> be diſpleaſed, and grudge at God for glorifying thoſe, whom he deſtinated to glory before the foundations of the world; and whom he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and prepared for Glory? Muſt there a place be empty, and a voice be wanting in the Heavenly Chore, Ieſt we ſhould miſs our friends on earth? Are we not haſting after them at the heels, and do we not hope to live with them for ever? and ſhall we grudge that they are gone a day, or week, or year, before us? O fooliſh unbelieving ſouls! We mourn for them that are paſt mourning: and lament for our friends that are gone to Reſt, when we are left our ſelves in a vexatious, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, howling wilderneſs! as if it were better to be here! we mourn and weep for the ſouls that are triumphing in their Maſters joy!
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59502:73"/>
And yet we ſay, we believe, and hope, and labour, and wait for the ſame felicity! Shall the happineſs of our friends be our ſorrow and lamentation? O did we but ſee theſe bleſſed ſouls, and where they are, and what they are enjoying, and what they are doing, we ſhould be aſhamed to mourn thus for their change! Do you think they would wiſh themſelves again on earth? or would they take it kindly of you, if you could bring them down again into this world, though it were to reign in wealth and honour? O how would they diſdain or abhor the motion, unleſs the commanding will of God did make it a part of their obedience! And ſhall we grieve that they are not here, when to be here, would be their grief?</p>
               <p>But thus our lives are filled with griefs. Thus ſmiles and frowns, deſires and denyals, hopes and fruſtrations, indeavours and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, do make a quotidian ague of our lives. The perſons and the things we love, do contribute to our ſorrows, as well as thoſe we hate. If our friends are bad, or prove unkind, they gall and grieve us while they live: If they excell in holineſs, fidelity and ſuitableneſs, the dart that kills them deeply woundeth us; and the ſweeter they were to us in their lives, the bitterer to us is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59502:74"/>
their death. We cannot keep mercy, but ſin is ready to take it from us, or elſe to marr in, and turn it into Vinegar and Gall. And doth not Death (acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally) befriend us, that puts an end to all theſe troubles, and lands us ſafe on the Celeſtial ſhore, and puts us into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of perpetual Reſt, where all is calm, and the ſtorms and billows that toſt us here, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And thus Death ſhall make us ſome recompence at laſt, for the wrong it did us; and the mortal blow ſhall hurt us leſs then did the dreadful apparition of it in our fore-thoughts. Let not our fears then exceed the cauſe; Though we fear the pangs and throws of travel, let us withal remember, that we ſhall preſently rejoyce, and all the holy Angels with us, that a ſoul is born into the world of glory: And Death ſhall gain us much more then it deprived us of.</p>

               <head>DIRECTION X.</head>
               <p>THE laſt Direction that I ſhall give you, to conquer the Enmity of Death, is this: <hi>Give up your wills entirely to the will of God, as knowing that his will is your beginning and your end, your ſafety, your felicity and reſt, in which you ſhould gladly aquieſce.</hi> When you think of Death, remember who it is that ſends it; It is our Fathers meſſenger, and is ſent but to execute his will. And can there be any thing in the will of God, that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould inordinately fear? Doubtleſs, his Will is much ſafer and better for us then our own. And if in generall it were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our choice, Whether all particulars of our lives ſhould be diſpoſed of by Gods will or by ours, common reaſon might teach us to deſire, to be rather in Gods hands then our own. The fulfilling of his will is the care and buſineſs of our lives: and therefore it ſhould be a ſupport and ſatisfaction to us at our death, that it is but the fulfilling of his will. His Juſtice and puniſhing Will is good, though ſelfiſhneſs maketh it ungratefull to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59502:75"/>
the offendor. But his children that are dear to him, and taſt no evil but that which worketh for their good, have no cauſe to quarrell at his will: Whatſoever our ſureſt deareſt friends would have us take, or do, or ſuffer, we are ready to ſubmit to, as being confident they will do nothing for our hurt, (if they do but know what is for our good.) And ſhall we not more boldly truſt the will of God then of our deareſt friend? He knows what he hath to do with us, and how he will diſpoſe of us, and whither he will bring us; and his intereſt in us is more then ours in our ſelves; and ſhall we then diſtruſt him, as if we had to do with an enemy, or one that were evil, and not with love and infinite goodneſs? It is the will of God that muſt be the everlaſting Reſt, the Heaven, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our ſouls: And ſhall we now ſo fear it, and fly from it: as if it were our ruine? Look which way you will through all the world, your ſouls will never find repoſe, nor ſatisfying quietneſs and content but in the will of God. Let us therefore commit our ſouls to him, as to a faithful Creator; and deſire unfeignedly the fulfilling of his will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is no ground of confidence more firm. <hi>Abraham</hi> may boldly truſt his Son, his only Son, on the will of God: And Chriſt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59502:75"/>
himſelf when he was to drink the bitter Cup, ſubmitteth his own naturall love of life to his Fathers will, ſaying, Not my will, but thine be done. 'Tis a moſt unworthy abuſe of God, that we could be quiet and rejoyce, if our own wills, or our deareſt friends might, diſpoſe of our lives, and yet are diſtreſſed when they are at the diſpoſe of the will of God.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, <hi>It is the error of my own will that hath procured my Death: if it had been meerly the fruit of the will of God, I could be eaſily ſatisfied. Anſw.</hi> Wo to us, if we had not ground of comfort againſt the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our own wills. When our deſtruction is of our ſelves, our help is of God. So much as is of our ſelves in it, is evil: but ſo much as is of God is good. I do not ſay that you ſhould reſt in your <hi>own</hi> wills, nor in your own wayes; but in the will and wayes of God. The rod is good, though the fault that makes it neceſſary, be bad. The Chaſtiſing will is good, though the ſinning will be evil: And it is good that is intended to us, and ſhall be performed in the event.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But how can we reſt in the angry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting will of God; when it is this that we muſt be humbled under: and it is the will of God that is the condemnation of the wicked. Anſ.</hi> The effect being
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59502:76"/>
from a twofold cauſe (the ſinning will of man, and the puniſhing will of God) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly good as from the latter, and ſo far ſhould be loved and conſented to by all; and evil as from the former, and ſo may be abhorred: But to the Saints there is yet greater Conſolation: Though affliction is their grief, as it ſignifieth Gods diſpleaſure, and cauſeth the ſmart or deſtruction of the fleſh; yet it is their mercy, as it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Love of God, and prepareth them for the greateſt mercies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing God never bringeth evil on them that Love him, but what is preparatory to a far greater good, we may well take comfort in our Death, that it is our Fathers will it ſhould be ſo.</p>

               <p>IF Death ſhall be conquered as the laſt enemy, from hence Chriſtians may receive exceeding conſolation, as knowing that they have no enemy to their happineſs, but ſuch as ſhall be conquered by Chriſt; ſooner or later he will overcome them all. Let
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59502:76"/>
faith therefore foreſee the conqueſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; and let us not with too much deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency hang down our heads before any enemy that we know ſhall be trodden down at laſt. We have burdenſome corruptions, that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our graces, and grieve the ſpirit, and wrong our Lord; but all theſe ſhall be overcome. Though we have heard, and read, and prayed, and meditated, and yet our ſins remain alive, they ſhall be conquered at laſt. Our Love, and Joy, and praiſe ſhall be everlaſting; but our ignorance, and unbelief, and pride, and paſſion ſhall not be everlaſting: Our Holineſs ſhall be perfected and have no end: but our ſin ſhall be aboliſhed, and have an end.

                  </gap>t. The wicked have no comforts but what will have an end; and the fore-thought of that is ſufficient to imbitter even the preſent ſweetneſs. And the godly have no ſorrows but ſuch as are of ſhort continuance: And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the fore-ſight of their end, ſhould ſweeten the preſent bitter Cup, and make our ſorrows next to none: We ſit wee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing now in the midſt of manifold afflictions:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59502:77"/>
But we fore-ſee the day when we ſhall weep no more, but all tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes, by the tender hand of our merciful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. We are now afraid of love it ſelf, even of our dear and bleſſed Father, leſt he ſhould hate us; or be angry with us for ever. But heaven will baniſh all theſe fears, when the perfect fruition of the eternal Love hath perfected our love. Our doubtings and perplexities of mind are many and grievous, but they will be but ſhort. When we have full poſſeſſion, we ſhall be paſt our doubts. Our work is now to pour out our grieved ſouls into the boſome of ſome faithful friend; or eaſe our troubled minds by complaining of our miſeries to our faithful Paſtors, that from them we may have ſome words of direction and conſolation: But O how different a work is it that we ſhall have in heaven? where no more complainings ſhall be heard from our mouths, nor no more ſorrow ſhall poſſeſs our hearts? and we ſhall have no need of men to comfort us; but ſhall have comfort as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the face of God, as we have light and heat in the ſummer from the ſun. When we all make one celeſtial Chore, to ſing the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the King of Saints, how unlike will that melody be to the broken muſick of ſighs, and groans, and lamentations, which we now
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59502:77"/>
take to be almoſt our beſt! We are now glad when we can find but words, and groans, and tears, to lament our ſin and miſery: But then our joy ſhall know no ſorrow, nor our voice any ſad and mournful tune. And may we not bear a while the ſorrows that ſhall have ſo good an end? We ſhall ſhortly have laid by the hard, unprofitable, barren hearts, that are now our continual burden and diſeaſe. Love not your corruptions, Chriſtians; but yet be patient under the unavoidable relicts that offend you; remembring that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict will end in conqueſt, and your faith, and watchfulneſs, and patience will be put to it but a little while. Who would not enter willingly into the fight, when he may before hand be aſſured, that the field ſhall be cleared of every enemy? All this muſt be aſcribed to our dear Redeemer. Had not he wrought the conqueſt, the enemies that vex us would have deſtroyed us, and the Serpent that now doth but bruiſe our heel, would have bruiſed our head: and the ſorrows that are whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſanctified, and ſhort, would have been mortal, venemous, and endleſs.</p>
               <p>What ſuffering then can be ſo great, in which a believer ſhould not rejoyce, when he is before hand promiſed a gracious end?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59502:78"/>
What though at the preſent it be not joyous, but greivous (in it ſelf?) We ſhould bear it with patience, when we know that at laſt it ſhall bring forth the peaceable fruits, of righteouſneſs to all them that are exerciſed thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. If we ſhould be <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi> abuſed, and alwayes unthankfully and unkindly dealth with, or <hi>alwayes</hi> under the ſcorns or ſlanders, or perſecutions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable men, or <hi>alwayes</hi> under our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and toilſome labours, or <hi>alwayes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our pains and pining ſickneſſes, we might then in deed diſmiſs our comforts: But when we know that it will be but a little while, and that all will end in Reſt and Joy; and that our ſorrows are but preparing for thoſe Joyes; even Reaſon it ſelf is taught by Faith, to bid us rejoyce in all our tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12. We make nothing to endure a ſudden prick, that by blood-letting we may prevent a long diſeaſe. The ſhort pain of pulling out a tooth, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily endured, to prevent a longer. A woman doth bear the pains of her travail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſhort, and tends to the bringing of a child into the world. Who would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any labour or toyl for a day, that he might win a life of plenty and delight by it? who
<pb facs="tcp:59502:78"/>
would not be ſpit upon, and made the ſcorn of the world for a day, if he might have his will for it as long as he liveth on earth? And ſhould we not then cheerfully ſubmit to our momentany afflictions, and the troubles of a few dayes, (which are light, and mixt with a world of mercies,) when we know that they are working for us, a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternal weight of glory? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. Our clamorous and malicious enemies, our quarrelſome Brethren, our peeviſh friends, our burdenſome corruptions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections will ſhortly trouble us no more. As our life is ſhort, and but a dream and ſhadow, and therefore the pleaſures of this world are no better; ſo our troubles alſo will be no longer, and are but ſad dreams, and dark ſhadows, that quickly paſs away: Our Lord that hath begun and gone on ſo far, will finiſh his victories, and the laſt enemy ſhall ſhortly be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>And if the fearful doubting Soul ſhall ſay; I know this is comfort to them that are in Chriſt; but what is it to me, that know not whether I have any part in him? I anſwer, 1. The foundation of God ſtill ſtandeth ſure: the Lord knoweth his own, even when ſome of them know not that they are his own. He knoweth his mark upon his ſheep, when they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59502:79"/>
know it not themſelves. God doubteth not of his intereſt in thee, though thou doubt of thy intereſt in him: And thou art faſter in the arms of his Love, then by the arms of thy own faith: as the child is ſurer in the Mothers arms, then by its holding of the Mother. And moreover your doubts and fears are part of the evil that ſhall be removed, and your bittereſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that hence proceed, ſhall with the reſt of the enemies be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>2. But yet take heed that you unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully plead not againſt the mercies which you have received, and be not friends to thoſe doubts and fears which are your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that you take not part with the enemy of your comforts. Why doſt thou doubt (poor humbled ſoul) of thy intereſt in Chriſt, that muſt make the conqueſt? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me but theſe few Queſtions from thy heart.</p>
               <p>1. Did Chriſt ever ſhew himſelf unkind to thee? or unwilling to receive thee, and have mercy on thee? Did he ever give thee cauſe to think ſo poorly of his Love and grace, as thy doubts do intimate thou doſt? Haſt thou not found him kind when thou waſt unkind? and that he thought on thee when thou didſt not think on him? and will he now forget
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59502:79"/>
thee, and end in wrath that begun in Love? He deſired thee when thou didſt not deſire him, and gave thee all thy deſires after him: and will he now croſs and deny the deſires which he hath cauſed? He was found of thee, (or rather found thee) when thou ſoughteſt not after him: and can he reject thee now thou cryeſt and calleſt for his grace? O think not hardly of his wonderous grace, till he give thee cauſe. Let thy ſweet experiences be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, to the ſhame of thy cauſleſs doubts and fears; and let him that hath loved thee to the death, be thought on as he is, and not as the unbelieving fleſh would miſrepreſent him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. If thou ſay that it is not his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, but thy own that feeds thy doubts; I further ask thee, Is he not kind to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? eſpecially when they lament their own unkindneſs? Thou art not <hi>ſo</hi> unkind to him as thou waſt in thy <hi>unconverted</hi> ſtate: and yet he then expreſt his Love in thy converſion: He then ſought thee when thou wenteſt aſtray, and brought thee carefully home into his Fold, and there he hath kept thee ever ſince: And is he leſs kind now when thou art returned home? Doſt thou not know that all his children have their forwardneſs, and are guilty of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes to him? And yet he doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59502:80"/>
diſown them, and turn them out of his family; but is tender of them in their froward weakneſs; becauſe they are his own? How dealt he with the peeviſh Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> that was [<hi>exceedingly diſpleaſed, and very angry,</hi>] that God ſpared <hi>Nineveh</hi> leſt it ſhould be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to his Propheſie; in ſo much that he wiſht that he might <hi>die</hi> and <hi>not live:</hi> and after repined at the withering of his gourd, and the ſcorching of the Sun that beat upon him? The Lord doth gently queſtion with him [<hi>Doſt thou well to be angry?</hi>] and after hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him that the mercy which he valued to himſelf, he ſhould not envy to ſo many, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. How dealt he with the Diſciples, that fell a ſleep; when they ſhould have watcht with Chriſt in the night of his great agony? He doth not tell them, [<hi>You are none of mine, becauſe you could not watch with me one hour;</hi>] but tenderly excuſeth that which they durſt not excuſe themſelves, [<hi>The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak;</hi>] When he was on the Croſs, though <hi>they all forſook him and fled,</hi> he was then ſo far from <hi>forſaking them,</hi> that he was manifeſting to admiration that exceeding love, that never would forſake them. And knoweſt thou not poor complaining ſoul, that the kindneſs of Chriſt overcometh all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59502:80"/>
of his children? and that his blood and grace is ſufficient to ſave thee, from greater ſins then thoſe that trouble thee? If thou hadſt no ſin, what uſe hadſt thou of a Saviour? Will thy Phyſitian therefore caſt thee off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art ſick?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Yea hath not Chriſt already ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued ſo many of thy enemies, as may aſſure thee he will ſubdue the reſt? and begun that life in thee, which may aſſure thee of eternal life? Once thou waſt a deſpiſer of God and his holy wayes: but now it is far otherwiſe with thee? Hath he not broken the heart of thy pride and worldlineſs, and ſenſuality and made thee a new Creature? and is not this a pledge that he will do the reſt? Tell me plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hadſt thou rather keep thy ſin, or leave it? Hadſt thou rather have liberty to commit it, or be delivered from it? Doſt thou not hate it, and ſet thy ſelf againſt it as thy enemy? Art thou not delivered from the reign and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of it, which thou waſt once under? And will not he perfect the conqueſt which he hath begun? He that hath thus far delivered thee from ſin, thy greateſt enemy, will deliver thee from all the ſad effects of it. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed work of the Spirit in thy Converſion, did deliver thee from the bondage of the Devil, from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59502:81"/>
thee into the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; Then didſt thou enter the holy warfare, under his banners that was never overcome, in the victorious Army that ſhall ſhortly begin their everlaſting triumph. The ſin which thou hateſt and longeſt to be delivered from, and art willing to uſe Gods means againſt it, is the conquered enemy, which may aſſure thee of a full and final conqueſt, ſuppoſing that thy hatred is againſt all known ſin, and that there is none ſo ſweet or profitable in thy account, which thou hadſt not far rather leave then keep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Moreover, art thou not truly willing to yield to all the terms of grace? Thou haſt heard of the yoak and burden of Chriſt, and of the conditions of the Goſpel, on which peace is offered to the ſinful world: and what Chriſt requireth of ſuch as will be his Diſciples. What ſaith thy heart now to thoſe terms? Do they ſeem ſo hard and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to thee, that thou wilt venture thy ſoul in thy ſtate of ſin, rather then accept of them? If this were ſo, thou hadſt yet no part in Chriſt indeed. But if there be nothing that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thee, that is not deſirable in thy eyes: or which thou doſt not ſtick at, ſo far as to turn away from him, and forſake him, and refuſe his Covenant and grace rather then ſubmit
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59502:81"/>
to ſuch conditions, thou art then in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, and the bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant belong to thee. Canſt thou think that Chriſt hath purchaſed, and offered, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that which he will not give? Hath he ſent forth his Miniſters, and commanded them to make the Motion in his name, and to invite and compell men to come in, and to beſeech them to be reconciled to God, and that yet he is unwilling to accept thee when thou doſt conſent? If Chriſt had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, he had not ſo dearly made the way, nor begun as a ſuitor to thy ſoul, nor ſo diligently ſought thee as he hath done. If the bleſſings of the Covenant are thine, then Heaven is thine, which is the chiefeſt bleſſing: And if they be not thine, it is not becauſe Chriſt is unwilling, but becauſe thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing of his bleſſings on his terms: Nothing can deprive thee of them but thy refuſal: Know therefore aſſuredly, whether thou doſt conſent thy ſelf to the terms of Chriſt, and whether thou art truly willing that he be thy Saviour; and if thy conſcience bear thee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſs, that it is ſo; diſhonour not Chriſt then ſo far as to queſtion, whether <hi>be</hi> be <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> who hath done ſo much to put it out of doubt. The ſtop is at <hi>thy will,</hi> and not at
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59502:82"/>
                  <hi>his.</hi> If thou know that thou art <hi>willing,</hi> thou mayſt know that Chriſt &amp; his benefits are thine; &amp; if thou be not willing, what makes theewiſh, &amp; groan, &amp; pray; &amp; labour in the uſe of means? Is it not for Chriſt &amp; his benefits, that thy heart thus worketh, and thou doſt all this? Fear not then if thy own hand be to the Covenant, it is moſt certain that the hand of Chriſt is at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. Moreover. I would ask thee, <hi>Whether thou ſee not a beauty in Holineſs, which is the Image of Chriſt, and whether thy ſoul do not deſire it even in perfection?</hi> So that thou hadſt rather, if thou hadſt thy choice, be more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then more rich or honourable in the world! If ſo, be aſſured that it is not without Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that thou chooſeſt and preferreſt Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Hadſt thou not rather have more faith, and hope, and love to God, and patience and contentment, and communion with Chriſt, then have more of the favour and applauſe of man, or of the riches or pleaſures of this world? If ſo, I would know of thee, whether this be not from the ſpirit of Chriſt within thee? and be not his Image it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee? and the motions of the new and heavenly nature, which is begotten in thee by the Holy Ghoſt? Undoubtedly it is. And the ſpirit of Chriſt thus dwelling in thee, is the earneſt of thy inheritance. Doſt thou find the ſpirit of Chriſt thus working in thee, cauſing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59502:82"/>
thee to love Holineſs, and hate all ſin, and yet canſt thou doubt of thy part in Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. Moreover canſt thou not truly ſay, that Chriſts friends; ſo far as thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt them, are thy friends, and that whinh is againſt him, thou takeſt as againſt thy ſelf? If ſo, undoubtedly, thy enemies alſo are to him as his enemies, and he will lay them at thy feet. Thy troubles are as his troubles, and in all thy afflictions he is as careful of thy good, as if he himſelf were thereby afflicted. Fear not thoſe enemies that Chriſt takes as his own. It is he that is engaged to overcome them.</p>
               <p>And now when Conſcience it ſelf beareth witneſs, that thus it is with thy ſoul, and that thou wouldſt fain be what God would have thee be, and deſireſt nothing more then to be more like him, and nearer to him, and deſireſt no kind of life ſo much, as that in which thou maiſt be moſt ſerviceable to him: Conſider what a wrong it is then to Chriſt, and to the honour of his Covenant and grace, and to thy poor dejected ſoul, that thou ſhouldſt lie queſtioning his love and thy part in him, and looking about for matter of accuſation or cauſeleſs ſuſpition againſt his ſpirit working in thee? and that thou ſhouldſt caſt away the joy of the Lord which is thy ſtrength, and gratifie the enemy of thy peace? When ſickneſs is upon thee, and death draws nigh, thou
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59502:83"/>
ſhouldſt then with joy lift up thy head, becauſe thy warfare is almoſt accompliſhed, and thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ready to deliver thee the Crown. Is this a time to fear and mourn, when thou art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into endleſs joy? Is it a time of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when thou art almoſt at thy jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, ready to ſee thy Saviours face, and to take thy place in the <hi>Heavenly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> amongſt thoſe millions of holy ſouls that are gone before thee? Is it ſeemly for thee to lament thus at the door, when they are fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with ſuch unconceivable joys within? Doſt thou know what thy Brethren are now enjoying, and what the heavenly Hoſt are doing? how full they are of God and how they are raviſhed with his Light and Love? and canſt thou think it ſeemly to be ſo unlike them, that are paſſing to them? I know there is ſuch difference between imperfection and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and between earth and heaven, that it juſtifieth our moderate ſorrows, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to take up infinitely ſhort of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, till we are with them. But yet let there not be <hi>too great</hi> a diſproportion between the members of Jeſus Chriſt. We have the ſame Lord, and the ſame Spirit, and all that is theirs in poſſeſſion, is in right and title ours. They are our elder brethren, and being at age, have poſſeſſion of the inheritance: but we that are yet in the lap of the Church on earth, our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59502:83"/>
Mother, and in the arms of our Fathers grace, are of the ſame family, and have the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in our low degree. They were once on earth as low as we: and we ſhall be ſhortly in heaven, as high as they: Am I now in fleſh, in fears, in griefs? ſo was <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Saints, a while ago: yea and Chriſt himſelf. Am I beſet with ſin, and compaſſed with infirmities, and racked by my own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered paſſion? ſo were the many ſaints now glorified, but the other day <hi>Elias was a man ſubject</hi> (ſaith <hi>James,</hi>) <hi>to like paſſions as we are, James</hi> 5. 17. Am I maliced by diſſenting adverſaries? Do they privily lay ſnares for me, and watch my halting, and ſeek advantage againſt my name, and liberty and life? ſo did they by <hi>David,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now with Chriſt? But now theſe enemies are overcome. Art thou under pains, and conſuming ſickneſſes? are thine eyes held wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and doth trouble and ſorrow waſt thy ſpirits? doth thy fleſh and thy heart fail thee, and thy friends prove ſilly comforters to thee? So was it with thoſe thouſands that are now in Heaven, where the night of calamities is paſt, and the juſt have dominion in the morning; and glory, hath baniſhed all their griefs, and joyes have made them forget their ſorrows; unleſs as the remembrance of them doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59502:84"/>
thoſe joyes. Are thy friends lamenting thee, and grieved to ſee the ſigns of thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death? do they weep when they ſee thy pale face, and conſumed body, and when they hear thy ſighs and groans? Why thus it was once with the millions that are now triumphing with their Lord? They lay in ſickneſs, and underwent the pains, and were lamented by their friends, as as thou art now. Even Chriſt himſelf was once in his agony, and ſome ſhake the head at him, and others pitied him, who ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have wept for themſelves, than for him. This is but the paſſage from the womb of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, into the life of immortality, which all the Saints have paſt before thee, that are now with Chriſt. Doſt thou fear the dreafdul face of death? Muſt thy tender fleſh be turned to rottenneſs and duſt? and muſt thou lie in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till the Reſurrection, and thy body remain as the Common earth? And is not this the caſe of all thoſe millions, whoſe ſouls now ſee the face of Chriſt? Did they not lie as thou doſt, and die as thou muſt, and paſs by death to the life which they have now attained? O then commit thy ſoul to Chriſt, and be quiet and comforted in his care and love. Truſt him as the Mid-wife of thy departing ſoul, who will bring it ſafe into the light and life, which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59502:84"/>
thou are yet ſuch a ſtranger to. But it is not ſtrange to him, though it be ſtrange to thee.</p>
               <p>What was it that that rejoyced thee all thy life, in thy prayers, and ſufferings, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? was it not the hopes of heaven? And was Heaven the ſpring and motive of thy obedience, and the comfort of thy life? and yet wilt thou paſs into it with heavineſs? and ſhall thy approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to it be thy ſorrows? Didſt thou pray for that which thou wouldſt not have? Haſt thou laboured for it, and denyed thy ſelf the pleaſures of the world for it? and now art thou afraid to enter in? Fear not, poor ſoul! Thy Lord is there; Thy husband, and thy head, and life is there. Thou haſt more <hi>there,</hi> a thouſand fold more, than thou haſt <hi>here. Here</hi> thou muſt leave poor mourning friends, that languiſh in their own infimities, and troubled thee as well as comforted thee, while thou waſt with them, and that are haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after thee, and will ſhortly overtake thee. But there thou ſhalt find the ſouls of all the bleſſed Saints, that have lived ſince the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till this age: that are all uncloathed of the rags of their mortality, and have laid by their frailties with their fleſh, and are made up of holineſs, and prepard for joy, and will be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59502:85"/>
companions for thee in thy joyes. Why ſhouldſt thou be afraid to go the way that all the Saints have gone before thee? Where there is one on earth, how many are there in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? and one of them is worth many of us. Art thou better then <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David?</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Saints? Or doſt thou not love their names, and wouldſt thou not be with them? Art thou loath to leave thy friends on earth? And haſt thou not far better and more in heaven? Why then art thou not as loath to ſtay from them? Suppoſe that I, and ſuch as I, were the friends that thou art loath to leave: What if we had dyed long before thee? If it be our company that thou loveſt, thou ſhouldſt then be willing to die, that thou mayſt be with us. And if ſo, why then ſhouldſt thou not be more willing to die, and be with Chriſt and all his holy ones, that are ſo much more excellent than we? Wouldſt thou have our company? Remove then willingly to that place, where thou ſhalt have it to everlaſting: and be not ſo loath to go from hence, where neither thou nor we can ſtay. Hadſt thou rather travel with us, than dwell with us? And rather here ſuffer with us, than reign in Heaven with Chriſt and us?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59502:85"/>O What a brutiſh thing is fleſh? What an unreaſonable thing is unbelief? Shall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and fly from the <hi>end</hi> of our belief? Shall we hope, and be loath to <hi>enjoy</hi> our hopes? Shall we deſire and pray, and be afraid of <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> our deſires, and leſt our prayers ſhould be heard? Shall we ſpend our lives in labour and travel, and be afraid of comming to our journeys end? Do you love life, or do you not? If not, why are you afraid of death? If you do, why then are you loath to paſs into everlaſting life? You know there is no hope of immortality on earth: Hence you muſt paſs whether you will or not, as all your Fathers have done before you; it is therefore in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or no where, that endleſs life is to be had. If you can live here for ever, do. Hope for it, if any have done ſo before you. Go to ſome man of a thouſand years old, and ask him how he made ſhift to draw out his life ſo long: But if you know that man walketh here in a vain ſhew, and that his life is a ſhadow, a dream, a poſt; and that all theſe things ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the faſhion of them paſſeth away; is it not more reaſonable that we ſhould ſet our hearts on the place where there is hopes of our continuance, than where there is none? and where we muſt live for ever, than where we muſt be but for ſo ſhort a time?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59502:86"/>Alas poor darkned, troubled ſoul! Is the preſence of Chriſt leſs deſirable in thy eyes, than the preſence of ſuch ſinful worms as we, whom thou art loath to part with? Is it more grievous to thee to be abſent from us, than from thy Lord; from Earth, than from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; from Sinners, than from bleſſed Saints; from trouble and frailty, than from glory? Haſt thou any thing here that thou ſhalt want in Heaven? Alas, that we ſhould thus draw back from Happineſs, and follow Chriſt ſo heavily and ſadly into life! But all this is long of the enemies that now moleſt our peace: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling ſin, and a flattering world, and a brutiſh fleſh, and interpoſing death, are our diſcouragements that drive us back. But all theſe enemies ſhall ſhortly be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p>Fear not Death then, let it do its worſt. It can give thee but one deadly gripe that ſhall kill it ſelf, and prove thy life: as the Waſp that leaves its ſting behind, and can ſting no more. It ſhall but ſnuff the Candle of thy life, and make it ſhine brighter when it ſeems to be put out. It is but an undreſſing, and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſleep. That which thou couldſt not here attain, by all our preaching, and all thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and cares, and pains, thou ſhalt ſpeedily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the help of death. It is but the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59502:86"/>
of thy gracious Lord, and calleth thee to him, to the place that he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Hearken not now to the great Deceiver, that would draw thee to unbelief, and cauſe thee to ſtagger at the promiſes of God, when thou haſt followed him ſo far, and they are near to the full performance. Believe it as ſure as thou believeſt that the Sun doth ſhine upon thee, that God cannot lye; he is no Deceiver: it was his meer love and bounty that cauſed him to make the promiſes, when he had no need for himſelf to make them: and ſhall he be then unfaithful, and not fulfil the promiſes which he hath freely made? Believe it, faith is no deluſion: It may be folly to truſt man; but it is worſe than folly not to truſt God. Believe it, Heaven is not a ſhadow, nor the life of faith and holineſs a dream. Theſe <hi>ſenſible</hi> things have leaſt reality: Theſe groſſer ſubſtances are moſt droſſy, deluſory and baſe. God is a Spirit, who is the prime Being, and the cauſe of all created Beings. And the Angels and other celeſtial Inhabitants, that are neareſt to him, are furtheſt from corporei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and are ſpirits likeſt unto God. The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing is from ſpirituality, the further from that excellency and perfection, which the

And this lumpiſh, dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, viſible world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is incomparably below that ſpiritual world, which we believe and wait for: And though thy conceptions of ſpirits, and the ſpiritual world, are low, and dark, and much unſatisfying; remember ſtill that thy head is there; and it belongeth to him to know what thou ſhalt be, till thou art fit to know it, which will not be till thou art fit to enjoy it. Be ſatisfied that thy Father is in Heaven, and that thy Lord is there, and that the Spirit that hath been ſo long at work within thee, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thee for it, dwelleth there: And let it ſuffice thee, that Chriſt knoweth what he will do with thee, and how he will employ thee to all eternity. And thou ſhalt very ſhortly ſee his face, and in his light thou ſhalt behold that light that ſhall fully ſatisfie thee, and ſhame all thy preſent doubts and fears; and if there were ſhame in Heaven, would ſhame thee for them.</p>

               <p>FRom the Enmity of Death, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Conqueſt, we may ſee what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful mercy the Reſurrection of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was to the Church, and what uſe we ſhould make of it for the ſtrengthening of our Faith. It was not only impoſſible to man to conquer Death by his own ſtrength, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be conquered by Chriſt; but it was alſo beyond out power to believe it, that ever the dead ſhould riſe to life, if Chriſt had not riſen as the firſt fruits, and convinced man, by eye-ſight, or certain teſtimony, that the thing is poſſible and already done. But now what a pillar is here for faith? What a word of Hope and Joy is this, that [<hi>Chriſt is riſen?</hi>] With this we will anſwer a thouſand Cavi's of the Tempter, and ſtop the mouth of the enemies of our faith, and profligate our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity. As unlikely as it ſeems to fleſh and blood, ſhall we ever doubt whether we ſhall riſe again; when the Lord came down in fleſh among us, that he might die and riſe again him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſhew us as to our faces that we ſhall riſe?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59502:88"/>
This is the very Goſpel which we preach, and by which we muſt be ſaved; <hi>that Chriſt dyed for our ſins according to the Scriptures, and was buried, and that he roſe again the third day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures; and that he was ſeen of</hi> Cephas, <hi>then of the Twelve, and after that he was ſeen of above five hundred Brethren at once, of whom the greater part remained alive,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this, who was the laſt that ſaw him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Read over this Chapter again and again, where our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is proved by the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>No wonder therefore that the Church in all ages ever ſince <hi>the very day of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> hath kept the firſt day of the week, as a holy feſtival, in remembrance of it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though they commemorated the <hi>whole work</hi> of our Redemption, yet was it from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> as the moſt glorious part, that the Spirit of Chriſt did chuſe the day. This hath been the joyful day to the Church this 1625 years, or thereabouts: in which the ancient Chriſtians would aſſemble themſelves together, ſaluting one another with this joyful word, [<hi>The Lord is riſen.</hi>] And this is the day that the Lord hath bleſſed, with the New-birth, and reſurrection of millions of ſouls. So that it is moſt probable that all the ſix dayes of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59502:88"/>
week have not begot half ſo many ſouls for Heaven, as this bleſſed day of the Lords Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection hath done. Let Infidels then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it, that believe not Chriſts Reſurrection; but let it ſtill be the Churches joyful day. <hi>This was the Lords doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes: This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will be glad and rejoyce therein,</hi> Pſal. 118. 23, 24. In it, <hi>Let us ſing unto the Lord, let us make a joyful noiſe to the Rock of our ſalvation. Let us come before his preſence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noiſe to him with Pſalms,</hi> Pſal. 95. 1, 2. Every day let us Remember the Lords Reſurrection: but on this day let the joyful commemoration of it be our work.</p>
               <p>We may ſee by the witneſs of the Apoſtles, and their frequent preaching the Reſurrection of Chriſt; as if it were the ſumm of all the Goſpel, that this is a point that Faith muſt eſpecially build and feed upon, and that we muſt make the matter of our moſt frequent meditations. Oh what vigour it addeth to our faith, when we are encountred by the ſight of Death, and of a grave, to remember ſeriouſly that [<hi>Chriſt is riſen.</hi>] Did he take fleſh purpoſely that he might dye and riſe, and ſhew us how he will raiſe his members? and will he after all this, break his promiſe, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59502:89"/>
leave us in the duſt for ever? It cannot be. Hath he conquered Death for himſelf alone, and not for us? Hath he taken our Nature into Heaven, to be there alone, and will he not have all his members with him? Remember then, Chriſtian, when thou lookeſt on thy grave, that Chriſt was buried; and hath made the grave a bed of reſt, that ſhall give up her truſt, when his Trumpet ſounds: And that his Reſurrection is the pledge of ours. Keep therefore thy riſing and glorified Lord conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in thy eye. If Chriſt were not riſen, our preaching were vain, and your faith were vain, and all men were miſerable, but we moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, that ſuffer ſo much for a life which we had no ground to hope for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14, 17, 19. But now we have an Argument, that Infidelity it ſelf is aſhamed to encounter with; that hath been the means of the converſion of the Nations unto Chriſt; by which we may put even Death it ſelf to a defiance; as knowing it is now a conquered thing. If it could have held Chriſt captive, it might alſo have held us. But he being riſen, we ſhall ſurely riſe. Write it therefore, Chriſtians, upon your hearts; mention it more in your conference for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your faith; Write it on the grave-ſtones of your friends, that [CHRIST
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59502:89"/>
IS RISEN,] and that [BECAUSE HE LIVETH WE SHALL LIVE ALSO,] and that [OUR LIFE IS HID WITH CHRIST IN GOD] though <hi>we are dead;</hi> and <hi>when he ſhall appear who is our Life, we ſhall alſo appear with him in glory,</hi>] John 14. 19. Col. 3. 3, 4. Though we muſt be ſown in corruption, in weakneſs, and diſhonour, we ſhall be raiſed in incorruption, ſtrength, and honour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. 42, 43. While our ſouls behold the Lord in glory, we may bear with the winter that befalls our fleſh till the ſping of Reſurrection come. [<hi>Knowing that he that raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall alſo raiſe us up by Jeſus—For which cauſe we faint not; but, though our outward man periſh, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man is renewed day by day,—while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: For the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.] <hi>As we are riſen with Chriſt to newneſs of life, ſo we ſhall riſe with him to glory.</hi>

               <p>LAſtly, If Death be the laſt Enemy to be deſtroyed at the Reſurrection, we may learn hence, how earneſtly believers ſhould long and pray for the ſecond coming of Chriſt; when this full and final Conqueſt ſhall be made. Death ſhall do much for us; but the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhall do more. Death ſends the ſeparated ſoul to Chriſt: but at his coming, both ſoul and body ſhall be glorified. There is ſomewhat in Death that is penal, even to believers: but in the coming of Chriſt, and their Reſurrection, there is nothing but glorifying grace. Death is the effect of ſin, and of the firſt ſentence paſſed upon ſinners: but the Reſurrection of the Juſt is the final deſtruction of the effects of ſin. And therefore, though the fears of Death may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex us, me-thinks we ſhould long for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, there being nothing in that, but what tends to the deliverance and glory of the Saints. Whether he will come before the general Reſurrection, and reign on earth a thouſand years, which ſome expect, I ſhall not preſume to paſs my determination. But ſure I am, it is the work of faith, and Character of his people, to <hi>love his appearance,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. and to <hi>wait for the Son of God from Heaven, whom he raiſed</hi>

                  <hi>from the dead, even Jeſus who delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 10. and <hi>to wait for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 7. and <hi>to wait for the adoption, the redemption of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> with inward <hi>groanings, Rom.</hi> 8. 23. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us pray more earneſtly for the <hi>coming of our Lord!</hi> and that [<hi>the Lord would direct our hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Chriſt</hi>] 2 Theſ. 3. 5. O bleſſed day, when the glorious appearing of our Lord ſhall put away all his ſervants ſhame, and ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Glory to his members, even to the bodies that had laid ſo long in duſt, that to the eye of fleſh there ſeemed to be no hope! Though the Majeſty and glory will cauſe our Reverence, yet it will not be our terrour, to the diminution of our joy. It is <hi>his enemies that would not have him rule over them,</hi> whom he cometh to <hi>deſtroy, Lu.</hi> 19. 27. [<hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, &amp; to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him; as</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch <hi>the ſeventh from</hi> Noah, <hi>propheſied,</hi> Jud. 14. 15.

Aſſemblics prayed <hi>pro mora finis, (Apologet. c. 39.)</hi> And ſo he might well enough, if it were not that to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians the Glory of God is dearer than their own felicity, and the ſalvation of millions more precious than the meer haſtening of their own; and the glory of the Church more deſirable than our perſonal glory, and the <hi>hallowing of Gods Name</hi> were not to be prayed for before the <hi>coming of his Kingdom;</hi> and the Kingdom of grace muſt not neceſſarily go before the Kingdom of glory. But as much as we long for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord, we are content to wait till the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59502:92"/>
Elect be gathered; and can pray that he will delay it, till the Univerſal Body be made up, and all are called that ſhall be glorified. But to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> that are brought out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into the Wilderneſs, how deſirable is the promiſed Land? When we think on our own intereſt, we cry [<hi>Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly:</hi>] The ſooner the better. Then ſhall our eyes behold him, in whom we have believed: Not as he was beheld on earth in his deſpiſed ſtate; but as the glorious King of Saints, accompanied with the Celeſtial Hoſt, <hi>coming in flaming fire to render vengeance</hi> to the rebellious, and Reſt and Joy to believing ſouls, that waited for this day of his appearance. Then <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> ſhall give up their work; and ſight and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perfect love, ſhall everlaſtingly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them. The rage of Perſecutors ſhall no more affright us: the folly of the multitude ſhall no more annoy us: the falſeneſs of our ſeeming ſelfiſh friends ſhall no more betray us: the pride of ſelf-conceited men ſhall no more diſturb us: the turbulency of men diſtracted by ambition, ſhall caſt us no more into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Kingdom that we ſhall poſſeſs, ſhall not be lyable to mutations, nor be toſſed with pride and faction, as are theſe below. There is no monthly (or annual) change of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Laws, as is in Lunatick Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59502:92"/>
but there will be the ſame Lord and King, and the ſame Laws and Government, and the ſame Subjects and obedience, without any mutinies, rebellions, or diſcontents, to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. The Church of which we ſhall then be members, ſhall not be divided into parties, and factions, nor the members look ſtrangely at each other, becauſe of difference of opinions, or diſtance of affections, as now we find it, to our daily grief, in the militant Church. We ſhall then need no tedious debates to reconcile us: Unity will be then quickly and eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. There will be no falling out in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Lord. There will be none of that darkneſs, uncharitableneſs; ſelfiſhneſs, or paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on left, that now cauſeth our diſſentions. When we have perfect Light, and perfect Love, the perfect Peace will be eaſily attained, which here we labour for in vain. Now there is no Peace in Church or State, in Cities or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in families or ſcarce in our own ſouls. But when the glorious King of Peace hath put all his enemies under his feet, what then is left to make diſturbance? Our enemies can injure us no more, for it is then their portion to ſuffer for all their former injuries to Chriſt and us: Our friends <hi>will</hi> not injure us (as here they do;) becauſe their corruption and weakneſs is put off, and the relicks of ſin, that cauſed the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59502:93"/>
trouble, are left behind. O that is the ſight that faith prepareth for, that is the day, the bleſſed day, that all our dayes are ſpent in ſeeking, and waiting, and praying for; then ſhall the glory of holineſs appear, and the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the Saints be juſtified by <hi>all,</hi> that now is <hi>juſtified by her children!</hi> Then it ſhall be known, Whether faith or unbelief, whether a heavenly or earthly mind and life, was the wiſer and more juſtifiable courſe: then ſhall all the world <hi>diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between them that ſerve God, and them that ſerve him not,</hi> Mal. 3. 18. Then ſin (that is now ſo obſtinately defended, and juſtified by ſuch fooliſh cunning) ſhall never more find a tongue to plead for it, or a Patron to defend it more. Then where is the man that will ſtand forth, and break a jeſt at godlineſs, or make a ſcorn of the holy diligence of Believers? How pale then will thoſe faces look, that here were wont to jear at piety! What terrour will ſeize upon thoſe hearts, that here were wont to make themſelves ſport at the weakneſſes of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſervants of the Lord? That is the day that ſhall rectifie all judgements, and cure the errours and contemptuous thoughts of an holy life, which no perſwaſions now can cure; that is the day that ſhall ſet all ſtraight, that now ſeems crooked; and ſhall ſatisfie us to the full,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59502:93"/>
that God was juſt, even when he proſpered his enemies, and afflicted the ſouls that loved him, and walkt in their integrity before him. We ſhall then ſee that which ſhall fully ſatisfie us of the reaſon and equity of all our ſufferings, which here we underwent; we ſhall marvel no more that God lets us weep, and groan, and pray, and turns away his face, and ſeems not to regard us. We ſhall then find that all our groans were heard, and all our tears and prayers did ſucceed, which we ſuſpected had been loſt. We ſhall then find that a duty performed in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, through all our lives, was never loſt; no nor a holy thought; nor a <hi>Cup of cold water,</hi> that from holy love we gave to <hi>a Diſciple.</hi> We ſhall then ſee that our murmurings, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and jealous unbelieving thoughts of God, which ſickneſs, or poverty, or croſſes, did occaſion, were all injurious to the Lord, and the fruit of infirmity; and that when we queſtioned his Love on ſuch accounts, we knew not what we ſaid. We ſhall then ſee that Death, and Grave, and Devils were all but matter for the glorifying of Grace, and for the triumph of our Lord and us.</p>
               <p>Up then my ſoul, and ſhake off thy unbelief and dulneſs: Look up, and long, and meet thy Lord. The more thou art afraid of death, the more deſire that bleſſed day, when <hi>morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:59502:94"/>
                  <hi>ſhall be ſwallowed up of life,</hi> and the name of death ſhall be terrible no more: Though death be thy enemy, there is nothing but friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the coming of thy Lord. Though death diſſolve thy nature, the Reſurrection ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, and make thee full reparation with advantage.</p>
               <p>How glad would I have been to have ſeen Chriſt, but with the Wiſe Men in the Manger! or to have ſeen him diſputing with the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in his Child-hood in the Temple; or to have ſeen him do his Miracles, or heard him Preach; much more to have ſeen him as the three Diſciples, in his transfiguration; or to have ſeen him after his Reſurrection, and when he aſcended up to Heaven. But how far is all this below the ſight that we ſhall have of him when he comes in glory! when the brightneſs of his ſhining face ſhall make us think the Sun was darkneſs: and the glory of his attendants ſhall make us think what a ſorbid thing, and childiſh foolery was all the glory of this world! The face of Love ſhall be then unvailed, and raviſh us into the higheſt Love and Joy, that our natures are capable of. Then doubt, and fear, and grieve, if thou canſt! What then wilt thou think of all theſe diſquieting, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful Thoughts that now ſo wrong thy Lord and thee? If <hi>going into the Sanctuary, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59502:94"/>
                  <hi>the end,</hi> can cure our <hi>brutiſh</hi> miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Gods providences, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 17.) how perfectly will they be cured, when we ſee the glorious face of Chriſt, and behold the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in its glory, and when we are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the <hi>Saints</hi> that <hi>judge the world?</hi> We ſhall never more be tempted then, to condemn the generation of the juſt, nor to think it vain to ſerve the Lord, nor to envy the proſperity of the wicked, nor to ſtagger at the promiſe through unbelief; nor to think that our ſickneſs, death and grave, were any ſigns of unkindneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs in God. We ſhall then be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> were unfit to cenſure the wayes of God, or to be our guides.</p>
               <p>Haſten, O Lord, this bleſſed day! Stay not till Faith have left the earth; and infidelity, and impiety, and tyranny have conquered the reſt of thine inheritance! Stay not till ſelfiſh unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pride hath vanquiſhed love and ſelf-denyal and planted its Colonies of Hereſie, confuſion and cruelty in thy dominions: and Earth and Hell be turned into one. Stay not till the eyes of thy ſervants fail, and their hearts and hopes do faint and languiſh with looking and waiting for thy ſalvation. But if yet the day be not at hand, O keep up Faith, and Hope, and Love, till the Sun of perfect Love ariſe, and Time hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared us for Eternity, and Grace for Glory.</p>

            <p>It is not the hiſtory of the Life of this precious
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59502:95"/>
ſervant of the Lord which I intend to give you: for I (was not many years acquainted with her:) but only ſome paſſages, which either upon my certain knowledge, or her own Diurnal of her courſe, or the moſt credible teſtimony of her moſt intimate ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious godly friends, I may boldly publiſh as true, and imitable in this untoward diſtempered gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>She was born <hi>Novem. 1634.</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi> near <hi>London:</hi> the only child of <hi>Mr. John Gode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchalk, alias Godſcall.</hi> Her Father dying in her Child-hood, ſhe was left an Orphane to the Chamber of <hi>London.</hi> Her Mother after married <hi>Mr. Iſaac Barton,</hi> with whom ſhe had the benefit of Religious Education. But between ſixteen and ſeventeen years of age, by the ſerious reading of the Book called <hi>The Saints Everlaſting Reſt,</hi> ſhe was more throughly awakened, and brought to ſet her heart on God, and to ſeek ſalvation with her chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt care: From that time forward ſhe was a more conſtant, diligent ſerious hearer of the ableſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in <hi>London,</hi> riſing early, and going far to hear them on the week dayes, waiting on God for his confirming grace in the uſe of thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which empty unexperienced hypocrites are eaſily tempted to deſpiſe: The Sermons which ſhe conſtantly wrote, ſhe diligently repeated at home for the benefit of others; and every week read over ſome of thoſe that ſhe had heard long before, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59502:96"/>
the fruit of them might be retained and renewed: it being not novelty that ſhe minded.</p>
            <p>In the year 1654. being near one and twenty years of age, after ſeeking God, and waiting for his reſolving ſatisfying directions, ſhe conſented to be joyned in marriage to <hi>Mr. Joſeph Baker,</hi> by the approbation of her neareſt friends: God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken away her Mother the year before. With him ſhe approved herſelf indeed ſuch a Wife as <hi>Paul</hi> (no Papiſt) deſcribeth as meet for a Biſhop or Paſtor of the Church, <hi>1 Tim. 3. 11. [Even ſo muſt their Wives be grave, not ſlanderers, ſober, faithful in all things.</hi> Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I ſhall give, for the imitation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>1. She was very exemplary in <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> and <hi>humility:</hi> And having ſaid thus much, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance have I comprehended? O what a beauty doth <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> put on ſouls! Nay what a treaſure of everlaſting conſequence do theſe two words expreſs? I ſhall give you a few of the diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>1. It appeared in her accompanying in <hi>London</hi> with the holieſt, how mean ſoever, avoiding them that were proud, and vain, and carnal: She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired moſt to be acquainted with thoſe that ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were beſt acquainted with God, neglecting the pomp and vain glory of the world.</p>
            <p>2. When ſhe was called to a married ſtate,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59502:96"/>
though her portion and other advantages invited perſons of greater eſtates in the world, She choſe rather to marry a Miniſter of known integrity, that might be a near, and conſtant guide, and ſtay and comfort to her, in the matters which ſhe valued more than riches. And ſhe miſſed not of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, for the few years that ſhe lived with him. Even in this age, when the Serpent is hiſſing in every corner at faithful Miniſters, and they are cnotemned both by Prophane and Heretical Malignants. She preferred a mean life with ſuch a one, for her ſpiritual ſafety and ſolace, before the Grandeur of the world.</p>
            <p>3. When ſome inhabitants of the City of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> were earneſt with me to help them to an able Miniſter; <hi>Mr. Baker</hi> then living in <hi>Kent</hi> had about an hundred pound <hi>per annum:</hi> and when at my motion he was readily willing to take a great charge in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> upon a promiſe from two men to make the maintenance fifty pounds a year by a voluntary Contribution, of the continuance of which he had no ſecurity; his Wife was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter, and no diſcourager of his ſelf denyal, and never tempted him to lookafter greater things. And afterward, when I was afraid leſt the ſmalneſs and uncertainty of the means, together with his diſcouragements from ſome of his people, might have occaſioned his remove; and have heard of richer places mentioned to him, as he ſtill anſwered
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59502:97"/>
that he had enough, and minded not removing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity: ſo was ſhe ever of the ſame mind, and ſtill ſeconded and confirmed him in ſuch reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, even to follow Gods work while they had a competency of their own, and to mind no more.</p>
            <p>4. Her very ſpeech and behaviour did ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt meekneſs, and humility that in a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with her it might eaſily be diſcerned.</p>
            <p>5. She thought nothing too mean for her, that belonged to her in her family and relation, no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying often, that <hi>[What God had made her duty, was not too low a work for her.]</hi> And indeed, when we know once that it is a work that God ſets us upon, it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much forgetfulneſs of him and our ſelves, if we think it too baſe, or think our ſelves too good to ſtoop to it.</p>
            <p>6. No Neighbour did ſeem too mean or poor for her familiar converſe, if they were but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>7. She had a true eſteem, and chearful love for the meaneſt of her Husbands Relations, and much rejoyced in her comfort in his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, recording it among her experienced mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>2. She was very conſtant and diligent in doing her part of family duties: teaching all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours of her family, and labouring to ſeaſon
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59502:97"/>
them with principles of holineſs, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them of their ſin and danger: never failing on the Lords Day at night to hear them read the Scriptures and recite their Catechiſms, when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick duty, and all other family duty was ended: and in her Husbands abſence praying with them. How much the imitation of ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would conduce to the ſanctifying of families, is eaſie to be apprehended?</p>
            <p>3. In ſecret duty ſhe was very conſtant, and lived much in thoſe two great ſoul-advancing works; <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Prayer:</hi> in which ſhe would not admit of interruptions. This inward holy diligence was it that maintained ſpiritual life within, which is the ſpring of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acceptable works. When communion with God, and daily labour upon our own hearts is laid aſide, or negligently and remiſly followed, grace languiſheth firſt within, and then unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, if not diſorders and ſcandals appear without.</p>
            <p>4. Her Love to the Lord Jeſus was evidenced by her great affection to his Ordinances, and Wayes, and Servants: A very hearty Love ſhe manifeſted to thoſe on whom the Image of God did appear, even the pooreſt and meaneſt, as well as the rich or eminent in the world: Nor did a difference in leſſer matters, or any tolerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, alienate her affections from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59502:98"/>5. She was a Chriſtian of much plainneſs, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity &amp; ſingleneſs of heart: far from a ſubtil eraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſſembling frame, &amp; alſo from loquacity or oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And the world was very low in her eyes to which ſhe was long crucified, and on which ſhe looked as a lifeleſs thing: Senſuality and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the fleſh, ſhe much loathed: When ſhe was invited to feaſts, ſhe would oft complain, that they occaſioned a difficulty in maintaining a ſence of the preſence of God, whoſe company in all her company, ſhe preferred.</p>
            <p>6. She was a very careful eſteemer and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of her time. At home in her family, the works of her general and particular calling took her up: When neceſſary buſineſs, and greater duties gave way, ſhe was ſeldom without a Book in her hand, or ſome edifying diſcourſe in her mouth, if there were opportunity. And abroad ſhe was very weary of barren company that ſpent the time in common chatt, and dry diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>7. She uſed good company Practically and profitably, making uſe of what ſhe heard for her own ſpiritual advantage. When I underſtood out of her Diary, that ſhe wrote down ſome of my familiar diſcourſes, with ſerious application to her ſelf, it ſtruck exceeding deep to my heart, how much I have ſinned all my dayes, ſince I undertook the perſon of a Miniſter of Chriſt, by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59502:98"/>
the ſlightneſs and unprofitableneſs of my diſcourſe; and how exceeding careful Miniſters ſhould be of their words, and how deliberately, wiſely and ſeriouſly they ſhould ſpeak about the things of God, and how diligently they ſhould take all fit opportunities to that end, when we know not how ſilent hearers are affected with what we ſay: For ought we know, there may be ſome that will write down what we ſay in their Books, or hearts, or both: And God and conſcience write down all.</p>
            <p>8. In her courſe of <hi>Reading</hi> ſhe was ſtill lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in for uſe and practiſe. Her courſe was, when ſhe read the Scriptures, to gather out paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and ſort and refer them to their ſeveral uſes, as ſome that were fit ſubjects for her Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: ſome for encouragement to prayer, and other duties: Promiſes ſuited to various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and wants, as her papers ſhew.</p>
            <p>And for other Books, ſhe would meddle with none but the ſound and practical, and had no itch after the empty Books, which make oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Novelty, and which Opinioniſts are now ſo taken with; nor did ſhe like writing or preaching in envy and ſtrife. And of good Books, ſhe choſe to read but few, and thoſe very often over, that all might be well digeſted. Which is a courſe (for private Chriſtians) that tends to avoid luxuriancy, and make them ſincere and ſolid, and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59502:99"/>9. She had the great bleſſing of a tender conſcience. She did not ſlightly paſs over ſmall ſins without penitent obſervation. Her Diary records her trouble, when cauſeleſly ſhe had neglected any Ordinance; or was hindered by Rain or ſmall occaſions: or if ſhe had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlept her ſelf, and loſt a Morning-exerciſe in <hi>London,</hi> or came too late; or if ſhe were diſtracted in ſecret duty: And if ſhe miſt of a Faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through miſ-information and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and found not her heart duly ſenſible of the loſs, that alſo ſhe recorded. So did ſhe her ſtirrings of anger, and her very angry looks, reſolving to take more heed againſt them. Though all ought not to ſpend ſo much time in writing down their failings; yet all ſhould watch, and renew repentance.</p>
            <p>10. She was very ſolicitous for the ſouls of her friends: As for inſtance, her Brothers in Law; over whom ſhe exerciſed a Motherly care, inſtructing them, and watching over them, and telling them of miſcarriages, and counſelling them: Cauſing them to keep a conſtant courſe of reading the holy Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and meditating on it (as far as ſhe could:) Cauſing them to learn many Chapters without Book: and to read other good Books in ſeaſon: Earneſtly praying for them in particular: Much deſiring one or both ſhould be Miniſters: And when her Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59502:99"/>
appointed the eldeſt to go to <hi>France,</hi> ſhe was much troubled for fear of his miſcarriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſtrangers, eſpecially thoſe of the Romiſh Way.</p>
            <p>11. She was a ſerious Mourner for the ſins of the time and place ſhe lived in.</p>
            <p>12. In ſum, for ſtrict, cloſe, watchfull, holy walking with God, even her Husband pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that ſhe was a pattern to him. As I hinted before, ſhe kept a daily acount in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, (which is now to be ſeen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year 1654.) eſpecially of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>1. Of the frame of her heart in every dayes duty; in Meditation, Prayer, Hearing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp;c. whether lively, of dull <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Of thoſe ſins which ſhe had eſpecially to repent of, and watch againſt.</p>
            <p>3. Of her Reſolutions and Promiſes, and how ſhe kept them.</p>
            <p>4. Of all ſpecial Providences to her ſelf, Husband, Brothers, and others, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. As at the death of her Son, who died with great ſighs and groans, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded her ſenſe of the ſpecial neceſſity of holy Armour, and great preparation for that encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when her turn ſhould come to be ſo removed to the everlaſting habitation.</p>
            <p>5. Of her returns of Prayer, what anſwers, and grant of them ſhe found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59502:100"/>6. Of the ſtate of her ſoul upon examination: how ſhe found it, and what was the iſſue of each examination; and in this it ſeems ſhe was very exact and punctual. In which, though many times fears and doubtings did ariſe, yet hath ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent records of the diſcovery of evidences, and comfortable aſſurance of ſincerity. Somtime when ſhe hath heard Sermons in <hi>London,</hi> that helped her in her ſearch: and ſomtimes when ſhe had been reading writings that tended that way, ſhe recorded what evidences ſhe found, and in what degree the diſcovery was: If imperfect, reſolving to take it up and follow the ſearch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And if ſhe had much joy; ſhe received it with jealouſie, and expectation of ſome humbling conſequent. When any grace languiſhed, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turned to ſome apt remedy. As for inſtance, its one of her Notes, Novemb. 1658. [<hi>I found thoughts of Eternity ſlight and ſtrange, and ordinary imployments very deſirable: at which I read Mr.</hi> Bs. Crucifixion <hi>&amp; was awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Mortification and Humiliation,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>The laſt time that ſhe had opportunity for this work, was two or three dayes before her delivery in Child-bearing; where ſhe finally recorded the apprehenſions ſhe had both of her bodily and ſpiritual State in theſe words, <hi>[Drawing near the time of my delivery, I am fallen into ſuch weakneſs, that my life is in hazzard. I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59502:100"/>
find ſome fears of death, but not very great, hoping (through grace) I die in the Lord.]</hi> I only mention theſe hints, to ſhew the Method ſhe uſed in her daily Accounts. To thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that have full leiſure, this courſe is good: But I urge it not upon all. Thoſe that have ſo great duties to take up that time, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpare ſo much to record their ordinary paſſages; Such muſt <hi>remember</hi> what others <hi>record,</hi> and daily renew repentance for their daily fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and <hi>record</hi> only the extraordinary, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, and more remarkable and memorable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of their lives, leſt they loſe time from works of greater moment. But this excellent work of <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> muſt be performed by all.</p>
            <p>And I think it was a conſiderable expreſſion of her true wiſdom, and care of her immortal ſoul, that when any extraordinary neceſſity required it, and ſhe found ſuch doubts, as of her ſelf ſhe was not able to deal with, ſhe would go to ſome able experienced Miniſter, to open her caſe, and ſeek aſſiſtance (as ſhe did more than once to my dear and ancient friend, <hi>Mr. Croſs,</hi> who in full age is ſince gone after her to Chriſt) And therefore choſe a Miniſter in Marriage, that he might be a ready aſſiſtant in ſuch caſes of neceſſity, as well as a continual help.</p>
            <p>At laſt came that death to ſummon her ſoul away to Chriſt, for which ſhe had ſo ſeriouſly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59502:101"/>
been preparing, and which ſhe oft called <hi>a dark entry to her Fathers Palace.</hi> After the death of her Children, when ſhe ſeemed to be ſomewhat repaired after her laſt delivery, a violent Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuddenly ſurprized her, which in a few dayes brought her to her end. Her underſtanding, by the fits, being at laſt debilitated, ſhe finding it ſomewhat hard to ſpeak ſenſibly, excuſed it, and ſaid, <hi>[I ſhall ere long ſpeak another lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage]</hi> Which were the laſt words which ſhe ſpake with a tongue of fleſh; and lying ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eighteen hours after, ſhe departed <hi>Auguſt 17.</hi> 1659. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea ſaith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our turn is coming: Shortly we ſhall alſo lay by fleſh: this is our day of preparation: There is no <hi>preparing</hi> time but this. Did men but know the difference between the death of the holy and the unholy, which doth not appear to fleſhly eyes, how ſpeedily would they turn! how ſeriouſly would they meditate! how fervently would they pray! how carefully would they live! how conſtantly, painfully and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly would they labour! Did they well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the difference between dying <hi>prepared</hi> and <hi>unprepared,</hi> and of what difficulty and yet everlaſting conſequence it is to die well; O then,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59502:101"/>
what manner of perſons would men be, in all manner of holy converſation and godlineſs? and all their lives would then be a continued preparation for death; as all their life is a haſting towards it.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall only deſire you, for the right underſtanding of all that I have here ſaid, and to prevent the cavils of blinded malice, to obſerve theſe three or four particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That though I knew ſo much of her as eaſily maketh me believe the reſt, upon ſo ſure a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſaw her Diary, yet the moſt of this Hiſtory of her life, is the collection and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch faithful witneſſes, as had much better opportunity than I to know the ſecrets of her ſoul and life.</p>
            <p>2. That it is no wonder if many that knew her, perceived not all this by her, that is here expreſſed: For that knowledg of our outward carriage at a diſtance, will not tell our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours what we do in our Cloſets: where God hath commanded us to ſhut our door upon us, that our Father which ſeeth in ſecret, may reward us openly. And many of the moſt humble and ſincere ſervants of the Lord, are ſo afraid of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and hate oſtentation, that their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Glory is only to be expected from the ſearcher of hearts, (and a few of their more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance:) Though this was not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59502:102"/>
the caſe before us; the example deſcribed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>3. That I over-paſs the large expeſſions of her charity, which you may hear from the poor and her intimate acquaintance, as I have done; that I may not grate upon the modeſty of her ſurviving friends, who muſt participate in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>4. That it is the benefit of the living that is my principal end; Scripture it ſelf is written much in Hiſtory, that we may have matter of imitation before our eyes.</p>
            <p>5. If any ſay, that here is no mention of her faults; I anſwer, Though I had acquaintance with her, I knew them not, nor ever heard from any other ſo much as might enable me to accuſe her, if I were her enemy. Yet I doubt not but ſhe was imperfect, and had faults, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me. The example of Holineſs I have briefly propoſed: They that would ſee examples of iniquity, may look abroad in the world, and find enough: I need not be the accuſer of the Saints to furniſh them. And I think if they enquire here of any thing notable, they will he hard put to it to find enough to cover the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers ſhame.</p>
            <p>6. It is the honour of Chriſt and Grace in his members, more than the honour of his ſervant that I ſeek.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59502:102"/>7. And I would not ſpeak that in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the living which I do of the dead who are out of the reach of all temptations, of being lifted up with pride thereby: Unleſs it be ſuch whoſe reputation the intereſt of Chriſt and the Goſpel commandeth me to vindicate.</p>
            <p>8. Laſtly, I am ſo far from lifting up one above the reſt of the members of Chriſt, by theſe commendations, and from abaſing others whoſe names I mention not, that I intend the honour of all in <hi>One,</hi> and think that in the ſubſtance I deſcribe all Saints, in deſcribing one. I am not about a Popiſh work of making a wonder of a Saint, as of a <hi>Phoenix,</hi> or ſome rare unuſual thing. Saints with them muſt be Canonized, and their names put in the Calender: and yet their blind malice tels the world, that there are no ſuch things as Saints among us. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the many that I have communion with, and the many that have lately ſtept before me into Heaven, and are ſafe there out of the reach of malice, and of ſin, and all the enemies of their peace; and have left me mourning, and yet rejoycing; fearing, and yet hoping; and with ſome deſires, looking after them here behind: And the faſter Chriſt calls away his choſen ones, whoſe graces were amiable in mine eyes, the more willing he maketh me to follow them, and to leave this world of darkneſs, confuſion,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59502:103"/>
wickedneſs, danger, vanity and vexation, and to meet theſe precious ſouls in Life, where we ſhall rejoyce that we are paſt this howling wilderneſs, and ſhall for ever be with the Lord.</p>
