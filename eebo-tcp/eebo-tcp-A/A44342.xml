            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you must <hi>suffer the words of Exhortation,</hi> (as the Apostle sayes) <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 22. So likewise suffer the words of Conviction, of Reproof, of Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hold and keep your hearts under the Word, that you may be wrought upon thereby. And as when men have set Carpenters a work to build an House, then they come every day, and ask them, How doth the work go on? How doth the building go forward? When you are gone home, do you so reason with your selves, and ask your own hearts how the work of the Lord goes forward in you? Is my heart yet humbled? Am I yet fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Christ? I thank God I find some work and power of the Word, and therefore I hope the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will go forward.</p>

Why? Because all that while a man is in the way: Mercy may meet with him, and he may meet with it: While there is life, there is hope (unless a man have sinned against the holy Ghost) Physitians observe all the while there is strength in Nature, there is hope the Physick may prove profitable; It is much more for the comfort of the Soul, while there is life, there is yet a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Thy heart is stubborn, and rebellious, and proud; but thou yet livest, and the Lord lives, and his Mercy lives, therefore it may be he may shew mercy to thee: But when a man is dropped down into the grave, and the pit hath shut its mouth upon<note place="margin">Psa. 146</note> him, then <hi>all his thoughts perish,</hi> then with a sad heart he may remember all the helps he had, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> he had, but never had a heart to get any good by them: Then he reads over all the Sermons he heard, by the flames of Hell; and remembers all the kindnesses of the Lord, and then there is no hope.</p>
                        <p>You therefore that know your bosom abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you have your back doors, and your base haunts; you know your sins are not pardoned, you have not repented of them; when you are gone home, go your waies, and bless God that you live: For, let me tell you, This is all the hope in the world that yet you are alive, and therefore the Lord may shew Mercy to you; if your dayes were ended, and

Not Bears, but Sins and Devils are upon you, they have you in their clutches, tearing and devouring your Souls: Oh look to Heaven, and cry out unto the Lord, and say, Lord, a proud stubborn Creature, but yet I am alive, the Devil is Devouring my soul, but Lord, help me and deliver me, yet I am alive; bless God you are so, and know its all you have to shew for your everlasting welfare.

Why Consider, Art thou sure of a better life? They will Answer, No, thats my misery, I see all my sins before me, and Hell gaping for me, and the Devils attending to seize upon my Soul, and it makes me weary of my life. Weary of your life!

                     <p>For the two first being apprehended in the full breadth of them, the necessity and mysterious depth of Gods Dispensation in the last will appear with greater Evidence, and be more easily conceived, and assented unto with greater readiness.</p>
                     <p>For the ground of the first Point we have chosen the words of this Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. where we have the divers, nay, the contrary judgment of the Lord, and the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> touching their spiritual estate and condition; They fate down well apayed in the apprehension, nay the admiration of their own happiness, and professed they had as much as they needed, and were as good as they desired to be: When as the Lord who knew better, and could judg better of their condition, passeth a peremptory sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the contrary, that they were <hi>wretched, poor, and blind, and naked;</hi> they wanted not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wretchedness or misery, but wanted sence of either, and that was the reason they were secure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both.</p>
                     <p>Here then we see the guise of a graceless heart, of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

soul: They need nothing in their own apprehension though indeed they have nothing; they see no evil nor danger towards them, though they be compassed and beset on every side with sins and plagues: Men naturally are most secure in their sins, when they are most under the power and plague of them; see how well apaid they sit down in the present frame of their hearts (for it's spiritually meant as appears by the opposition, in the counsel which is administred in the following verse, <hi>I counsel thee to buy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>These are the Grounds why a sinful Heart settles it self in security, and blesseth it self, though nothing belongs to him but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may see the Reason why sharp and<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> soul-saving Preaching, seems so greivous and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the carnal hearts of wicked and natural men; they hardly vouchsafe audience, but not acceptance: Whats the cause? It would awaken them out of their sleepy security in which they lye: To bring a Candle to a sleepy man is unpleasing but to pluck off the Clothes, he will hardly bear it, but will let flie at you: Why will you not suffer a man to be quiet in his bed? &amp;c. All men are naturally in a dead sleep of sin, therefore to bring the Candle of the Law to them, to shew them their condition, to pluck away all their coverings and hidings that they may see their sins and themselves as they are, it is death to a man in this case: Plain dealing and rough dealing evermore finds harsh entertainment here: still Musick is pliasing and rocks men asleep; but sound blows will awaken men, and not suffer them to sleep in their sins, and therefore they cannot bear them; they have <hi>itching ears</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>heaping up Teachers to themselves after their own lusts, and therefore they cannot endure sound doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 3. Such Ministers, and such Preaching as answer their desires and please their pallats, that they and their sins and all may go to Heaven together, this they like very well of: Itching ears must be scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not buffeted. You know what he said to <hi>Elias, Art thou he that troubles Israel? And hast thou

                     <p>Hence again, We should be perswaded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> its the heaviest plague that can befal a man, That God should suffer him to sleep in his sins and prosper in a wicked Course: Because it argues (for ought any man knows) that God intends no good to him, nor will work no good for him; but as if the Lord hath left such a one to be a prey to sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; he is in the hands of his lusts, and become a spoil unto them; Jesus Christ passeth by him (as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

hath, and the greatest Enemy he hath, is his own Heart and Will. It follows thus, It is that which maintains al the sinful distempers of his soul, it keeps the whole Army of Corruptions al in their Ranks, that Victuals them, and provides for them, that hinders a man from using the means, or from getting good by al the means of Grace: Its the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt wil of a man that keeps him under the power of his sinne, and keeps off the power of an Ordinance, that would procure his everlasting good. I speak it the rather to dash that dream of wickedmen, when they do ill, and speak ill; yet (say they) my heart is good. Its true, I cannot speak so wel, nor do so wel, nor make such a shew as others can, but my desires are good. No truly, If thy Life be naught, thy Heart is worse.

Nay, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of the Heart is above al; the masterful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Heart is beyond al that we can conceive: A man may discern a mans life, and perceive what is there sutable, or cross to the Will of God; <hi>but the heart is desperate decentful, who can know it?

which the Apostle <hi>James</hi> speaks of the tongue, That <hi>it is an unruly evil ful of deadly poyson, none can tame it,</hi> Jam. 3. 8. It is much more true of the heart, for whatever wickednes is ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the tongue, its first in the heart; and its there much more: men may gag a mans mouth, and fetter his hands and feet, but Oh the corrupt will of man, who can restrain that? The truth is, it wil stand out against al Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Arguments, and nothing can move the wil except God work upon it. As they said, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 19. When <hi>Samuel</hi> gave them Reasons against Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; they say not, Your Reasons are not good, we wil Answer them, and bring better Reasons for what we desire; No, <hi>but we will have a King.</hi> And as the Lord saies to the House of Israel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye from your evil wayes, why will you die?</hi> Give me the reason of it: It is not my wil you should die, I forbid it; its not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to reason, that gain-say it; its not agreeable to nature that abhors it, to have your sins, and to have the plagues of them for ever: nay, but we wil have our sins whatever come of it.

                        <item>2 That he was wholly unwilling to be severed therefrom. That it is a Death to him to be awakened out of this dead sleep when he saw no danger, nor feared any; but pleased himself in his Dreams and deluded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <item>3 The Third and last Point now comes to skan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Consideration, wherein indeed the Pith and Marrow of this so deep and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58768:191"/>
mysterious a Dispensation of the Lord upon the Soul discovers it self; The Two former only made way for the more plain Explication of this last, and the more easie Apprehension of it by those who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to understand. Namely,</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>That by a holy kind of violence he is driven out of his sin, and Drawn unto Christ by God the Father, notwithstanding al the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And for the foundation of our following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course we have chosen these words, which out of the very Scope of the place and intendment of our Savior, present to our view the former Point, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Before I come to handle this Point, this I would Premise by way of Preface, That I purpose to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle both these together; both, plucking from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Drawing to Beleeve, for they are both performed by the same Action, or Motion; and therefore its most fit as they be in Nature together, so we should discover them together.

                     <p>The Lord not only offers it freely that we might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be encouraged: but heartily intends it; yea, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats it earnestly that indeed we might be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without gain-saying to yeild. He not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the sinner to come, but if he go away, Mercy pursues him; if yet he seems to withdraw himself, Mercy laies hold on him, wil not leave him, but weeps over him, kneels down before him, and begs importunately at his hands his own reconciliation with the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.

                     <p>This makes the bowels of a sinner to rowl with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him and drives him to a stand, and almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our unkind natures: What! A King to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat a Traytor to be pardoned; the Judge a Theif to be acquitted; a Conqueror fal at the foot of a Captive and his Prisoner, and desire him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. I hat God, the great God of heaven and earth who was offended by us, who hath no need of us, who was infinitely happy in himself without us who might with the breath of his nostrils for ever confound us, and that justly; why it had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and enough a Conscience, but to admit such accursed dust and ashes into his presence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It had been a high favor and mercy to have given him leave to have begged mercy, though he had never granted it. But to hear me when I cal and cry, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to favor when I come, that is as much as could be desired. But that God should stoop to man, heaven to earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

by me, had no need of me, was happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me, and might have honored the name of his Justice in my everlasting confusion, not only to hear me and receive me when I come, but to send after me, but to beseech a damned forlorn Creature to be pardoned. This is the wonder of Mercy more than I could have conceived, durst have begged, yea I should have conceived it unreasonable to have desired it, nor could I have thought it, but that the Lord hath said it and done it. His wil be done, and blessed be his holy name for ever. Oh that I should live to hear of this Mercy, but wretch that I am if I should out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the offer of it, or not entertain it. I need not question, that the Lord is serious and heartily wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have the tender of his Grace entertained, and my self for ever comforted therein and thereby. Why he takes his Oath, not that he can change, but that he would have me be settledly assured thereof. <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death of a sinner but rather that he should repent and live,</hi> Ezek. 33. 11. If God do not desire my death but my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Why should I desire my own death? so that the heart of a sinner could almost be content to give way, but yet his loose domineering lusts wil not give leave.</p>
                     <p>If yet the sinner wil not come away but staies stil,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and clings to his darling lusts, the Lord leaves the Record of these his kindnesses upon his heart, and stil out of his long sufferance waits for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and repentance, puts him in mind, and lies pulling at him with these cords of his Compassions. Isa. 30. 18. <hi>He waits to be gracious:</hi> He takes fresh and renewed throws of Patience and travels as it were in expectation of the return of a sinner, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. last. <hi>Oh Jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean? when will it once be?</hi> As a Woman in travel, Oh

Let this day be the last day of sinning, of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zying in a Christian course, of carnal formality, let this time, this night be the last night of provocation &amp; unprofitableness under al the priviledges &amp; means of Grace you enjoy: Once at last let that proud heart be humbled, that peevish Spirit meekned, those covetous desires, unclean affections be changed: when wil it once be?

                     <p>The Lord proclaims his Mercy openly, freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it, heartily intends it, waits to communicate it, layes siege to the Soul by his long sufferance: There is enough to procure al good, distrust it not: He freely invites, fear it not, thou mayest be bold to go: he intends it heartily, question it not: yet he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But if these limetwigs of Love cannot catch you,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> these Cords of Mercy cannot hold you, he hath iron Chains which wil either pluck you from your evil wayes, or they wil pul you al in pieces. The Third Means (therefore) by which the Lord Draws, is the Cord of Conscience: If the Bonds of a man and of kindness wil not prevail with us, the iron Hook of Conscience wil drag us with a witness to forsake our beloved lusts, to come to the Lord to be ruled and to be saved. Now the Hooks whereby Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence holds us are Three principally, whereby it tears the heart away from those wretched distempers, and holds the sou! from under the power of such base Corruptions which have taken greater place, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised greater power over it.</p>
                     <p>God stirs up Conscience, and arms it with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for the stilling and settling of such unruly distempers which heretofore have refused his power and neglected his law, and so took much place in the Soul, and carried lt to the Commission of much evil against the mind of Conscience. So that whereas Conscience was kept under before by reason of the Mutinies and Conspiricies of many Corruptions in the heart; and was blinded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, and benummed with the violence and unruly rage of many wretched lusts, so that either it did not see, what was to be done, or could not be heard in what it would speak, at least was utterly unable to prevail. The Lord now hath awakened Conscience, and put that Life, Vertue, and Authority into it: That now Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence begins a fresh to take upon him, and to shew his Soveraignty and Rule; he wil not take it as he hath
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:58768:199"/>

                        </gap> Charge, and Edicts, not to be contradicted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled upon the pain of the severest punishments.</p>
                     <p>This is the first work of Conscience to be a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warner, and to admonish the soul of evil, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise a severe Charge, and give uncontroulable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands against sin: So that Corruption comes to be snubbed and checked, and the soul kept in aw under him which it scorned before. It fares in this case with Conscience as with an High Sheriff, or some special Officer of note in the Country, in the absence of the King, while he is gone aside there ariseth a Mutiny and Tumult of unruly persons, which tear his Commission, withstand his proceedings, and offer in an outragious manner to lay violent hands upon his Person; so that as he can do nothing, so he dares shew little distaste, but express no strong opposition against them, as not having power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to surprise and crush them in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The act of sin only in the one is hindred; the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of sin in the other is subdued, the one curbs and confines the corrupt Nature, as a Fox in a chain, a Wolf in a grinn, they have the same Nature still, but they have not the same liberty to put forth their ravenous desires and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I Answer Three Things.</p>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. For it is al one as to say. We should do a thing out of our inward inclination, and not out of our inward inclination: A Cause acting by Counsel, should be a Cause acting by necessity, one Contrary should be another.</p>

Its impossible that while a thing acts by his own inward inclination, it should by outward force act against its inclination, though its possible and reasonable that the Lord cross both, yea, destroy both act, and inclination and al, as he wil.

And hence it is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Not having mine own Righteousness, but that which is of God in Christ:</hi> Therefore not in us properly.

Is it not enough that I understand this, and thereby be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to follow it? The Apostle answers, No: <hi>It was impossible</hi> for the Law to enable a man to walk after the Spirit, and to be free from the Law of sin, for so the Causal [<hi>For</hi>] knits this Verse as a proof of the former, not because <hi>the Law</hi> was faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but because <hi>our Flesh,</hi> our natures were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,

                     <p>That which is done by a Holy kind of Violence against the natural inclination of the heart, that must needs be done upon us, but not by us; we have no hand in that work, and so it is here as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Let me ad Two or Three Reasons more besides the Evidence of the Rule from whence it is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately deduced.</p>
                     <p>Here that Weapon comes first to hand which<note place="margin">Reas. 1</note> some of the Ancients have so often used in this Cause, and its the Canon of the Apostle, and that Staple Principle that cannot be gain-said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>It is not in him that willeth, or in him that runneth, but in God that shews Mercy.</hi> Where al other hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Causes that may share in the Conversion and bringing home of the sinner, are wholly denied &amp; cast out, though they were Means of special improvment, that if any thing might seem to further it, they might have been of peculiar use, and of a speeding nature. It was not a sleepy, careless, slighting of the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any spiritual good, or a sloathful attendance upon it, nor is it a kind of heartless, and spiritless Affection to it that are here rejected, nay though his will was there, and the strength of endeavor, yet both miss the mark; The Apostle is Plain and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, Let him set Heart, and Feet, and Hand, and Head on work, he shal never do no good on it, it is not there. Its meerly only <hi>in him that shews Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was wont to be Answered by the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that it is so said, That its not in him that Runs, or Wills, without Mercy pittying of him, and Grace assisting of him, he cannot do it without these, let him do what he can; yet he can do it with these. The vanity of which Answer hath been long since disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as that it crosseth and corrupteth the very mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apostle. For then the meaning upon
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:58768:223"/>
the self same grounds would here be thus, As it is not in him that Wills and Runs without God assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, co-working; so you might turn the tables: Its not in God that shewes Mercy without him that Wills and Runs. For if the words be not a plain &amp; peremptory denial, but only comparatively to be taken, Its not so much, or not in his willing and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without Mercy prevailing and helping, yet they concur as Causes in this work; then may they as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> be taken the other way: Its not in God that shews Mercy only and wholly, but in him that wills and runs in part, which is to destroy the text, and to cross the intendment of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>That Dispensation of God which gives ability and<note place="margin">

                           </gap>. 2</note> a Principle to the will for to work that act and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation must be before the ability of the will and act of it, and so cannot be caused by it. As if God put a soul into those dead dry bones in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. that they might live, this putting in of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> whence comes life, is before, and so without the work of the soul, or life also; and not at al caused by either. But this Preparation and pulling away from sin, is to make way for a spiritual ability to be given to the will for to work, and therefore it is before the will and work, and either of them as any cause. So the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 20. <hi>He hath given us a mind to know him and his Christ.</hi> Not only drawn out this act of Knowledge, but given a mind also to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us hereunto. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This is to be Observed against a wretched Shift and cursed Cavil of the Jesuits; when they would
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:58768:223"/>
pretended to give way to the Grace of God; and yet in truth take away what they give: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they yeild freely and fully, That <hi>it is God who gives both the will and the deed.</hi> And Grace is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of necessity unto both, and neither can be without it; nor will nor deed. But in truth this is nothing but a colour of words, when the sense which they follow sounds quite contrary. For ask but their meaning, and when they have opened themselves, al comes to thus much; That the Lord hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and a co-working in the Will and Deed, and sends forth an influence into the act of the Will, and of the work done: and leads forth and guides both unto their end. And this is no more than he doth with the act of any Creature; the first cause concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the second: <hi>For in him it is that we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> As it is with Two men that draw a Boat or a Ship together, each man hath a principle and power of his own whereby he draws, but both these meet, and concur, and co-work together, in the drawing. So that al this that is said is but indeed to darken and delude the Truth; yea, and to destroy the work of Gods Grace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Reader. For this gives no more to the work of Gods Grace in Conversion, than it doth to the Act of Providence upon, and with the act of any Creature reasonable.</p>
                     <p>Whereas this must be observed carefully, and for ever maintained as the everlasting Truth of God, That the Lord gives a power spiritual to the work, which it had not before he Concurs with the act of that power when it is put forth, he gives him a being in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As it is with the Sons of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in the<note place="margin">Reas. 3</note> work of their Generation naturally, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and turning aside their souls from the Lord: So it is with the Sons of the second <hi>Adam</hi> in their spiritual Regeneration and Conversion.

But this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth so. For it makes it in the power of mans will to frustrate and over-power al the Means which are provided, and the operations of the Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soul, For, for al these, the soul may not be Converted.

                     <p>This Delusion is exceedingly derogatory to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Glory of God, deprives God of that Praise and Thanksgiving which is due unto his Name; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, a Reprobate wretch who shal perish for ever in the bottomless pit, stands as much bound to God for his Grace and Bounty as he that is saved. For they were al equal in the Means provided, in the operation of the Spirit, and the offers tendered for good; had the one the Ordinance, the other had so to.

                     <p>But the Saints when they come <hi>to acknowledge the Son of God;</hi> at the meeting of al the Churches they do profess the contrary; It was not their prayers, their tears, nor hearing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>It was not any ability, or parts natural that could do it: for they see the spawn of al sin in their hearts, and had certainly had the strength of al distempers in their Lives, that they are not in the dungeon with Witches, upon the chain with Malefactors, they cannot thank their good nature for it. Nay it was not in al the means though spiritual and powerful, the Ministers they shewed the way, they set forth the glorious things of God and Grace, but it was not that which did it, but it was only in God that shewed mercy, meerly, only, wholly, out of the free mercy of the Lord.<note place="margin">Coll. 3.</note>

Therefore no Power, nor Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our Will, carried by any Congruity of any helps, doth or can procure it.</p>

But the former is true as hath been abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

before; Therefore the latter also.</p>
                     <p>Nor do they, or can they by this pretence prevent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the former Absurdity, as Resolving the Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sinner, upon the Freedom of the Will.</p>
                     <p>For they themselves Confess, as you heard in the Explication of the Cause, That this perswasion of the Lord put forth in this Congruity and suitablness of al the Circumstances; It leaves the Will still at his liberty and indifferency, as the Masters and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of this Opinion do profess: whence I Reason thus,</p>
                     <p>If it be left in the power of the Will, either to Receive or Refuse this Congruous perswasion, then is it in the power of the Will still, whether the act of Conversion shal follow or not; then is the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and success of the work of the Means and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit resolved lastly into a mans Will.

of their Rebellions, that they might indeed Confess it, and al the world see it: It is not the suitableness of our Disposition which God needs to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by, but the Almighty and Al-sufficient efficacy of his Grace is such, That he doth what he Will, when our wills most oppose, and in reason there is least probability and possibility in the work of Causes to attain this effect.

there is a Concurrence of al Moral Causes which by the rule of Providence the Lord hath appointed, all those that he hath fitted and proportioned both to the nature of the soul, and the nature of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual work needful for it; such whom he hath so far breathed upon and wrought withal, that there is a taste of al the saving work of God left upon the soul, only the truth and reality of the work is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For certain it is when al the Means that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed are attended and used, also in the order and manner he hath appointed, neither more help, nor more Congruity can be desired, nor yet attained; for if there be any other Means which God hath not appointed, those wil prove hinderances not helps; or if they be used in any other Order than that he hath ordained, these are disorderly perverted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, and made unserviceable to do their work, or attain their end. And yet when the power of al these is improved to affect the Will, and stir and provoke it, but not change it, it is never savingly brought home to God.

                        <q>Where ever there is Sufficiency of exciting and preventing Grace, put forth by the Lord, for the Drawing, and Converting of the Sinner; there is also the Efficacy of that Grace which never fails to attain suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, We shal Open this Collection, That
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:58768:234"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ful meaning may fairly and plainly be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We shal shew how it follows evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the former Doctrine, as that the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be granted, but the other must needs be yeilded.</p>
                     <p>For the understanding of the Collection, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Three Things.</p>
                     <p>That this Exciting or Preventing Grace of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is not any Habit, or gracious Disposition imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Soul, wherby it was in power or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility to act or not to act, as it seems good and suits best with its own purpose. For Example sake, In those Actions wherein men are Causes by Counsel, they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and power to put forth such an action, or with-hold the doing of it as they see fit. A man hath a power to go hither or thither, to speak these or those words, yet he may sit still, and stop his motion, he may be mute, and silence his words. But as we heard before, It is the motion or actual impression of the work of the Spirit, so that God is not purposing and decreeing within himself, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his purpose into a powerful Execution, and so comes under such words to be deciphered, as Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Teaching, Turning; al which shew an actual Expression of Gods power and pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Sufficiency of any Cause or Causes is to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> either absolutely in regard of the End at which they look, and then that is absolutely sufficient which can attain his End without any other; if any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances it can remove, if any wants it can supply, if any thing to be done, it can procure it, accomplish it; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> And thuse some Causes may be sufficient for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of one Effect, which are not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.

And withal Satan tells him the date of Mercy is past, your best dayes are done, you have had Means, and Mercies, and Friends to Counsel you; very good, now Mercy is gone and

Oh! sayes the soul, Is there no hope in Jesus Christ, the Means of Grace, and the Spirit of God?

from his sins unto himself, and his Christ. This hath been dispatched already in the former Discourse.</p>
                     <p>The Second now follows: And that is the Frame and Disposition which is wrought in the Hearts of such as the Lord hath purposed to save, and to whom he hath dispensed himself in that gracious Work of his.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Contrition,</item>
                        <item>Humiliation.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>This Disposition consists especially in Two Things</p>
                     <p>That so I may follow the Phrase of Scripture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lords own Words in the Text, where the Lord saith, that he dwels with him that is <hi>of an humble and contrite Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To omit al manner of Coherence, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we will pass all the other Specials in the Verse, and point at that Particular which will suit our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and may afford ground to the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that we may go no further than we see the Pillar of Fire, the Lord in his Truth to go before us. We shal fasten then upon the last words only, as those that fit our Intendment.</p>
                     <p>To make way for our selves in short, there is one word alone to be opened, that so the Point may be better fitted for our Application; we must know what it is <hi>to dwel,</hi> or how <hi>God</hi> is said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>dwell in a contrite and humble heart?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Answer, To Dwell implies Three Things.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">First, That the Lord owns such as those in whom he hath an especial interest, and claims a special propriety, as though he left all the rest of man-kind to lie wast as a Common, that the World, and the Devil, and Sin may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and use at their pleasure, reserving the Honor of his Justice, which by a strong hand he will exact as a Tribute due to himself out of all things in Heaven and Earth, and Hell and all; but persons whom he thus fits, he reserves for his own special Improvement. As Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Persons of place and quality, do lease out, and let
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58768:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some Forrests and Commons to the Inhabitants border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereabout, reserving some acknowledgment of Fealty and Royalty to themselves, but the choyce and best Pallaces or Granges of greatest worth, and profit, they reserve for their own peculiar to inhabit in. So here, the Lord leaseth out the World, and the wicked in it to the Devil and his Angels, and Instruments, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Royalty and Prerogative to himself, as that he will have his Homage and Acknowledgment of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon himself; but his broken-hearted ones are his own for his own Improvement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8, 9. <hi>When the most High divided to the Nations their Inheritance. and separated the sons of</hi> Adam, <hi>he set the bounds of his People according to the number of the Children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, for the Lords Portion is his People Israel, the Lot of his Inheritance: Ye are the Temple of the Living God;</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. Yea, to them the Lord himself saies, <hi>Ye are my People, and they shall say, thou art my God,</hi> Zach. 13. last. Therefore he professeth, that though in the course of his Providence he goes on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress over all the world, yet he takes up his dwelling and abode amongst his own People. For,</p>
                     <p n="2">Secondly, Where a man dwels, as he owns the house,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so he takes up his abode there, it is the place of his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; we say any may know where to seek men, or where to find them, at home, at their own house: That's the difference between Inning and Dwelling; we Inn at a place in our passing by, when we take repast only, and bait, but depart presently, intending not to stay; but where we dwel, we settle our abode, we take up our stand there, and stir no further. So the Lord is said then to dwel in the Soul, when he vouchsafes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant expression of his peculiar presence and assistance to the soul. True it is that the Lord fills Heaven and Earth with his presence, yea, the Heaven of Heavens is not able to contain him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. His infinite Being is every where, and one and the same every where in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58768:260"/>
of himself; because his being is most simple, and not subject to any shadow of change, being all one with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Yet he is said to take up his abode in a special manner, when he doth put forth the peculiar expression of his Work; as in Heaven he dwels, because he puts forth the constant expression of his Glory, and that in the full brightness of it without any alteration and change. Here in this Spiritual Temple, the Souls of his Saints, he puts forth the peculiar expression of the constant assistance of his blessed Spirit. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall send you another Comforter, who shall abide with you for ever,</hi> John 14. 16. 1 Joh. 2. 23. <hi>Ye have received an anointing which abideth in you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dwelling, if it be attributed to the chiefest Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and Owner of the House, it implies also the ruling and ordering of the occasions that come under hand there, the exercising of the Government of the house and family where the Owner is, and dwels. He that lodgeth at a House as a stranger, comes to an Inn as a Passenger, he takes what he finds, hath what he can receive of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and courtesie; but the Owner is the Commander of the House where he dwels, and the orderer of all the Affairs that appertain thereunto. So doth the Lord with a broken Heart. Thus we are said to <hi>live in the Spirit, and to walk in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 25. And it's that which follows by Inference upon this ground, <hi>John</hi> 15. 4. 5. <hi>If I abide in you, and you abide in me, you shal bring forth much fruit;</hi> and therefore its added also in this place, that the Lord dwels in the contrite and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart <hi>to receive the Spirit</hi> of the contrite ones, they yeeld themselves to be acted by him, and they shall be acted and quickened by him to Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>So that the full meaning is, The contrite and humble heart is such to whom the Lord vouchsafes acceptance, special presence and abode, and peculiar guidance; he owns him, abides with him, and rules in him for ever.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58768:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>True, it is said Christ dwels in our Hearts by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and as many as beleeve in him, they receive him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. That is done as by the next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand, by which we say hold on Christ, and give entertainment to him; but unless the heart be broken and humbled, we cannot receive Faith, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ. <hi>And while the soul is thus breaking and humbling, Faith also is coming</hi> in a right sense, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood; whereof we shal speak somwhat large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Lord give us leave to come to that place.</p>
                     <p>The Words thus opened, the Point is the very letter of the Text, which looks full upon every Hearer or Reader that will look upon the Text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Heart must be broken and humbled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Doct.</note> the Lord will own it as His, take up his abode with it, and rule in it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There must be Contrition and Humiliation before the Lord comes to take possession; the House must be aired and fitted before it comes to be inhabited, swept by brokenness and emptiness of Spirit, before the Lord will come to set up his abode in it. This was typified in the passage of the Children of Israel towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Land; they must come into, and go through a vast and a roaring Wilderness, where they must be bruised with many pressures, humbled under many over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing difficulties, they were to meet withal before they could possess that good Land which abounded with all prosperity, flowed with Milk and Honey. The Truth of this Type, the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> explains, and expresseth at large in the Lords dealing with his People in regard of their Spiritual Condition, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 14, 15. I <hi>will lead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58768:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for a door of hope;</hi> the story you may recal out of <hi>Jos.</hi> 7. 28. when <hi>Achan</hi> had offended in the execrable thing, and the hearts of the Israelites were discomfited and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, like water spilt upon the ground, because they had caused the Lord to depart away from them, the Text saies, they having found out the offender by lot, they stoned him, and they said thou hast troubled Israel, we will trouble thee, and they called it <hi>the Valley of Achor,</hi> and after that God supported their hearts with hope, and encouraged them with success, both in prevailing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Enemies, and in possessing the Land. So it shall be Spiritually, the Valley of Consternation, perplexity of Spirit, and brokenness of heart, is the very gale and entrance of any sound hope, and assured expectation of good. This I take to be the true meaning and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the place, and part of the description of a good Hearer, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Who with an honest and good heart receives the Word, and keeps it,</hi> by strong hand, <hi>and brings forth fruit with patience;</hi> the fruit is Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Patience is part of Sanctification, and the holy disposition of heart, that must be in the heart, that brings and bears such fruit, that which makes the heart good is Faith in Vocation, which enables the soul to lay hold upon Christ in the Word, and from him to receive that lively vertue of Patience, and readiness to every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word and work. And <hi>an honest heart is a contrite and humble heart,</hi> so rightly prepared that Faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and the soul thereby carried unto Christ, and quickened with patience to persevere in good Duties. As we say of Grounds before we cast in Seed; there is two things to be attended there, It must be a fit ground, and a fat ground; the ground is fit when the weeds and green sword are plowed up, and the soyl there, and made mould: And this is done in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; then it must be a fat ground, the soyl must have heart, we say the ground is plowed well, and lies well, but it's worn out, it's out of heart: Now Faith
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58768:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fats the soyl, furnisheth the soul with ability to fasten upon Christ, and so to receive the Seed of the Word, and the Graces of Sanctification, and thence it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in Obedience: Upon this condition Gods favor is promised, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that be of a contrite spirit, and saveth them that be of a broken heart.</hi> Isay 61. 3. <hi>He gives the Garment of praise to those that have had the spirit of heaviness;</hi> it will suit none, fit none, it's prepared for none but such, it's their Livery only. Upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it is obtained, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Unless ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye can in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> 2 Chron. 33. 12. It's said of <hi>Mannasseh, he humbled himself greatly,</hi> and made supplication, and the Lord <hi>was intreated of him;</hi> such persons and services are highly accepted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 17. <hi>A broken and contrite heart O God, thou wilt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise,</hi> nay, he wil undoubtedly accept of it.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons of the Point are taken, partly in regard of the heart, which without these will neither be fitted nor enabled to act upon God in Christ for any good; partly in regard of God, all his Ordinances and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations will be unprofitable, and unable to do that good which he intends, and we need.</p>

Each man sits down willingly, well apaid with his own estate and portion, sees no need of any change, and therefore not willing to hear of it. Each

Contrition loosens a man from his sin, makes him see an absolute necessity to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, or else he is a damned man. Humiliation loosens a man from himself, makes him see an utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency in what he hath or doth, for to procure the least spiritual relief unto his soul; now the Coast is cleer, that Faith may come to us, and we by that be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to come to Christ.</p>

                        <q>Contrition is that Preparative Disposition of Heart, when by the sight of sin, and the punishment due to the same, the soul is brought to sound sorrow for it, and so brought to detest it, and to sequester it self from it.</q>

                     <p>And here I desire that still may be remembred which I mentioned and discovered before, That all these are things rather wrought upon us by the impression and motion of the Spirit, than performed by any inward principle, and habitual power of Grace received, and this the manner of the expressions in the words of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription plainly intimates; <hi>the soul brought to</hi> see his sins, <hi>brought</hi> to forrow for them, <hi>brought</hi> to detest them, and sequester it self from them: For the sinner would not look upon the loathsomness of his soul, and the filth of his sinful distempers, but the Lord laies it before him, and holds his apprehension to it, follows him with the remembrance of it, and forceth his thoughts to give attendance thereunto. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 3. <hi>My sin is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before me;</hi> which way soever he turns his thoughts, his sins stared him in the face, and were full in his view; they dwelt with him, and were dayly in his presence, that where ever he was, they were, he could not look off from them, look which way he would.</p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58768:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p n="2">2. The sinner would shake off the sorrow that now seizeth upon him, and seems to overbear him like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty stream, he labors to beat back the blow, and to make an escape from under the stroke of the Truth that stabs and wounds his heart, with the direful expression of Gods displeasure, and dreadfulness of the evil that doth attend him; but he can neither avoid it, nor remove it, neither keep himself from the wound, nor cure it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. <hi>Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, that I cannot look up:</hi> a similitude taken from the Prey that flies from the Pursuer, though he would have fled from the terrors of the Almighty, wrested and rescued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from under the attachment, yet they overtake him, and take such hold of him that he cannot escape: <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 2. Thine Arrows stick fast in me, and thine hand presseth me sore; he would have plucked out the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Gods indignation, but his skil and strength fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, he could not be eased, they could not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him: until at length, the soul feeling the wrath of the Almighty, and seeing no way to avoid an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting separation from the Lord, if yet his sins be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him, being thus pressed by the power of that undeniable Truth, which laies open the loathsomness of his sin, and makes him feel the bitterness thereof, he is carried with detestation against it, and driven to make a sequestration from it.

for it's beyond question, that thousands do, and many there did hear those savory Truths seasonably dispensed by <hi>Peter,</hi> which were never either throughly convinced, nor had their hearts in any manner affected therewith; the meaning therefore must needs be this, When by their hearing they rightly discerned, and cleerly conceived those things, <hi>i. e.</hi> the nature of those sins, which <hi>Peter</hi> had discovered and charged so punctually upon them; <hi>Let all the House of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ.</hi> When they so heard that they yielded and assented fully to that which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But this sin of despair sinks a mans heart and comforts as a stone flung into the midst of the Sea, carries a man beyond the ken and compass of the boundless favor and compassions of the Lord.

There was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, wisdom, and goodness put forth in making a World of nothing, adorned and enriched with such beauty and goodness, which each man may see in the frame thereof: but in the plotting and performing the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58768:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great Work of Redemption, there was wisdom beyond all the wisdom in the Work of the Creation; power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond and above all that power; God said, let there be a World, and it was so: but saying will not serve the turn here, it must be the sending of his own Son, the death and suffering of Jesus Christ, it must cost him his life before lost man could be restored to life again; here was Mercy above all the former Bounty and Goodness; that goodness then vouchsafed continued not with man, nor he in it; but this is everlasting mercy, which doth not only put us into the possession of Grace and Glory, but keeps us there in despight of all the power and policy of Devils, all the treachery and weakness of our own hearts; despair casts the Crown of all his Power, and Wisdom, Truth, and Faithfulness down unto the dust, and proclaims to all the world, in our apprehension, our weakness is beyond his power, it cannot support us, our folly too hard for his wisdom, it cannot lead and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our minds, our misery and sins surpasseth the vertue of his mercy, it cannot help and relieve us.</p>
                     <p>This is the reason why the Lord cannot endure the least appearance of these desperate pangs, as deeply inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Honor of his Name, and that in the greatest Excellency, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 27. <hi>Why saiest thou</hi> O Jacob, <hi>and speakest thou O Israel, my way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is passed over of my God?</hi> Let no more such words be heard, the Lord cannot endure to hear you speak so, or to have you think so; you cast the most vile unsufferable indignity upon the Lord that may be. You drooping discouraged hearts, you think it is the loathsomness of your own sins, the vileness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness of your own persons that you look at in all those dreadful complaints you make. Is there water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Sea to clense this sink of hellish rebellions in this wretched Nature? Can such loathsom abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of so deep a dye, of so long continuance, committed against so much Light, Grace, committed against know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58768:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Conscience, against patience and goodness, and that multiplied from day to day, Can these be pardones? Mercy should be accessary to its own dishonor if it should shew mercy to such a wretch which hath so abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it. Know assuredly, you speak against the Lord al this while, while you would seem to speak against your own wretched distempers; so the Psalmist <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 19. <hi>Yea</hi> (they not only sinned more, and provoked God, as in the former verses, but) <hi>they spake against God, saying, Can God prepare a Table in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness?</hi> You blaspheme and speak against his Power, which is not able to work it; against his Wisdom, which cannot contrive it; against his Mercy, which is not willing, or not able to succor you: It was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sin that ever <hi>Cain</hi> committed, when he said <hi>his sin was greater than could be forgiven,</hi> Gen. 4. Then thy heart is more sinful than God can be merciful, Satan more able to damn thee than God is able to save thee; then God is no God, and Christ is no Christ, and the Spirit no Comforter; yea, this is to make the Devil, which is the worst of all Creatures, and Sin which is no Creature, but weakness, and worse than the Devil himself, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove God, and the Lord Jesus, and the blessed Spirit of Grace; worse than which blasphemy, Hell it self can hardly afford any. Hear therefore and fear, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abhor that such thoughts should once come into your minds, such words proceed out of your mouths.</p>
                     <p n="1">As it's dishonorable to God, so it's dangerous, yea,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> deadly to the soul: It not only crosseth a mans present comfort, darkens our evidence, sence, and assurance of Gods Favor; but utterly cuts off all possibility from the soul for ever expecting the least drop of refreshing, or smile of Gods Face.

This stops all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> passages, that there is no hope for any good or comfort to accrue to the soul. This is the Instrument of death, whereby the Enemy at once makes an end of the very life of our comfort: The hope of Salvation is made the Helmet of a Christian; so the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Put on the Breast-plate of Faith and Love, and for an Helmet the Hope of Salvation.</hi> Well-grounded evidence and assurance of Gods Love in Christ, is as it were the head, and the highest top of a Christians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, hope is the Helmet; for when our sence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, experiences and performances, yea our hearts fail, in regard of any present sweet, or refreshing we have, yet hope saies, it may be it will be better hereafter, and this holds the aking head of a Christian: The Devil who ever fights at the head, labors to shake our assurance and comfort, and if he can dash a mans hopes by despair, he kils him dead in the head, there is no help nor recovery to be looked for; know this, and be wary and wise for after times.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As it dams up the way, and stops the passage, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is no possibility of any good to come, so it deads all a mans endeavors, takes off the edg of a mans abilities, puts all out of joynt and off the hooks, that there is no striving after a good when there is no hope to attain it. All men that are carried by counsel (if not fools or mad-men) they ever have an end in their eye, at which they look, and for which they labor; this is the white they shoot at, the price they run for, for this they devise
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58768:275"/>
and contrive means, and use what they have attained, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what they take in hand, in hope the end they have attended, may be brought about. Now where there is no hope (which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> casts off) there is no good to be expected, therefore no possibility to attain our end, therefore no reason to attend our labor in that behalf. Why should I se k (saies the despairing man) when I have no hope to find? Why should I spend my labor in praying, hearing, reading, improving any Ordinance, when there is no possibility I should speed, that ever God should help, or hear, or bless? as good sit still, as rise and fall. So <hi>Cain</hi> when he had laid that desperate conclusion, <hi>My sin is greater than can be forgiven, he flies into the Land of</hi> Nod, drowns himself in sensual delights, but forsakes the Lord. The Hope of Good is the Load-stone of a mans labor, it carries on our course with speed and resolution: So they in <hi>Jonah,</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do these two things:</p>

We should be wary not to suffer our selves to be deluded by his false collections.

                     <p>Do you not see saies the Enemy, the means do not work, your prayers do not profit, the abilities you have, and the endeavors you take up, serve rather to encrease your sin than to help you, they nor you are able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the least sin, to gain the least assurance, not able to procure the least peace: True, be it so, <hi>Yet God is able.</hi> Thus our Savior to his Disciples dismayed with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the work, <hi>Lord say they, who then can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> he answers, <hi>With man it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible,</hi> Matth. 19. 26.

                     <p>We are come now to enquire the Particulars expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Description, and here also presented to our view. And first touching the sight of sin, whereby the sinner is made rightly apprehensive of his own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his condition by reason thereof. The Point thence is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There must be a true sight of sin, before the heart can</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                        <hi>be truly broken for it.</hi> A right apprehension goes before through Contrition; The Judgment must be rightly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened to see the nature of our sins before the heart can be pierced with that sence and sorrow that is meet. This is Gods way which he takes, in whose hand it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do this work, <hi>Job,</hi> 36. 8. to 11. <hi>When sinners come to be bound in fetters, and holden in cords of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58768:276"/>
then he sheweth them their work, and their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions wherein they have exceeded; and then bows their ear to Discipline, and commands them to turn from iniquity.</hi> So repenting <hi>Ephraim</hi> prosesseth it was the course the Lord took with him; <hi>After I was instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted I repented,</hi> Jer. 31. 19. That which the eye sees not the heart rues not, that which is not apprehended by the understanding, is not affected by the will; so in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> word comes home in power and plainness, so that <hi>the thoughts of his heart come to be discovered,</hi> he falls down, and saies, God is in you of a Truth. The want of this was the reason why the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria</hi> manifested such sawcy impudency, and peremptory boldness, in her conference with our Savior, though she could not be ignorant that those abominable loose haunts of hers would call to Heaven for revenge; but when our Savior laid his hand upon the sore, and let the light shine in her face, and points at the vileness of her practice, <hi>Thou hast had five Husbands, but he whom thou now hast, is not thy Husband;</hi> she then becomes sensible of his soveraign wisdom, and her own wretchedness, <hi>John,</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20. So it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> when the Lord met him going to <hi>Damascus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting the Saints; he saw not the sinfulness of his course, and therefore was senceless of it. <hi>Saul, Saul</hi> (saies Christ) <hi>why persecutest thou me?</hi> Then he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> Jesus said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, it is hard for thee to kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pricks: when he understood the evil of his way, then he stood trembling and astonished, saying, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? <hi>Acts,</hi> 9. 5, 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Corinthians were made conscious of their own carelesness, neither pitying the soul of the incestuous Corinthian, nor yet seeking to reform his sin, they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over him, and prided themselves in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited excellency; but when the Apostle had discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their miscarriage and failings, what sorrow and care
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58768:276"/>
did it work in them, and what serious endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the guilty party. The Doctrine is true, we shall endeavor to make it plain, and therefore we shall open several particulars, the right conceiving whereof will be as a key to unlock the Treasury of this Truth, that each man may take what will serve his turn.</p>

                     <p>To which I shall Answer in four Conclusions: Or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Answer unto which Inquiry, will be expressed in four Particulars.</p>
                     <p>The Righteous Law of God, as it is the Rule of our<note place="margin">Conclus.</note> Lives, so it is the Discoverer of our Sins, and swervings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therefrom; and by the light thereof, together with that little light of common Principles, of Piety and Love left upon our Consciences, we come to have our corruption made known to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>By the Law is the knowledg of sin;</hi> insomuch that <hi>Paul,</hi> a learned Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, one that profited in the Jews Religion more than his equals; he was yet at a loss in discerning and judging of the turnings and distempers of his heart, before he takes the light and lamp of the Law. So himself professeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>I had not known that lust had been a sin,</hi> those first stirrings of the Body of death, and secret lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grings and inclinations to that which is cross to the wil of God, though there be no consent given to them, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light taken in them, <hi>but that the Law said, thou shalt not lust,</hi> the Sentence of the Law set down his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58768:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and therefore the Apostle <hi>James</hi> compares it to a <hi>perfect</hi> and curious <hi>Looking-glass,</hi> wherein each man may see the least blemishes or motes, if he will present himself before it, <hi>James</hi> 1. 25. <hi>But whoso looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein,</hi> will lay his mind, and heart, and life level to the Law of God, and hold his heart and apprehensions to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment, and Sentence thereof, it will plainly discover the smallest imperfections, the least stirrings of the most hidden distempers that arise; so <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. the Heathens with the twi-light or Star-light of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of <hi>the Law written in their heart</hi> past Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against themselves, touching the sinfulness of their course.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, nor yet enough, to make us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a right sight of our Sins, unless the Lord put a new Light into our minds, within, as we have the Light of the Law, and Counsel of God shining without unto us; otherwise the Law may be, and wil be a clasped Book, and a dead Letter; we shall see little in it, or receive lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from it. So <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. <hi>I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandement came, sin revived.</hi> Without the Law, how could that be, since he was <hi>an Hebrew of the Hebrews, of the Tribe of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, trained up at the feet of Gamaliel?</hi> a Doctor of the Law, prosessed it, and practised it, according to the most exact <hi>Sect of the Pharisees,</hi> as he speaks? But the meaning is, that he was without the power of it, and the spiritual life, and lively efficacy of the Law. It was a dead and a killing Letter. Look what the sence of the words, or some evidence of Reason or Arguments could hold out to a Natural Understanding; the bark, and shell, and outside of such directions, he took and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But the Spiritualness of the Law, <hi>For the Law is Spiritual,</hi> saies <hi>Paul,</hi> and that spiritual and lively power of Conviction and Direction, it puts forth upon the souls of the Saints, who are subject to it, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58768:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore indeed receive the work of it. This <hi>Paul once</hi> in the time of his unregeneracy was destitute of, and then <hi>he was alive;</hi> that is, in his own overweening, and self-deluded conceit, he concluded himself to be a living Christian, to have the power and truth of Grace, and to live the life of it. So that it's possible, nay it's ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and nothing more usual, than for men to be without the Law, when they have the Law; to be without the Life of it, while they have the Letter of it; to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law as a Soveraign Rule to their Lives, while they take upon them the profession of it; to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spiritualness of the Law, and so to miss the end of it that is closing with God, as our last end, and chief good, which is the sap, the pith and substance of the Law, though they have the appearance of the practice of it, (And if they miss the end of the Law at which it aims, and unto which it tends, they must needs fall short of the Wisdom and Counsel, and Spiritual efficacy of the Law, which should direct them) So in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Now for a long time, Israel had been without the true God;</hi> that is, his true Worship that would bring them to him; and that is the meaning of that Phrase, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Without God in the World;</hi> that is, without the true Worship of God: so that they who want the true Worship of God, are without God. So they who have the manner of the true Worship, and want both Spirit and Truth, in which God will be worshiped, they have the Appearance, but want the Spirit and Truth of the true manner they have. So of the rest. Thus it is with thousands in the Church, which hear, and know, and have the Letter of the Law, and yet are indeed without the Power and Spirit; and therefore they neither see the evil of their sins by it, nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any spiritual Direction from it, nor indeed know any such thing; and therefore though their carriages are somwhat reformed, yet their inward corruptions are not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58768:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
observed, at least not reformed, or they made sensible of them: As it is with a pur-blind man, he may see things of a greater bulk, as a great Print, or the like; but the smallest Print, or the least pricks, he perceives not: So it is with a pur-blind Christian <hi>who cannot see afar off,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. If there be some loathsom and gross sins discovered, he can see them; but to see the stirrings of sin in his Nature, and the secret inclinations of his soul to sin, and the base aims and ends that are up and down in his heart in the performance of holy Duties, to see the smallest Print of the Law discovering secret and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wickedness in the Heart, that a man that hath no more than Nature cannot see. And therefore (for we come to the Point) the Spirit of Bondage is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which may let in the light of the Law into the mind, and set on the power of it mightily upon the consciences of sinners, and so dazle their Eyes, and daunt their hearts with the dreadfulness of their sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>You have not received the spirit of Bondage again to fear:</hi> as who should say, it's a gift, and it must be received, or else we shall not by all that we can do, attain the bondage and thraldom of that base condition in which we are (whereof more afterward in Conviction.) The Law is a Hammer, but it will not break the Flint unless the hand óf the Spirit take it and use it; a Hammer in the hand of a Child will not move the stones; so the Law in the hand of a man or Minister, it is as a Rod to whip us unto Christ; but unless the Spirit take it into his hand, we shall never feel the blow or smart, and so be forced to go: Hence that Phrase, <hi>John,</hi> 16. 8, 9. <hi>I will send the Spirit, and he shall convince,</hi> it's his Prerogative; he is appointed, by him it's only performed.</p>
                     <p>The two former may agree to a false-hearted Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he may have a lighter stroke of the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and the Law may convince him, and his own heart condemn him, and he may go away in dreadful horror for his sins, and yet it doth not remove the Rule of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58768:278"/>
and darkness out of the mind, but the Saints of God have the two former and they have this further, viz. such a through stroak of the spirit of bondage as takes away the rule of darkness and removes the Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aignity and Authority of it from the mind this I take to be the meaning of that phrase, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>to turn them from darkness to Light.</hi> When the Lord wil work throughly, he wil not onely scatter the sogs and disperse the grossest of the dimness and darkness of a mans mind, and leave the soul under the power of it for all that. The hypocrite may be dazled and astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the light of the truth breaking upon him, but yet his understanding is under the power of darkness, but the Saints of God are turned from it, that is their understandings are delivered from under the power of that darkness that was in them before. Conceive it thus, when the night comes darkness overspreads the face of the Earth, and though there be Moon-light, or some flash of Lightning sometimes, that may something take off the grossness and blackness of darkness but yet it is dark stil, the Moon-light or Starre-light doth not remove the rule of darkness: but when the Sun ariseth in the East we say it is day break, and you shal see ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently when light comes with a Command of the Sun, it scatters the darkness that was in the ayr, it removes the rule of it, and it rules there it self; So it is with the spirit of bondage, when he comes to an hypocrite he enlightens him with Star-light or Moon-light as it were, so that the grossness of darkness and blindness is scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that now a terrified hypocrit sees his sins, and is able to Discourse of sin and of the Law of God and to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to others, and yet it is but Moonshine it makes not day, the root and rule of Darkness is there stil, which stops and hinders the entercourse of the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God unto the soul.

                     <p>A fourth ground of mistake is because men judg of the evil of their sins by the patience and long suffering of God, which he extends towards them in the midst of their deservings; that because they are not now troubled they think they shal never be plagued, because <hi>that judgment is not presently executed</hi> it wil never be inflicted.

This was their guise in Psal. 50. 21. <hi>I held my tongue and sayed nothing, and thou thoughtest wickedly that I was such a one as thy self; but I wil reprove thee and set thy sins in order before thee.</hi> Its so at this day, men judge Gods connivance and forbearance a kind of allowance, and because he forbears to reprove them, that therefore he wil never come into judgment against them; when men see <hi>the way of the wicked pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and them exalted that rebelliously transgresse,</hi> they conclude sin is not so dangerous as Ministers would bear men in hand, nor God so severe against it or them. And therfore they look at the threatnings of scripture as words of Course used as in way of policy that God only would awe and scare men but doth not purpose to Condemn men. Why do ye not see (say they) that the most base on earth have commonly the best portion and largest allowance of the most pleasing Contents? <hi>do not their Brests run ful of Milk, and their Bones ful of Marrow? do not their Eyes stand out with fatness, and have they not more than their hearts desire? Psal</hi> 73. when such as walk with most exactness are fed with bread of sorrow and water of affliction as their

The wise man makes it a conclusion, which is setled in the hearts of all the sons of men beyond all doubt, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Because sentence is not speedily executed, therefore the hearts of the sons of man are wholly set to do evil:</hi> because the Lord out of his long-suffering abates them the present feeling of the plagues and dreadfulness of their sins, therefore they determine it, there is no such poyson in them.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth and last cause of mistake, is want of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> morning light, that Spiritual knowledg of God, and his Soveraign good pleasure over his Creatures, whereby he hath right to rule in the hearts of men, and they are bound to conform themselves thereunto.

If a man should deny his fault, and himself guilty, Meditation will evidence it beyond all gainsaying, by many testimonies which Meditation wil easily cal to mind; remember ye not in such and such a place: upon such an occasion, you gave way to your wicked heart to do thus and thus; you know it, and God knows it, and I have recorded it: If the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The Nature of the Duty is thus opened; let us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it now to the particular, and give in the Reasons of the Truth, why this Meditation brings in this Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and heart-breaking.</p>
                     <p>I might argue from the former Description, that which makes a through search of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But I shall add a double Argument briefly; they both shal be taken from the special effects of Meditation, which are marvelous pregnant to this purpose. These come neerer to the Point in hand, and apply the general Doctrine to this special occasion.</p>

As it is in the Art of Chymistry and Distillation, by their dexterity and skil in that course; they draw out the very spirits of the Mettal, or Herb, or Liquor, as the Spirits of Wine, the Oyl of Gold, &amp;c. and five drops of that wil work more strongly than five <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So here; Meditation is this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Chymistry, or the art of holy Distillation, which draws out the Spirits of the poyson and bitterness that is in corruption, Spirituallizeth the plague and venom of the vengeance that attends every transgression; and though it was never so smal in the eye of the world yet it stings the heart more than the greatest evil which is committed, if not mused on, nor attended.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> when by consideration he had viewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He looks now at the root of sin whence it came, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the highest strain in spiritual wickedness: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, thee only have I sinned,</hi> Psal. 51. 4. I said in my hast, in my sudden foolish apprehension, it was but against a man, my Servant, my Subject, and Vassal, and therefore no such great matter nor grievous evil, if I as a Prince did gratifie my own desire; but now I see it was against thee, thee only, the God of Justice, and Mercy, and Fidelity, and Truth. That was the extent of it, how far it went. Again, <hi>Deliver me from blood guiltiness, O.

But now he saw it was not <hi>Joabs</hi> treachery, <hi>nor the Sword of the Children of</hi> Ammon, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. but it was he that had taken away the life of <hi>Uriah:</hi> The dead body of <hi>Uriah</hi> was dished out to him as his break-fast every morning.

his welcoming of <hi>Vriah,</hi> his pretence of care to send him to his own house, was nothing but apparent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery against the Law of God, and light of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and knowledg which the Lord had set up in him.

Meditation raiseth a storm or tempest of distress in the soul. A sudden and present apprehension, a flashy thought of the evil of sin, is like the flourish of a Sword afar off, which a man neither seels nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

which it may be ripples the skin, whereas deep and through Meditation is as it were doubling of the blow, that steddy recoyling of a mans thoughts, is the stabbing of the heart through, and through again, makes the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bleed inwardly and abundantly. When the sinner would put by the stroke of the Truth, and shake off the danger of the sin now discovered, and applied, and set on, Meditation follows the blow home, and puts the soul beyond its sence, nay, it is so, it must be so, it wil be so: beleeve it, and expect it, for you shal find it worse than others do express, or you can conceive; for this is the voyce and verdict which Meditation gives in. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> expresseth the nature of the departure of the people from the Lord, thus: <hi>It is an evil and a bitter thing that thou hast departed away from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> Jer. 2. 19.

This some, and those very judicious, make the meaning of that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and dependance, <hi>Job,</hi> 14. 16, 17. <hi>Thou sealest up my transgression in a bag, and sewest up my iniquity together, and surely the mountain falling cometh to nought;</hi> i. e. Thou heapest up the hideous remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of al my provocations, and surely neither rocks, nor mountains, nor any power was able to bear, and not break under the unsupportable weight thereof. As it is in War, when the numbers are few, and the parties that give the onset, are weak and feeble, it's not hard then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to resist their power, or avoid and escape their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits; but when many thousands, it may be some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of thousands joyn al forces together to give the onset, they usually say they overbear the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and break their ranks with their very numbers and croud of the multitudes that overlay them utterly. It's so in this Spiritual contestation with the sinful distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of our hearts; it may be we spend some few and flashy thoughts about them, and look over them after a heedless manner, when either the Truths of God are dispensed to our conviction, or our sins discovered; they neither touch nor trouble our hearts, we cast off such thoughts, or cast them away, or break through them easily: But Meditation musters up new Armies of Arguments, levies and cals in new forces of all special, particular, aggravating circumstances, whereby the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness

This is the reason ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the prophet of the sottishness of the deluded Idolater, that he cannot see his own folly and madness in worshipping an Image of wood, he stifles the strength of reason and setts not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The strength of reason in a right way would easily have forced such a conclusion upon the heart; but the corruption of the heart stifled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted the power of reason and damped the evidence thereof, because it was not followed and fastened by the power of Meditation; <hi>no man considereth in his heart,</hi> the want of consideration made the heart not find nor own the evidence of that inference and truth. For we find this in our corrupt hearts naturally when sin and guilt comes to be charged upon us, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness of both are presented to our view, we willingly would hide our selves from the evidence and power of the truth, <hi>as Adam from the presence of the Lord.</hi> If we cannot deny it, yet excuse it, that the fault was in such and such, they are to be blamed, they were the cause and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> power and profit of Meditation, it dasheth and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters al these delusions and deceits, stops the passage as it were that none of al these carnal and false pretences can keep off the stroke of the truth, and the sting of sin from the heart. No no replyes Meditation: these and these are your corruptions you must own them, the evidence of them are such and so playn ye cannot excuse them; the aggravations so many so great you cannot lessen them, the plagues heavy and unavoydable you cannot prevent them. Thus it is <hi>know it for your selves</hi> these are your sins, these will be your ruin. And I summon thee here to answer it before God in the sight of men and Angels at the great day. When the heart cannot shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, nor shift, nor shake off the strength and cleerness of the Truth, it's compelled to own its sin and misery, though happily not willing to leave the one, nor knows not how to avoid the other.</p>
                     <p>True indeed then Meditation hath attained its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and powerful work, and is effectually blessed of God when our hearts are so affected, with the evil of our sins, as in our judgments rightly informed, we did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and in our most serious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This is beyond our power and reach, only its good to run after it, and though we cannot go as far as we should, yet thus far we may go.</p>
                     <p>We may put the heart to silence for the while, stop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and stisle such gainsayings for a time and turn, and get the last word of the wil, as it were, notwithstanding

Hold the heart to it, and do not suffer it to go away. Yes it was you that did it, you must own it, you shal find it upon your score one day. you know and God knows and I know it, the time when they were committed the manner how, and how aggravated with many height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning circumstances: It is so, know it; and thy damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sleepeth not, do not slight it, you wil never be able to endure it. Yes but I can: God wil abate it, or I can bear it, nay you cannot; God cannot abate it if you live in your sins, and you cannot bear it. Take the leave of your heart thus when you go to bed; this is your condition, this wil be your misery. The sum of this first Rule returns to these three particulars.</p>

When thou hast with strong hand as it were forced thy heart by the power of the Truth rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Meditation from every Coast, as it were from all particular circumstances and occasions, that it yield the Charge which it cannot gainsay, owns the guilt under which it lies, and the punishment which it hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, sits down silent under the Soveraignty of the Truth which it cannot controul; keeps the heart under this awful disposition for ever. Do not suffer thy mind to go off from the Duty of Meditation, or thy wil and affections from under the impressions which were left upon it thereby. For if thou thus givest way out of sloth, or wearish negligence, thou art in hazard not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lose thy labor, but to leave thy soul much worse by the abuse of an Ordinance, than it was before thou did'st enjoy the liberty and practice of it. As Iron or any Mettal once melted, if it cool, it grows more hard than before, and more unsit to be fashioned to any use; It's so with the heart awed and melted as it were, and made coming under the power of Meditation; if once thou growest careless, and it grows cold, it becomes more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable, hard, and unfit to receive any impression of the Truth, with what ever power it be dispensed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by dayly consideration keep the power of the Truth, and discovery of thy sins within ken stil, before the eyes and sight of thy soul, that so thou mayest keep the same heat and temper of Spirit, that awful, under, and silent subjection, to the Authority of the Truth, the terror and dreadfulness of thine own sins; and here our greatest watch is to be improved to follow this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because the policy of Satan, the proneness of our own hearts, and professed opposition that the Spirits of the sons of men have against this Dispensation on Gods part, and this disposition on ours; we are loth to bear it, Satan and the wicked are loth to suffer it in us, to

have the rod dayly shaked over us, the silth and guilt and plagues due unto our sins continually presented and pressed upon our consciences, it's exceeding tedious and irksom unto our natures: Flesh and blood is very loth to bear it, Satan and the world are unwilling we should continue in such a course, because they know it's the next way to make us weary of our lives, and of our sins; therefore our corrupt hearts are willing to shake off such considerations, and they are as restless to pluck our hearts from under the power of such an Ordinance. It wil be our comfort, let it be our care to have dayly meditation keep us company in our dayly course, it wil keep the heart in an awful and under temper. Therefore the Apostle joyns both together, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Meditate on these things, and be in them,</hi> under the power and prevailing vertue of them.

But if he see the sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make a through search, and to make work of it, he then labors to carry him as much to the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, that he shal see nothing but sin; before he bore him in hand, he needed no pardon; now he perswades him there is no hope of pardon: Before his estate was safe and good, and need not be altered, nor he trouble himself about it; it's now so vile and desperate, there is no help, and cannot be recovered: Before he soothed up the sinner, it was in his power to reform when he would; now he perswades there is no possibility in Heaven or Earth to relieve.

apprehensions, which unless they can compass, they are resolved to take no content; nay, not to follow any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direction than that they have coyned in their own conceit; and thus they please themselves in their own apprehensions, and resolve to dwel in the consideration of their sins, until their hearts were brought so low, see themselves so vile, the soul so through broken under the weight of their evil, and their own unworthiness, else what have they to do with a Christ, or once to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him.</p>
                     <p>How we come to grapple with the heart by Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we heard before; and because this Work is weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som in it self, and tedious to our corrupt Nature, to be ever raking in the Wound, set a mans heart upon the rack, and keep it in restless disquiet, that the venom of a mans guilt and plagues should ever be before his eyes, and the Summons to Judgment ever sounding in his Ears; the soul is not able to bear the unsupportable weight thereof, and therefore it cannot get to Christ to be cured and healed; it winds and turns every way that yet it may be eased, therefore the sinner tries al conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that possible may be, that he may drive away the dismal thoughts of his sinful condition, and cast aside those stabbing considerations that makes his heart die within him. Therefore he turns every stone, if he can drink it out, or game it out, or work it out, or pray it out, or any waies, or by any means wear out the thoughts that weary him of his life.</p>
                     <p>Thus he strives if he cannot get good by his Medirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet to get rid of it; because he cannot be bettered by it, he would not be troubled with it. As the Patient when he is not able to bear the extremity of the Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, that would eat out the proud flesh, takes it off and laies it aside, rather keep his sore though it hazard his life than suffer the smart of it, and may be his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness costs him his life.

the rebellious heare is not able to endure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, and therfore at last it wil make an escape from under the sting and strength of it, if possibly it may; and usually it doth, unless the Lord put forth his powerful hand in some special help: and therefore herein lies the last, and the hardest part of Meditation, to get above the heart, and to get the better of it. <hi>And to this purpose, the Directions are Three.</hi>

though that sence is savory and included: but there is I conceive somewhat more, that eye is here meant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light and direction whereof the whol body is acted and ordered, that is a mans whol course and conversation is guided in a right way. That is by vertue of Conscience especially which hath an overpowring command with it, to act and carry out al the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our hearts and actions of our lives, suitable to the light and level of the law of God, according to which it accuseth or excuseth; <hi>This single eye</hi> is a conscience sincere, when nothing interrupts the work of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the law acts it, and it acts the man, thus the office Conscience exereiseth is from God and for God.</p>

                        <q>They were pierced in their hearts.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The persons have been considered in those respects which were material and suitable to the aim of the Text: We are now come to enquire of the Work it self, that is termed here <hi>piercing.</hi> 2. The place or subject in which this was, <hi>it was in their hearts. Pierced</hi>] The word in the Original is a compound, and implies more than bare pricking; nor have we any English word fit to express it. <hi>A shivering and pulling all asunder;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cyprian trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punctio.</note> for it is so to prick as to pierce and enter, dig on every side, to pierce not overly, but quite through the soul, as some of the Antients render it. It's found only in this place in the new Testament, though the Seventy, Interpreters used it often in the Old, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of several words in several places, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment thereof. But that is remarkable, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Root which they somtimes expressed by the word in this place, it signifies such a kind of piercing as when the body of a travelling woman is wounded with the sorrow of Child-birth, when the Child is severed from the Womb, and brought into the world. And it usually implies as here, a work of sound sorrow laid upon the soul, whereby sin and the soul come to be parted each from other. And this resemblance and similitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Spiritual Sorrow and piercing; stands in three Particulars.</p>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:58768:423"/>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Piercing and digging, is ever grievous and tedious to the part that feels it.</item>
                        <item>2. There is a loosning and parting of those things which were united and closed before, there is <hi>dissolutio continui,</hi> as the Physitian speaks; the parts that were firm and continued, become now to be parted and sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more or less one from another.</item>
                        <item>3. By this severing and sundring the parts, there is a way and a passage made, that corruption, or any other humor which was in the part may be drawn out. So in sound sorrow, there be three things answerably.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The soul comes to be wounded and pained extreamly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with the pressure of corruption, stung with those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers which stab and torment the heart.</p>
                     <p>Hence the cursed union betwixt sin and the soul <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> comes to be loosened, when the sinner cannot find that sweetness in his lusts which have suited with him so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in former times. When this sweetness like the soder by which the heart and corruption lay couched so neer, and so incorporate as it were, that they became one continued thing, is as I may say, by this prevailing sorrow, melted and removed; the knot and combination between our hearts and our lusts, come to be broken.</p>
                     <p>Hence there is way made for the letting out of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> corruptions unto which the soul was endeared former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the sinner brought from under the supream and soveraign commanding power of his distempers. Thus the Church converted in <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 8. when they had sought their Lovers, and could not find them, followed them, and could not overtake them, they begin to take up other thoughts, <hi>I will go to my first Husband, for it was better with me then, than now.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Heart.</hi>] It properly signifies that chief part in a mans Body, wherein the Fountain of the Vital Spirits lies; that which lives first (as they say) and dies last; that's the Natural signification. But here it's Spiritually understood, and it's put for <hi>the Will and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58768:423"/>
Affections,</hi> which have their proper place of abode there, and express their special Operations in a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal manner, according as Objects are presented, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion offered: And thus it's taken in this place (not to trouble you with other variety of apprehensions) thus you shal find it frequently in the Scripture; <hi>The heart shal fear,</hi> Deut. 28. 67. <hi>Joy of heart,</hi> Isa. 65. 14. <hi>Sorrow of heart,</hi> Levit. 26. 16. &amp;c. And <hi>out of the heart comes murders and adulteries,</hi> Matth. 15. 19. All which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry undeniably the work of the Will and Affections, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they put forth several Operations as they meet with several Objects. So that this was not a slight and overly ripling of the skin, but a piercing to the quick, reached unto the very heart-root, that which cut asunder the Soveraignty of the choyce of the Will, and made that stand back, and go off from those loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som corruptions, which were as neer as the soul to the soul; and they were all pricked as one man in the one and the same manner in the heart; they were al woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as though there had been but one heart in them all. Hence we shal propound divers Points, and pursue that which is the main.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Sins unrepented of, and continued in, make<note place="margin">Doct.</note> way for piercing and perplexing terrors.</q>

                     <p>I say, <hi>unrepented, and continued in,</hi> make way for terror. They do not alwaies immediately let in Gall and Wormwood into the Soul, presently after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of them; plagues are then in preparation, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those over-bearing and dreadful Judgments which the Lord is devising against the ungodly, are then in the birth, and the Lord will not bring them forth until they be come to their full growth, as the fittest time for the execution of his vengeance. It fares with sinners, as it doth somtimes, and for the most part with Malefactors;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58768:424"/>
they make an escape from the hand of Justice, and they please themselves in the practice of their wickedness, and contenting their own lusts, until their destruction surprize them so, as they cannot avoid it, nor bear it. Had you but seen these scorners and despisers of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior formerly, when they run riot in their out-rage and opposition, carried all before them, as if they had the world at will, <hi>Away with him, away with him; not Christ, but</hi> Barrabbas. You would have conceived, nay, if thou had'st asked themselves, they would have concluded, they had been beyond all gun-shot, terrors and perplexities could not have touched, much less sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon them. Yet see them here, and see how their condition is altered; they who scorned the Apostles, now come trembling to them; they who cared not what they did before, now are at their wits ends which way to turn themselves; and it's certain, the fire was then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which now scorched; the sins were then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which now sunk their hearts with unsupportable horrors.

The Prophet sets forth the greatness of that sorrow of theirs, under a double similitude. First, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They shall mourn for him, as the mother mourns for her only son, and for her first born:</hi> the mourning of a tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mother for her son, her first born, and for her only son, he adds al degrees of grief: if she had possessed many, she might more easily have wanted one, or at least par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it; or had it been any but her first born which had the first of her strength, and the first of her love, yet she might have born it with more quietness: but when al these meet together, her life and comfort is wrapped up in the life of the Child, the mourning becomes unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable, fils the heart as it were. Secondly, It shall be <hi>like the mourning of</hi> Hadadrimmon <hi>in the Valley of</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddon, when al Israel lamented the death of their good <hi>Josiah,</hi> the light of their eyes, the breath of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils, the comfort of their souls, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 25. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the original words which lay open this work, are of marvelous weight, and discover the overpowring vertue thereof, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57. 18. <hi>The Lord dwels with him that is of a contrite spirit.</hi> Isai. 61. 6. <hi>The Lord binds up the broken heart.</hi> The first whereof signifies to pun to pouder, and to bring to smal dust; it is so used, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 3. <hi>Thou bringest man to the dust of death, again thou sayest, return ye children of men.</hi> That as the hardest stone when it's broken al to smal mammocks, and pouder as it were, it's easie and yielding under the touch of the hand, what ever ruggedness and resistance was in it before.

whol part to be found there, no sodering in any secret manner with any retired distemper; but the weight of godly sorrow hath shatter'd all asunder, distress of Conscience hath brought it to dust, parted all the privy closures with any particular of any distemper, all that knotty stiffness and perversness of spirit in siding with any corruption is now taken off. The soul comes easily to give way to the Authority of the Truth, that would take any sinful lust away. To the like purpose is that of <hi>Job,</hi> Job, 23. 16. when the Armies of Gods indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had encamped against him, and <hi>the terrors of the Lord had drunk up his spirit;</hi> saies he, <hi>God makes my heart soft,</hi> or <hi>hath melted my soul;</hi> the word signifies a severing and separation of one thing from another, and is opposite to setling and fastening, making firm, stiff, and hard, as that of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 9. last, <hi>Pharaoh hardened his heart,</hi> his soul fastened by an invincible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to the sinful purpose of his malicious detaining and oppression of the Jews. When the fierceness of Gods dupleasure brought home by the breathings of the Spirit of God upon the soul, it makes it melt like Wax before the fire, makes it easie to give way to the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the pleasure of the Lord, that his Spirit may take away any of those lusts that have been of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But the truth is this, The Lord must let in an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of some special motion and operation and leave some impression of spiritual power upon the wil to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it to act, not onely to concur with the act thereof.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:58768:455" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And I follow the Apprehension of those Authors who conceive that the removal of this resistance is not by any gracious habit of Sanctification, but by the irresistible motion of the work of the Spirit; and therefore they cal it <hi>Actual Grace,</hi> the other <hi>Habitual:</hi> A work of the Spirit assisting, the other a work of the Spirit inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, or dwelling in the heart; the one a Principle of Grace in us which we have from communion with Christ; the other the work of the Spirit upon us, to bring us from our sins to union with the Lord Jesus; and that upon these grounds:</p>
                     <p>All Habits (as it is in the Nature of all qualities)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> have their being in their Subjects, before they work in their Subject: Reason and Nature teacheth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth he must have skil before he can use it, gain the knowledg of an Art before he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> work by it; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the work of the Trade, alas I have no skil, nor ever was brought up to it; for take the heart according to the condition in which we now look at a sinner, it's wholly under the power of resistance, carried in total opposition against God, and al the works of his Grace; and therefore consider him in this time and turn, and go no further, there is no room, or next capability of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious habit or spiritual Principle to be there, therefore it cannot work there, <hi>The Natural man doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things of the Spirit of God, nay he cannot do it,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The World cannot receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> John, 14. 21.</p>
                     <p>Where there is a capability to receive, there is some kind of consent and agreement, but so as yet it cannot be here in a heart fastened to its lusts; where there is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal opposition, there is no fit disposition to receive, but while the soul is under the power of this resistance, there is a total opposition, and therefore there can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension.</p>
                     <p>Again Secondly, All gracious Habits of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are part of the Image which we receive from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

                     <p>All Communion presupposeth Union; no sap in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Branches, unless growing to the Tree; no life in the Member, unless united to the Head, <hi>John,</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less ye abide in me, ye can have nothing, do nothing:</hi> Eph. 4. 15, 16. <hi>Grows up in him in all things, who is our Head, by whom the Body aptly compacted together, according to the effectual working, &amp;c.</hi> First In-being then working.</p>
                     <p>No Union but by an Act, for no qualities close <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with their Object but by an Act. But now look at the soul in this present condition, as it comes to considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this place, as to have the resistance removed, and it self turned from sin, and in way to be turned to God. Should this be done by a gracious Habit? then there should be communion with Christ, before any union to him, or acting upon him; all which imply so many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities, and cross the whol course of Gods Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
                     <p>Those gracious Habits, when and wheresoever they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be in any Subject, it becomes free (somtimes the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof are suspended and cease, as in sleep) and then the act and order of things, is according to their own liberty in an indifferency; so that were either the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance against the work of Grace to be removed, or the heart carried to God from hence, it were in our choyce to be converted, or not converted, whenas it hath been proved, our Conversion is wrought irresistably, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to one side, not issuing from the liberty of our choyce, and therefore it is brought about by the irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible impression of the work of the Spirit: In a word,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:58768:456" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to issue this Point, Look as it is in the will of every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> when he comes to be averted, and turned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> when he comes to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from sin to God in Spiritual Conversion. Look at the will of a Child in the course of Natural Generation, as it is created by God, and comes holy and undefiled out of his hand; as the question, How comes the will of the Child to be turned from God to sin? it cannot be by any actual sin of its own, it hath committed none; it cannot be by any corrupt quality first put into it, before it was turned from God, and by which, that turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side is wrought, for then it should be under the power of sin, while yet it is under the power of God. But by vertue of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and the Curse that attends the breach of the Covenant, and by means of the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the work of Generation; the Body made won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, and the Soul created holy by God, he as an unskilful workman, by the vertue of the Curse, acting the work of Generation under the power of the Curse, and power of a perverted will, turns the set of the Soul from God, joyns body and soul in a wrong and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant manner; hence they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>So it is by proportion in a contrary manner in the work of Conversion, when the Lord Jesus comes to bring the sinner home, he doth not put sanctifying Grace into the heart, to bring the heart from the power and rebellion of fin, for then it should be under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Grace and sin together; but by the mighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and motion of his Spirit takes off the resistance,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58768:457"/>
and turns the soul from sin to himself in Christ, in whom accepting of it as adopted in his Son, he leaves the impression of his Image, and al gracious abilities whereby the heart may be carried towards him, and act for him in all things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the removal of this resistance, for the conquering</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                        <hi>and overpowering this opposition, that a carnal heart naturally carries against God and his Grace, the will of the sinner it self is a meer Patient, and the soul is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a sufferer and acts not, but is acted upon;</hi> for the heart and wil of a sinner being possessed and overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with corruption, that which is the subject of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt quality, and acted by it, hath no power to expel it, that which is wholly carried by resistance, cannot wil to remove that resistance out of it, but in truth resists al that resists or opposeth that; only the Lord by the mighty impression of the powerful operation of Spirit over-bears that opposition in the soul, and forceth the soul to feel the stab and venom of sin, though it use all means and waies it can to avoid the stroak of it, but al in vain, for <hi>the Arrows of the Almighty stick fast in him:</hi> And all this is done, and may be without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to any Liberty that the Lord hath put into the will, for the will may be forced to suffer even against it's will, without any wrong to the liberty thereof, as the damned do in Hell at this day, and shal through all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and shal never be able to get from under the terrors of the Almighty.</p>
                     <p>For the meaning of that received expression, <hi>the Will cannot be compelled,</hi> is this, In all the acts the Will puts forth, she is a cause by counsel, and acts from the inward power and ability that is implanted in her; to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, is to act by constraining force from without: now for the will to act from her own power inwardly, and yet to be acted by a contrary power from without, are Contradictions. The will then (in a word) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be constrained to do, but it may be constrained to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58768:457"/>
suffer without any the least prejudice to liberty; and so it is here in this work I now mention, a meer sufferer.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Job,</hi> 36, 10. The Lord said to <hi>command men from iniquity;</hi> he not only directs, but by a soveraign power carries the soul from iniquity: thus lamenting <hi>Ephraim</hi> intreats, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>Turn me and I shall be turned, thou art the Lord my God:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> was sent, <hi>Acts,</hi> 20. 18. <hi>To turn men from darkness to light;</hi> and so the whol frame of Scripture runs: they are said to be <hi>wounded, burdened, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

So here.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, When this resistance is removed, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> right, power and challenge which sin made, disanulled, <hi>the soul comes yet further to yield consent that there should be an everlasting divorce made between it and her former lusts and lovers, and is in earnest content they should for ever be estranged from her, and she from them.</hi> And in this consent which the soul yields for this separation, which is the great knot, it moves only as under the power, and in the vertue of the motion of the Spirit. So that Divines thus speak, <hi>This consent is not
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58768:458" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our selves, though not without our selves.</hi> There is no power in the soul, by which as a principle and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the work it's carried to the work, but acts as prevented by the impression of the power and motion of the Spirit, in vertue whereof it's acted and enabled to this consent; so that the act of Gods exciting and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Grace, doth not concur with the power that is in the will, to put forth this consent, but as a principle leaves an impression of power upon the will, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof it's moved, and so moves in and to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. As the will of a child of <hi>Adam,</hi> in generation it turns from God to sin, not by any first power of its own, but by the perverting work of the next Parent, who under the vertue of the Curse and Gods Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, turned it from the Lord, and the Authority of the Law, and put it under the Authority of fin: So the will of him that comes to be begotten of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> doth turn from sin unto God, not by any power or principle it hath of its own, but by the impression of the operation of his Spirit by which it is turned, and in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that it turns. Take an instance: Suppose the first Grace offered, or the voyce of Gods Call tendered unto the will that now hath the resistance taken off; the Question now grows, How the will comes to give her consent to this Act or first Grace; this consent must come either from the will only; or partly from the will, and partly from Grace; or from Grace only. To say from the will only, is Heretical, and perfect Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism in the highest degree, which exalts Nature above Grace, nay, to make it perfect without it. If from Grace and the will both, as divers principles, then there is a concurrence of our will by a power of its own with the power of Grace at the same instant to this work of consent, then there is an ability in the will to begin its work, and to meet and concur with Grace, without Grace so far in a Spiritual Act: As for instance, The Father and the child both draw a Boat; the Father puts
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58768:458" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more strength to the work, the Son also from a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of its own puts forth some strength, and both these concur and meet in the motion; the beginning is several from each as several causes, though both meet in the act: So that Grace concurs with the power of the will to this motion, doth not give power and principle whereby it moves: And this also is Heretical and Pelagianism; for thus far, and in that beginning, the will closeth with Grace without the power of Grace, which is cross to the Apostle, and to all the former conclusions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is in this consent, The first call of Grace prevents, and wholly moves the will, and the will in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of that motion, moves to the call, and consents: As it in the Eccho, the Voyce stirs the Air, the Air in vertue of that stir, returns the Voyce again.</p>
                     <p>Among some searching Disputes, I meet with such an expression, which I shal propound and explicate, because it makes way for the understanding of the thing in hand; <hi>The Will doth consent or will, but doth not make it self to consent, but is made so by another.</hi> Their meaning is this:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Will doth put forth the Act of Consent, and so far it's the cause of it.</item>
                        <item>2. But it was not the cause of that power by which it was enabled to consent, but that it received, and by that it was enabled to it. So that this seems to be the order in which God proceeds.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>God takes away that resistance by the irresistable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of his Spirit, when the soul, having that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment removed, it comes to be in the next passive power, and immediately disposed to a Spiritual Work, <hi>vult moveri.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God leaves a powerful impression upon the will, acts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this capability to carry it from sin in a right order to God; at the entrance of which, the soul is moved, and takes the impression; having taken the impression or motion, it moves again, and in vertue of that is said to act
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58768:459" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and consent, so that this consent is not from our selves, though not without our selves.</p>
                     <p>And thus we are put beyond any principle of our own, or to be the beginners of our own work, by any thing we have in our selves, which cuts the sinews of the Covenant of Works; and hither many times God wil bring us to our beginnings, to the bare board, even to leave our souls with him, that he may carry us from sin to himself, and act us upon himself, and keep us with himself for ever. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119. 29. <hi>Take from me the way of lying,</hi>

                     <p>So that in this Condition, it's true to say a man hath not a principle of concurrence with God, as by sanctified habits we have; but the Spirit puts in us a power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are carried to God.</p>

So <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 38. 3. <hi>There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger, nor is there any rest in my bones, because of my sin, for mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me,</hi> and he goes mourning al the day long.

a mans content? This seems good, but how may that be avoided? That is more profitable, but how may this or that inconvenience be prevented? And yet as though men had no souls, or had nothing to do with Grace, and Life, and Salvation, they have nothing to say for Heaven, nay, nor about Heaven. Our hearts work not this way, which argues the Word never wrought kindly, either for the discovery of thy sin, or the breaking of thy heart for it. If men were wounded they would fil your ears with their sighs, and your hearts with their complaints. So here, they would not give God rest, nor you rest, if their hearts were restless in their distresses; <hi>thou keepest mine eyes waking, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sleep,</hi> saies the Psalmist, Psal. 77. 4.

It's true, men speak much of sin, and can talk much of Christ, &amp; may have heard and read much of faith, yet know nothing but empty words, not know the thing when they should use it: He that spels by rote, may be wil not spel a Letter of the Book when he is put to read.

                     <p>This Canonical Institution, is the erecting of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of Cruelty, to rack mens Consciences, and pick mens Purses to satisfie their own greedy covetous desires; and to set up their Lawless Soveraignty in the hearts of such, who have captivated themselves to their Directions and Counsels: for thus they have a noose upon mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and hold men between hopes and fears, leaving them between Heaven and Hell, as they suit their minds.

                     <p>This is the first work of God in the extent of it, and the way he takes to turn the soul from sin and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Fear stops him, sorrow tires him, hatred turns him. Fear troubles his sin, sorrow loosens it, hatred abandons it. Fear finds the knot, Griefunties it, Hatred dissolves and breaks it off. Fear questions the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the match between sin and the soul, Sorrow gives in proof and evidence out of sence of the evil of it, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred disanuls the League, and fues out an everlasting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce betwixt sin and the soul.

Take the wheels of a Watch out of place, if you wil bring them into the right room and place, they wil then move, because there is a principle of motion put into it. So of a Member out of Joynt, if you wil by strong hand pul and move it unto the place, being wholly moved, it wil move into his order and rank, it doth not concur or meet with your hand for the joynting of it self, but stirs wholly and only as stirred; but being settled and confirmed in the place, it wil move to your hand, and concur with your hand to help it self. So here: That hatred in Sanctification we receive from our union with Christ; this the Spirit works upon us to make way to bring us to Union with the Lord Jesus; we must turn from our sins, before we come to God, there must be an aversion from sin, before there can be a conversion unto God; we cannot be under two Covenants; in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and the second; grow upon two stocks together. It's said <hi>that</hi> Adam <hi>begot a son in his own Image,</hi> that a Son was<note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> generated by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> the act of Generation was no part of the Image, but the Image is the corruption of Nature that came by Generation: So that we are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that's none <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The sum in short then is this: There must be an aversion from sin, before conversion unto God: there is nothing in the soul that can work this, but Christ must do it. When Christ works this, it is not by any habit of Grace infused into the soul, but <hi>by the motion and work of the Spirit upon the Soul.</hi> In this work, Christ as the Head of the Covenant by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
