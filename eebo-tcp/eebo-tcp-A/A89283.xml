         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lovingly anſwered,
By one of the leaſt of all Saints, and therefore writes himſelf an
unworthy ſervant to the Father of the leaſt of Saints:
John More.</head>
            <p>FRiends, I love you, and in love do I ſalute you, wiſhing unto you
grace and peace, from God our Father, and our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 2. humbly beſeeching you, by the meekneſs and
gentleneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the expectation of his
coming for our eternal rejoycing, thinke me not your enemy, if in love I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:166815:2"/>
tell you the truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 16. For indeed, I travel in birth with you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
no reſt within my ſelf (ſince in your printed Paper I underſtood
the ſearch you made after this truth of God) till Chriſt in this and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his commands be perfectly formed in you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my Friends, when I had received your Paper, I was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly
ſtraightened, till I had in love diſcharged my duty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10.
therefore according to your earneſt, and as I judge (in the ſimplicity of
my ſoul) well intended deſires, I made haſte in this my undertaking (from
the word of truth, which you in your Paper have owned, and I doubt not
will owne, as that rule by which we muſt both be directed and judged)
according to the ability that God hath given me, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11. in love to
ſatisfie you according to your caution, ſhewing my readineſs in all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
meekneſs (as it ought to be in every one of us) to render a reaſon
to all that ſhall ask us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. My earneſt prayer therwith to God
being for you, that your hearts may be opened, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. and your
underſtandings inlightned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. (by that Spirit of the almighty God,
which onely leadeth into all truth, <hi>John</hi> 16. 12, 13. through the hearing of
faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. that worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and is demonſtrate in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>James</hi> 2. 14, 18.) that you may not any longer, whilſt ye ought to be
teachers and are teachers of others, have need that one teach you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which be the firſt principles of the doctrine of Chriſt: and ſo your
ſelves need milk, whilſt you give unto others ſtrong meat, which
ſtand in need of milk as well as you; which I in my preſent judgement
do humbly conceive is not a right dividing of the truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15.
<hi>Heb. 5. 12. 1 Cor. 3. 2. Heb.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as to the Queries (in which your non-ſatisfaction may be
the main cauſe why you act thus) I ſhall affectionately indeavour to give
you ſatisfaction, and that particularly and briefly, concluding with a ſhort
general exhortation, both to you and all the Churches that profeſs to
love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, whereſoever it ſhall come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 1 Firſt you deſire to know, what you are commanded to ſay or
do, that you may be found faithful in this point, otherwaies to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
diſobedient unto a command, by the word of God, which is the
onely director here, and that which ſhall be our judge at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this my anſwer is twofold: Firſt, to what you ought to
know or ſay: and ſecondly, what ye ought to do in reference hereunto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you will not diſowne that you here allow of, <hi>(viz.</hi> the word of
God) as I have confidence you will not, you muſt of neceſſity ſay this is
one of thoſe principles (which are not uſeleſs) of the very foundation of
the doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the ſecond, what ye ought to do: I anſwer, if this be
one of the principles of the foundation, you ought to lay no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
then what is laid, of which Chriſt Jeſus is the corner ſtone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 11. compared with <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
            <p>2. If this be milk for babes, then as ye ought not to caſt away
the Childrens bread, <hi>Matthew</hi> 15. 26. ſo ought ye not to caſt away
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:166815:2"/>
their milk, but feed them with it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In ſum, theſe things ye ought to ſay, to teach, to do, as a
principle in the foundation of the doctrine of Chriſt, otherwaies ye go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to lay another foundation than what is laid; which is neither to be
added to or taken from, under the penalty of a ſad and dreadful ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtoniſhing
curſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. Wherefore whoſoever he be that laies a
foundation with more principles adding thereto, lays not the ſame, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
foundation, and wo be unto him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. And whoſoever
he be that ſhall lay a foundation with leſs principles, taking from them
(either Chriſt the chiefe Pillar or any other pillar or principle of the
foundation layes not the ſame foundation, but another, and wo be unto
him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 2 Secondly, you deſire to know ſome place in the word of God
(if we know of any, ſay you) where our Lord Jeſus Chriſt or any of his
Apoſtles or Diſciples preached this doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that Baptized believers
ought to practiſe, or ſubmit unto laying on of hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. To this I anſwer, that from what hath been already ſaid, is
ſufficiently proved, not onely the teaching it, but alſo a teaching it as a
foundation-principle of Chriſts doctrine, which was alſo practiſed by
baptized believers with breaking of bread and prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 41.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If it be ſo, as it is manifeſt it is, that this not onely belongs
to the Doctrine of Chriſt, but it is alſo a principle in the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or ground-work of that doctrine, <hi>Heb. 5. 12. Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. then are they
ſo forward in teaching it, that they teach, whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and
abideth not in it, hath not God, 2 <hi>John</hi> 9 verſ. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.
and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If it be ſo that this appertaineth to the doctrine of Chriſt, then
I ſay, they do not barely teach it, but alſo teach it to them to whom
they teach it, to teach it others, that may teach it others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. and 2. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 3. You ſay that the reaſon of this Querie is, the deſire of many
that baptized believers ſhould require hands to be laid on them; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you deſire of them to ſhew you ſome place of Scripture (if they
know any) that doth expreſs ſuch a behaviour either of the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or the perſon on whom hands were laid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. To this I anſwer, if baptized believers are babes in Chriſt,
they have need of milk, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13, 12. and if this be milk for them, as it is
evident it is, comparing <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. with 5. 12. then are they taught in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to deſire it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 4. You deſire to know, if they can tell of any of the ſervants of
Chriſt that ever did reprove or blame any ſort of people, whether bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
or not, becauſe laying on of hands was not practiſed or ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto by them: and the ground of this you ſay is our blaming or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
them that do not ſubmit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. To this I anſwer, I do not finde that for the neglect of this
duty they reproved any, neither had we not occaſion by their omitting of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166815:3"/>
the duty, ſhould we, wherefore notwithſtanding they had no occaſion to
blame or reprove in this particular, and ſo did it not; yet having occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the time cometh of Apoſtacie foreſpoken of, we not onely may,
but muſt, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 2, 3, 4. Eph.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 5. You deſire to know if any of them can inform you, which
of all the laying on of hands in Scripture mentioned, whether <hi>Luke</hi> 21.
12. <hi>Mark 16. 18. Act. 9. 17. Act. 8. 17. Act. 28. 8. Act. 6. 6. Act. 13. 3. 1 Tim.</hi> 1.
4, 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17. is called by Chriſt or his Apoſtles the foundation-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
or the beginning doctrine by ſome text in Scripture, ſeeing they diſter
one from another, either in the qualifications of the adminiſtrators or in
perſons on whom hands were laid, ſometimes it being before baptiſme,
ſometimes after baptiſme, ſometimes to be brought before Rulers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to heal the ſick, ſometimes to cure the blind, ſometimes to ſet men
apart to adminiſter temporal things, ſometimes to ſet men apart to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
ſpiritual things, ſometimes that men might be gifted, ſometimes by
men gifted to give the holy Ghoſt to them that were not ſet apart to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as many of themſelves ſay (ſay you) from <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. To this I Anſwer briefly, that the knowledge of all of theſe
is proper to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. but the practice of that which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Principle,
is that particularly of gifting to be communicated or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
unto every baptized believer, as milk for them whilſt Babes, <hi>Act.</hi>
19. 5, 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 16, 17. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. and 6, 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 6. You deſire to know, (ſeeing that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. ſpeaks of the laying
on of hands as plural, as the Doctrine of baptiſmes; and doth not ſpeak
of any one laying on of hands particularly nor any other diſtinction,
neither of any end, purpoſe, or event) what ſafety is it for any man to
conclude, that this in Hebrews is meant but of one of them only?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 6. To this, I Anſwer you, firſt of all, as our Lord and Maſter Jeſus
Chriſt anſwered the chief Prieſts, &amp; Scribes, and Elders, as he was walking
in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem, Mark</hi> 11. 28, 29, 30. Saying, I will ask you
one queſtion, which whether you anſwer me or no, I will proceed to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcovery of the ſafety of concluding that this in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. is meant
but of one of theſe onely in the practice, as to be miniſtred as milk for
Babes, and likewiſe of that one of gifting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer. Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Then how know ye (ſeeing <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. ſpeaks of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes
as plural, as well as laying on of hands, and doth not ſpeak of any
one baptiſme particularly, nor any other diſtinction, neither any end,
purpoſe, or event, more then laying on of hands doth, That it is ſafe
for any one to conclude, that it is meant but of one of them particularly,
and that of that you practice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly, That this is meant (particularly) as milk for Babes,
but one of them, and that of this one of gifting, I thus prove.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 12. before mentioned, is no foundation-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be practiſed by the Servants of Chriſt as milk for babes, as you may
ſee if you look into it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 18. and <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8. and 19. 17. is no more
in the practice milk for babes, then the former; but rather meat for ſtrong
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166815:3"/>
men, that were to go forth, and after Chriſt, firſt to divulge the Goſpel of
peace, whereby they were to be confirmed as Chriſtians, to deliver in truth
the word of God, <hi>Act. 2. 22. Heb.</hi> 6. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That in <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. is no more here meant as aforeſaid, then
either of the former to be this milk for babes; becauſe it properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
to particular men, ſet apart to particular Offices for the well being
of the Church of Chriſt, but this as milk to all as babes in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. and 6. 1, 2. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3. is no more here meant as aforeſaid to be
milk for babes, or particularly a foundation-Principle of the doctrine of
Chriſt, then any of the former; becauſe it no more appertaineth unto
babes, but ſtrong men, even thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. who by reaſon
of uſe, had their ſenſes exerciſed in diſcerning good or evil, who were made
ſit to be imployed in the work of the miniſtery, therefore to be ſeparated
after that manner thereunto; ſuch I ſay, as were gone beyond theſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. being in a capacity of teaching others, having no
need of laying againe in them the foundation of the Doctrine of Chriſt,
therefore neither can this be that meant in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. as the foundation or
beginning principle which is milk for babes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. and 6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, ſeeing none of theſe as aforeſaid can be that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of hands here meant, and this of gifting 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14. Act.</hi> 19. 6.
<hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17. may for the reaſons following, it will be ſafe for all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that this in <hi>Hebrews</hi> is meant (as aforeſaid, which is practically)
but of one of them onely, and that of gifting.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe every babe is capable hereof, which they are not of the
former.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe every babe hath need thereof, which they have not
of the former.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe we finde examples for it, <hi>Act. 19. 6. Act.</hi> 8. 17. as to
babes with the annexion of the reward of the ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 7. Seeing, ſay you, many draw inferences or deductions (as
they call them) from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. to maintain one laying on of hands onely,
and none of them upon the forementioned conſiderations, neither in the
end, purpoſe, or event, therefore we deſire to know, whether you judge
it a command of our Lord Chriſt, that any mans inference or deduction
ſhould be of binding force in point of faith or obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 7. To this I anſwer, that I have now hopes you will be fully
ſatisfied (as well as I) and them alſo that occaſioned your writing, of the
probability both of the end, purpoſe, and event of the laſt of theſe, of
being both expected and injoyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the ſecond part of your Quere; If there be occaſion
for to anſwer it, I judge not that any mans inference or deduction, as
you tearm it from one phraſe of Scripture, ſhould be ſo, father then
other Scriptures, comparing ſpritual things with ſpiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12, 13.
do clearly infer the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 8. You deſire to know of them, what they will refer you to, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166815:4"/>
a ſure rule to try inferences or deductions by, becauſe the beſt of men
are liable to miſtakes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 8. To this I anſwer again, to the word of truth, wherein we
are directed by the Spirit of truth, <hi>Iohn 16. 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 10. received
from God through the laying on of hands, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 6. without which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ye can do nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11. Wherefore I ſhall in the name of
Jeſus Chriſt, Son of the eternal God, and elder brother to the Saints of
God, with all meekneſs humbly intreat you to take into ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the Scriptures I have inſerted, and let me beg your thoughts upon
them, manifeſting thereby the reality of what you have profeſſed in your
paper, <hi>viz.</hi> your unfained ſearch after the truth as it is in the doctrine of
Jeſus: conſider theſe, I ſay, I have inſerted, thoſe I ſhall inſert, with all
others to the aforeſaid purpoſe you <hi>(Berean</hi>-like) may, and ought to ſearch
for, <hi>Act. 17. 11. John</hi> 5. 39. and be perſwaded in love to ſubmit unto
the will of God in this particular, which is his approved-of way; for his
beſtowing of his Spirit upon us, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17. in what meaſure he ſhall pleaſe,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. to the ſearching out of all things, even the deep things of
God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. without which it is impoſſible to know them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11,
12. Wherefore if you have any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort in
love, if the leaſt fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercy, fulfil ye
my joy, by being like minded with us in practiſing of all the commands
of all the commands of our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, that you with
us may be his friends indeed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 14. This in love I leave with you,
and proceed to a general Exhortation.</p>

General Exhortation
to all Baptized Churches, not yet

rule of the word of God, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-principle
of the Doctrine
of Chriſt, of laying on of hands.</head>
            <p>IN the the name of the eternal God, do I beſeech you, O ye baptized
Churches, to the Law and to the teſtimonies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 23. and there exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

13. 5. which that you may do, as I have in love exhorted the world, in a
general exhortation about a year ago; ſo with the ſame affection, and
much more, do I exhort you to examine your principles, or foundation
upon which you build that fabrick, which you call the temples of the moſt
high God; if it be right, it is agreeable to the rule and meaſure of the
word, without adding or diminiſhing, which is the rule and ſquare, without
which we may not, nay we cannot build the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11.
compared with <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. 2. Cor. 10. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. and 21. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.
5. Wherefore with all earneſtneſs of ſpirit, I beſeech you take up the
rule, or read the word of God, and meaſure by way of examination your
foundation; ſince if it be not the foundation already laid in the
word of truth, it is not the foundation of Chriſtianity, ſince other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
can no man lay then what is laid, of which Chriſt Jeſus is the chief
corner ſtone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 30. Wherefore examine if you have
laid your foundation with this corner-ſtone, and repentance from dead
works, faith towards God, baptiſms, laying on of hands, reſurrection
from the dead, and eternal judgement as principles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. if not,
know ye, according to the diſcovery of the word of truth, that whether
ye leave out the chief corner-ſtone or principle, or whether ye leave out
repentance from dead works, or baptiſms, or laying on of hands, or any
other; ye thus teaching and practſing, alter the foundation of the
doctrine of Chriſt, as much as in you lyeth: but you cannot alter it, it
is not his but your own. Nevertheleſs, with the Apoſtle, I have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
concerning you, that ye will do the things commanded us of God,
2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 4. by Chriſt and them that heard him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. although as yet
ye do them but in part, wherefore conſider I pray you, firſt, that he which
offendeth in one point, is guilty of all, <hi>James</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>2. That they are lyers, whoſoever they be, and how fairly ſoever they
pretend, that keep not the commands of God; and the truth is not in
them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Wherefore what ſhall we think of ſome that ſay they are Chriſtians, and
are not built up upon the foundation of the doctrine of Chriſt? <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>Now therefore ſeeing you have left out but one Principle of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and cannot truely build the houſe of God without it, becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no other but its own, take to your ſelves this principle of Laying on of
hands as milk for babes, <hi>Heb,</hi> 5. 12, 13. &amp; 6. 1, 2. of ſo much uſe, and ſo
great concernment to the Saints of God as it is, it being God's ordinary
way of beſtowing gifts upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17, 18. &amp; 19. 6. Wherefore I
beſeech you that none of you neglect any longer that a gift ſhould be
given you by the Laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. but
ſubmitting thereunto, expect that ſome uſeful gift or gifts ſhould be given
you to profit withal, as many of your friends have both expected, and
found made good unto them, as they alſo had in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6. enjoying the
gifts of knowledge, faith, or prophecie; and though not of tongues,
which ſerved for ſignes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22. yet of uſeful gifts for the Church of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166815:5"/>
God to profit withal, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. which place
conſider.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, would we have our knowledge increaſed, our faith increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
our gifts enlarged, and we our ſelves vindicated from being juſtly
charged with being diſobeyers of the Commands of God, takers away of
the childrens milk, layers aſide of one of the Principles of the foundation
of Gods houſe, which we ſhould build withal; which before we have laid,
we cannot go on unto perfection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Let us all with joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
own the foundation of Chriſts doctrine; and own it ſo, that whoever
brings any other, and not the ſame, whether added to or diminiſhed from,
let us not countenance him, by receiving of him into our houſes, or bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of him God ſpeed, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 11. for he comes under the curſe, <hi>Rev.</hi>
22. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O my friends, I humbly beg you to conſider the dangerous
conſequence of altering the foundation that God himſelf hath laid, by
taking from, or adding to the ſame foundation; hoping and praying to
God the Father, through our Lord Chriſt, for a practical anſwer, through
his enabling of you, with readineſs and willingneſs to cloſe herewith, that
you may indeed be the people of the Lord our righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 14. I reſt,</p>
