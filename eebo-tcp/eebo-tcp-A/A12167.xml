         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

persons that partake of humane nature, so whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is excellent in the whole world, is borrowed
to set out the excellencies of these two great
Lovers.</p>
                  <p>It is called <hi>Salomons Song,</hi> who next unto
<hi>Christ,</hi> was the greatest Sonne of <hi>wisdome</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Church</hi> bred: whose understanding, as it
was large as the sand of the Sea, so his Affections,
especially that of <hi>Love,</hi> was as large: as we may
see by his many wives, and by the delight he
sought to take in whatsoever nature could afford.
Which affection of <hi>Love</hi> in him misplaced,
had beene his undoing, but that he was one belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of God; who by his Spirit raised his soule
to lovely Objects of a higher Nature. Here in
this argument there is no danger for the deepest
wit, or the largest affection (yea of a <hi>Salomon</hi>) to
over-reach: for the knowledge of the love of
<hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> is above all knowledge, The
<hi>Angels</hi> themselves may admire it,<note place="margin">Eph 3. 19.</note> though they
cannot comprehend it. It may well therefore
be called the <hi>Song of Salomon;</hi> The most excellent
<hi>Song,</hi> of a man of the highest conceit, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
apprehension, and of the highest matters, <hi>The
Intercourse betwixt Christ the Highest Lord of Lords,
and his best beloved contracted Spouse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are diverse things in this <hi>Song,</hi> that a

corrupt heart (unto which all things are defiled)
may take offence; But, <hi>To the pure all things are
pure.</hi> Such a sinfull abuse of this Heavenly Booke
is farre from the intention of the Holy Ghost in
it, which is by stouping low to us, to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to raise us higher unto him; that by taking
advantage of the sweetest passage of our life, (<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>)
and the most delightfull affection (<hi>Love</hi>) in
the sweetest manner of Expression (<hi>by a Song</hi>) he
might carrie up the Soule to things of a Heavenly
Nature.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> We see in <hi>Summer,</hi> that one heat wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
another: and a great light being neare a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

Amongst other wayes of <hi>Mortification,</hi>
there be two remarkable,

                        <item>1. By imbittering all earthly things unto us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                        <item>2. By shewing more noble, excellent, and fit Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</item>
                     </list>
That the soule issuing more largely and strongly
into them, may be diverted; and so by degrees die
unto other things. The holy Spirit hath chosen
this way in this <hi>Song;</hi> by elevating and raising
our <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> to take it off from other
things, that so it might runne in its right Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell.
It is pitie that a sweet streame should not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

a shame is it, that man having in him such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17813:12"/>
affections as <hi>Love, Ioy, Delight,</hi> should cleave
to dirty base things that are worse than himselfe,
so becomming debased like them? Therefore
the Spirit of God, our of mercy and pitie to man,
would raise up his affections, by taking compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

that onely deserve <hi>Love, Ioy, Delight,</hi> and

must be, not to looke so much on the <hi>colours,</hi> as
the <hi>Picture:</hi> and not so much on the Picture, as
on the <hi>Person</hi> it selfe represented: that we looke
not so much to the <hi>resemblance,</hi> as to the <hi>Person

                  </p>
                  <p>Some would have <hi>Salomon</hi> by a <hi>Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,</hi>
to take a view here of all the time, from his
Age to the second coming of Christ: and in this

<hi>Passages</hi> and <hi>Periods</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in severall

But howsoever this <hi>Song</hi> may containe (we

yet this hinders not, but that <hi>most passages of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to the Spirituall estate of the Church in every age:</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:17813:12"/>
as most Interpreters have thought. In this <hi>Song</hi>
there is
<list>
                        <item>1. A strong desire of the Church of nearer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ: <hi>and then</hi>

                        <item>2. Some declining againe in affection.</item>
                        <item>3. After this we have Her recovery and regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <item>4. The Church fals againe into a declining of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,

                        </item>
                        <item>5. That the Church perceiving of Christs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

Christ, than ever before. <hi>Chap. 3.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>These passages agree to the Experience of the
best Christians in the state of their owne lives.
This Observation must carrie strength through
this whole <hi>Song,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the whole Song.</note> That, <hi>there is the same regard of the
whole Church, &amp; of every particular member in regard
of the chiefest Priviledges and Graces that accompany
salvation.</hi> There is the same reason of every drop
of water, as of the whole <hi>Ocean</hi> all is water; and of
every sparke of fire, as of the whole Element of
fire, all is fire: of those Homogeneall bodies, as we
cal them, there is the same respect of the part and
of the whole. <hi>And therefore as the whole Church is
the Spouse of Christ, so is every particular Christian:
and as the whole Church desires still nearer Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Christ, so doth every particular member.</hi>

quickening. <hi>Christ</hi> then answers those desires, by
commanding the winds to blow upon her. For,
ordinarily <hi>Christ</hi> first stirres up desires, and then,
answers the desires of his owne Spirit, by further
increase, as here.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Awake, thou North-wind, and come thou South,
and blow upon my Garden, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>For the first Point named, we see here, that
<hi>Christ</hi> sends forth his Spirit, with Command to
all <hi>meanes,</hi> under the name of <hi>North and South
wind,</hi> to further the fruitfulnesse of his <hi>Church.</hi>
The wind is natures fanne, what <hi>winds</hi> are to the
<hi>Garden,</hi> that the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the use of
meanes, is to the soule. From Comparison
fetcht from Christs commanding the <hi>winds;</hi> We
may in generall observe,<note place="margin">Observation from Christs commanding the winds.</note> That, <hi>All Creatures
stand in obedience to Christ, as ready at a word, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he speakes to them.</hi> They are all as it were
asleepe untill he awakes them. He can call for
the <hi>wind</hi> out of his treasures when he pleases, he
holds them in his fist.</p>
                  <p>Which may comfort all those that are <hi>Christs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vse.</note>
that they are under one that hath all creatures at
his becke under him, to do them service, and at
his checke to do them no harme. This drew the
<hi>Disciples</hi> in admiration to say, <hi>What manner of man
is this,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 27.</note> that even the winds and the seas obey him?</hi>
And cannot the same power still the winds and
waves of the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> and cause a
sodaine clame, if (as the Disciples) we awake him
with our Prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:17813:14"/>
Secondly, we see here, that <hi>Christ</hi> speakes to
<hi>winds contrary one to another,</hi> both in regard of the
coasts from whence they blow, and in their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
but both agree in this, that both are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the <hi>Garden:</hi> where we see, That, <hi>The
courses that Christ takes,<note place="margin">Observation from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blasts of winds.</note> and the meanes that he uses
with his Church, may seeme contrary, but by a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all agree in the wholsome issue.</hi> A prosperous
and an afflicted condition are contrary, a mild and
a sharpe course may seeme to crosse one another.
Yet, sweetly they agree in this, that as the <hi>Church</hi>
needeth both, so <hi>Christ</hi> uses both for the
<hi>Churches</hi> good. The <hi>North is a nipping wind,</hi> and
the <hi>South a cherishing wind,</hi> therefore the <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi>
is the welcomer and sweeter after the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi>
hath blowne. But howsoever, all things are
ours, <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas, things present and to

                     <hi>life, death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all things work together for good
to us,</hi>

                     <hi>being in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the manifold wisdome of
Chirst maketh use of such variety of conditions,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
and hence it is that the Spirit <hi>of Christ</hi> is mild in
some mens Ministeries, and sharpe in others.
Nay, in the very same Minister, as the state of the
soule they have to deale with all requires.</p>

let loose all kind of <hi>winds</hi> at his pleasure, then if
meanes be wanting or fruitlesse; <hi>It is he that sayes to

Therefore, we must acknowledge him in want
or plenty of meanes. The Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> in the

                     <item>3 <hi>The wind disperseth and Scattereth clouds, and

disperse such clouds as corruption and Satan
raise up in the soule, that we may clearely see

                     </item>
                     <item>4 <hi>The wind hath a cooling and a tempering quality,
and tempers the distemper of nature:</hi> as in some
hot countries there be yearely Anniversarie
winds which blow at certaine times in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
tempering the heat. So the Spirit of God
allayeth the unnaturall heats of the soule in

that nature could never have found out.</item>
                     <item>6 <hi>The wind hath a cherishing and a fructifying

Spirit, and maketh the heart which is

downe houses, and trees like the Cedars in Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
turnes them up by the roots, and layes all

that <hi>Christ</hi> will <hi>blow</hi> upon us, not onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
us, but also to maintaine his owne Graces in
us. But O! where is this stirring up of our
selves, and one another upon these grounds?</p>
                  <p>But,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                     <hi>Why is the Church compared to a Garden?</hi>
Christ herein takes all manner of termes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
himselfe and the state of the Church,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as it
is to him, to shew us that wheresoever we are,
we may have occasion of heavenly thoughts, to
raise up our thoughts to higher matters. His
Church is his <hi>Temple,</hi> when we are in the <hi>Temple,</hi>
it is a <hi>field</hi> when we are there; A <hi>Garden,</hi> if we
walke in a <hi>Garden:</hi> It is also a <hi>Spouse</hi> and a <hi>Sister;</hi>
&amp;c. But more particularly the <hi>Church</hi> is resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to a <hi>Garden,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Church is compared to a garden.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Because a Garden is taken out of the common
wast ground, to be appropriated to a more particular
use;</hi> so the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is taken out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:17813:17"/>
wildernesse of this wast world, to a particular
use.<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 26.</note> It is in respect of the rest, as <hi>Goshen</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi>
wherein light was, when all else was in darknesse.
And indeed wherein doth the <hi>Church</hi> differ from
other grounds, but that <hi>Christ</hi> hath taken it in?
It is the same soyle as other grounds are; but, he
dresseth and fits it to beare spices and herbes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>In a garden nothing comes up naturally of it
selfe,</hi> but as it is planted and set; so nothing is
good in the heart, but as it is planted and set by
the heavenly Husbandman.<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 22.</note> We need not sow
the wildernes, for the seeds of weeds prosper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
the earth is a mother to weeds, but a step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
to herbs. So weeds &amp; passions grow too
rank naturally, but nothing growes in the <hi>Church</hi>
of it self, but as it is set by the hand of <hi>Christ,</hi> who
is the Author, Dresser, and Pruner of this Garden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, <hi>In a Garden nothing uses to be planted
but what is usefull and delightfull,</hi> so there is no
grace in the heart of a Christian, but it usefull
(as occasion serves) both to God and man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Further, <hi>In a garden there are variety of flowers
and spices;</hi> especially in those hot Countries;
so in a Christian, there is somewhat of every
grace: as some cannot heare of a curious flower,
but they will have it in their <hi>Garden,</hi> so a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannot
heare of any Grace;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but he labours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, they labour for graces for all seasons,
and occasions. They have for <hi>Prosperity, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and sobriety;</hi> for <hi>Adversity, patience</hi> and <hi>hope</hi>
to sustaine them. For those that are <hi>above them,</hi>
they have <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> and for those
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17813:17"/>
under them, sutable usage in all conditions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
For the Spirit of God in them is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
of spirituall good things;<note place="margin">Reason.</note> as in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature, before the Spirit of God came
to us, there was the seminary of all ill weeds in
us, so when there is a new quality and new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
put in us, there with comes the seeds of all
graces.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>of all other Places, we most delight in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Gardens to walk there and take our pleasure,</hi> and take
care thereof, for fencing, weeding, watering, and
planting. So <hi>Christs</hi> chiefe care and delight is
for his <hi>Church:</hi> he walks in the midst of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
golden Candlestickes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 2. 1.</note> and if he defend and
protect States, it is that they may be a harbour to
his <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then againe, as in Gardens there had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
wont to have <hi>Fountaines</hi> and <hi>streames</hi> which run
through their <hi>Gardens:</hi> as <hi>Paradise</hi> had foure
<hi>streames</hi> which ran through it. So the <hi>Church</hi> is
<hi>Christs Paradise,</hi> and his Spirit is a spring in the
midst of it, to refresh the soules of his upon all
their faintings, and so the soule of a Christian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
as a <hi>watered Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So also, <hi>Their Fountaines were sealed up;</hi> so the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
joyes of the <hi>Church</hi> and particular Christians,<note place="margin">Cant. 4. 12.</note> are
as it were sealed up; <hi>A stranger</hi> (it is said) <hi>shall
not meddle with this joy of the Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 14. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>A garden stands alwayes in need of weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
and dressing;</hi> continuall labour and cost
must be bestowed upon it; sometimes planting,
pruning and weeding, &amp;c. So in the <hi>Church</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17813:18"/>
hearts of Christians, <hi>Christ</hi> hath alwayes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to do, we would els soone be over-growne
and turne wild: In all which, and the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<hi>Christ</hi> calleth upon the <hi>winds to blow upon
his Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If then the <hi>Church</hi> be a severed portion, then,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
                     <hi>We should walke as men of a severed condition from
the world,</hi> not as men of the world, but as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to make good that we are so, by feeling the
graces of Gods Spirit in some comfortable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that so <hi>Christ</hi> may have somthing in us, that
he may delight to dwell with us, so to be subject
to his pruning and dressing. For, <hi>It is so far from
being an ill signe, that Christ is at cost with us, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
us with afflictions, that it is rather a sure signe
of his love.</hi> For, the care of this blessed Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is to prune us so, as to make us fruitfull.
Men care not for heath and wildernesse whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they bestow no cost. So when God prunes us
by crosses and afflictions, and sowes good seed in
us, it is a signe, he meanes to dwell with us, and
delight in us.</p>
                  <p>And then also, we should not strive so much
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for common liberties of the world that common
people delight in, but for peculiar graces, that
God may delight in us as his <hi>Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, let us learne hence, <hi>not to despise any</hi>

an <hi>Eden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, let us blesse God for our selves, that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our lot hath fallen into such a pleasant place,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17813:18"/>
to be planted in the <hi>Church</hi> the place of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                  <p>And this also should move us, <hi>to be fruitfull,</hi> for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
men will indure a fruitlesse tree in the wast wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
but in their garden who will indure it?
<hi>Dignity should mind us of duty.</hi> It is strange to be
fruitlesse and barren in this place that we live in,
being watered with the deaw of Heaven, under
the sweet influence of the meanes. This fruitlesse
estate being often watered from heaven, how
fearefully is it threatned by the Holy Ghost?<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 8.</note>
that <hi>it is neare unto cursing and burning.</hi> For in this
case, visible <hi>Churches,</hi> if they prosper not, God
will remove the hedge, and lay them wast, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a <hi>Garden</hi> elswhere. Sometimes Gods plants
prosper better in <hi>Babylon,</hi> than in Iudea. It is to be
feared God may complaine of us, as he doth of
his people, <hi>Ier. 2. 21. I have planted thee a noble vine,
how art thou then come to be degenerated?</hi> If in this
case we regard iniquity in our heart, the Lord
will not regard the best thing that comes from
us, as our prayers, <hi>Heb. 12. 18. Heb. 13.</hi> We must
then learne of himselfe, how and wherein to
please him, obedience from a broken heart is the
best sacrifice. Marke in Scriptures what he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors,
what he delights in: we use to say of our
friends, would God I knew how to please them:<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> teacheth us, that <hi>without faith it is impossible
to please him.</hi> Let us then strive and labour to be
fruitfull in our <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Callings:</hi> for it is the

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17813:19"/>
us with such a condition,<note place="margin">Hos. 10. 1.</note> as to make us fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
<hi>We must not bring forth fruit to our selves,</hi>
as GOD complaines of <hi>Ephraim. Honour,
Riches,</hi> and the like, are but secondary things,
arbitrary at Gods pleasure to cast in: but,
<hi>to have an active heart fruitfull from this ground, that

be, <hi>a tree planted by the water side, that brings forth

that fruit which <hi>Moses</hi> complaines of, <hi>Deut. 32.
32. The wine of Dragons, and the Gall of Alpes:</hi>
but good fruit, as <hi>Iohn speakes: Every tree that

                  <p>Lastly, in that the <hi>Church</hi> is called <hi>Christs Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
this may strengthen our faith in Gods care
and protection. The <hi>Church</hi> may seeme to lie
open to all incursions, but it hath an invisible
hedge about it, a <hi>wall</hi> without it, and a <hi>well</hi> within
it.<note place="margin">Zach. 2. 5.</note> God himselfe is <hi>a wall of fire about it,</hi> and his
Spirit a well of living waters running through it
to refresh and comfort it.<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 1.</note> As it was said of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
so it may be said of the <hi>Church; The eye of
the Lord is upon it all the yeare long,</hi> and he waters
it continually. From which especiall care of
Gods over it, this is a good plea for us to God, <hi>I
am thine, save me,</hi> I am a plant of thine owne set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
nothing is in me but what is thine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cherish what is thine. So, for the whole
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17813:19"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> the plea is good; the <hi>Church</hi> is thine, fence
it, water it, defend it, keep the wild bore out of
it. Therefore the enemies thereof shall one day
know what it is to make a breach upon Gods
vineyard. In the meane time, let us labour to
keep our hearts as a <hi>Garden,</hi> that nothing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth
may enter. In which respects the <hi>Church</hi> is
compared to a <hi>Garden,</hi> upon which <hi>Christ</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South-wind</hi> (all the meanes
of Grace) <hi>to blow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to what end must these winds blow upon the
Garden?</p>
                  <p>That the Spices thereof may flow out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>blowing</hi> is you see, <hi>That the
Spices thereof may flow out;</hi> good things in us lie
dead and bound up, unlesse the Spirit let them
out. <hi>We ebb and flow, open and shut, as the Spirit
blowes upon us; without blowing, no flowing.</hi> There
were gracious good things in the <hi>Church,</hi> but they
wanted <hi>blowing</hi> up and further spreading, whence
we may observe, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We need not onely grace to put life into us at the first,<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
but likewise grace to quicken and draw forth that
grace that we have.</hi> This is the difference betwixt
mans <hi>blowing</hi> and the Spirits; man when he
<hi>blowes</hi> (if grace be not there before) spends all his
labour upon a dead coale, which he cannot make
take fire. But the Spirit first kindles a holy fire,
and then increases the flame. <hi>Christ</hi> had in the
use of meanes wrought on the <hi>Church</hi> before, and
now further promoteth his owne worke. We
must first take in, and then send out; first be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17813:20"/>
cisternes to containe; and then, conduits to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.
The <hi>wind</hi> first <hi>blowes,</hi> and then the <hi>Spices</hi> of
the <hi>Church flow out; we are first sweet in our selves,
and then sweet to others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence we see further,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> That, <hi>It is not enough
to be good in our selves, but our goodnesse must slow
out:</hi> that is, grow more strong, usefull to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
and streame forth for the good of others.
We must labour to be (as was said of <hi>Iohn) burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and shining Christians:</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> is not like
a boxe of oyntment shut up and not opened,
but like that boxe of oyntment that <hi>Mary</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out, which perfumes all the whole house
with the sweetnesse thereof. For, the Spirit is

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avour of
grace to others. A Christian so soone as he finds
any rooting in God, is of a spreading disposition,
and makes the places he lives in the better for
him. The whole body is the better for every
good member;<note place="margin">Philem. 10.</note> as we see in <hi>Onesimus.</hi> The
meanest persons when they become good, are
usefull and profitable; of briers become flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the very naming of a good man casts a sweet
favour as presenting some grace to the heart
of the hearer. For, <hi>then we have what we have to
purpose; when others have occasion to blesse God for us,
for conveying comfort to them by us.</hi> And for our

we cannot do that which we are able to do,

the deed is from the Spirit. Which should stirre
us up to go to <hi>Christ,</hi> that he may stirre up his
owne graces in us, that they may flow out.</p>
                  <p>Let us labour then in our selves to be full of

sire of Christs presence to delight in the graces of his

take delight in the Graces of his owne Spirit.
And she cals him <hi>Beloved,</hi> because all her love
is, or should be imparted and spent on <hi>Christ,</hi> who
gave himselfe to a cursed death for her. Our love
should run in strength no oterr way, therefore
the <hi>Church</hi> cals <hi>Christ</hi> her <hi>Beloved. Christ</hi> was
there before, but she desires a further presence of
him; whence we may observe, That,</p>
                  <p>Wheresoever grace is truely begun and stirred up,
there is still a further desire of Christs presence,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> and
approaching daily more and more neare to
the soule, <hi>the Church</hi> thinkes him never neare
enough to her, untill shee bee in heaven with
him. The true <hi>Spouse</hi> and the <hi>Bride</hi> alwayes (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in desertion and temptation) cryeth, <hi>Come
Lord Iesus,<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 17</note> Come quickly.</hi> Now these degrees of
<hi>Christs</hi> approaches to the soul untill his Second

more and more in defending, comforting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
his <hi>Church</hi> with Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every further manifestation
of his presence, is a further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
                  <p>But why is the <hi>Church</hi> thus earnest?</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> because grace helps to see our need of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and so helps us to prize him the more;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17813:21"/>
which high esteeme breeds an hungring earneste
desire after him, and a desire of further likenesse
and sutablenesse to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because the <hi>Church</hi> well knowes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>
that when <hi>Christ</hi> comes to the soule, he comes
not alone, but with his Spirit, and his Spirit with
abundance of peace and comfort. This shee
knowes what need she hath of his Presence, that
without him there is no comfortable living. For,
wheresoever he is, he makes the soule a kind of
Heaven, and all conditions of life comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may see that those that do not desire
the presence of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Ordinances,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> are (it is
to be feared) such as the <hi>wind</hi> of the Holy Ghost
never blew upon. There are some of such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as they cannot indure the presence of
<hi>Christ:</hi> such as <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his limms, whom
the presence of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Ordinances blasts
and consumes. Such are not onely profane and
wordly persons, but proud hypocrites who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in something of their owne, and therefore

his <hi>Garden:</hi> and that he might take the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

are precious fruits, as growing from plants set by

his sight, that so we may be perfect in every good
thing to do his will, having grace whereby we
may serve him acceptably. And one prevailing
argument with him is, that we desire to be such as
he may take delight in, <hi>The upright are his delight.</hi>
It cannot but please him when we desire grace,
for this end that we may please him. If we stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to please men in whom there is but little good;
should we not much more study to please Christ
the fountaine of goodnesse? Labour therefore

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church desires Christ to come into his Garden,
to eat his pleasant fruits.</hi> Where we see, <hi>The
Church gives all to Christ:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Observe.</note> The <hi>Garden</hi> is his, the
<hi>Fruit</hi> his, the <hi>pleasantuesse</hi> and <hi>preciousnesse</hi> of the
<hi>Fruit</hi> is his. And as the fruits please him, so the
humble acknowledgement that they come from
him, doth exceedingly please him. It is enough
for us to have the comfort, let him have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
It came from a good Spirit in <hi>David,</hi> when
he said,<note place="margin">2 Chron.</note> 
                     <hi>Of thine owne Lord I give thee,</hi> &amp;c. God
accounts the works and fruits that comes from
us to be ours, because the judgement and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of will, whereby we do them is ours. This
he doth to incourage us, but because the grace
whereby we judge and will aright comes from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17813:23"/>
God, it is our duty to ascribe whatsoever is good
in us, or comes from us, unto him: so God shall
lose no praise, and we lose no incouragement.
The imperfections in well-doing are onely ours,
and those <hi>Christ</hi> will pardon, as knowing how to
beare with the infirmities of his Spouse, being
<hi>the weaker vessell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore should cheere up our spirits,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> in
the wants and blemishes of our performances.
They are notwithstanding, precious fruits in
<hi>Christs</hi> acceptance, so that we desire to please him
above all things, and to have nearer communion
with him: <hi>fruitfulness unto pleasingnes may stand with
imperfections,</hi> so that we be sensible of them, and
ashamed for them. Although the fruit be little,
yet it is precious, there is a blessing in it. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
help us against tentations to pride, not to
be matter of discouragement, which Satan aimes
at. And as Christ commands the <hi>North</hi> and
<hi>South-wind</hi> to <hi>blow</hi> for cherishing, so Satan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to stirre up an <hi>East</hi> pinching <hi>wind,</hi> to take
either from indeavour, or to make us heartlesse
in indeavour. Why should we think basely of
that which <hi>Christ</hi> thinks precious? Why should
we thinke that offensive which he counts as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense?
We must not give false witnesse of the
work of grace in our hearts, but blesse God that
he will work any thing in such polluted hearts as
ours. What though as they come from us they
have a relish of the old man, seeing he takes them
from us,<note place="margin">Rev. 8. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and perfumes them with his own sweet odors,</hi>
to presents them unto God. He is our <hi>High
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17813:24"/>
Priest</hi> which makes all acceptable, both <hi>Persons,
Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Performances,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13.</note> sprinkling them all
with his blood.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Point, let it be our study to
be in such a condition wherein we may please
<hi>Christ;</hi> and whereas we are daily prone to offend
him, let us daily renew our covenant with Him,
and in him: and fetch incouragements of well-doing
from this, that what we do, is not onely
well-pleasing unto him, but rewarded of him.
And to this end desire him, that he would give
command to <hi>North and South,</hi> to all sort of
meanes, to be effectuall, for making us more
fruitfull, that he may delight in us as his pleasant
<hi>Gardens;</hi> and then what is in the world, that we
need much care for, or feare?</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the first then, in that <hi>Christ</hi> makes such a

come into my Garden,</hi> &amp;c. We see, That <hi>Christ</hi>
comes into his <hi>Garden:</hi> 'Tis much that he that

the sons of sinfull men: but this he doth for

               <p>
                  <hi>Let my Beloved come into his Garden, and eat his

gives all to <hi>Christ,</hi> who when she hath made such a

planteth good things therein,<note place="margin">The Order of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her good desires: both fitnesse to pray from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
gracious disposition: and holy desires: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, Christ hearing the voice of his own
Spirit in her, and regarding his owne preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he answers them graciously. Whence, in
the first place we may observe, That,</p>
               <p>God makes us good,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> stirres up holy desires in us, and
then answers the desires of his holy Spirit in us.</p>
               <p>A notable place for this we have <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 17.<note place="margin">How the heart is prepared to prayer.</note>
which shewes how God first prepares the heart
to pray, and then heares these desires of the soule
stirred up by his owne Spirit, <hi>Lord, thou hast heard
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17813:26"/>
the desires of the humble,</hi> none are fit to pray but
the humble, such as discerne their owne wants:
<hi>Thou wilt prepare their hearts, thou wilt make thine
eare to heare.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. It is said, <hi>Likewise the
Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for, we know not
what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it
selfe maketh intercession for us, with groanings which
cannot be uttered.</hi> Thus the Spirit not onely stirs
up our heart to pray: but also prepares our
hearts unto it Especially this is necessary for us,
when our thoughts are confused with trouble,
grief, and Passions, not knowing what to pray. In
this case the Spirit dictates the words of praier, or
els, in a confusion of thoughts summes up all in a
volie of sighs and unexpressible groanes. Thus
it is true, that our hearts can neither be lifted up
to Prayer, nor rightly prepared for it, in any
frame fitting, but by Gods owne Spirit. Nothing
is accepted of God toward heaven and happines,
but that which is spirituall: all saving and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
good comes from above. Therefore God
must prepare the heart, stirre up holy desires, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
prayer: must do all in all, being our <hi>Alpha</hi>
and <hi>Omega.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>God heares our Prayers,</hi> First, <hi>Because the
Materialls of these holy desires are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why God heares our Prayers.</note> 
                  <hi>and from the Person from whence they come, his
beloved Spouse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> as it is <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. where <hi>Christ</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to heare the voice of his <hi>Church,</hi> saith, <hi>Let
me see thy Countenance, and let me heare thy voice;
for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi>
Thus the voice of the <hi>Spouse</hi> is sweet, because it is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17813:26"/>
stirred up by his owne Spirit, which burnes the
<hi>Incense,</hi> and whence all comes which is savingly
good. This offering up of our prayers in the
name of <hi>Christ,</hi> is that which with his sweet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
perfumes all our <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 8. 3.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being in the Covenant of Grace, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
whatsoever comes from us, as we do the
desires of our neare friends.</p>
               <p>And then againe, God heares our Prayers, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>he lookes upon us as we are in election, and choice
of God the Father, who hath given us to him.</hi> Not
onely as in the neare bond of marriage, husband
and wife, but also as he hath given us to <hi>Christ:</hi>
which is his plea unto the Father, <hi>Ioh. 17. 6. Thine
they were, thou gavest them me,</hi> &amp;c. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of the Church please him, because they are
stirred up by his Spirit, and proceed from her
that is his: whose voice he delights to heare, and
the prayers of others for his Church are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because they are for her that is his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
               <p>To confirme this further, see <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 9.
<hi>Thou then shalt cry, and the Lord shall answer; thou

accesse unto him, and communion with him.
What a pitifull case is it to lose other comforts,
and therewith also to be in such a state, that we
cannot go to God with any boldnesse? It is the
greatest losse of all,<note place="margin">The greatest losse of all.</note> when we have lost the spirit of
Prayer. For, if we lose other things, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover

this boldnesse to go to God, and are afraid to look
him in the face (as malefactors the Iudge) this is a
wofull estate.</p>
               <p>Now there are <hi>diverse cases wherein the soule is
not in a state fit for Prayer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cases wherein one is unfit to pray.</note> As that first, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.
18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
regard my Prayer.</hi> If a man hath a naughty heart,
that purposeth to live in any sinne against God, he
takes him for an enemy, and therefore will not
regard his Prayer. Therefore we must come
with a resolute purpose, to break off all sinfull
courses, and to give up our selves to the guidance
of Gods Spirit.<note place="margin">A strong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> And this will be a forcible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to move us thereunto, because so long as we
live in any knowne sinne unrepented of: God
neither regards us nor our prayers. What a
fearfull estate is this, that when we have such need
of Gods favour in all estates; in sicknesse, the
houre of death, and in spirituall temptation, to be
in such a condition, as that we dare not go to
God? Though our lives be civill, yet if we have
false hearts that feed themselves with evill imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and with a purpose of sinning (though
we act it not) the Lord will not regard the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of such a one, they are abominable (<hi>The very
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17813:28"/>
sacrifice of the wicked is abominable</hi>)</p>
               <p>Another case is,<note place="margin">Pro. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>when we will not forgive others.</hi>
We know it is directly set downe in the Lords
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Prayer. <hi>Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
them that trespasse against us,</hi> and there is further
added Vers. 15.<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>If you forgive not men their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,
neither will your heavenly Father forgive
you.</hi> If our hearts tell us we have no dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to pardon, be at peace and agreement, then
we do but take Gods Name in vaine, when we
ask him to forgive our sinnes, and we continue in
envy and malice. In this case God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
our prayers, as it is said; I care not for your
Prayers, or for any service you performe to me:
why?<note place="margin">Isa, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>For your hands are full of blood:</hi> you are un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mercifull,<note place="margin">Isa. 66.</note>
of a cruell fierce disposition, which
cannot appeare before God rightly, nor humble
it selfe in Prayer. If it doth; its owne bloudy
and cruell disposition wilbe objected against the
Prayers, which are not mingled with <hi>faith</hi> and
<hi>love,</hi> but with <hi>wrath</hi> and bitternesse. Shall I look
for mercy that have no mercifull heart my selfe?
Can I hope to find that of God, that others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find from me? An unbroken disposition
which counts <hi>Pride</hi> an ornament, that is cruell
and fierce, it cannot go to God in Prayer. For,
whosoever would prevaile with God in prayer,
must be humble: for <hi>our supplications must come
from a loving peaceable disposition, where there is a
resolution against all sinne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> Neither is it sufficient
to avoid <hi>grudging</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> against these, but we
must looke that others have not cause to grudge
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17813:28"/>
against us, as it is commanded. <hi>Matth. 5. 23. If
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest
that thy Brother hath ought against thee: leave there
thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to thy Brother: and then come and offer thy gift.</hi>
So that if wee doe not seeke reconciliation with
men unto whom we have done wrong, God will
not bee reconciled to us, nor accept any service
from us.</p>
               <p>If then we would have our Prayers, and our
Persons accepted, or respected, let us make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of that which hath beene said, and not loose
such a blessed priviledge as this is, that God may
regard our prayers. But here may be asked.</p>
               <p>How shall I know whether God regard my prayers or
not?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Answ. 1</note> 
                  <hi>When he grants the thing prayed for, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth
our hearts to pray still.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How to know when God heares our prayers.</note> It is a greater gift <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
then the thing it selfe we beg, to have a spirit of
prayer with a heart inlarged. For, as long as the
heart is inlarged to prayer, it is a signe, that God
hath a speciall regard of us; and will grant our
petition in the best and fittest time.</p>
               <p>When <hi>hee answers us in a better and higher
kind,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> when he prayed for the taking away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of the Prick of the flesh; had promises of sufficient
grace.</p>
               <p>When againe, <hi>He gives us inward peace, though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
he gives not the thing:</hi> as <hi>Phil. 4. 7. In nothing bee
carefull, but in all things let your requests be made to
God, with prayer and thankesgiving.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But sometime he doth not answer our requests.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:17813:29"/>It is true he doth not, but <hi>the peace of God which
passeth al under standing guards our hearts &amp; minds in
the knowledge &amp; love of God.</hi> So though he answers
not our prayers in particular; yet he vouchsafes
inward peace unto us; assuring us that it shall goe
well with us, though not in that particular wee
beg. And thus in not hearing their prayers, yet
they have their hearts desire, when Gods will is
made known. Is not this sufficient for a Christian,
either to have the thing, or to have inward peace,
with assurance that it shall go better with them,
then if they had it: with a spirit inlarged to pray,
till they have the thing prayed for? If any of these
be; God respects our prayers.</p>
               <p>Againe, In that <hi>Christ</hi> is thus ready to come
unto <hi>his Garden</hi> upon the <hi>Churches Invitation,</hi> we
may further observe; That</p>
               <p>Christ vouchsafes his gracious Presence to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> upon their desire of it.</p>
               <p>The point is cleere, from the beginning
of the world, the <hi>Church</hi> hath had the presence
of <hi>Christ</hi> alway. For, either he hath beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> or in some other things, <hi>signes of
his presence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 2.</note> as in the <hi>Bush,</hi> or some more glorious
manifestation of his presence,<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 22.</note> the <hi>Arke,</hi> and in
the <hi>Cloude,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 13. 21.</note> and Pillar of fire, and after that more
gloriously in the <hi>Temple:</hi> he hath ever beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with his <hi>Church</hi> in some signe or evidence of
his presence, he delighted to be with the children
of men. Sometimes before that, sometimes hee
assumed a body and afterward laid it downe
againe untill hee came indeed to take our nature
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17813:29"/>
upon him never to leave it againe. But, <hi>heere is
meant, a spirituall presence most of all;</hi> which the
<hi>Church</hi> in some sort ever had: now desires, and
he offers:<note place="margin">Psal. 65. 2.</note> as being <hi>a God hearing prayer.</hi> And
to instance in one place for all to see how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Christ</hi> hath alwaies beene to shew his presence
to the <hi>Church</hi> upon their desire. What else is
the <hi>burden</hi> of the 107. <hi>Psalme;</hi> but a repetition
of Gods readinesse to shew his presence in the
<hi>Church,</hi> upon their seeking unto him, and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
desire of it: notwithstanding all their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
provocations of him to anger: which is well
summed up, <hi>Psal. 106. 43. Many times did he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, but they provoked him with their counsell,
and were brought low for their iniquity. Neverthelesse,
hee regarded their affliction when he heard their crie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It doth not content the <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That the Church is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from desire to desire.</note> to have a kinde
of spirituall presence of <hi>Christ;</hi> but, <hi>It is carried
from desire to desire,</hi> till the whole desire be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.
For, <hi>as their are graduall presences of Christ,
so their are sutable desires in the Church which rise by
degrees. Christ</hi> was present 1 by his gracious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
And then 2 more gratiously present in his
<hi>Incarnation,</hi> the sweetest time that ever the <hi>Church</hi>
had from the beginning of the world untill then.
It being <hi>the desire of nations:</hi> for the discription of
those who lived before his comming, is from, <hi>the
waiting for the consolation of Israel,</hi> that is, for the
first comming of <hi>Christ.</hi> And then there is a
third and more glorious presence of <hi>Christ,</hi> that
all of us wait for, whereby we are described to be
such, as <hi>waite for the comming of Christ:</hi> for the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17813:30"/>
soule of a Christian is never satisfied untill it injoy
the highest desire of <hi>Christs</hi> presence, which the
<hi>Church</hi> knew well enough must follow in time.
Therefore she especially desires this spirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
in a larger and fuller measure, which shee in
some measure already had. So then, <hi>Christ</hi> is
graciously present in his <hi>Church,</hi> by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.<note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note>
                  <hi>I will be with you</hi> (saith he) <hi>unto the end of the
world.</hi> It is his promise, when I am gone my selfe;
<hi>I will not leave you comfortlesse,</hi> but leave with you
my <hi>Vicar-Generall;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 16.</note> (the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> the <hi>Comforter</hi>)
who shall be alway with you. But</p>
               <p>How shall we know that Christ is present in us?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To know this we shall not need to pull him
from heaven,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> we may know it in the <hi>Word</hi> and
<hi>Sacraments</hi> and in the <hi>Communion of Saints;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How to know that Christ is present in us.</note> for,
these are the conveyances whereby he manifests
himself, together with the work of his own grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spirit in us: for, as we need not take the <hi>Sunne</hi>
from Heaven to know whether or not it be up, or
be day: which may be knowne by the light, heate,
&amp; fruitfullnes of the creature, and as in the <hi>Spring,</hi>
we need not looke to the Heaven to see whether
the <hi>Sunne</hi> be come neere us or not; for looking
on the <hi>Earth</hi> we may see all greene, fresh, lively
strong and vigorous. So it is with the presence of
<hi>Christ,</hi> we may know he is present, by that light
which is in the soule, convincing us of better cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be taken, of a spirituall life, to know heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, and the difference of them from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and to set a price upon them. When there is
together with <hi>light,</hi> a heate above nature. The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17813:30"/>
affections are kindled to love the belt things, and
to joy in them.</p>
               <p>And when together with <hi>heate, there is strength
and vigor, to carrie us to spirituall duties,</hi> framing
us to a holy communion with God, and one with
another.</p>
               <p>And likewise when <hi>there is every way cheerefullnes
and inlargement of spirit;</hi> as it is with the creature
when the <hi>Sunne approacheth.</hi> For these causes, the
<hi>Church</hi> desires <hi>Christ,</hi> that she may have more
light, life, heate, vigor, strength, and that she may
be more cheerefull and fruitfull in duties. The
soule when it is once made spirituall, doth still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
a further and further presence of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be
made better and better.</p>
               <p>What a comfort is this to Christians, that
they have the presence of <hi>Christ</hi> so farre forth, as
shall make them happie, and as the earth will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
<hi>Nothing but Heaven (or rather Christ in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)</hi>
it selfe, <hi>will content the child of God.</hi> In the
meane time his presence in the Congregation,
makes their soules (as it were) Heaven. If the
Kings presence, who carries the Court with him,
makes all places where he is a Court.<note place="margin">That where Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, there Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is in some degrees.</note> So <hi>Christ he
carries a kinde of Heaven with him, whersoever he is,
his presence hath with it, life, light, comfort, strength
&amp; all.</hi> For one beame of his countenance, will scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the cloudes of griefe whatsoever. It is no

<hi>if a fourth be there also.</hi>

flames nor nothing shall hurt us. If in a dungeon

by his spirit to inlarge our soules; all is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
whatsoever. It changeth the nature of all
things, sweetneth every thing, besides that sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which it brings unto the soule, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the spirit, as we see in the <hi>Acts,</hi> when they
had received <hi>the Holy Ghost more abundantly,</hi> they
cared not what they suffered; regarded not whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<hi>nay were glad that they were accounted worthy

                  <note place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note> Whence came this

               <p>So, let us have the spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> that comes

a double desire, 1 That <hi>Christ</hi> would come to
accept of what shee had for him of his owne
Grace, which he had wrought in her soule. And
2 shee was also verily perswaded, that he would

Grace, and comfort; and the <hi>Church</hi> doth

loves but the reflection of his owne Graces in his
Children, and therefore accepts them.</p>
               <p>3. His kindnesse is such as he takes all in good
part, <hi>Christ</hi> is love and kindnesse it selfe. Why
doth he give unto her the name of <hi>Spouse,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
but that he would be kinde, and loving, and
that we should conceave so of him? We see then
the Graces of <hi>Christ</hi> accepting of us and what we
do in his strength. Both we our selves are sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and what we offer is a sacrifice acceptable to
God thorough him that offered himself as a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of sweet smelling savour, from which God
smells a savour of rest. God accepts of <hi>Christ</hi> first
&amp; then of us, and what comes from us in him. We
may bouldly pray as <hi>Psal. 20. 3. Lord remember all
our offerings and accept all our sacrifices.</hi> The blessed
Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth will us,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>to offer up our
selves</hi> a holy and acceptable Sacrifice to God,
when we are once in <hi>Christ.</hi> In the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we have divers manifestations of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.
He accepted the Sacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> (as it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17813:38"/>
is thought) by fire from Heaven; and so <hi>Eliahs</hi>
sacrifice, and <hi>Salomons</hi> by fire.<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 18.</note> So in the
New Testament,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 21. 2.</note> he shewed his acceptation of
the <hi>Disciples</hi> meeting together,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 1.</note> by a mighty wind
and then filling them with the Holy Ghost. But
now the declaration of the acceptation of our
<hi>Persons, Graces,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that we offer to him,
<hi>is most in peace of conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi>
and from a holy fire of love kindled by the spirit
whereby our sacrifices are burned. In the incense
of prayer how many sweet spices are burned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by this fire of faith working by love, as
humility, and patience in submitting to Gods
will, hope of a gratious answer, holinesse, love to
others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If so be,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> that God accepts the performances
and Graces (especially the Prayers of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
<hi>Let it be an Argument to incourage us, to bee
much in all holy duties.</hi> It would dead the heart of
any man, to performe service, where it should
not be accepted, and the eye turned aside, not
vouchsafing a gratious looke upon it; this would
be a killing of all comfortable endeavours. But
when all that is good is accepted, and what is
amisse is pardoned, when a broken desire, a
cup of cold water shall not goe unrespected
nay unrewarded, what can we desire more? It
is infidelity which is dishonorable to God and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
to our selves that makes us so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and cold in duties.</p>
               <p>Onely let our care be to approve our hearts
unto <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> When our hearts are right, wee

cannot, but thinke comfortably of <hi>Christ.</hi>
Those that have offended some great Persons,
are afraid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they heare from them, because
they thinke, they are in a state displeasing to
them; So a soule, that is under the guilt of any
sinne, is so farre from thinking that God accepts
of it, that it lookes to heare nothing from him, but
some message of anger, and displeasure. But one
that preserves acquaintance, due distance,
and respect to a great person, heares from him
with comfort before he breakes open a letter, or
sees any thing, he supposes it comes from a friend,
one that loves him. So as we would desire to
heare nothing but good newes from Heaven, and
acceptation of all that we doe, let us be carefull to
preserve our selves in a good estate, or else our
soules will tremble upon any discovery of Gods
wrath.<note place="margin">The discourse of a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> The guilty conscience argues, what can
God shew to me, being such a wretch. The heart
of such an one cannot but misgive, as where
peace is made it will speake comfort. It is said
of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that he was a man of Gods desires;
and of <hi>Saint Iohn,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> so loved him, that
he leaned on his breast. Every one cannot bee a

there are degrees of favour, and love: but there
is no child of God, but he is beloved and accepted
of him in some degree, but something of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

they saw,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 24.</note> that <hi>Paul</hi> of a Woolfe, was become not
only a sheep, but a Shepheard and leader of Gods
flocke, they glorified God.</p>
               <p>So the beleeving <hi>Iewes,</hi> when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17813:43"/>
converted they <hi>glorified God, that he had taken the
Gentiles to be his Garden, and People.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act 11. 18</note> When <hi>Paul</hi> and
others had planted the Gospell, and God gave the
increase, the godly Iewes rejoyced at that good.
So we that are <hi>Gentiles</hi> should rejoyce, to heare of
the conversion of the Iewes, and pray for it, for,
then there will be a generall joy when that is.
Want of joy shewes want of grace. There is not
a surer Character of a Satanicall, and Cainish
disposition, then to looke on the Graces of Gods
children with a malignant eye: as <hi>Caine,</hi> who
hated his Brother, because his workes were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

God in others, and cloud them with disgraces,
that they may not shine, and will not have the
sweet ointment of their good names to spread,
but cast dead flies into it, shew that they are of his
disposition that is the accuser of the Brethren, it

Grace in them, are of <hi>Christs</hi> and of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

milke, in clouds to drop downe showers, in the

            <p>Our duty is to accept of <hi>Christs</hi> inviting of

with him, we will not suffer with him, if we will
not feast with him, we will not suffer with him,
if we will not joy with him and in him. Happy
are they that come, though compelled by crosses
and other sharp waies. If we rudely and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
refuse his feast heere, we are like never to

deepely as kindnesse despised. It was the cause
of the Iewes rejection.<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>How shall we escape,</hi> not if

            </p>
            <p>That which we should labour to bring with us,
is a taste of these dainties, &amp; an appetite to them.
The soule hath a taste of its owne, and as all
creatures that have life, have a tast to relish and
distinguish of that which is good for them, from
that which is offensive: so wheresoever spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
life is, there is likewise a taste sutable to the
sweet relish that is in spirituall things. God should
loose the glory of many excellent creatures, if
there were not severall sences to discerne of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
goodnesse in them: so if there were not a
taste in the soule we could never delight in God,
and his rich goodnesse in <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tast is the most necessary sence for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the creature, because there is nearest
application in taste, and that we should not be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17813:48"/>
deceived in taste, we heare, see and smell before,
and if these sences give a good report of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,<note place="margin">Omnis vite gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stu ducitur.</note>
then we taste of it and digest it and turne
it into fit nourishment: so the spirit of man
after judgement of the fitnesse of what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
tasts of it, delights in it, and is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by it. Ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is an attractive drawing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the soule whereby every member sucks that
out of the food that is convenient for it: so the
soule drawes out what is well digested by
judgement, and makes it its owne for severall
uses.</p>
            <p>The chiefe thing that <hi>Christ</hi> requireth is a
good stomacke to these dainties.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The meanes to procure an appetite. We are
first to be sensible of spirituall wants and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Passeover Lamb was eaten with sower
herbes: so <hi>Christ</hi> crucified relisheth best to a
soule affected with bitternesse of sin: whilst men
are rich in their owne conceipt, they goe empty
away; the duties and performances they trust
too, are but husks, windy empty chaffe; swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is not kinde nourishment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That which hinders the sharpnesse of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
are, could defluxions, that dull and flat
the edge of it. So upon plodding upon the world,
cold distillations drop upon the soule, and take
away the savour and desire of heavenly things.
These things fill not. There is both a vanity of

then they will fall fresh to it. We know not
how long wisdome will be inviting of us, it will
be our wisdome to take our time, least we put
off so long, as wisedome her selfe laughs at our
destruction, and a famine be sent, of all famines
the most miserable; a famine of the Word, and
then we may pine away eternally without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
<hi>Christ</hi> will not alwaies stand inviting of us,

            <p>Let this draw us on that we see heere <hi>Christs</hi>
hearty and free wellcome, the gracious looke
that we are like to have from him. He counts it
an honour since he hath made such rich provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

refused. We cannot honour his bounty more
then to feed liberally of that he liberally sets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Let us open our mouth wide since <hi>Christ</hi> is so

Suppers are in the end of the day, and this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

            <p>But then will be the true magnificent supper,
when all that belong to Gods election shall meet
together, and feed upon that heavenly Manna for
ever: then there will be nothing but marrow
it selfe, and wine without all dregs; in all our

the contrary; then nothing but pure quintessence.
In the meane time he lets fall some Manna in this

will not putrifie as the other Manna did, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

we can never draw these wells drie, never
sucke these breasts of consolation too much, and
the more strong and cheerefull we are, the better

delight is as sugar, sweete in it selfe, and it swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens

Friendship is the sweetnesse, intimatenesse and
strength of love. In our friends our love dwells
and rests it selfe. Conjugall friendship is the
sweetest friendship. All the kinds and degrees
of friendship meete in <hi>Christ</hi> towards his <hi>Spouse:</hi>
it is the friendship of a husband, of a brother, and
if there be any relation in the world wherein
friendship is, all is too little to expresse the love
of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In friendship there is mutuall consent, an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of judgement and affections, there is a mutuall
sympathy in the good and ill one of another, as if
there were one soule in two bodies: there be
mutuall friends and mutuall enemies.<note place="margin">Psal. 139. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Doe I not
hate them</hi> (saith <hi>David) that hate thee.</hi> There is
mutuall love of one another for their owne
sakes; in flattery men love themselves most; in
semblance love others but all is in reflection to
themselves.</p>
               <p>There is liberty which is the life of friendship,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17813:51"/>
there is a free intercourse betweene friends, a
free opening of secrets: so heere <hi>Christ</hi> openeth
his secrets to us, and we to him, we acquaint him
with the most hidden thoughts of our hearts, and
we lay open all our cares and desires before him:
thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was called Gods friend, and the
Disciples <hi>Christs</hi> friends. It is the office of the
Spirit to reveale the secrets of <hi>Christ</hi> heart to us,
concerning our owne salvation; he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
himselfe to the world.</p>
               <p>In friendship there is mutuall solace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
one in another. <hi>Christ</hi> delighteth himselfe
in his love to his <hi>Church,</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her selfe in her love to <hi>Christ. Christs</hi> delight
was to be with the sonnes of men, and ours is to
be with him.</p>
               <p>In friendship there is a mutuall honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
one of another; but here is some difference
in this friendship, for though <hi>Christ</hi> calls us
friends, and therein in some sort brings himselfe
downe to us, yet we must remember that this is
a friendship of unequalls: <hi>Christs</hi> honouring of
us is his putting honour upon us: our honouring
of him, is the giving him the <hi>honour due to his name.</hi>
This friendship must be maintained by due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
on our parts. As he is our friend, so he is
our King, and knowes how to correct us if we
forget our distance. If he heere seeme to use us
hardly, it is that he may use us the more kindly
after: he suffers much for us, therefore we may
well allow him the liberty of seasonable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:17813:51"/>He that inspireth friendship into others, will
undoubtedly keepe the lawes of friendship him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
will count our enemies his enemies. The
enemies of the Church shall one day know that
the Church is not friendlesse.</p>
               <p>And as his friendship is sweet, so constant in
all conditions; he useth not his friends as we do
flowers, regard them onely when they are
fresh: but he breeds that in us, that may make us
such as he may still delight in us; if other friends
faile (as friends may faile) yet this friend will
never faile us: if we be not ashamed of him, he
will never be ashamed of us. How comfortable
would our life be, if we could draw out the
comfort that this title of <hi>friend</hi> affordeth: It is
a comfortable, a fruitfull, an eternall friendship.</p>

               <p>Here the Church expresseth a changeable
passage of her spirituall condition after she had
recovered her selfe out of a former desertion;
expressed in the beginning of the third Chapter
and enjoyed a comfortable intercourse with
Christ; now she falleth into a deeper desertion
and temptation, from the remainder of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> The Church is
alwaies <hi>beloved,</hi> a <hi>spouse, a friend;</hi> but in this one
state there falleth out variety of changes. No
creature subject to so many changes as man;
from a state of innocency he fell into a state of
corruption, from that he by grace is restored to
a state of grace, and from grace to glory, where
his condition shall be as Christs now is, and as
heaven the place is, altogether unchangeable.
And in that state of grace how many intercourses
be there, the foundation of Gods love to us, and
grace in us alwaies remaining the same, once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
for ever beloved.</p>
               <p>We see here after a feast the Church falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe,
see it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> sometimes <hi>strong in

               </p>
               <p>The ground is by reason of variety of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
occurrences working upon the diversity of
principles in us nature and grace,<note place="margin">The Reason.</note> both nature and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17813:52"/>
grace are alwaies active in us in some degree,
when corruption gets strength, then we find a
sicke state creeping upon us, and lose our former
frame. It's with the soule as with the body, in a
certaine period of time it gathereth ill humours
which breake out into aguish distempers at
length: so the reliques of a spirituall disease not
carried away, will ripen and gather to a head.
This should teach us when we are well to study
to keepe an even course, and to watch over the
first stirrings: and likewise if we see some une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennesse
in our wayes, not to censure our selves
or others over harshly. Exact evennesse is to be
striven after here, but to be enjoyed in another
world.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Observ. 2.</note> We see by comparing the state of the
Church here with the state of it in the third
Chapter, that where corruption is not thorowly
purged, and a carefull watch kept over the soule,
there after a recovery will follow a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
distemper, corruption will not onely
strive for life, but for rule. If there had beene a
thorow reformation in the Church after her
former trouble, and a thorow closing with
Christ, she would not thus have fallen into a
more dangerous condition. We see <hi>David</hi> in
his later times fals to <hi>numbring of the people;</hi> and
<hi>Samson</hi> after he had done great services for the
Church, at length shamefully betrayes his
strength; and he that had ruled others, submits
to be ruled by a base strumpet. <hi>Ionas</hi> for not
thorough repenting for his running from his

calling, falls after to quarrell with God himselfe.
It is the best therefore to deale thorowly with
our hearts, els fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

greater shame, and we shall dishonour our owne
beginnings. Yet this is the comfort, that this
will occasion deeper humility; and hatred of sin
in those that are Gods, and a faster cleaving to
God than ever before, as we see in the Church
here: afterwards grace will have the better at
last.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">3. Observ.</note> We may observe the ingenuity of the
Church in laying open her owne state. It is the
disposition of Gods people to be ingenuous in
opening their state to God, as in <hi>David, Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
Ezra,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reason is thus.</p>
               <p>1. By a free and full confession we give
God the honour of his wisdome in knowing of
our owne condition secret and open, we give
him the honour of mercy that will not take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
against us, the honour of power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over us, if he should shew his strength
against us. We yeeld unto him the glory of all
his chiefe prerogatives, whereupon <hi>Ioshua</hi> moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<hi>Achan</hi> to a free confession, <hi>My sonne, give
glory to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We shame Satan, who first takes away
shame of sinning, and then takes away shame for
sinne, he tempts us not to be ashamed to do that
we are ashamed to confesse; so we by silence
keepe Satans counsell against our owne soules.
If we accuse our selves, we put him out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17813:53"/>
who is <hi>the accuser of the brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. We prevent likewise malicious imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the world, <hi>Austin</hi> answered roundly
and well when he was upbraided with the sinnes
of his former age:<note place="margin">Quae tu repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fault with, I have condemned in my selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>4. This ingenuous dealing easeth the soule,
giving vent to the griefe of it: whiles the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
head stickes in the wound, it will not
heale:<note place="margin">Ferrum in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere.</note> Sin unconfessed is like a broken peece of

it will by rankling and festring cause more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
It is like poyson in the stomach, if it be not
presently cast up, it will infect the whole body.
Is it not better to take shame to our selves now,
than to be shamed hereafter before Angels, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
and Men? How carefull is God of us, by
this private way to prevent future shame?</p>
               <p>5. This faithfull dealing with our selves is
oft a meanes of present delivery out of any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>David</hi> in the 32 <hi>Psalme</hi> 4. was in a great
distemper both of body and spirit; his moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
was turned into the drought of summer. It
is thought he made this Psalme betweene the
time of his sinne and his pardon. What course
taketh he? <hi>I said</hi> (saith he) that is, <hi>I resolved
to confesse my sinne, and thou forgavest the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my sinne.</hi> Upon a free and full, a faithfull,
and ingenuous confession, without <hi>all guile of
spirit,</hi> he found ease presently both in soule and
body. The cause of Gods severe dealing with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17813:54"/>
us is that we should deale severely with our
selves, the best triall of Religion in us
is by those actions whereby we reflect on our
selves by judging and condemning of our selves:
for this argueth a spirit without guile. Sin and
shifting came into the world together. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of proud nature, especially in eminency, is
such, that sinnes may passe for vertues; because
sinne and Satan are alike in this, they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to appeare in their owne colour and habit;
and so those that oppose it shall be accounted
opposers of good. This <hi>guile of spirit</hi> hath no
<hi>blessednesse</hi> belonging to it, take heed of it.</p>
               <p>4. Marke further one signe of a gracious
soule, to be abased for lesser defects, sleepinesse
and indisposition to good. One would thinke
drowsinesse were no such great matter; O but
the Church had such sweet acquaintance with
Christ, that every little indisposition that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
any degree of communion was grievous
to her. You shall have a <hi>Iudas,</hi> a <hi>Saul,</hi> an enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
offender confesse great falls that gripe his
conscience; all shall be cast up, that the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
being disburdened may feele a little ease:
but how few have you humbled for dulnesse of
spirit, want of love, of zeale, and cheerfulnesse
in duty: This accompanied with strife against
it, argues a good spirit indeed.</p>
               <p>A carnall man is not more humbled for grosse
sinnes, than a gracious Christian for wants in
good actions, when it is not with him as it hath
been, and as he would. The reason is, where

there is a cleare and heavenly light, there lesser

of any obstruction and hinderance. This
goeth in the world for unnecessary nicety: the
world straineth not at these gnats: But those,
upon whose hearts the Sun of righteousnesse
hath shined, have both a cleare sight and a tender
heart.</p>
               <p>To come to the words; [<hi>I sleep</hi>] The Church
fetcheth a comparison from the body to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the state of the soule. It is one use of
our body to helpe us in spirituall expressions.
Whilst the soule dwelleth in the body, it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
much in the conceiving of things upon the
phantasie, and the phantasie upon the senses.
We come to conceive of spirituall sleep by sleep

that dead sleep all men are in by nature, nor to be
that judiciall sleepe, that spirit of slumber which
is a further degree of that naturall sleep to which
God giveth up some as a seale of their desperate
condition, but here is meant that sleepe that
ariseth out of the remainder of corruption un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subdued,

both their intercourse in us as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malek</hi>

Vaine hopes are the dreames of waking

               <p>In sleep there is no exercise of senses or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

differs little from a dead professour;
both of them are unactive in good; and what
they do they do it without delight, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly
and unacceptable manner, unbeseeming
the state of a Christian. It is all one to have no
senses, and not to use them; we may say of
men in this sleepy temper, as the Scripture
speaks of idols, <hi>they have eyes and see not, eares and

               <p>So likewise they are alike in danger, in sleep the
preciousest thing men carry about them is taken
away without resistance: and they are ready to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17813:57"/>
let loose what they held fast before; were it never
so rich a jewel. And it is so in spirituall sleepines;
men suffer the profession of the truth to be
wrung from them without much with-standing,
and with letting fall their watch, let fall likewise,
if not their grace, yet the exercise of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and are in danger to be robbed of all.</p>
               <p>There is no danger but a man in sleepe is faire
for, and exposed unto: <hi>Sisera</hi> was slaine asleep,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 4. 7.</note>
and <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> at noone day, and there is no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
no sinne, no judgement, but a secure
drowzy Christian is open for; which is the
ground of so oft inforcing watchfulnesse by the
Spirit of God in the Scriptures. As spirituall
deadnesse of spirit is a cause of other sinne, so
likewise it is a punishment of them; God pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a spirit of <hi>dead sleepe upon men,<note place="margin">Esa. 29. 10.</note> and closeth up
their eyes,</hi> till some heavy judgement falleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and how many carnall men never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
in this world, till they awake in
hell! No wonder therefore that Satan
labours to cast men into a dead sleep all that he
can, and deludes them with dreames of a false
good, that their estate is good, and like so to
continue, that to morrow shall be as to day, that
no danger is neare, though Gods wrath hangeth

Thus Popery grew up by degrees, till it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
the Church. Whilst the watchmen that

And thus we answer the Papists, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they

They ask of us when such and such an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
began: we answer, that those that should have
observed them, were asleep. Popery is a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that crept into the Church by degrees vnder
glorious pretences. Their errours had modest
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17813:58"/>
beginnings. Worshipping of images arose
from reserving the pictures of friends; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that were brought into the Church. Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints arose from some of the Fathers
figurative turning of their speech to some that
were dead. Transubstantiation had rise from
some transcendent unwary phrases of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The Papacy it selfe from some titles of
the Romish Church and Bishop. Nothing in
Popery so grosse, but had some small begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
which being neglected by those that
should have watched over the Church, grew at
length unsufferable. No wonder if the Papists
be cast into a dead sleep, they have drunk too
deep of the whores cup. They that worship
Images, are (as the Scripture saith) <hi>like unto
them, they have eyes and see not,</hi> &amp;c. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discerne of their errours, though they be
never so ridiculous and senslesse, as prayer in an
unknowne tongue, and such like.</p>
               <p>And upon this state of the Church let us add
this caution.</p>
               <p>If the best men be so prone to sleep, then we
cannot safely at all times build upon their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<note place="margin">A Caution.</note> The Fathers of the Church were not

               <p>But howsoever this sleepy condition agreeth
to the former times of the Church, yet I wish
there were not cause to apply it to our selves, in
this latter age of the Church, wherein many
of the ancient heresies are revived; and besides,
the evils that accompany long peace, take hold
of us, and will prevaile too farre if we do not
rowze up our selves. The Church is in the
common-wealth, and usually they flowrish
and fall together. When there is a sleep of the
Church, for the most part there is a sleep of the
State. A civill sleep is, when in grounds of
danger there is no apprehension of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it not,</hi> when judgements abroad will not awake
men. When noise and pinching will not awake,
the sleep must needs be deep. The whole world
almost is in combustion round about us, and
many countries thought themselves as safe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before their troubles, as we now think our
selves. If feare of outward dangers will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
then spirituall dangers will not, as being
more secret and not obvious to sense. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then if few will believe our report of the
fearefull condition of wicked men in the world
to come. A man may be startled &amp; awaked with
outward dangers that is spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is carelesse of outward danger, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlesse
of what we say in spirituall dangers.
The feare of danger may be the greater, when
(as it was amongst the Iewes) those that should
be watchfull themselves, &amp; awake others, instead
of awaking rock the cradle, &amp; cry <hi>peace, peace, the
temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,</hi> yet we
must never forget to be mindfull with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for peace and the Gospell of peace which
yet by Gods blessing we enjoy, alwaies suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the readinesse of nature to grow secure under

selves in that condition.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Signes of a sleepy state.</note> Now we know that sleep is creeping upon
us, by comparing our present condition with
our former, when we were in a more wakefull

then all is not well.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:17813:59"/>2. Compare our selves againe with that

for sometimes a Christian goes under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
condition, all the daies of his
life, so that hee is not fit to make himselfe his

is in the word of a waking and living Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
what should a man be, take him at the best,
the varying from that is a sleepie estate; as for

live and walke by faith, hee

members of Christ, to disdaine to defile our

purge us and make us sutable to the condition
we hope for in Heaven, and the Company we
hope to have fellowship with there.</p>
               <p>3. Againe, look to the examples of others that
are more gratious, I have as many incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to bee thankfull to God, and fruitfull,
they enjoy no more meanes then I, and yet they
abound in assurance, are comfortable in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
J am downe in a little trouble, subject to
passion, to barrennesse, and distrust, as if there
were no promises of God made to sowing in
righteousnesse, thus a man may discerne hee is
a sleepe by comparing himselfe with others that
are better then himselfe.</p>
               <p>4. Againe, it's evident that we are <hi>growing

it should bee the joy of a Christian, (as

               <p>5. When the soule begins to admire outward
excellencies, when it awakes much to profits,
pleasures, and honours, when men admire great
men, rich men, great places, the strength and fat
of the soule are consumed by feeding on these

therefore the divell labours all hee can to cast
men into this temper, which he must doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can make him fall into any grosse sinne,
when hee is asleepe hee is in a fit frame for any
ill action, he is in a temper fit for the divell to
worke upon to bring into any dreame or error,
to inflame the fancies and conceits with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
excellencies, the divell hath a faculty this
way, to make outward things great that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth, and to make such sinnes little, as if
we were awake would affright us; hee workes
strongest upon the fancie, when the soule is slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
or a little drowsie.</p>
               <p>There is no man that comes to grosse sins sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
but hee falls by little and little, first to
slumber, and from slumber to sleepe, and
from sleepe to security, and to from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to another: it is the inlet to all sinnes,
and the beginning of all danger, therefore the
Lord takes a contrary course with his, when
hee would preserve a state or person he plants
in them first a spirit of faith to beleeve that
there is such a danger, or such agood to bee
apprehended, upon watching and going on in
a course befitting that condition, and then faith
(if it bee a matter of threatning) stirres up feare
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17813:61"/>
which maketh up care and diligence, this is
Gods method, when hee intends the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of any.</p>
               <p>2. A man in his sleepe is fit to loose all, a
sleepie hand lets any thing goe with ease. A
man hath grace and comfort, hee lets it goe in
his spirituall sleepinesse, grace in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and the sense and comfort of it alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
A Christian hath alwaies the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in him that workes in some degree, yet
notwithstanding in regard of his present tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and feeling, he may be in such a case, that he
shall differ nothing from a reprobate, nay hee
may come to feele more then any ordinary
wicked man feeles whiles he lives in the world;
as divers good Christians doe. And all this,
through their carelesnesse, that they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to bee robbed of first beginnings, by
yeelding to delights, company and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
feeding their conceits with carnall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
so favouring corruptions, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that that is naught in them, they loose the
comfort of all that is good: who would doe
this for the gaining of a little broken sleepe, I
say broken sleepe, for the better a man is, the
more unquietly shall he sleepe in such a state, he
shall feele startlings and frights in the middest
of his carnall delights if he belong to God.</p>
               <p>3. Besides, God meets them with some
crosses in this world, that they shall gaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it. There is none of Gods children, that
ever gained by yeelding to any corruption, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17813:61"/>
drowsinesse; though God saved their soules. It
is alwaies true, a secure state is a sure fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of some great crosse, or of some great
sinne. God cannot endure such a temper of
soule, livelesse and unfeeling performances and
sacrifices, to him that hath given us such incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements;
It must needs be distastfull to God

               <p>4. And it is an odious temper to God; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
doth not hee deserve cheerefull service at our

he not deserve the marrow of our soules? doth
not his greatnesse require it at our hands, that
our sences bee all waking? and doth not his
mercy deserve, that our love should take all care,
to serve him that is so gratious and good to us?
Is it not the fruit of our redemption to serve him
without feare in holinesse and righteousnesse all

               </p>
               <p>5. It is a state not onely odious to God, but
irksome to our owne spirits, the Conscience is
never fully at peace in a drowsie state or in
drowsie performances.</p>
               <p>Likewise it is not gracefull to others, it breeds
not love in them to good things, but dislike. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men, let them see a Christian not carry

himselfe waking as he should, though they bee a

they think it should not be so, such a

and so much grace.</p>
               <p>Let a man consider, wherefore God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the powers of the soule and the graces of
the Spirit, are they not given for exercise and

a man is not a man, a Christian is not a Christian
when he is not waking, he so farre degenerates
from himselfe, as he yeelds unto any unbesee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

but to conceive the best things,
wherfore have we <hi>Iudgement,</hi> but to judge aright
betweene the things of Heaven and Earth,
wherefore have we <hi>love</hi> planted in us, but to
set it on lovely objects, wherefore <hi>faith,</hi> but to
trust God over all, wherefore <hi>hatred,</hi> but to fly
ill, wherefore have we <hi>affections,</hi> but for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
things; when therefore our affections are
dull, and loose their edge to these things, being
quick onely to earthly things, what a temper is
this, how doth a man answer his Creation, the
state of a new Creature, wherefore are all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
planted in the soule, as faith and love, and
hope and patience, but to be in exercise, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
to have these and to let them sleepe and lie
unexercised, so farre a Christian forgets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and is not himselfe, a Christian as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that is, in his right temper should bee
in the act and exercise of what is good in him,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17813:62"/>
upon all occasions, as we say of God, hee is a
pure Act, because hee is allwaies in working,
the Spirit of God is a pure act, in whom is no
suffering but all action, about that that is fit for
so glorious a nature; So it is with the spirit of a
man, that hath the Spirit of God, hee is in act,
in exercise, in operation, as the Spirit is more or
lesse in him, so he is more or lesse in operation,
more or lesse fruitfull, what a world of good
might Christians doe, if they were in a right
temper, what a deale of ill might they escape
and avoid that they lie in, if they would
rouze up their soules to be as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
should be, and as their soule and

               <p>Indeed, the Church might have said, my

same facultie, the same power of the soule, both
in the state of Corruption, and of grace, in which
the soule is, as in the twy-light, wee cannot say,
this is light, and that is darkenesse, because there
is such a mixture. In all the powers of the soule,
there is something good, and something ill,
something flesh, and something spirit. The
heart was asleepe, and likewise was awake. I
sleepe but my heart waketh;<note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> you see here then
first of all in this correction; That a Christian
hath two principles in him, that which is good,
and that which is evill, whence issueth the
weakenesse of his actions, and affections, They
are all mixed, as are the principles from which
they come forth, wee may observe further,
that a Christian man may know how it is with
himselfe,<note place="margin">Obser. 2.</note> though he be mixed of flesh, and spirit,
he hath a distinguishing knowledge and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereby he knowes both the good, and
evill in himselfe. In a dungeon where is nothing
but darkenesse both on the eye that should
see, and on that which should bee seene,
he can see nothing: but where there is a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
principle, where there is this mixture,
there the light of the spirit searcheth the darke
corners of the heart; A man that hath the spirit
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17813:64"/>
knoweth both, he knoweth himselfe and his
owne heart. The Spirit hath a light of its owne,
even as Reason hath, how doth Reason know
what it doth; By a reflect act Inbred in the
soule, shall a man that is naturall reflect upon his
state, and know what hee knowes, what hee
thinkes, what hee doth, and may not the soule
that is raised to an higher estate know as much?
undoubtedly it may. Besides we have the Spirit
of God, which is light, and selfe-evidencing,
it shewes unto us, where it is, and what it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The worke of the Spirit may sometimes bee
hindered,<note place="margin">How the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning worke of the Spirit commeth to be so interrupted.</note> as in times of temptation, then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
a man may looke wholy upon corruption,
and so mistake himselfe, in judging by that which
hee sees present in himselfe, and not by the other
principle which is concealed for a time from
him. But a Christian, when he is not in such a
temptation, he knowes his owne estate, and can
distinguish betweene the principles in him of
the flesh and spirit, grace and nature.</p>
               <p>Againe we see heere in, that the Church
saith, <hi>but my heart waketh,</hi> that shee doth
acknowledge there is good as well as evill;
As the Church is ingenious to confesse that
which is amisse, <hi>I sleepe,</hi> so she is as true in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
that which is good in her selfe; <hi>but my
heart waketh,</hi> which yeelds us another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
               <p>Wee should as well acknowledge that
which is good,<note place="margin">Obser. 3.</note> as that which is evill in our

               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:17813:65"/>Because wee must not beare false witnesse
(as not against others) much lesse against our
selves. Many helpe Satan the accuser and plead
his cause against the Spirit their Comforter;

not so benighted when they sleepe, or given up
to such a reprobate judgement, as that they
discerne not differences: they can discerne that
such are in a good way, and such are not; that
such meanes are good, and such are not; a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
oft times is forced to doe worke out of
judgement, in case his affections are asleep or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,

As we see in a swoond or great scares, the blood
spirits and life, though they leave the face and
hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they are in the heart. It is said in
the Scripture of <hi>Eutichus, his life is in him still,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> though hee seemed to be dead.</hi> As Christ said of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 20. 9. Ioh 11,</note>
So a man may say of a Christian, in his

               </p>
               <p>This is a sound Doctrine and comfortable,<note place="margin">Obser.</note>
agreeable to Scripture, and the experience of

in such times. These two never faile on
Gods part, his <hi>love</hi> which is unchangiable, and
his grace a fruit of his love; And two on our
part, the impression of that love, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
worke of the new creature. <hi>Christ never

himselfe (after his Resurrection) so he never

Let us comfort our selves therefore in this for

                  <hi>A Christian is what his heart, and inward man is,</hi>
It is a true speech of Divines <hi>God and nature

with our judgements, Doe we allow of the

good things? How with our hatred, our zeale?

Indeed all the outward man depends upon this;
Therefore Satan, if he can get this fort, he is safe,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>
and so Satans vicar. It was a watch-word, that
was in <hi>Gregorie. 13.</hi> his time, in <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi>
daies, <hi>My Sonne, give methy heart,</hi> dissemble,
goe to <hi>Church,</hi> and doe what you will, but <hi>Da
mihi cor,</hi> bee in heart a Papist, and goe where
you will. God is not content with the heart
alone, (the Divell knowes if hee have the
heart, he hath all, But God, as he made all, both
soule, and body he will have all) but yet in
times of temptation, the chiefe triall is in the
heart.</p>
               <p>And from hence, we may have a maine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene one Christian and another.
A sound Christian doth what he doth from the
heart, he begins the workethere. What good
he doth, he loves in his heart first, judgeth it to
be good, and then he doth it.</p>
               <p>An Hypocrite doth that he doth outwardly,
and allowes not inwardly of that good he doth;
hee would doe ill, and not good, if it were in his
choice. The good that he doth is for by ends,
for correspondence, or dependance upon others,
or conformitie with the times, to cover his
designes under formalitie of Religion, that he
may not be know he outwardly, as he is inwardly,
an Atheist, and an Hypocrite. So he hath false
aymes, his heart is not directed to a right marke;
But it is otherwise with Gods child, Whatsoever
good he doth, it is in his heart first, Whatsoever
ill he abstaines from, he doth it from his heart,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17813:69"/>
judging it to be naught: therefore he hates it,
and will not doe it. Here is a maine difference
of the <hi>Church</hi> from all others, It wakes in the
heart, though the outward man sleepes. But
other mens hearts sleepe, when they wake, as
you know some men will walke and doe many
things in their sleepe. An Hypocrite is such a
kind of man, He walkes and goes up and downe,
but his heart is asleepe, he knowes not what he
doth, nor doth he the thing out of judgement,
or love, but as one asleepe (as it were) he hath
no inward affection unto the things he doth. A
Christian is the contrary, his heart is awake,
When hee is asleepe.</p>
               <p>Another difference from the wordes you
may have thus. A Christian by the power of
Gods Spirit in him, is sensible of the contrarieties
in him, complaines, and is ashamed for the same:
but an Hypocrite is not so, hee is not sensible of
his sleepinesse, <hi>I sleepe</hi> (saith the <hi>Church</hi>) so much
as the <hi>Church</hi> saith shee slept; <hi>So much shee did
not sleepe:</hi> for a man that is asleepe, cannot say he
is asleepe, nor a dead man, that he is dead, <hi>So
farre, as hee saith hee is asleepe, hee is awake.</hi>
Now the <hi>Church</hi> confesseth that she was <hi>asleepe</hi>
by that part, that was <hi>awake</hi> in her, other men
doe not complaine, are not sensible of their
sleepinesse, and slumbring, but compose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to slumber, and seeke darkenesse, which
is a friend of sleepe, they would willingly bee
ignorant, to keepe their Conscience dull, and
dumbe as much as they can, that it may not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17813:69"/>
them. This is the disposition of a Carnall
man, he is not sensible of his estate as here the
Church is.</p>

Thus did the blessed soules in former times
exercise their thoughts, raise and stirre them up
by meditation, that so they might hold their

not suffer them to sleepe. We never fall to sleep
in earthly and carnall delights, till the soule let

ere long, we shall be all drawn to an exact
account, before a strict, precise Judge; And shall
our eyes then be sleeping and carelesse? These
and such like considerations out of spirituall
wisdome we should propound to our selves, that
so we might have waking soules, and preserve
them in a right temper.</p>
               <p>The soule is as the object is that is presented
to it,<note place="margin">2. Meaness To keep Faith waking.</note> and as the certainty of the apprehension is
of that object. It conduceth much therefore to
the awakening of the soule to keepe faith awake.
It's not the greatnesse alone, but the presence of
great things that stirres us; now it is the nature
of faith to make things powerfully present to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17813:70"/>
the soule: for it sets things before us in the word
of <hi>Iebovah,</hi> that made all things of nothing,
and is Lord of his word,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> to give a being to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

Grace, keepe that awake, and it will keepe all

               <p>When a man believes, that all these things
shall be on fire ere long, that <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>
shall fall in peeces, that we shall be called to
give an account; before that time we may be
taken away. Is it not a wonder we stand
so long, when Cities, stone walls fall, and
Kingdomes come to suddaine periods? When
faith apprehends, and setts this to the eye of the
soule, it affects the same marvellously: Therfore
let faith set before the soule some present
thoughts according to its temper, sometimes
terrible things to awaken it out of its dulnesse:
Sometimes glorious things, <hi>Promises,</hi> and
<hi>Mercies,</hi> to waken it out of its sadnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
When we are in a prosperous estate let faith
make present all the sinnes and temptations that

selfe-applause and the like: if in adversitie,

feare not to lye, dissemble, and rush upon the
pikes of Gods displeasure? When they say one
thing and doe another, are they not dead? or
take them at the best, are they not asleepe?
Were they awake, would they ever doe thus?
Will not a fowle that hath wings, avoyde the
snare? or will a beast runne into a pit when it
sees it? There is a snare laid in your Play-houses,
gaming houses, Common houses that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
frequent that generally professe Religion,
and take the Communion. If the eye of their
soules were awake, would they runne into these
snares, that their owne Consciences tells them
are so? If there be any goodnesse in their soules,
it is wondrous sleepie; There is no man (even
the best) but may complaine something, that
they are overtaken in the contagion of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
times, they catch drovvsie tempers
(as our Saviour saith) of those latter times.

                  <hi>For the abundance of iniquity, the love of many shall
waxe cold.</hi> A chill temper, growes ever from
the coldnesse of the times that we live in, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the best may complaine of coldnesse, but
there is great difference. The life of many, we
see, is a continuall sleepe.</p>
               <p>Let us especially watch over ourselves, in
the use of liberty and such things as are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
lawfull. It is a blessed state, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
carries himselfe so in his liberty, that his
heart condemnes him not for the abuse of that
which it alloweth and justly in a moderate use.
Recreations are lawfull, who denies it? To
refresh a mans selfe, is not onely lawfull, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
<hi>God knew it well enough:</hi> Therefore hath
allott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d time for sleepe, and the like. <hi>But we must
not turne Recreation into a Calling,</hi> to spend too
much time in it.</p>
               <p>Where there is least feare, there is most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
alwaies. Now because in lawfull things
there is least feare, <hi>we are there in most danger.</hi>
It is true for the most part, <hi>Licit is perimus omnes,</hi>
more men perish in the <hi>Church</hi> of God by the
abuse of lawfull things, then by unlawfull,
more by meate, then by poison; Because every
man takes heed of poison, beeing he knowes the
venome of it, but how many men surfet, and
dye by meate? So many men, die by lawfull
things, they eternally perish in the abuse of their
liberties, more then in grosse sinnes. Therefore
let us keepe awake, that we may carry our selves
so in our liberties, that we condemne not our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17813:74"/>
selves in the use of them. We will conclude
this point with the Meditation of the <hi>Excellency</hi>
of a waking Christian,<note place="margin">The Excellency of a waking Christian.</note> when he is in his right
temper, hee is an excellent person, fit for all
assaies, he is then impregnable, Satan hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with him, for he (as it is said) is then a
<hi>wise man</hi> and <hi>hath his eyes in his head;</hi> he knowes
himselfe, his state, his enemies, and adversaries,
the snares of Prosperitie, and Adversitie, and of
all conditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, he being <hi>awake,</hi>
is not overcome of the evill of any condition,
and is ready for the good of any estate. He that
hath a waking soule, he sees all the advantages
of good,<note place="margin">Mark. 13. 37.</note> and all the snares that might draw him
to ill. What a blessed estate is this? In all
things therefore watch: in all estates, in all
times, and in all actions. There is a danger in
every thing without watchfulnesse. There is a
scorpion under every stone (as the Proverbe is)
a snare under every blessing of God, and in
every condition, which Satan useth as a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
to hurt us. <hi>Adversitie</hi> to discourage
us, <hi>Prosperitie</hi> to puffe us up. When, if a
Christian hath not a waking soule, Sathan
hath him in his snare; In <hi>Prosperitie</hi> to bee
proud, and secure; In <hi>Adversitie</hi> to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
repine, bee dejected, and call Gods
<hi>providence</hi> into question. When a Christian
hath a heart, and grace to awake, then his
<hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Patience,</hi> his <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>awake,</hi> as it
should bee, hee is fit for all Conditions
to doe good in them, and to take good by
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:17813:74"/>Let us therefore labour to preserve watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and waking hearts continually, that so we
may be fit to live, to die, and to appeare before
the judgement seate of God; to doe what we
should doe, and suffer what we should
suffer, being squared for all
estates whatsoever.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto by Gods assistance,
we have heard largely both
of the <hi>Churches sleeping,</hi> and
<hi>Heart-waking,</hi> What this
<hi>sleeping,</hi> and <hi>Heart-waking</hi> is;
How it comes, the tryalls
of these opposite disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
of the danger of sleeping, and excellency
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17813:76"/>
of Heartwaking; and of the helpes, and meanes
both to shunne the one, and preserve the other.
Now the <hi>church</hi> having so freely and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
confessed what shee could against her
selfe, proceeds yet further to acquaint us with
the particulars in her heart-waking disposition,
Which were two-fold, shee heard and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>the voice of her Beloved,</hi> who for all her
sleepe, was her <hi>Beloved</hi> still, and more then that,
she remembers all his sweete words and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements,
whereby hee pressed her to open
unto him, <hi>Saying, open to me my love, my dove,
my undefiled,</hi> which is set out, and amplified
with a further mooving argument of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<hi>Christ</hi> had suffered in his waiting
for entertainement in her heart. <hi>For my head is
filled with dew, and my locks with the dropps of
the night.</hi> All which aggravates her offence,
and his rare goodnesse, and patience towards mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
sinners, so to waite from time to time for
admission into our wretched soules, that he may
rule, and governe them by his holy Spirit.
Therefore we had great need to shunne this
sleepie distemper of soule, which for the
present so lockes up <hi>the everlasting gates of our
soule, that the King of glory cannot enter in;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 24.</note> and
to strive for this blessed heart-waking disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which may helpe us at all times to see our
dangers, and by Gods blessing recover us out
of them, as heere the <hi>Church</hi> doth at length,
though first smarting and well beaten by <hi>the
watch-men,</hi> in a world of perplexities, ere she
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17813:76"/>
can recover the sence of her former union, and
Communion with <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely, we find by experience, what a
woefull thing it is for the soule, which hath
once tasted how gracious the Lord is, to be long
without a sence of Gods love, For when it
lookes upon sinne as the cause of this seperation;
this is for the time, as so many deaths unto it.
Therefore the <hi>Churches</hi> experience must be our
warning-peece to take heed how we grieve the
Spirit, and so fall into this spirituall sleepe:
Wherein yet this is a good signe, that yet we
are not in a desperate dead sleepe, when we can
with her say,</p>
            <p>It is the voice of my Beloved that knocks,
saying, open unto mee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:17813:77"/>First, <hi>the Churches acknowledgement</hi> is to be
considered, Confessing, <hi>It is the voce of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
The first thing to be observed in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
is, That the <hi>Church</hi> however
sleepie and drowsie she was, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her heart was so farre awake, as to know
the voice of her husband. The point is this,</p>
            <p>That a Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lazie, sleepie estate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But much more when in a good and lively frame.
Gods Beleevers are Christs sheepe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> Now <hi>my sheepe</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>heare my voice.</hi> It is the eare marke

                  </gap>e words by the eare,</hi> (as
<hi>Iob</hi> saith) he hath a spirituall taste, a discerning
relish in his eare, because hee hath the Spirit
of God, and therefore relisheth what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
and sutable to the Spirit. Now the
<hi>voice</hi> of Christ without in the ministery, and
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> within in the heart are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
and sutable each to other.</p>
            <p>And surely so it is, <hi>That this is one way to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
a true Christian from an other, even by a
taste in hearing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Difference of christians by a spirituall taste in bearing.</note> For those that have a spirituall
relish, they can heare with some delight things
that are most spirituall. As the <hi>Heathen</hi> man
said of a meadow, that some creatures come
to eate one sort of herbs: others an other, all
that which is fit for them; Men, to walke
therein for delight; All for ends sutable to
their nature. So in comming to heare the Word
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17813:77"/>
of God; some come to observe the elegancy
of words and phrases, some to catch advantage
(perhaps) against the speaker, men of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velish
temper, and some to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the custome of the places they live in,
or to satisfie the clamours of a troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that will have some divine dutie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
else it goes on with much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.
But every true Christian comes, and
relisheth what is spirituall; And when outward
things can convey in similituds spirituall things
aptly to the mind, he relisheth this not as elegant
and pleasing his fancy so much, as for conveying
the voyce of <hi>Christ</hi> unto his soule. So that a man
may much be helpt to know his state in <hi>Grace,</hi>
and what hee is by his eare: <hi>Itching eares</hi> usually
are such as are <hi>led with lust,</hi> as the Apostle saith,
and they must be clawed. They are sicke and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will downe with them, they quarrell with
every thing that is wholesome (as they did
with <hi>Manna</hi>) no sermons will please them,
no bread is fine and vvhite enough. Whereas
indeed, it is their ovvne distemper is in fault.
As those that goe in a ship upon the Sea; it is
not the tossing, but the stomacke, that causeth a
sicknesse, the choler within, and not the waves
vvithout. So the disquiet of these men that
nothing vvill dovvne vvith them, is from their
ovvne distemper. If <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe vvere here
a preaching, they vvould be sure to cavill at
something, as then men did, when he preached
in his ovvne person; Because they labour of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17813:78"/>
lusts, vvhich they resolve to feed and cherish.</p>
            <p>And againe, Observe it against our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
What say they? Hovv shall vve knovv
that the Word is the Word of God? For this
heretique saith thus, and this interprets it thus.
This is the common Objection of the great
Rabbies amongst them in their vvritings, hovv
vve can knovv the Word to be Gods, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are such heresies in the Churches, and
such contrariety of opinions concerning the
Scriptures read in the Churches.</p>
            <p>Even thus to object and aske, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and testimonie, that these men have not
the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> for <hi>His sheepe know his
voice;</hi> vvho hovvsoever they cannot interpret
all places of Scripture, yet they can discerne in
the Scripture vvhat is sutable food for them,
or in the unfolding of the Scriptures, in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
they can discerne agreeable food for
them, having a facultie to reject that vvhich is
not fit for nourishment, to let it goe. As there
is in nature passages fit for concoction, and
digestion, and for rejection; so there is in the
soule to vvorke out of the Word, even out of
that vvhich <hi>is hard,</hi> yet vvholesome, vvhat is fit
for the soule, and Spirit. If it be cast dovvne, it
feeds upon the promises for direction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
and vvhat is not fit nourishment, that it
rejects, that is, if it be of a contrary nature,
<hi>heterogeniall.</hi> Therefore vve ansvver them thus:
That <hi>Gods sheepe heare his voice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 2. 20.</note> That his Word
left in the <hi>Church</hi> (vvhen it is unfolded) his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17813:78"/>
Spirit goes together with it, breeding a relish of
the Word in the hearts of people, whereby
they are able to taste and relish it, and it hath a
supernaturall power and Majesty in it, which
carries its owne evidence with it. <hi>How shall we
know light to be light?</hi> It carries evidence in it
selfe, that it is light. <hi>How know we that the fire is
hot?</hi> because it carries evidence in it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> selfe, that
it is so. So if you aske, <hi>How we know the Word of
God to be the Word of God? it carries in it selfe
inbred Arguments, and Characters, that the soule
can say none but this Word can be the Word of God,
it hath such a majesty and power to cast down, and
raise up,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 25.</note> and to comfort, and to direct with such
power,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.</note> and majestie, that it carries with it its owne
evidence, and it is argument enough for it.</hi> And thus
we answer them; which they can answer no
way, but by cavills. <hi>Gods sheepe heare the voice
of Christ,</hi> He speakes, and the <hi>Church</hi> understands
him, <hi>and a strangers voice they will not heare.
Ioh. 10. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, this is the onely sure way of
understanding the word to be of God from an
inbred Principle of the majesty in the word,
and a powerfull worke thereof on the soule it
selfe, and an assent so grounded is that which
makes a sound Christian. If we should aske
what is the reason there be so many, <hi>that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize,
fall away, grow prophane,<note place="margin">Why so many aposta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

under the Gospell?</hi> notwithstanding they
heare so much as they doe; the answer is, their
soules were never founded, and bottomed upon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17813:79"/>
this, that it is the Word of God, and Divine
truth, so as to be able to say, I have felt it by
experience, that it is the voice of <hi>Christ.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they so soone Apostatize, let Jesuites, or
seducers set upon them, They were never
perswaded from inbred Arguments, that the
voice of <hi>Christ</hi> is the word of God: others from
strictnesse grow prophane, because they were
never convinced by the power and majesty of
the truth in it selfe; and then in the end they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
notwithstanding all the promises, because
they were never convinced of the truth of them,
they cannot say Amen to all the promises.
But the <hi>Church</hi> can say confidently upon sound
experience, <hi>It is the voice of my Beloved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againe, Whereas the <hi>Church</hi> saith here,
<hi>It is the voice of my Beloved,</hi> &amp;c. and knowes this
voice of her Beloved, we may note,</p>
            <p>That the Church of God, and every Christian
takes notice of the meanes that God useth for their
salvation.</p>
            <note place="margin">Obser.</note>
            <p>A Christian is sensible of all the blessed
helpes he hath to salvation. To a dead heart,
it is all one, whether they have meanes, or no
meanes, but a Christian soule takes notice of all
the meanes. <hi>It is the voice of my beloved that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
it seeth <hi>Christ</hi> in all.</p>
            <p>And marke what the <hi>Church</hi> saith moreover
<hi>It is the voice of my Beloved,</hi>

would have them more and more open to him,
our hearts are for <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath the heaven of
heavens, and the soule of a believing Christian
for himselfe to dwell in, he contents not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

a desire of mutuall communion of either side.

            <p>Now Christ is mercifull both by his office,

So Christ, as God, is all love to the Church.
And we see the Scriptures also to set out God
as love, both in his essence, and in his relations,
1. in Relations of love to his Church; Hee is a

<hi>Iehovah,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> Iehovah, Strong, Mercifull, Gratious,

in these Attributes of Consolation. So Christ
as God, is all love, and mercie, Likewise Christ
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17813:82"/>
as man, hee was man for this end to be all love,
and mercy, Take him in his office as <hi>Iesus</hi> to be a

So it is here, Christ doth knocke, and speake,
useth a voice of his Word, and knocks by his

by workes of mercy or of judgement, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

God adds instruction to correction. He opens

            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes this <hi>Objection,</hi> and speakes
very rudely, that he is an unwise man to knocke,
where there is no man within to open; and
that if Christ knocke, and we cannot open,
it is a delusion to exhort to open, and that
therefore there must needs be free-will in us to
open?</p>
            <p>The Answer is; First, Christ speakes to the
Spouse here,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and so many such exhortations
are given to them that have the Spirit of God
already,<note place="margin">Why Christ knockes though he hath power to open to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:

For good, and gracious men, are mooved first
by the Spirit, and then they moove; they are
<hi>Moti moventes,</hi> and <hi>Acti Agentes.</hi> They are
acted first by the Spirit, and then they doe act <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
by it, not of themselves: as the inferiour Orbes
moove not, but as they are mooved by the
superiour. The Question is not of them in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the state of Grace, but at their first Conversion,
when especially we say that Christ speakes to
them that hee meanes to convert, <hi>He knocks at
their hearts, and opens together with his speech,</hi>
Then there goes a power that they shall open,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17813:86"/>
for his wordes are operative wordes; as it was in
the Creation, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> it was an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
word,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and there was light.</hi> Let there bee
such a Creature, it was an operative working
word, and there was such a Creature presently;
So hee opens together with that word. With
that invitation, and commaund there goes
an almighty power to inable the soule to
open; Were it not a wise reason to say, When
Christ called to <hi>Lazarus to come forth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 43.</note> that
wee should reason hee had life to yeeld to
Christ, when he bad him come forth? no,
he was rotten in his grave almost; but with
Christs speaking to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> there went an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
power, that gave life to him, by which
life he heard what Christ said, <hi>Arise Lazarus.</hi>
So Christ by his Spirit cloaths his word in the
Ministery, when he speakes to people with a
mightie power: as the Minister speakes to the
eare, Christ speaks, opens, and unlocks the
heart at the same time, and gives it power to
open, not from it selfe, but from Christ. <hi>Paul</hi>
speakes to <hi>Lydias</hi> eare, Christ to her heart,<note place="margin">Acts. 16. 13.</note> and
opened it, as the Text sayes, whereby shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
so Christ opens the heart;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Why doth he thus worke?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Because hee will preserve <hi>Nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and the
principles thereof, and so he deales with us,
working accordingly; the manner of working
of the reasonable creature, is to worke freely
by a sweet inclination, not by violence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he workes the worke of Conversion,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:17813:86"/>
hee doth it in a sweet manner, though it bee
mightie for the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ficaciousnes of it, he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
us with intreatie, and perswasion, as if
we did it our selves. But though the manner be
thus sweet, yet with this manner there goeth
an almighty power. Therefore hee doth it
strongly as comming from himselfe, and sweetly,
as the speaking is to us preserving our Nature,
so the Action is from him, which hath an
almightie power with it.<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> As Holy <hi>Bernard</hi>
saith <hi>Thou dealest sweetly with my soule in regard
of my selfe,</hi> (That is, thou workest upon me, as
a man with the wordes of love,)<hi>yet strongly in
regard of thy selfe.</hi> For except he adde strength
with sweetnesse, the worke will not follow;
but when there are both, an almightie worke is
wrought in the soule of a Christian; and so
wrought, as the manner of mans working is
preserved in a sweet and free manner, whilst he
is changed from contrarie to contrarie; And it
is also with the greatest reason that can be, In
that now he sees more reason to be good, then
in the daies of darkenesse he did to be naught,
God workes so sweetly. God speakes to us
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fter the manner of men, but he workes in us as
the great God; he speakes to us as a man in our
owne language, sweetly; but hee workes in us
almightily, after a powerfull manner, as God;
so we must understand such phrases as these,
<hi>I knocke, open to mee, my Love, my Dove,</hi> &amp;c.
wee may take further notice,</p>
            <p>That the heart of a Christian,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> is the House,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17813:87"/>
and Temple of Christ.</p>
            <p>Hee hath but two houses to dwell in; the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>7. 13.</note> and <hi>the heart of an humble broken hearted
sinner;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can Christ come into the soule?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Hee comes into the heart by his Spirit,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> It is
a speciall entertainement that hee lookes for:
open thine eares that thou mayest heare my
word: thy love, that thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mayest love mee
more: thy joy, that thou mayest delight in mee
more: open thy whole soule that I may dwell
in it. A Christian should bee Gods house,
and a true Christian is the true Temple of God.
Hee left the other two Temples therefore, but
his owne body, and his Church he never leaves:
for a house is for a man to solace himselfe in,
and to rest in, and to lay up whatsoever is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to him. So with Christ, a man will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
his howse, so Christ will repaire our
soules, and make them better, and make them
more holy, and spirituall, and every way fit for
such a guest as he is.</p>
            <p>How shall we know whether Christ dwells in our
hearts or not.</p>
            <p>Wee may know by the servants what Master
dwells in an house, If Christ be in the soule
there comes out of the house good speeches,
and we watch the senses, so as there comes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
into defile the soule, and disturbe Christ,
and nothing goes out to offend God. When
we heare men full of gratious sweet speeches,
It is a signe Christ dwells there. If we heare
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17813:87"/>
the contrary, It shewes Christ dwells not there,
for Christ would move the whole man to doe
that which might edifie and comfort.</p>
            <p>Againe, where Christ comes, <hi>Assistance
comes there.</hi> When Christ was borne, all <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
was in an uproare, so when Christ is borne in
the soule, there is an uproare, corruption armes
it selfe against Grace, there is a combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
flesh and Spirit, but Christ subdues the
flesh by little and little. Gods image is stamped
upon the soule where Christ is, and if we have
opened unto the Lord of Glory, hee will make
us glorious.</p>
            <p>Christ hath never enough of us, nor we have
never enough of him, till we be in heaven, and
therefore we pray, Thy Kingdome come, and
till Christ comes in his Kingdome, hee desires
his Kingdome should come to us, <hi>Open</hi> (saith
he) <hi>Stupenda dignatio,</hi> &amp;c. (as he cries out) it
is a stupendious condescending, when hee that
hath Heaven to hould him, Angells to attend

Is there such love in God, to become man, and

Conversion, these very conceits; and <hi>when wee

            </p>

invited you to come to me, I knocked at the

no entrance, <hi>Depart from us</hi> said you, therefore
now <hi>Depart you from mee.</hi> What doe prophane
persons in the Church? but bid Christ depart
from them, especially in the motions of his
Spirit, they entertaine him in the outward
roome, the braine; they know a little of Christ,
but in the heart, the secret roome, hee must not,
come there to rule. Is it not equall, that hee
should bid us,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 41.</note> 
               <hi>Depart yee cursed I know you not?</hi>
you would not give entrance to mee, I will not
now to you; as to the foolish Virgins he speakes,
and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. Wisedome knockes, and hath
no entrance, therefore in times of danger, they
call upon Her, but shee rejoyceth at their
destruction; Where God magnifies his mercie
in this kinde in sweete allurements, and inviting
by Judgements, Mercies, Ministrie, and Spirit,
hee will magnifie his Judgement after. Those
that have neglected Heaven with the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
and advantages in this kind, they shall
be cast into Hell.<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Woe to thee Chorazin,</hi> &amp;c. as
you know in the Gospell. This is one thing
that may humble us of this place and nation,
that Christ hath no further entrance, nor better
entertainement after so long knocking? for the
entertaining of his vvord, is the welcomming
of himselfe, as it is, <hi>Colloss. 3. 16. Let the word of
God dwell plentifully in you. And let Christ dwell
in your hearts by faith. Ephes. 3. 17.</hi> Compare
those places, let the word dwell plenteously
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17813:90"/>
in you by wisdome, and let Christ dwell in
your hearts by faith. For then doth Christ
dwell in the heart, when the truth dwells in
us. Therefore what entertainement we give to
his truth, wee give to himselfe. Now what
meanes of knocking hath hee not used among us
a long time? For <hi>workes</hi> of all sorts; he hath
drawne us <hi>by the cords of a man,</hi> by all kind of
favours. For <hi>Mercies,</hi> How many deliverances
have we had (No Nation the like, we are a
Miracle of the Christian World,) from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
invasion, and Domesticall conspiracies
at home? How many mercies doe we enjoy?
<hi>Abundance together with long peace, and
plenty.</hi> Besides, if this would not doe, God
hath added <hi>Corrections</hi> with all these, in every
Eliment, in every manner, Infection in the aire,
Judgements in inundations; We have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of warres, &amp;c. threatnings, shakings of the
rod onely, but such as might have awaked us,
And then he hath knocked at our hearts by the
example of other Nations. By what hee hath
done to them, he hath shewed us what he might
justly have done to us, wee are no better then
they.</p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Ministeriall knocking;</hi> above
threescore yeares wee have lived under the
Ministerie of the Gospell, this Land hath beene
<hi>Goshen,</hi> a land of light, when many other places
are in darkenesse, especially wee that live in
this <hi>Goshen,</hi> this place, and such like, where
the light shines in a more abundant measure.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17813:91"/>
Ministers have beene sent, and varietie of gifts,
there hath beene piping, and mourning (as
Christ complaines in his time) that they were
like froward Children, that neither sweet pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
nor dolefull mourning would moove to
be tractable to their fellowes<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 17.</note> they had <hi>Iohn</hi>
who came mourning, and Christ comforting
with blessing in his mouth, all kind of meanes
have beene used.</p>
            <p>And <hi>for the Motions of his Spirit,</hi> who are there
at this time, who thus live in the Church under
the Ministerie, who cannot say that God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hath smote their hearts, those hard rockes
againe and againe, and awaked their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
partly with corrections publike and
personall, and partly with benefits: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
what little way is given to Christ?
Many are indifferent, and lukewarme either way,
but rather incline to the worst.</p>
            <p>Let us then consider of it, The greater meanes,
the greater judgement afterwards, if we be not
won by them. Therefore let us labour to
hould Christ, to entertaine him, let him have
the best roome in our soules, to dwell in our
hearts, let us give up the keyes to him, and
desire him to rule our understandings, to know
nothing but him, and what may stand with his
truth, Not to yeeld to any errour, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
let us desire that hee would rule in our
wills, and affections, sway all, give all to him;
for that is his meaning; when hee saies, <hi>Open
to mee,</hi> so that I may rule, as in mine owne house,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17813:91"/>
as the husband rules in his familie, and a King
in his Kingdome, hee will have all yeelded up
to him, And hee comes to beate downe all
whatsoever is exalted against him, and that is
the reason men are so loath to open unto him.
They know if they open to the Spirit of God,
hee will turne them out of their fooles Paradice,
and make them resolve upon other courses of
life, which because they will not turne unto,
they repell the sweet motions of the Spirit of
Christ, and pull away his Graces, building
bullwarkes against Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> as lusts, strange
imaginations, and resolutions. Let the Ministers
say what they will, and the Spirit moove as he
will, thus they live, and thus they will live.
Let us take notice therefore of all the meanes
that God useth to the state, and to us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and every one labour to amend one.
Every soule is the Temple, the House Christ
should dwell in, let every soule therefore
among us consider what meanes Christ useth
to come into his soule to dwell with him, and
to rule there.</p>
            <p>And what shall wee loose by it?<note place="margin">Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iderations inforcing us to entertaine Christ.</note> Doe wee
entertaine Christ to our losse? Doth hee come
emptie? Noe, he comes with all Grace, his
<hi>Goodnesse</hi> is a <hi>Communicative,</hi> diffusive good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<hi>Hee comes to spread his Treasures, to inrich
the heart with all Grace and strength to beare all
afflictions, to encounter all dangers, to bring peace
of Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost; hee comes</hi>
(indeed) <hi>to mak our hearts</hi> (as it were) <hi>a heaven.</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:17813:92"/>
Doe but consider this, hee comes not for his
owne ends; but to emptie his goodnesse into
our hearts, as a breast that desires to emptie it
selfe; when it is full. Soe this fountaine, hath
the fulnesse of a fountaine, which strives to
emptie his goodnesse into our soules; he comes
out of love to us; Let these considerations melt
our hearts for our unkindnesse, that we suffer
him to stand so long at the doore knocking,
as it is said heere.</p>
            <p>If wee find not our suits answered so soone as
we would; Remember, we have made him also
waite for us; perhaps to humble us, and after that
to incourage us, he will make us waite, for we
have made him waite. Let us not give over, for

us when we come to him,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 7.</note>, If he answers us not at

She acknowledgeth Christs voice in her sleepie
estate, and sets downe his carriage thus, <hi>how hee
knockes,</hi> and then also speakes, <hi>Open to mee,</hi>
And then sets downe what hee suffered for her,
<hi>My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the
dropps of the night.</hi> And that nothing might be
wanting that might moove her heart to respect
this his carriage towards her, he useth sweete
titles, a loving compellation, <hi>Open to mee</hi> (saith
he,) <hi>my Sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled,</hi>
as so many cords of love to draw her, so here
wants neither loving carriage, sweet words, nor
patience; <hi>It is the voice of my Beloved that
knocketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church as she takes notice of the voice
of Christ, so shee doth also of the meanes he
useth, and seeth his love in them all. <hi>It is the
voice of my Beloved that knocketh, saying, open to
mee,</hi> &amp;c. Here is also an other distinguishing
note of a sound Christian from an unsound, A
sanctified spirit sees Christ in the meanes, this is,
sayes the heart, the word of Christ, and this the,
mercie of Christ to take such paines with my
soule, to send his Ministers, to provide his
ordinances,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 12.</note> to give gifts to men, and men to
the Church. <hi>It is the voice of my Beloved that
knocketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wee must especially understand it of the
Ministeriall voice,<note place="margin">That Christs knocking is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Ministery of the Word.</note> whereby Christ doth chiefly
make way for himselfe into the heart, and that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17813:93"/>
by all kind of wayes dispensed therein: as gifts
of all so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts, some rougher, some milder, all kind
of Methods and wayes in the Ministery to
make way for himselfe, First of all by the
threatnings of the Law, and by terrours, as <hi>Iohn</hi>
was sent before Christ, and as the storme, went
before the still and calme voice,<note place="margin">1 King. 19. 12.</note> wherein God
came to <hi>Elias,</hi> so he useth all kind of courses in
the Ministery; and Ministers by the direction
of the Spirit turne themselves, as it were, into all
shapes and fashions both of speech and Spirit
to win people to God, in so much that God
appeales to them, <hi>What could I have done more for
my Church,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 1.</note> that I have not done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore let us take notice of this voyce of
Christ in the vvord,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and not thinke as good
<hi>Samuel</hi> thought,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 5.</note> that <hi>Eli</hi> spake, when God
spake; let us thinke that God speakes to us in
the Ministery, that Christ comes to woe us,
and win us thereby.</p>
            <p>And wee Ministers are the friends of the
Bridegroome, who are to heare what Christ
saith and would have said to the Church, and
we must pray to him, that he would teach us
what to teach others. We are to procure the
contract, and to perfect it till the marriage be in
heaven, that is our worke.</p>
            <p>And you that are hearers if you doe not regard
Christs sweete voyce in the Ministery, which
God hath appointed for the governement of the
world, know, that there is a voice that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
shake of. That peremptorie voice at the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17813:94"/>
day of judgement,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> when he will say, <hi>Goe yee
cursed into hell sire,</hi> &amp;c. And that God who
delights to be stiled <hi>a God hearing prayer,</hi> will
not heare thee, but saith <hi>Such a one as turnes his
care away from hearing the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 9.</note> 
               <hi>his prayer is
abominable.</hi> It is a dolefull t hing, that hee that
made us, and allureth us in the Ministery, that
followes us with all evidences of his love, and
adds together with the Ministery many sweet
motions of his Spirit, that he should delight in
the destruction of his creatures, and not indure
the sight of them, <hi>Depart away from me yee cursed
into hell fire,</hi> &amp;c. There are scarce any in the
Church, but Christ hath allured at one time or
other to come in, and in many he opens their
understandings in a great measure, and knocks
upon their hearts, that they (as it were) halfe
open unto Christ, like <hi>Agrippa</hi> that said to <hi>Paul,
Thou almost perswadest mee to be a Christian.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note>

Herod <hi>did many things, and he heard gladly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 6. 20.</note> They
are halfe open, seeme to open, but are not
effectually converted, but at last they see, that
further yeelding will not stand with that which
they resolve not to part with; their lusts, their
present condition that they make their God,
and their heaven, whereupon they shutte the
doore againe, when they have opened it a little
to the motions of Gods Spirit, they dare give no
further way, because they cannot learne the first
lesson in Christs schoole, to denie themselves,
and take up their crosse.</p>
            <p>This is an undoubted conclusion, our blessed

There is no wicked man in the Church, that

            <p>Thus we see that Christ doth condescend so

low as to account it almost a part of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to have our soules for a Temple to dwell
in, to rule there. Therefore he makes all this
earnest suit, with strong expressions what he
suffereth.</p>
            <p>And since Christ beares this great and large
affection to his poore Church, It may incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us to pray heartily for the same, and to
spread before God the state thereof. <hi>Why Lord?
it is that part of the world that is thy Sister, thy
Love, thy Dove, thy undefiled: the Communion
with whom thou livst above all the world besides.</hi>
It is a strong argument to prevaile with God.
Therefore let us commend the state of the
Church at this time, or at any time with this
confidence. <hi>Lord, it is the Church that thou lovest.</hi>
They thought they prevailed much with Christ
when thy laboured to bring him to <hi>Lazarus,</hi>

It is good to thinke of prevailing arguments,
not to moove God so much, as our owne hearts,
to strengthen our faith to prevaile with God,
which is much, fortified with the confideration
of Christs wonderous loving expression to his

his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>pittie</hi> mooves him to desire further

cleaves to things worse then it selfe. If a man
were anatomized, and seene into, hee would be

Christ therefore out of pittie to our soules,
would not have the Divell there; Christ
knowes it is good for our soules to give way

wherein hee shewes what he suffered, which
sufferings are of two sorts. <hi>In himselfe. In his
Ministers.</hi> In himselfe and in his owne blessed
person, what did he endure? what patience had
hee in enduring the refractorie spirits of men
when he was here? how many indignities did
he digest in his Desciples after their conversion?
Towards his latter end, his Head was not onely
filled with the dropps, but his bodie filled with
drops of bloud. Drops of bloud came from
him, because of the anguish of his Spirit, and
the sense of Gods wrath for our sinnes. Upon
the Crosse, what did hee indure there? that
sense of Gods anger there was onely for our
sinnes.<note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>My God my God, why hast thou forsaken
mee?</hi> What should wee speake of his going up
and downe doing good, preaching in his owne
person, setting whole nights apart for prayer;
And then for what hee suffers in his Minister?
there he knocks, and saith, <hi>Open in them.</hi> And
how was hee used in the Apostles that were
after him, and in the Ministers of the Church
ever since, What have they indured? for he put
a spirit of patience upon them. And what indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
indured they in the Primitive Church,
that were the publishers, of the Gospell, those
sweet publishers thereof, drawing men to open
to Christ, were killed for preaching. So cruell
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17813:97"/>
is the heart, that it offereth violence to them,
that love them most, that love their soules. And
what greater love, then the love of the soule? yet
this is the Satanicall temper and disposition of
mens hearts, they hate those men most, that
deale this way most truely and lovingly with
them. It is not that the Gospell is such an hard
message. It is the word of Reconciliation, and
the word of life, but the heart hates it, because
it would draw men from their present condition,
and <hi>Therefore Condemnation is come into the world,
in that men hate the light,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 19.</note> because their workes are
evill.</hi> Is there any thing truely and cordially
hated but Grace? and are any persons heartily
and cordially hated in the world so much as
the Promulgers and Publishers of Grace, and
the Professours of it, because it upbraids most
of all, and meddles with the corruptions of
men, that are dearer to them then their owne
soules.</p>
               <p>Now what patience is there in Christ to
suffer himselfe in his messengers, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be thus used? Nor it is not strange to
say that Christ stands thus in his Ministers, for
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. It is said, <hi>That Christ by his Spirit
preached in the daies of Noah to the soules now in

now: and as he was patient then to endure the

this, if we have any love to divine things and
can set a great price upon the best things,
upon the word, because it is Christs word;
upon grace, prizing the image of Christ, and
the new creature, when we can set an high
value upon communion with Christ, the sence
of his love in our hearts and all spirituall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
and excellencies above all things,
this is an excellent argument of Christs love
to us, Our love is but a reflection of his, and
therefore if we have love to any thing that is
good, we have it from him first. If a wall that
is cold become hot, we say, <hi>the Sunne,</hi> of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry
must shine on it first, because it is nothing
but cold stone of it selfe. So if our hearts, that
are naturally cold be heated with the love of
divine things, certainely we may say, Christ
hath shined here first: for naturally our harts
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17813:102"/>
are of a cold temper, there is no such thing as
spirituall love growing in our natures and harts.</p>
               <p>You have many poore soules helped with
this, who cannot tell whether Christ love them
or noe, but this helpes them a little, they can
find undoubted arguments of their love to
Christ, his Image and servants, and of relishing
the word, though they find much corruption;
and this their love to divine things tells them
by demonstrations from the effects, <hi>that Christ
loves them,</hi> because there is no love to divine,
and supernaturall things without the love of
Christ first. And the graces in our hearts, they
are love tokens given to the spouse. Common
favours he gives, as <hi>Abraham</hi> gifts to his
servants and others, but speciall gifts to his
spouse, if therefore there be any grace, a tender
and soft heart, a prizing of heavenly things,
love to Gods people and truth, then we may
comfortly conclude Christ loves us, not only
because they are reflections of Gods love, but
because they are iewels and ornaments that
Christ onely bestowes upon his spouse, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

therefore be glad at the infirmities and failings
of any, that discover any true goodnesse in

no abasement that was ever so low as
Christ was abased unto us, to want for a time

There was an union of Grace, but the union of
solace, and comfort, that he had from him
was suspended for a time, out of love to us,
for he had a right in his owne Person to be in
Heaven presently. Now for him to live so long
out of Heaven, and oft times, especially towards
his suffering to be without that solace (that he
might be a sacrifice for our sinnes) to have it
suspended for a time, what a condescending

                  <hi>Vndefiled</hi> is a high word to be applied to the

so soone as ever we are united to Christ, our

is undefiled. Christ himselfe the second Person
is the first lovely thing next the Father, and in
Christ all things as they have relation to Him
are loved, as they are in Him. Christs humane

as that sacred Body of his, both making up one
Christ mysticall, And so is amiable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
even of God himselfe, who hath pure
eyes: yet in this respect lookes upon the
Church as <hi>Vndefiled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ and his Church are not to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as two, when we speake of this undefiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but as one. And the Church having
Christ with all that is Christs, they have the
field, and the pearle in the field together, and
Christ giving himselfe to the Church, he gives
his Righteousnesse, his perfection, and holines,
all is the Churches.</p>
               <p>But how can it be the Churches, when it is
not in the Church, but in Christ?</p>
               <p>It is safe for the <hi>Church</hi> that it is in Christ
who is perfect, and <hi>Vndefiled;</hi> for us to make
us appeare so: and so it is in <hi>Christ</hi> the second
<hi>Adam</hi> for our good: it is not in him as another
person; but it is in him, as the Churches Head,
that make both one Christ. The hand and the
foot see not; but both hand and foot have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by the eye that sees for them. There is no
member of the body understands, but the head
does all for them. Put the case we have not
absolute Righteousnesse, and undefilednesse in
our owne Natures and persons inheering in us.
Yet we have it in Christ that is one with us,
who hath it for our good. It is ours; For all the
comfort, and good that we may have by it, and
thereupon, <hi>The Church in Christ is undefiled:</hi> yea
even then when it feeles its own defilements.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17813:114"/>
And here ariseth that wondrous contradiction
that is found in a beleevers apprehension. The
nature of faith is to apprehend <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> in
the sence of sinne, <hi>Happinesse,</hi> in the sence of
misery, and favour in the sence of displeasure</p>
               <p>And the ground of it is; Because that at the
same time, the soule may be in some measure
defiled in it selfe, and yet notwithstanding be
undefiled in her head and husband Christ.
Hence the guilty soule, when it feeles corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and sinne, yet notwithstanding doth see it
selfe holy, and cleane in Christ the head, and
so at once there is a conscience of sinne, and no
more conscience of sinne, as the Apostle saith,
<hi>Heb. 10. 2.</hi> when we believe in Christ, and <hi>are
purged</hi> with his bloud, that is, there is no more
guilt of sin binding over to eternall damnation,
yet notwithstanding alwayes there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of sinne, for we are guilty of infirmities,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 10.</note>
                  <hi>And if we say we have no sinne we lie and deceive
our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> How can this be that there should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of sinne, and no conscience of sinne,<note place="margin">Object.</note> a sinner,
and yet a perfect Saint and undefiled?</p>
               <p>The Conscience knowes its owne imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
so it is defiled,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> and accuseth of sinne:
And as it lookes to Christ so it sees it selfe pure,
and purged from all sinne; Here is the conquest,
fight, and the victory of <hi>Faith</hi> in the deepest
sence of sinne, pollution and defilement in our
selves; at the same time to see an absolute, and
perfect Righteousnesse in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Herein
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17813:115"/>
is even the triumph of <hi>Faith</hi> whereby it answers
God. And Christ who sees our imperfections,
(but it is to purge and cleanse them away, not
to damne us for them;) at the same time hee
sees us in his owne love, cloathed with his
Righteousnesse, as one with himselfe indowed
with whatsoever he hath, his satisfaction and
obedience being ours, as verily as any thing in
the world is. Thus hee lookes on us, and thus
faith lookes upon him too, and together with
the sight, and sense of sinne, at the same time,
it apprehends Righteousnesse, perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and so is undefiled. This is the
maine point in Religion, and the comfort of
Christians to see their perfection in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>
And to be <hi>lost</hi> in themselves (as it were) and
to be onely <hi>found in him, not having their owne
Righteousnesse, but the Righteousnesse of God in
him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> This is a mistery which none knowes but
a beleeving soule; none see corruption more,
none see themselves freed more, they have an
inward sight to see corruption, and an inward
faith to see God takes not advantage at it. And
surely there can be no greater honour to Christ
then this, In the sence of sin, of wants, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
staines, and blemishes, yet to wrap
our selves in the righteousnesse of Christ God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and by faith beeing thus covered with
that absolute Righteousnesse of Christ, with
boldnesse to goe cloathed in the garments of
this our elder Brother, to the throne of grace,
This is an honour to Christ, to attribute so much
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17813:115"/>
to his Righteousnesse, That being cloathed
therewith, we can boldly breake through the
fire of Gods justice, and all those terrible attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
when we see them all (as it were) sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
fully in Christ. For Christ with his
righteousnesse could goe through the justice of
God, having satisfied it to the full for us. And
we being cloathed with this his Righteousnesse
and satisfaction may goe through too.</p>
               <p>But besides that there is another undefilednes
in the Church, in respect to which she is called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>undefiled,</hi> that is, <hi>in pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty of disposition,</hi> tending
to perfection. And God respects her according
to her better part, and according to what hee
will bring her in due time. For we are chosen
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o perfection, and to be holy in his fight, and
perfectly holy, undefiled and pure, we are not
chosen to weake beginnings.</p>
               <p>In choosing us, what did God ayme at? Did
hee ayme at these imperfect beginnings to rest
there? No, we were elected and chosen to
perfection; For as it is in this naturall life, God
purposed that we should not onely have all the
limbes of men, but grow from infancie to
activenesse and perfection; As God at first
intended so much for our bodies, no question
hee intends as much also for the soule, that we
should not onely have the lineaments of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
a sanctified judgement with affections
in part renewed; But hee hath chosen us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by degrees. As the seed first lyes rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the ground, then growes to a stalke, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17813:116"/>
then to an eare; So Gods wisedome shines
here by bringing things by degrees to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and undefilednesse. His Wisedome
will have it thus, or else his Power might have
it otherwise, because he will have us to live by
<hi>Faith,</hi> to trust his mercy in Christ, and not to
the undefilednesse that is begunne in us, but
to admire that which wee have in Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is the character of a judicious
beleeving Christian soule, that he can set a
price, and value the Righteousnesse of Christ
out of himselfe, labouring, living and dying to
appeare in that, and yet to comfort and sustaine
himselfe during this Conflict and Sight betweene
the flesh and the Spirit, that in time this inherent
<hi>Grace</hi> shall be brought to perfection.</p>
               <p>And Christ hee lookes upon us as he meanes
to perfect the worke of Grace in us by little and
little, as he meanes to purge and cleanse us, as
<hi>Ephes. 5. 26, 27.</hi> The end of Redemption is, that
he might purge his Church, and so never leave
it, till he have made it <hi>a glorious Spouse in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
He lookes upon us, as we shall be ere long,
and therefore we are said, <hi>To be dead to sinne</hi>
while we are but dying to it. And (saith he)
<hi>You have cruc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lusts thereof,</hi> when we are but crucifying it;<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> but
it is said so, Because it is as sure to be done, as if
it were done already. As a man, when he is
condemned, and going to his execution, he is a
dead man; So there is a sentence passed upon
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17813:116"/>
sinne and corruption, it shall be abolished and
die. Therefore it is dead in sentence, and is
dying in execution. It is done,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>They that are in
Christ have crucified the flesh with the lusts thereof.</hi>
It is as sure to faith as if it were done already.
So wee are said <hi>to fit in heavenly places with
Christ,</hi> wee are with him already.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 6.</note> For Christ
having taken us so neere in affection to himselfe,
he will never leave us, till he have made us such,
as hee may have full contentment in, which
is in Heaven; when the contract betweene him

thus upon us. Which should comfort us in

betweene Christ and his Spouse, is her maine

at them? how doe I proove them to bee

and betweene any thing in this world, that to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
any hinderance wherby we cannot keep

These excuses will not serve the turne,
not onely with God at the day of judgement:
but also our owne consciences will tell us, that
we are Hypocrites to make such or such a plea.

which sleights over duties under false pretences.
O! they can toile for the pelfe of the world, but
for matters of their soules, they turne off all

them, a <hi>Heaven</hi> to reward them, or a <hi>Hell</hi> to
punish them. Will such excuses serve the turne?
O no, they cannot with conscience, much lesse
with God the Judge who is greater then our
conscience. This is another way to cut off these
idle cavills, to consider that these excuses cannot

is not as he should be, for in a right temper, he
ought to be fitted to every good worke, ready
for all opportunities of doing any thing that is
good: because the time of this life is the feeds-time,
the time of doing good, the time of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
is in the world to come; when therefore
the heart is shut when any opportunitie is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

abundance of incouragements as wee have.
What a world of incouragements hath a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?
there are none to those of Religion, from
the inward content that it brings heere at the
houre of death, and in Glory hereafter. When
we are drawne to bee scantie, niggardly, and
base to things that are good, surely, this is not as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17813:133"/>
it should be, pretend what we will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
this is a fault. A Christian should at all
times be fit to yeeld and to render up his soule
unto God, because our life is uncertaine. When
therefore, we are mooved by corruption to live
in a state that we cannot abide to die in, because
we are under the guilt of some sinne: then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
pretend what we will, our state is so farre
naught, as farre as there is unfitnesse and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
to die. Let us have in the eye of our
soule therefore, what a Christian should bee,
aime at it, and think that when we stop at a lower
measure and pitch; that (pretend what wee
will) all is but from carnall wit and policie, the
greatest enemie that Religion hath.</p>
            <p>We pray in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Thy Kingdome
come, thy will bee done in earth as it is in Heaven,</hi>
great desires, and which should be the desires
of all our hearts. But herein we play the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
whilst wee pray thus that <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God may come,</hi> that Christ may rule in our
hearts over lusts and desires: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
we pretend this and that excuse, whereby
we may be led with this and that lust, we crosse
our own prayers: yet it sheweth what pitch we
should aspire to, <hi>To sanctifie the Lord in our hearts,</hi>
to delight in him, and trust in him above all.
When wee doe not this, wee fall short of our
owne prayers. And when we cannot bring our
hearts to suffer, and to doe what God would
have us to do, but are led away with our owne
wills, wee are not as wee should be; our wills
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17813:133"/>
should be conformable to Christs in all things,
It is our prayer, and therefore we should ayme
at it. Now, when flesh and bloud sets up a
pitch of Religion, I am well enough: and yet
prais, <hi>Hollowed be thy Name; Thy Kingdome
come, Thy will be done,</hi> &amp;c. Such a man is an
hypocrite; for his prayer leades him further
and further still till he come to Heaven, where
is all perfection: untill when, our life is a life of
indeavour and progresse. Though we be never
so perfect, yet Christ may more rule and set up
his Kingdome yet more in the heart, and further
bring our will to his in all things: when flesh
and bloud sets up cavills against this, we play
the hypocrites with God and crosse our selves.
Therefore, Let us justifie a measure of Religion
beyond our present pitch whatsoever it is,
justifie it more and more still. Thinke wee are
never as we should be till we be in Heaven; and
never blesse our selves, but thinke that wee
should alwayes be on the growing hand, and
whatsoever excuse comes to hinder us from
zealousnesse and earnestnesse (though it carry a
shew of reason in the profession of Religion:)
account it to come from our corrupt hearts.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Remember to doe all things to God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
not to man in our Callings both of Religion, and in
our particular Callings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To doe all our works of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and our calling to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not to man.</note> and then whatsoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
there is from men, we should not
be discouraged. Wee shall heare men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

thing for them. Why? doe it to God, If it fall
within our callings let us doe justice and shew
mercy: God will accept, though men doe not.
It cutts of many discouragements in duties; It
is best to have Gods reward. In this world it is
good to meet with naughty unthankfull persons,
because else we should meet with all our reward
here. It is good to doe somewhat for Gods
sake, and for Religion, let people be as unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as they will: to say, I did it not to you, but
to God. If a man regard the discouragement of
the world, he shall never doe that which is good,
people in the world are so unthankfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlesse
to those that wish them best, and that
doe best to them. But if a man doe a thing to
God, and doe it out of dutie and conscience, he
may hould on, have hee never so many discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
in the world, he shall loose nothing,
all shall be rewarded, and is regarded.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Likewise be sure to carry this in minde,<note place="margin">To bee perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that sinne is the greatest evill, and grace the greatest good in the world.</note> 
               <hi>That
sinne is the greatest evill, and grace and goodnesse
the best thing in the world.</hi> Therefore, there is no
excuse for sinne, from any thing in the world,
for it is the worst thing in the world, which
staines the soule, and hinders it from comfort.
And for grace and goodnesse in the inward
man, it is the best thing in the world, therefore,
purchase this, though with disadvantage. It is
best to avoyde sinne, though with enduring
evill; yea to avoide the least sinne, by endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the greatest evill. It is wisedome to doe
good with disadvantage, when the disadvantage
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17813:134"/>
is bounded onely in this life, the thing that I
doe, beeing a thing which furthers my reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the day of account. Therefore, have
this alway in consideration, whatsoever I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in this world, I will not sinne, this will cut
off a world of excuses.</p>
            <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 1.</note> let us labour to cut off all cavills,
and to <hi>arme our selves.</hi> It is the Apostle

that looke to be Crowned, let them

life: that this,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>I will not breake for all the world.</hi>
So, there is a purpose of living honestly,
a manner of life, not by starts, now and
then to speake a good word, and to doe a
good deed. But there is a purpose and manner
of life for it, he resolves alwayes for the best
things.</p>
            <p>And to this end begg of God his Spirit,
which is above all impediments. The more
Spirit the more strength and courage against

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9. 19.</note> Which is an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that naturally wee are very prone to
bee deceived in points of the greatest conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in the world, to flatter our selves (as
the Church doth here) with false excuses. <hi>I
have put of my coate,</hi> &amp;c. But wee shall now
see in this next verse, what becomes of all those
excuses, and backewardnesse of the Church
whereby she puts of Christ.</p>
            <p>My Beloved put in his hand by the hole of the
doore,<note place="margin">Verse. 4.</note> and my bowels were mooved for him,</p>
            <p>I rose to open to my Beloved,<note place="margin">Verse. 5.</note> And my hands
droopped with mirrh, and my fingers with sweet
smelling mirrh upon the hand'es of the locke.</p>
            <p>I rose to open to my Beloved,<note place="margin">Verse. 6.</note> but my Beloved
had withdrawne himselfe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This comes of her sluggishnesse, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
that Christ absented and withdrew
himselfe. There are 3. things here set downe
in these <hi>Verses</hi> now read.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Christs withdrawing of himselfe.</item>
               <item>2. His gratious dealing having withdrawne
himselfe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Hee doth not altogether leave his Church,
but <hi>puts his finger into the hole of the doore,</hi> and
then leaves some sweetenes behind him before
he goes. After which is set downe,</p>
            <p>3. The successe of Christs departure, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17813:140"/>
withdrawing of himselfe from her.</p>
            <p>1. Her Bowells were mooved in her, <hi>which were</hi>
hard <hi>before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Shee rose up out of her bed</hi> wherein for
merly shee had framed, and composed her selfe
to rest.</p>
            <p>3. Shee seekes and calls after him.</p>
            <p>But the Doctrinall points, which are to be
observed out of these verses, are these,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That Christ doth sometimes use to leave his
Children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> as he did the Church here.</p>
            <p>2. That the cause is from the Church her selfe,<note place="margin">Obser. 2.</note>
as wee see how unkindly shee had used Christ,
to let him attend her leisure so long. Therefore
hee taking a holy state upon him, leaves the
Church; The cause of his forsaking us, is in
our selves, we may thanke our selves for it.</p>
            <p>3. That though Christ deale thus with us,
Yet notwithstanding,<note place="margin">Obser. 3.</note> 
               <hi>hee never leaves us wholly,
without some footestepps of his saving grace, and
everlasting love, some remainders and prints hee
leaves upon the soule.</hi> So as it lingers after him,
and never rests till it find him, he alwayes leaves
something. There is never a totall desertion:
as we see here in Christs dealing, <hi>hee puts his
finger into the hole of the doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> he stands at the
doore, and leaves <hi>myrrh</hi> behind him, something
in the heart that causeth a lingering, aud restlesse
affection in her towards Christ.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That the Church by reason of this gratious
dealing of Christ (leaving somewhat behind him)
is sensible of her former unkindnesse,<note place="margin">Obser. 4.</note> is restlesse
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17813:141"/>
and stirrs up her selfe to indeavour more and more,
till shee have recovered her former communion, and
sweet fellowship with Christ, which she had before.</hi>
Shee never gives over till Christ and shee meet
againe in peace (as wee shall see in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,)
These be the chiefe points consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Christ doth use sometimes to leave his
Church,</hi> as here he doth, <hi>My Beloved had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himselfe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But what kind of leaving is it?</p>
            <p>Wee must distinguish of Christs leavings;
and withdrawings of himselfe. They are either
in regard of outward or inward comforts and
helpes.</p>
            <p>1. Outward, as Christ leaves his Church
sometimes, <hi>by taking away the meanes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the Ministery, <hi>or by taking away outward
comforts;</hi> which is a withdrawing of his, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if hee accompany the taking of them
away with some signes of his displeasure, or
sense of his anger, as usually it falls out. This
doth imbitter all crosses, and losses, namely
when they come from Christ, as a Testimony
of his anger for our former unkindnesse.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sometimes his forsaking is more inward;</hi>
and that is double, <hi>Either in regard of peace, and
joy,</hi> sweet inward comfort that the soule had
wont to feele in the holy Ordinances by the
Spirit of Christ; <hi>Or in regard of strength, and
assistance.</hi> There is desertion in regard of
<hi>Comfort</hi> and in regard of strength. Sometimes
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17813:141"/>
hee leaves them to themselves in regard of
strength and supportation to fall into some sinne
to cure some greater sinne perhaps.</p>
            <p>Now that Christ thus leaves his Church it is
true of all, both of the body and of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
member of the Church.</p>
            <p>It is true of the <hi>whole body</hi> of the Church,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
for you have the Church complaining,<note place="margin">In the whole Body.</note>

our corruption, the not valuing of things till
they be gone, wee set not the true price upon
them when wee enjoy them. When we enjoy
good things, we looke at the grievances which
are mingled with the good, and forget the good,
which when it is gone then wee remember the
good.<note place="margin">Numb. 11. 5.</note> The <hi>Israelites</hi> could remember their

So because <hi>Manna</hi> was present, they despised
<hi>Manna,</hi> and that upon one inconvenience it had,
<hi>It was ordinary with them.</hi> Thus the corrupt
heart of man is prone in the enjoying of favours,
If it have any grievance, it murmures at that,
and it troubles and makes them forget all the
goodnesse and sweetenesse of what they enjoy.
But on the contrary when God withdrawes
those good things from us, then we forget those
former inconveniences, and begin to think what
good we had by them. This is the poyson and

Now all of us must sip of that cup, whereof

is to have God to forsake us, for the most part,
those beleevers who live any time, (especially
those of great partes,) God deales thus

thing, when God shall seeme to be angry with
us, and our conscience at the same time shall
accuse us, when the Divell shall lay sinnes hard
to our charge, and some affliction at the same
time lie heavy upon the sore and guilty soule.
If we have not somewhat layed up before hand,
what will become of the poore soule, when
Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, and all shall seeme

we tremble not at Gods judgements, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and at the signes of them;</hi> with many such
things. Where these dispositions are, we need
not wonder if wee find not the comforts of
Christ, and of the Holy Ghost in us with the
gratious presence of his Spirit; the cause is in
our selves. But security hath beene at large
spoken of before, where the Churches <hi>sleepe</hi>
was handled, therefore the point shall not be
here inlarged, but onely some use made of it,
as may serve for the present purpose.</p>
            <p>If Christ should take away the comforts that
we enjoy,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> and remoove himselfe; and his
dwelling from us, (for he is now yet among
us and knocks at our doores,) doe we not give
him just cause to depart? what a spirit of slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
possesseth us, which will be awaked with
nothing to seeke after Christ? how few lay
hould upon God, presse upon him, wrestle with
him by prayer? to hide themselves before the
evill day come, as they should doe. Therefore
if Christ have absented himselfe a long time
from the Church in generall, and withdrawne
the comfort and presence of his ordinances
and in particular withheld the sweet comforts
of our spirits, and our peace, so that we see him
in the contrary signes of his displeasure and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17813:146"/>
anger, as if hee did not regard and respect us,
we have given him just cause so to doe. Wee
see here how the Church used Christ and so
doe we with the like security, and a spirit of
slumber, with unkindnesse, notwithstanding all
the provocations that Christ useth to winne us;
hee leaves us not, untill he be left first, for he
desires to have neerer acquaintance, communion
and fellowship with the soule; as we have seene
in the former verse, <hi>My love, my dove, my unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,

doe, and walke more in the comforts of the

that is one order of his dispensation: and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he sees that that is neglected, then hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
his comforts and hides his gratious
countenance, yet he is then present still in an
other order and way, though we discerne it not,
that is, in a way of humbling the soule, letting it
see its sinne. So here howsoever Christ had
withdrawne himselfe in regard of this manner
of his dealing, in respect of comfort, that the
Church did not now see his grace, favour, yet
he left behind him a spirit of grace, to affect her
heart with griefe, sorrow, and shame, and to
stirre up her indeavours to seeke after him, (as
it is said here,) <hi>I rose to open to my Beloved and
my hands dropt myrrh, and my fingers sweet swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

            <p>I speake to any Christians experience, if in

            <p>Now whence came all this? from this that
is mentioned, verse. 4. <hi>My Beloved put in his
hand by the hole of the doore, and my bowels were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> for him.</hi> First for that expression, he put
his finger in by the hole of the doore. It implies
here that Christ before he departed left by his
Spirit an impression on the Churches heart
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17813:151"/>
which deepely affected her to seeke after him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fingers</hi> spoken of, are nothing but
<hi>the power of his Spirit:</hi> as the usuall Scripture
phrase is,<note place="margin">Exod. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 19.</note> 
               <hi>This is Gods finger, Gods mighty hand,</hi>
without which all ordinances are ineffectuall,
<hi>Paul may plant and Apollos may water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 7.</note> but all
is nothing without the working of the Spirit,
The motions whereof are most strong, being
<hi>Gods finger,</hi> whereby he wrought all that affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
in the Church, which is here expressed.
Christ before he leaveth the Church, <hi>puts his
finger into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ole of the doore,</hi> that is, he workes
somewhat in the soule by his Spirit, which
stirred up a constant indeavour to seeke after
him. For why else followes it, <hi>her bowells were
mooved after him,</hi> which implies a worke of the
Spirit upon her bowels, exprest in her griefe
for his absence, and shame for her refusing his
entrance, and whereby her heart was mooved,
and turned in her to seeke after him. From
whence thus explained observe,</p>
            <p>That outward means will doe no good unlesse
the finger of Christ come to doe all that is good.<note place="margin">Obser.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The finger of Christ is the Spirit of Christ,
that is, a kind of Divine power goes from him
in hearing and speaking the word of God, and
in prayer, there is more then a mans power in
all this, if these work any effect <hi>Christ must put his

            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:17813:152"/>Let us make this use of it therefore, not to
rest in any meanes whatsoever,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> but desire the
presence of Christs finger to moov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and to
worke upon our hearts and soules; Many care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Christians goe about the ordinances of
God, and never regard this power of Christ,
this mighty power, <hi>the finger of Christ.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they find nothing at all that is divine and
spirituall wrought in them. For as it required a
God to redeeme us, to take our nature, wherein
he might restore us; so likewise it requires the
power of God to alter our natures. We could
not be brought into the state of grace without
Divine satisfaction, and we cannot be altered to
a frame of grace without a Divine finger, the
finger of God working upon our hearts and
soules. This should moove us in all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God that we attend upon, to lift up
our hearts in the midst of them: Lord, let me
feele the finger of thy Spirit writing thy word
upon my heart. <hi>Turne us O Lord, and wee shall
be turned.</hi> Pray for this quickning, and in livening;
for this strengthening Spirit: all comes by it.
2. From this that it is said here, <hi>That Christ puts
his finger into the hole of the doore before hee remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it</hi> and withdrew himselfe, Observe.</p>
            <p>How graciously Christ doth deale with us,
<hi>That he doth alwayes leave some grace,<note place="margin">Obser. 2.</note> before hee
doth offer to depart?</hi> Let us therefore for the time
to come, lay, and store this up as a ground of
comfort, that howsoever Christ may leave us,
yet notwithstanding hee will never leave us
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17813:152"/>
wholly, but as he gave us his holy Spirit at first,
so he will continue him in us by some gracious
worke or other, either by way of <hi>comfort,</hi> or of
<hi>strength</hi> to uphold us. Perhaps we may need
more sorrow, more humility, then of any other
grace. For, Winter is as good for the growing
of things as the Spring, because, were it not
for this, where would be the killing of weedes,
and wormes, and preparing of the ground, and
land for the spring; So it is as needfull for
Christians to find the presence of Christ in the
way of <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>abasement,</hi> causing us to
afflict our owne soules, as to feele his presence
in <hi>Peace, Ioy,</hi> and <hi>Comfort.</hi> In this life we cannot
be without this gracious dispensation. We may
therefore comfort our selves, that howsoever
Christ leaves us, yet he will alwayes leave some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
behind him, as here he left some <hi>myrrh</hi>
after him upon the handle of the doore; some
<hi>myrrh</hi> is left alwayes behind him upon the
soule, which keepes it in a state and frame of
grace, and sweetens it. <hi>Myrrh</hi> was one of the
ingredients in the holy oyle, as it is <hi>Exod. 30. 30.</hi>
and so this leaving of myrrh behind him, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the oyle of grace left upon the soule, that
inabled the Church to doe all these things,
which are after spoken of.</p>
            <p>But you will say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> How doth this appeare
when in some desertion a Christian finds no
grace, strength, or comfort at all? that nothing
is left?</p>
            <p>It is answered,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>they alwayes do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> Take those
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:17813:153"/>
who at any time have had experience of the
love of God, and of Christ formerly, take them
at the worst, you shall find from them some
sparkles of grace, broken speeches of tryed
secret comfort, some inward strength and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against corruptions, their spirits end eavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to recover themselves from sinking too
low, and with something withstanding both
despaire and corruption. Take a Christian at
the worst, there will be a discovery of the Spirit
of Christ left in him, notwithstanding all deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This is universally in all in some measure
though perhaps it is not diceerned to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
himselfe, but to those that are able to judge.
Sometimes others can read our evidences better
then our selves. A Christian that is intemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
cannot judge of his owne estate, but
others can; and so, at the very worst, he hath
alwayes somewhat left in him, where by he may
be comforted, Christ never leaves his Church
and Children that are his wholly. Those that
are wholly left, they never had saving grace, as
<hi>Achitophell, can, Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> were left to
themselves. But for the Children of God, if
ever they found the power of sanctifying grace,
<hi>Christ whom he loves,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 1.</note> he loves to the end;</hi> From
whom he departs not, unlesse he leaves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
behind him, that sets an edge upon the
desires to seeks after him.</p>
            <p>Make this 2.<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> use of it, To magnifie the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
love and mercy of Christ; that when we

               </gap>erve the contrary to be left altogether, yet
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17813:153"/>
notwithstanding so graciously he deales with
us. Behold in this his dealing the mercy of
Christ, hee will not suffer the Church to be in
a state of security, but will rather (to cure her)
bring her to another opposite state of griefe and
sorrow, as we shall see in the next point, How
that which Christ left in the heart of the
Church, so afflicted her, <hi>That her bowels were
turned in her.</hi> Whereupon she riseth, seekes, and
inquires after Christ by the watch-men, and
others. So she saith of her selfe.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>My bowels were mooved in mee, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>What was that? My heart was affected full
of sorrow and griefe for my unkind dealing with
Christ. Hereby those affections were stirred up
(that were afore sleepy and secure) to godly
griefe, sorrow, and shame: For, God hath
planted affections in us, and joyned them with
conscience, as the executioners with the judge.
So that, when as conscience accuseth of any

                  </hi> or <hi>Commission,</hi> affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions

               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:17813:154"/>The observation from hence is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That security, and a cold dull state, produceth a

                  </gap>rowes and griefes.</p>
               <p>We usually say, cold diseases must have hot
and sharp remedies; It is most true spiritually,
security, which is a kind of lethargy, (a cold
disease) forgetting of God, and our duty to
him, must have a hot and sharpe cure; And
the lethargy is best cured by a Burning Ague.
So Christ deales here, he puts his finger in at
the hole of the doore, and leaves grace behind
to worke upon the bowels of the Church, to
make her grieve and be ashamed for her unkind
dealing. Thus he cures security by sorrow.
This is the best conclusion of sinne.</p>
               <p>And we may observe withall,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> That even
<hi>sinnes of omission</hi> they bring <hi>griefe, shame,</hi> and
<hi>sorrow,</hi> And in the issue through Christs sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

therefore prevent sorrow, shame, and griefe,
Take heed then of <hi>security</hi> the cause that leads
to them; yea of sinnes of <hi>omission,</hi> wherein
there is more danger, then in sinnes of <hi>commission.</hi>
The sinnes of carnall wicked men, are usually
sinnes of <hi>commission,</hi> most which breake out
outragiously, and thereby taynt themselves
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:17813:154"/>
with open sinnes. But the sinnes of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(who are neerer to him) are for the most
part sinnes of <hi>omission,</hi> that is negligence, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
carelessenesse in duty, want of zeale, and
of care they should have in stirring up the graces
of God in them, as the Church here, which
did not give way to Christ, nor shooke of
security.</p>
               <p>Let us esteeme as slightly as we will of sinnes
of <hi>omission,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vse.</note> and carelessenesse; they are enough
to bring men to hell if God be not the more
mercifull. It is not required onely that we doe
no harme, and keepe our selves from outward
evills, but we must doe good in a good manner,
and have a care to be fruitfull, and watchfull,
which if wee doe not, this temper will bring
griefe, shame, and sorrow afterwards; As here
even for sinues of omission, deadnesse, and
dullnesse, wee see the Church is left by Christ;
<hi>and her bowells are turned in her:</hi> For careles
neglect, and omission of duty to God, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
and forerunner of some downfall and
dejection. And commonly it is true, when a
man is in a secure and carelesse estate, a man
may read his destiny, (though he have beene
never so good) nay the rather, if hee be good,
Such a one is in danger to fall into some sharpe
punishment, or into some sinne; for of all states
and tempers, God will not suffer a Christian to
be in a secure, lazy, dead state, when he cannot
performe things comfortably to God, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or to others, a dead secure estate is so
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17813:155"/>
hatefull to him, (decay in our first love, this

it either goes before some greate sinne, crosse,
affliction, or judgement.</p>
               <p>My bowells were moved in me.</p>
               <p>And good reason, it was a suitable correction,
to the sinne wherein shee offended. For Christ
his bowells were turned towards her in love

Christ here leaves her to seeke after him, that
had waited and attended her leisure before, as
we shall see after.</p>
               <p>The next thing wee may hence observe, in
that, <hi>That her bowels were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in her</hi> from
something left in the hole of the doore by the
Spirit of Christ, is,</p>
               <p>That Christ hath our affections in his gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>He hath our bowels in his rule and governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
more then we our selves have. Wee
cannot of our selves rule our griefe, shame,
sorrow, or such affections as these, The wisest
man in the world cannot award griefe, and
sorrow, when God will turne it upon his
bowells, and make a man ashamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in himselfe. All the wit and pollicy
in the world cannot suppresse those affections.
For Christ rules our hearts. <hi>The heares of Kings
are in his hand,<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 1.</note> as the rivers of water,</hi> as well
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17813:155"/>
as the hearts of ordinary persons.</p>
               <p>If hee set any thing upon the soule to afflict it
and cast it downe, it shall afflict it, if it be but a
conceit, if hee will take away the <hi>raines</hi> from
the soule, and leave it to its owne passion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
away its guard, (for he by his Spirit
guards our soules with peace, by commaunding
of tranquillity;) So as let him but leave it to
its selfe, and it will teare it selfe in sunder,<note place="margin">2 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. 23.</note> as
<hi>Achitophell</hi> who being left to himselfe, did teare

in himselfe, you see what became of him; Let
Christ but leave us to our owne passion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
what will become of us but misery?
Hee hath more rule therefore of our passions
then we our selves have, because we cannot
rule them graciously, nor can we stay them
when we would.</p>
               <p>Therefore this should strike an awe in us of
God,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> with a care to please him: For, there is
not the wisest man in the world, but if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his guard from his soule, and leave him

he would make him his owne tormentor and

               <p>Here againe, as the conclusion of all this,

wondrous in <hi>patience,</hi> notwithstanding their
provocation of him; wondrous in his <hi>desertions,</hi>
wondrous <hi>in leaving something behind him in
desertions</hi> Those that are his he will not leave
them without grace, whereby they shall seeke
him againe. Nay, the falling out of lovers,
shall be the renewing of fresh and new love,
more constant then ever the former was. Thus
our blessed Saviour goes beyond us in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
taking advantage (even) of our security
(for our greater good) making all worke to
good in the issue,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> which shall end in a more
neere and close communion between Christ
and his Church, then ever before. Carnall
men feele not these changes, ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
they are not acquainted with Gods
forsakings. Indeed their whole life is nothing
but a forsaking of God, and Gods forsaking of
them, who gives them outward comforts,
peace and friends in the world, wherein they
sollace themselves, but for inward communion
with him, any strength to holy duties, or against
sinne, for to be instruments for Gods honour,
and service, to doe any good, they are carelesse.

or live long in a secure, drowsy sinfull state,
the continuance wherein is a fearefull evidence,
that such an one as yet hath no saving grace,
nor that he yet belongs to God, seeing Christ
hates such an estate, and will not suffer his to be
long therein, but will shift and remove them
from vessell to vessell, from condition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

Christian is trouble upon
trouble as wave upon wave,
God will not suffer us to
rest in security, but one way
or other he will fire us out
of our starting holes, and
make us to runne after him, how much better
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:17813:158"/>
were it for us then to doe our workes chearfully
and joyfully, <hi>so to runne as we may obtaine,</hi> then
to be thus hurried up and downe, and through
our owne default comming into desertions
and there receiving rebukes and blowes and
delayes ere we have peace againe, as it fell out
with the Church in the sequell, for this text is
but the beginning of her (seeming) misery.
The <hi>watch-men</hi> after this, <hi>found her, and wounded
her,</hi> &amp;c. But Heaven is more worth then all,
now that her affections are set on fire, from
thence shee bestirrs her selfe, is resolute to find
out her <hi>beloved,</hi> whom she highly values above
all this world. How her affections were stirred
by Christs putting in his finger at the hole of
the doore we have heard. Now followes her
action therupon, for here is rising, opening, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
calling and enquiring after Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Action followes affection.</hi> After her bowells
are moved she ariseth and openeth, from whence
we may further observe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That where truth of affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> it will discover
it selfe in the outward man, one way or other.</hi>
If there be any affection of love and piety to
God, there will be eyes lift up, knees bended
downe, and hands stretched forth to Heaven.
If there be any griefe for sinne, there will be
the face dejected, the eyes looking downe,
some expression or other: If there be a desire
there will be a making forth to the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.
For, the outward-man is commanded by
the inward, which hath a kind of soveraigne
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17813:158"/>
commanding power over it; and sayes, doe this
and it doth it, speake this and it speakes it,
therefore those whose courses of life are not
gratious, their affections and their hearts are
not good, for where the affections are good,
the actions will be sutable. <hi>Her bowells were
moved in her,</hi> and presently she shewes the truth
of her affection, in that she maketh after him.

wrought upon her, then she remembred what
Christ had said: all those sweet allurements
were effectuall now unto her, especially when
she saw that after those sweet allurements Christ
had withdrawne himselfe, for that is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

her soule failed after he spake; for so it should

find that their hearts are shut up and they cannot
pray as formerly when they had the Spirit of
God more fully, and when they find that they
cannot beare afflictions with wonted patience;
certainely Christ hath withdrawne himselfe;
(say they) This is first done when we heare
the word of God not with that delight and
profit as we were wont, when they find how
they come neere to God in holy communion
and yet feele not that sweet tast and relish in the
ordinances of God as they were wont to doe;
they conclude certainely God hath hid his face,
whereupon they are cast downe, their spirits
fayle. And doe not wonder that it should be so,
for it is so in nature; when the Sunne hides it
selfe many dayes from the world it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
time, the spirits of the creatures
lower and wither, we see it so in the body, that
the animall spirits in the braine (which are the
cause of motion and sence) if they be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
there followes an <hi>Apoplexie</hi> and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
So it is betweene Christ and the soule,
he is the <hi>Sunne of Righteousnesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note> by whose
beames wee are all comforted and cheared,
which when they are withheld then our spirits
decay and are discouraged. Summer and

of the sunne which comes neerer then.
So what makes the summer and winter in the
soule but the absence or presence of Christ,
what makes some so vigorous beyond others,
but the presence of the Spirit? As it is in nature,
so it is here, the presence of Christ is the cause
of all spirituall life and vigour; who when

man that never knew what this presence meant,
regards it not, can abide the want of it, he finds
indeed a presence of God in the creature
which hee thinks not of, there is a
sweetenesse in Meate, drinke, rest, and a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in honour, preferment, and riches; And
thus God is present alwayes with him. But
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17813:162"/>
other presence hee cares not for. Nay, hee
shunnes all other presence of God, labouring to
avoid his spirituall presence. For what is the
reason that a carnall man shunnes the applying
of the word and the thinking of it, but because
it brings God neere to his heart, and makes him
present. What is the reason hee shunnes his
owne conscience: that he is loath to heare the
just and unanswerable accusations that it would
charge upon him? but because he cannot abide
the presence of God in his conscience. What
is the reason hee shunnes the sight of holier and
better menthen himselfe? they present God to
him being his image,<note place="margin">1 King. 17. 18.</note> and call his sinnes to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and upbraid his wicked life. Hence
comes that satanicall hatred more then humane
in carnall vil emen, to those that are better then
themselves: because they hate all presence of
God: both in the word, ministery, and all
Gods holy servants; all such presence of God
they hate, whereof one maine reason is, because
they are melefactors, wicked rebells, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be so. And as a malefactor connot
endure so much as the thought of the judge,
so they cannot thinke of God otherwife (in that
course they are in) then of a judge, whereupon
they tremble and quake at the very thought of
him, and avoyd his presence.</p>

Wicked men love not to be arraigned, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,

time, therfore whatsoever presents to them
their future terrible estate, they cannot abide it.
It is an evidence of a man in a cursed condition,
thus not to endure the presence of God: but
what shall God and Christ say to them at the
day of judgement? It was the desire of such
men not to have to doe with the presence of
God here, and it is just with Christ to answer
them there as they answer him now, <hi>Depart
depart,<note place="margin">Iob 22. 17.</note> we will have none of thy wayes</hi> (say they)
<hi>depart ye cursed</hi> (saith he) He doth but answer

               <p>But you see the Child of God is cleane of
another temper, he cannot be content to be
without the presence of God and of his Spirit
inlightning, quickning, strengthening and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

finds not his presence helping him, when he
finds Christ his life is absent from him, he is
presently discouraged.<note place="margin">Col. 3. 4.</note> For, <hi>Christ is our life.</hi>
Now when a mans life fayles all fayles, when
therefore a man finds his spirituall taste and
comfort not as it was before, then oh, <hi>the life of

Carnall men when they find the sence of Gods

               <p>It is good to observe this kind of Christs dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

see after it was with the Church, he seemes

her affection and to make her ashamed of her
former unkindnesse, and to sit surer and hold
faster then she did before, all ends in a most

the malignant humours: so by the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Spirit that is in us, let us set all our

his children for the most part in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their conversion (in their first love)
experience of his love to ravishment? Jt is, that
afterwards they may have recourse to that

and withall to stirre up endeavours, and hope;
that finding it not so well with them now as
formerly it hath binn,<note place="margin">Hose. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7</note> by comparing state with

               <p>And as the remembrance of former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
serve to excite endeavour, so to stirre up
<hi>Hope.</hi> I hope it shall be as it was, because God
is Immutable. I change but Christ alters not,
the inferiour elementary world changes, heere
is faire weather and foule, but the Sunne keepes
his perpetuall course; and as in the gloomiest
day that ever was there was light enough to
make it day and to distinguish it from night,
(though the Sunne did not shine) So in the most
disconsolate state of a Christian soule, there is
light enough in the soule to shew that the <hi>Sunne
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17813:171"/>
of Righteousnesse</hi> is there, and that Christ hath
shined upon the soule,<note place="margin">Psal. 112. 4.</note> that it is day with the
soule and not night.</p>
               <p>5. And learne when wee are in this condition
to waite Gods leasure, for hee hath waited ours.
It is for our good, to prepare us for further
blessings, to mortifie and subdue our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to inlarge the capacity of the soule that
the Lord absents himselfe, therefore <hi>Bernard</hi>
saith well, <hi>Tibi accidit</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Christ comes and
goes away for our good,</hi> when hee withdrawes
the sence of his love, the soule thereupon is
stretched with desire, that it may bee as it was
in former time, in the daies of old. Thus much
for that, <hi>I sought him but I could not find him,
I called but hee gave me no answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere wee must answer one objection before
wee leave the words.<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>This seemes to contradict

in one meanes and not in another, they seeke
Christ in reading and not in the ordinance of
hearing, in private meditation, but not in the
communion of Saints; wee must goe through
all meanes to seeke Christ, not one must bee
left. Thus if wee will seeke him, undoubtedly
hee will make good his promise. Nay in some
sort, <hi>hee is found before hee is sought,</hi> for hee is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17813:171"/>
in our soules to stirre up desire of seeking him,
hee prevents us with desires and answers us
in some sort before wee pray, <hi>when hee gives

soule once inflamed with an heavenly fire, and
acquainted with her first originall, cannot be at
rest untill it find it selfe in that comfortable way
which certainely leads homewards.</p>
            <p>An instance whereof we have in the Church
heere, who having lost her sweet communion
with Christ, and so paid dearly for her former
neglect and slighting his kind invitations, (as
being troubled, restlesse in mind, <hi>beaten and
wounded by the watch-men,</hi> bereft of her vaile,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Yet this heavenly fire of the blessed spirit,
this <hi>water of life</hi> so restlesly springing in her,
makes her <hi>sicknesse of love</hi> and ardent desire after
Christ to be such, that she cannot containe her

            <p>Thus we may see that the way to Heaven is
full of changes, the strength of corruption over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouds
many times and damps our joyes. How
many severall tempers hath the Church beene
in? Sometimes she is all compounded of joy
vehemently desiring kisses of her best beloved,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17813:185"/>
she holds her beloved fast and will not let him
goe, and sometimes againe she is gone, hath lost
her beloved, is in a sea of troubles, seekes and
cannot find him, becomes sluggish, negligent,
overtaken with selfelove, after which when she
hath smarted for her omissions (as here againe)
she is all a fire after Christ (as we say) no ground
will hold her, away she flies after him, and is
restlesse untill she finde him, where by the way
we see, <hi>That permanency and stability is for the
life to to come; here our portion is to expect changes,
storms and tempests,</hi> therefore they must not be

and passion breeds astonishment, in these
younger Christians, who wonder what that is
which can so draw away the Churches love,
and runne away with her affections. They knew
no such excellencies of the person the Church
so admired, and therefore they double the
Question unto her, <hi>What is thy Beloved,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>what is thy Beloved,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby we see the
excellency of the soule which aspires still
towards perfection, not resting in any state
inferiour to the most excellent. Therefore also
is the Churches sicknesse of love here, who
desires a neerer union and communion with
Christ then she at this time had.</p>

with a <hi>Question:</hi> Questions they breed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(as the Greeke Proverbe is) <hi>doubtings
breed resolution.</hi> Whereupon the inquisitive
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:17813:199"/>
soule (usually) prooves the most learned, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and wise soule, therefore that great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
counted it as a vertue amongst his
schollers, that they would be inquisitive. So
the schollers of Righteousnesse are inquisitive,
<hi>they inquire the way to Canaan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 50.</note> 
               <hi>and the way to Zion
with their faces thitherwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is aspeciall part of Christians wisdome to
improove the excellency of others by Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">That is a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all point of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to improue the gifts of other by questions.</note>
to have a bucket to draw out of the deepe
wells of others (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) <hi>the heart of
a wise man is as deepe waters, but a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
can tell how to fetch those waters out:</hi>
There be many men of deepe and excellent
parts which are lost in the world, because men
know not how to improove them. Therefore
it is good while we have men excellent in any
kind, to make use of them. It is an honour to
God as well as a commoditie to our selves.
Doth God suffer lights to shine in the world that
we should take no notice of them, It is a wrong
to our selves and a dishonour to God.</p>
            <p>What is thy Beloved more then another Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> point from hence is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Observ.</note> That if wee
would give incouragement to others to repaire to us
for any good, we should labour to be so excellent as to
adorne Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O thou fairest among woemen, what is thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi>
&amp;c. They enquire of her because they
have a good conceit of her: a world of good
might be done if there were bred a good conceit
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:17813:199"/>
of men in others; we say in sicknesse, <hi>a good
conceipt of the Physition is halfe the cure:</hi> so in
teaching, a good conceipt of the teacher is halfe
the learning: <hi>The daughters of Ierusalem</hi> had a
good conceipt here in their Questioning of the
Church: <hi>O thou fairest among woemen, what is thy
Beloved more then another Beloved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us labour therefore to be such as may
bring honour and credit to Religion,<note place="margin">That our indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours must bee to make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion lovely.</note> and make
it lovely, that what we doe may make others
thinke we doe what we doe to great purpose:
which is oft times a speciall meanes and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their conversion. Though properly the
cause of conversion be the Spirit of God in the
ordinances: yet the inducement (many times)
and occasion, is the observation of the course
and carriage of those that excell and are knowne
to be eminent in parts and in graces, <hi>Emulation
ads spurrs to to the soule.</hi> Doe they take such
courses that are wiser then I, and shall not I take
the like course too? <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 11.</note> the emulation of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall be a meanes of the conversion
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when they shall see them imbrace
Christ, they will be incouraged to doe so also:
what shall we thinke therefore of them that live
so as that they bring an evill report, scandall and
reproach upon Religion? Great and fearfull is
their wickednesse, that by their ill conversation
like <hi>Hophny</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> discredit the ordinances
of the Lord.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Church thus answers the former
Question touching Christ, <hi>My Beloved is white

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance for all of love.</note> It is want of
wisdome amongst men to commend a thing that
is very lovely to others, and so to set an edge
upon their affections, when they cannot both
share; and the more one hath, the lesse another
hath of all things here below. But in Spirittuall
things there is no envie at the sharing of others
in that we love our selves: because all may be
loved alike, Christ hath grace and affection
enough for all his: he hath not (as <hi>Esaw</hi> speakes)
<hi>but one blessing:</hi> No, he can make all his happy.
Therefore the Church stands not upon tearmes,
when the <hi>daughters of Ierusalem</hi> enquire about
her <hi>Beloved,</hi> I tell you freely saies she what my
<hi>Beloved</hi> is: First in generall the answer is,
<hi>My Beloved is white and ruddie, the chiefest

            <p>My Beloved is white and ruddie, the chiefest

indeed some went backe of themselves (as the

Hee is of so sweet a nature that he never up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
those that followed him with their
former sinnes; as <hi>Peter</hi> with deniall, and the

Church is a company of despised people, that
are scorned of Pharisaicall proud spirits, who
perhaps have morallity and strength of parts to
praise them with. Now Christ takes part with
the broken spirits against all proud spirits,
howsoever he be gone to Heaven (where he is
full of Majesty) yet he hath not forgotten his
meekenesse nor changed his nature with change
of honour. He is now more honoured then
he was, for, <hi>he hath a Name above all Names,<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> in

<hi>Saul Saul why persecutest thou mee?</hi> He makes

And (as was shewed before) he is all

of horrour and confusion, and their faces of
shame, when they shall thinke, what hath Christ
made such sute to my heart to winne my love?
hath he ordained a ministery for to bring me in?
made such large promises, is he so excellent?
and was this discovered to me and yet would

we see what we get if we joyne with Christ,

him; and not onely so, but we gaine eternall
misery, and perish eternally. O what basenesse
of mind possesseth us, Christ left all things in
love to us, and we leave Christ for any paultry
thing in the world, almost to please and
content the humours of sinnefull men, to attaine
a few empty titles, to get a little wealth, injoy
a little pleasure. You see then the equity of
that terrible commination that you have, <hi>1 Cor.

we sinne against the Gospell; and then there is

Fleshly hearts that have runne so deepely into

a child from a full brest) which they have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

tender, it is an excellent advantage they have to

<hi>The Holy Ghost shall convince the world of sinne

So Christ the true <hi>Passeover</hi> we never rellish
truely without sower herbes, the consideration
of sinne with the desert of it. Christ savours
otherwise to a man humbled for his sinnes, then
he doth to another man not touched therewith:
otherwise to a poore man then he doth to a rich:
otherwise to a man that the world goes not well

with Christ and his excellencies when he doted

prize Christ without some afflictions, some

            <p>The Church doth not thinke it sufficient in
generall to set out Christ thus, but she descends
into a particular description of him by all the
parts of a body that are conspicuous. First in
generall observe hence,<note place="margin">Love is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver industious to set out the praises of the beloved.</note> 
               <hi>That it is the nature of
love upon all occasions to reflect upon the thing loved.</hi>
As the Church here, from things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in the world, borrowes phrases and
comparisons to set out the excellency of Christ,
exalting him above any other thing. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the soule of a Christian sees in Heaven or
Earth, it takes occasion thence to thinke of
Christ.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">The divers relations God takes upon him shewes the beames of his excellency in the creatures.</note> In generall observe from hence,
seeing the Church fetcheth comparison from
doves eyes, from the body of a man and other
things, <hi>That there are some beames of excellency in
every creature.</hi> There is somewhat of God in
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:17813:216"/>
every creature, this makes the meditation of the
creature to be usefull, there is none, even the
meanest but it hath a beeing, and thereby in a
sort sets out the beeing of God. Why doth
God stile himselfe a Shield, a Rocke, a Buckler,
a Shaddow, and the like. But to shew that
there is something of him in these, and therefore
to teach us to rise from them to him, in whom
all those excellencies that are scattered in them
are united.</p>
            <p>In innocency we knew God, and in him we
had knowledge of the creature, but now we are

is excellent. The Tabernacle was gold most of it,
though it was covered with Badgers-skins. The

Badgers-skins, not guilded as hypocrites, but
it is precious within; Againe, Christ as he is
gold, so he is fine gold, whole gold, he hath not
onely the crowne on him, but his head is gold

but their heads are not so: but there is such a

            <p>That is, his doctrine is as sweet as the lillies,

it being the nature of mirrh as it is sound
its selfe so to make other things sound. In like
manner the speech of Christ makes the soule
sound that imbraceth it. What was ever more
sweet then the truth of Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 20.</note> when he spake
himselfe, they all hung upon his lips (as the

the gratious words that came out of his lips,
<hi>Psal. 45.</hi> Grace was in his lips, all was sweet
that came from him, for it came from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

these affections of his heart. In the learned
language, the same word signifieth speech and
reason, to intimate that speech is but the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

the Psalmist is wonderous large. The law of

of the Lord are sure, and enlighten the eyes
more to be desired then gold, yea then fine

still. Do we stand ready disposed to suffer for
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17813:231"/>
Christ, of the world to be disgraced and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
and yet are we resolved not to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
nay doe we love Christ the more, and
sticke to his truth the faster? Certainely where
the love of Christ is, there is a spirit of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
as we may see in the Church here, who is
not discouraged from Christ by any meanes, he
is still the chiefe of tenne thousand, when she
was wronged for seeking after him, yet hee
was altogether lovely, whereas on the other
hand, you have some that for frownes of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
feare of losse, or for hope of rising, will
warpe their conscience and doe any thing.
Where now is love to Christ and to Religion.
He that loves Christ, loves him the more for
his crosse, as the Holy Ghost hath recorded
of some, that they rejoyced that they were
thought worthy to suffer for Christ. So the
more we suffer for him, the more deare he will
be to us. For indeed he doth present himselfe
in love and comfort most to those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, where love is, there it inlargeth
the heart,<note place="margin">Love enlargeth the heart and tongue in the praises of Christ</note> which being enlarged enlargeth
the tongue also. The Church hath never
enough of commending Christ, and of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out his praise, <hi>the tongue is loosed, because
the heart is loosed.</hi> Love will alter a mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as we see in experience, a man base of
nature, Love will make him liberall, he that
is tongue-tied, it will make him eloquent, let a
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:17813:231"/>
man love Christ, and though before he could
not speake a word in the commendation of
Christ, and for a good cause, yet (I say) if
the love of Christ be in him, you shall have
him speake and labour earnestly in the praises
of God. This hot affection, this heavenly
fire, will so mould and alter him, that he shall
be cleane another man, as we see in the Church
here, after that there was kindled a spirit of
love in her, she cannot have done with Christ,
when she had spoke what she could, she adds,
he is altogether lovely. Those that cannot speak
of Christ, or for Christ with large hearts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of good causes (but are tongue-tied and
cold in their affections) where is their love?
put any worldly man to a worldly theame
that he is exercised in, and speakes of dayly,
he hath wit and words at will, but put him to
a theame of piety, you loose him, he is out of
his theame, and out of his element. But tis not
so with those that have ever felt the love of
God in Christ, they have large affections, how
full is Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he cannot speake of Christ
but he is in the <hi>height, bredth, length,</hi> and
<hi>depth</hi> of the love of God in Christ, and the
<hi>knowledge</hi> of God above all <hi>knowledge:</hi> thus
we may discerne the truth of our love by the
expressions of it here as in the Church.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Church here is never content <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
till she finde Christ,<note place="margin">True love is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at rest till we finde Christ.</note> whatsoever she had, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

after him till she find him, so it is with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
if he have lost (by his owne fault) his
former communion with Christ, he will not
rest nor be satisfied, but searcheth here and
there in the use of this and that meanes, he runs

but hath now for a season lost, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and assurance of Gods love in Christ.</p>
               <p>Now if we can sit downe with other things
and can want Christ and the assurance of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">That content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Heavens sweet report of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the soule is a dangerous condition.</note>
that sweet report of the Spirit, that we
are his, and yet be contented well enough, here
is an ill signe, that a man is in an ill condition, the
Church was not so disposed here, she was never
quiet nor gives over her inquisition and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Christ, that by speaking of the object,
she might warme her affections, untill at the
last she meets with Christ, these and the like
signes there are of the truth of the love of
Christ.<note place="margin">A signe of true flaming love to Christ.</note> But where there is a flaming love of
Christ, there is this degree further, a desire of
the appearance of Christ, a desire of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
For if Christ be so lovely in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
If we finde such sweetnesse in the
Word and Sacraments, in the communion
of Saints, in the motions of the Spirit. What
is the sweetnesse (thinke you) which the soules
in Heaven enjoy, where they see Christ face to
face, see him as he is, hereupon the Spouse
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:17813:232"/>
saith <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his
mouth:</hi> Oh that I might live in his presence,
this is the desire of a Christian soule. When
the flame of love is kindled in any strength,
Oh that I might see him, and therefore it longs
even for death, for as farre as a man is spirituall,
he desires to bee dissolved, and to bee with
Christ, as <hi>Simeon,</hi> when he saw him (though
in his abasement) <hi>Now I have enough, let thy
servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seene
thy salvation.</hi> The presence of Christ (though
it were but in the wombe) When <hi>Mary</hi>
the mother of Christ came to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
it caused the Babe that was in her wombe to
spring. Such comfort there is in the presence
of Christ (though he be but in the wombe)
as it made <hi>Iohn</hi> to spring. What then shall be
his presence in Heaven, how would it make
the heart spring there thinke you? For that
which is most lovely in Christ is to come.
Therefore the Saints that have any degree of
grace in the new Testament, they are set out
by this description, they were such as loved
the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: how
can it be otherwise, if they love Christ, they
love the appearing of Christ, wherein we shall
be made lovely, as he is lovely.</p>

when we shall see him, and he was dispised of

him to him, made no body of him (as the
word in the Originall is) they looked upon
the outside of Christ in the flesh when he was
abased. <hi>There was no forme nor beauty in him</hi>
(saith the Holy Ghost) that is to the sight of
carnall men, but those that had the sight of
their sinnes with spirituall eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
judge of Christ. The poore <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So those soules that were inlightned, that
had the sight of their misery and the sight of
Gods love in Christ, had a high esteeme of
Christ in his greatest abasement. Therefore
if we have a meane esteeme of the children of
God as contemptible persons, and of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God as meane things, and of the
government of Christ (such as he hath left in
his word) as base, it is an argument of a sinfull
unworthy disposition in such a soule, Christ
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:17813:233"/>
hath never beene effectually by his Spirit, for
every thing in him is lovely even the bitterest
thing of all. There is a majestie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in all things of Christ, the censures of
the Church are excellent, when they proceed
and issue forth with judgement, as they should
doe, to deliver such a man over to Satan, that he
may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now if the Ordinances of Christ, the Word
and Sacraments, and the shutting sinners out
of the Church, if these things be vilified as
powerlesse things, it shewes a degenerate wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

If we have a meane esteeme of men that suffer
for Christ and stand out for him, if we account
them so and so, shall we thinke our selves
Christians in the meane time, when Christ is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
lovely, shall they be unlovely that
carry the image of Christ, can we love him
that begets and hate them that are begotten of
him, can we love Christ and hate Christians, it
cannot be.</p>
               <p>Now that wee may get this affection and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme

my friend,</hi> &amp;c. Which shall onely be touched
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:17813:236"/>
because we had occasion to speake thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
She cals Christ her beloved, howsoever
he had withdrawne himselfe in regard of the
comfort and communion she had with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>yet he is her beloved still.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is specially to be stood upon is,
that the Church here doth set out not onely in
parcels, but in generall her beloved Christ:
this is my beloved, she doth as it were boast in
her beloved, whence observe:</p>
            <p>A Christian soule seemes to glory as it were

            </p>
            <p>This is my beloved and this is my friend O

               <note place="margin">Divers ends why the Church thus in generall and particular sets forth the excellency of Christ.</note> but to unfold more
fully this point, there be three or foure ends
why the Church thus stands upon the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

and in generall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The one,</hi> To shew that it is most just that she
should love and respect him in whom there is all this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to deserve love,<note place="margin">To shew how just it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect so excellent a person.</note> both in himselfe, in regard of his

            <p>Secondly, <hi>To justifie her large affections before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the world and all opposites.</hi>
               <note place="margin">To justifie her strong affection to the stronger Christians.</note> For the world thinks,
what meane these who are called Christians to
haunt the exercises of religion, to spend so much
time in good things, they wonder at it for want
of better information; now the Church here
to justifie her large expressions, sayes, <hi>this is
my beloved,</hi> this is my friend, O ye daughters
of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>

there boasts of God,<note place="margin">To boast and glory in God.</note> 
               <hi>I will make my boast of thee
all the day long.</hi> So that Christians may not
onely justifie their course of life against ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but in some sort boast of Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi>
oft doth, and he shewes the reason of it, that
God hathy made Christ to us all in all, wisdome,
righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemption,
that whosoever glorieth might glory in the
Lord: for is it not a matter of glorying in the
Church when she hath such a head and such a
husband. <hi>This is my beloved,</hi> the wife shines in
the beames of her husband, therefore this
yeelds matter not onely of justification but of
glory.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And next in the fourth place, the Church is
thus large and shuts up all with a repetition,<note place="margin">To enlarge her owne affections.</note> this
is my beloved, <hi>To inlarge her owne affections
and to feed her owne love.</hi> For love feedes upon
this fuell (as it were) upon expressions and
meditations of the person or thing loved.<note place="margin">That love is wages to itselfe</note> Love
is as it were wages of it selfe, the paines it takes is gaine to it selfe, to the Church here it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument pleasing, she dilates upon a copious
Theame. I may truly say there is no greater
comfort to a Christian, nor a readier way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the affections after Christ, then to speake
oft of the excelleccies of Christ, to have his
tongue as the pen of a ready writer furnished
this way,<note place="margin">To aggravate her owne shame and unkindnesie in so sleighting Christs love.</note> this is my beloved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fift place another end of this may be
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17813:238"/>
               <hi>to aggravate her owne shame,</hi> as indeed Gods
children are much in this argument, that upon
their second thoughts of Christs worthinesse
and therewithall reflecting upon their owne
unworthinesse and unkindnesse they may relish
Christ the better. Therefore the Church here
that it might appeare to her selfe for her humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
how unkind she had beene to shut the
doore against Christ when he knocked, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he deservedly did withdraw himselfe
and made her seeke him so long sorrowing, I
tell you sayes she what a kinde of beloved he is,
thus and thus excellent. How did the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Gods kindnesse and love melt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
heart after that horrible sinne in the matter
of <hi>vriah,</hi> and the sweet lookes of Christ upon
<hi>Peter,</hi> that had beene so unkind, melted him.
So here the Church when she considered how
unkindc she had beene to Christ her beloved,
so incomparably excellent above other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds,
to let him stand at the doore, till his
locks were wet with the Dew of the night. The
consideration hereof made her ashamed of her
selfe, what so excellent, so deserving a person
as my beloved is to me, to be used of me so?
what indignity is this? Thus to raise up the
aggravation of her unkindnesse, no question
but the Church takes this course: for Gods
children are not as untoward worldlings and
hypocrits afraid to search and to understand
themselves, the child of God loves to be well
read in his owne heart and unworthy waies,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:17813:239"/>
therefore he layes all the blame he can upon
himselfe every way, he knowes he looseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by this, for there is more mercy in Christ
then there is sinne in him, and the more sinne
abounds in his owne feeling, the more grace
shall abound, he knowes the mysterie of Gods
carriage in this kinde. Therefore for this end
(amongst the rest) she sayes, this is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
and this is my friend, whom I have so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
used.</p>
            <p>And the last reason why the Church is thus
large was,<note place="margin">To wind up the affections of her new beginning Christians.</note> 
               <hi>To draw and wind up the affections of
those well meaning Christians that were commers
on, who were inequisitive of the way to Syon.</hi> O ye
<hi>daughters of Hierusalem,</hi> that you may know
that there is some cause to seeke after Christ
more then you have done before, I tell you
what an excellent person my beloved is, to whet
their affections more and more, and we see the
successe of this excellent discourse in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the next Chapter, whether is thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These and the like reasons there are of the
large expressions of the Church of the exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of Christ, this is my beloved, and this is
my friend, Oh ye daughters of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
But we will single out of these reasons for
use that which I thinke fittest for us to make Use
of.</p>
            <p>Let us then oft thinke of the excellencies of
Christ for this end, to justifie our endeavours
and paines we take in the exercises of religion
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:17813:239"/>
and to justifie Gods people from the false im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
of the world, that they lay upon them,
as if they were negligent in other matters, and
were too much busied in spirituall things.
You see how large the Church is in setting out
the excellencies of her beloved, &amp; then she shuts
up all (being able to say no more) justifying our
cause, This is my beloved, and this is my friend.
Doe you wonder that I seeke so much after him
then: or wonder you at Christians, when they
take such paines to keep their communion with
Christ in a holy walking with, and depending
upon God. These are no wonders, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how excellent Christ is, what he hath
done for us, and what he keepes for us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, that he will preserve us to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
kingdome, till he put us into possession
of that glorious condition that he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Le the hearts of men dwell upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of these things, and then you shall
see that Gods children are rather to be blamed
that they are no more carefull, watchfull, and
industrious, then to be taxed that they are so
much. Our Saviour Christ said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19.<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 19.</note>
Wisedome is justified of all her children. If
you will make good that you are children of
wisedome, you must be able to justifie the
wisedome of God every way, to justifie your
reading, hearing, your communion of Saints,
to justifie all the exercises of Religion from
an experimentall taste and sweetnesse of them,
(as the Church doth here this is my beloved)

in the next verse the Church vilifies the Idols,
our God is in Heaven and doth whatsoever he

aboundance of meanes: God hath not given

by the inward workings of his owne powerfull
Spirit to worke greater matters, and those that
keepe out of Gods reach, that will not come
into places where they may heare good things,
there is no hope of them, though there be many
ill fish in the net, yet there is no hope to catch
them that are without the net. So those that
are kept out of all opportunities and occasions
whereby Gods Spirit may worke upon them,
there is no hope of them.</p>
               <p>Let us learne this heavenly wisedome to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
our selves this way, by improoving
all good opportunities whatsoever whereby we

excellent thoughts. As therefore we love

               <p>The Church before was likened to a garden
culled out, an <hi>Eden,</hi> a Paradise, now there you

rivers which watered Paradise, the heads of

therefore the Church is compared to them:
other men are compared to thornes, not onely
for a noxious, hurtfull quality in them, but for

it is nothing but a company gathered out
of the world. Do we thinke that we are lillies
by nature; no we are thornes and briers, God
makes us lillies and then gathers us to other
lillies, that one may strengthen another. The
Spirit of God in his children is not a Spirit of
seperation of Christians from Christians, but
a spirit of seperation from the waste wild wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse

                     </gap>sea</hi> 2. 14. Christ speakes to the
heart of his Spouse in the wildernesse, that is, in
a place of no comfort, there are no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards
or pleasures, but all discomforts, there a
man must have it from heaven, if he have any
good in the wildernesse. In that wildernesse
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:17813:261"/>
that is in a desolate disconsolate estate; Christ
speakes to the heart of his children, there is in
the wildernesse oftentimes a sweet intercourse
of love incomparably beyond the time of
prosperity.</p>
               <p>Againe, to stay your hearts, know this will
not be long, as we see here the Church seemed
to be forsaken and neglected, fell into the hands
of cruell Watchmen, and was faine to goe
through this and that meanes, but it was not
long ere she met with him whom she sought
after. It may be midnight at this time, but the
night continues not long, it will be morning ere
long. Therefore the Church may well say,
<hi>Rejoyce not against me O mine enemy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Micah 7. 8.</note> as it is <hi>Micah</hi>

            <p>2. <hi>Because love descends,</hi> though it be of a
fiery nature, yet in this it is contrary, for love
descends, whereas fire ascends, the superiour
first loves the inferiour, Christ must descend
in his love to us, ere we can ascend to him in
our affections.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Because our nature is such that wee cannot

                  </gap>

Peter from Christ: depart from me for I am but a
sinnefull man</hi> So the soule of every man
would say if first it were not perswaded of
Gods love in Christ,<note place="margin">Isa. 33.</note> who amongst us shall
dwell with the everlasting burning, therefore
to prevent that disposition of soule, which
would rise our of the sence of guilt and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
God first speakes to us in Christ;
at length saying unto our soules, <hi>I am thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inds
if selfe so much beloved, so that our love is
but a reflection of his, <hi>I am my Beloveds, because
my Beloved is mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is with the Spirit of God, as with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in the soule and body of a man, there is
a marriage betwixt the body and soule, the
spirits joyne both together, being of a middle
nature, for they have somewhat spirituall neare
the soule, and somewhat bodily neare the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
therefore they come betweene the body

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:17813:266"/>
Christ is ours, the same Spirit makes up the
match on our part, and gives us up to Christ
againe.</p>
            <p>Let this then bee the tryall, that wee are
Christs by the spirituall Eccoe that our soules

our soules, whether in promises or in instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

Christ is mine, and the same Faith saith, I am

so that the maine worke of Faith is to be an
empty hand, <hi>Mendica manus,</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> calls

received, it gives backe againe, both our selves
and all that we can doe. as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. the
Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> gave themselves, and
then they gave their goods. Where Faith
is, there will be a giving of our selves and our
goods, and (by a proportion) our strength,
wits and all backe againe. This discovers a

would be a yeelding backe againe.</p>

12. The Spouse there is cloathed with the Sunne,</hi>
with the beames of Christ: but is that all? No,
<hi>I am my Beloveds, I am Christs, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
of Faith in Sanctification,</hi> the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that witnesseth Christ is ours, it sanctifies
and alters our disposition, that we can say, I am
Christs. It serves to instruct us therefore in the
necessary connexion of these two, <hi>Iustification</hi>
and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> against the idle slander of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
that sinnefully traduce that Doctrine,
as if we were Solifideans, as if we severed <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
from <hi>Sanctification.</hi> No, we hold here
that whensoever Christ is ours, there is a Spirit
of Sanctification in us, to yeeld all to Christ,
though this resignation bee not presently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>This likewise helps us (by way of Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to understand the Covenant of grace,<note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> and
the Seales of the Covenant,<note place="margin">A direction how to understand the Covenant of grace.</note> what they inforce
and comprise, not onely what God will doe
to us, but the duty we are to doe to him againe,
though we doe it in his strength. A Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
holds not on one side, but on both, <hi>Christ
is mine, and I am Christs againe, I will bee their
God,</hi> but they must have grace <hi>to be my people,</hi>
and then the Covenant is made up. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace is so called, because God is so
gracious as to inable us to performe our owne
part</p>
            <p>And so in the Seales of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Instanced in the Seales of the Covenant.</note> in
Baptisme, God doth not onely binde himselfe
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:17813:267"/>
to doe thus and thus to us, but binds us also to
doe backe againe to him. So in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we promise to leade a new life, renewing
our Covenant, and therefore we must not thinke
that all is well, when wee have received our
maker, though wee continue in a scandalous,
fruitlesse course of life. No there is a promise
in the Sacrament, the Seale of the Covenant
of grace, to yeeld up our selves to God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to Christ againe with our duty, then wee
come as we should doe, when we come thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
This for direction, <hi>My Beloved is mine and

            <p>Then againe, we see here the nature of Faith
in the whole Church, it is the same that is in
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:17813:267"/>
every particular, aud the same in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as it is in the whole Church. The whole
Church saith, <hi>I am my Beloveds and my Beloved
is mine,</hi> I appropriate him, there is a spirit of
appropriation in the whole, and there is so in
each particular. Every Christian may say with
<hi>Paul, I live by Faith in the Sonne of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that hath

my God and my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ground hereof is, because they are all
one in Christ, and there is one and the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the whole Church and every particular
Christian, as in pipes, though of different
sounds, yet there is the same breath in them.
So Christians may have different sounds from
the greater or lesser strength of grace that is in
the one and in the other, but all comes from
the same breath, the same Spirit. The Spirit
in the Bride saith come,<note place="margin">Reve 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> the whole Church
saith it and every particular Christian must say
it; because as the body is acted by one Spirit
and makes but one naturall body, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of many parts weaker and stronger. So
should there be a harmony in this mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
acted by that one Spirit of Christ, who so
regards all, as if there were but one, and regards
every one so, as he doth not forget the whole, <hi>Sic
omnibus attentus ut non detentus,</hi> &amp;c. Christ so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to all that hee is not deteined from any
particular, and he so attends every particular
that he is not restrained from all, there is the
same love to all as to one, and to every one, as
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:17813:268"/>
if there were no other, hee so loves each one
that every Christian may say as well as the
whole Church, Christ is mine and I am
Christs.</p>
            <p>In those things that we call <hi>Homogeniall,</hi> there
is the same nature in each quantity as in the
whole, as there is the same nature in one drop
of water as in the whole Ocean, all is water,
and the same respect of a sparke, and of all the
element of fire. So Christ beares the same
respect to the Church as to every particular,
and to every particular as to the Church.</p>

               <hi>I am my Beloveds

take notice in the first place from the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
Christ must be first ours before wee can
give our selves to him, therefore <hi>we must dwell
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the consideration of Christs love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">We must dwell in the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs love to us.</note> this must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and leade our method in this thing. Would
we have our hearts to love Christ, to trust in
him, and to embrace him, why then thinke
what is hee to us? beginne there, nay and
what we are? Weake, and in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
lost, then goe to consider his love, his
constant love to his Church and children,
<hi>whom he loves he loves to the end,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 13. 1.</note> we must warme
our soules with the consideration of the love
of God in him to us, and this will stirre up our
Faith to him backe againe, <hi>For we are more
safe in that hee is ours,<note place="margin">Gal 4. 9.</note> then that we give our selves
to him:<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 12.</note> we are more safe in his comprehenaing
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:17813:268"/>

we say of the mother and the childe both hold,
but the safety of the child is that the mother
holds him; <hi>If Christ once give himselfe to us,
he will make good his owne part alway, our safety
is more on his side then on ours.</hi> If ever wee have
felt the love of Christ, we may comfort our
selves with the constancy and perpetuity
thereof, though perhaps we finde not our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
warmed to him at all times, nor alike,
yet the strength of a Christians comfort lies
in this, that first, <hi>Christ is mine,</hi> and then in the

               <hi>that I am his.</hi> Now (I say) that
we may be able to maintaine this blessed
tradition of giving our selves to Christ, Let
us dwell in the consideration of his love to us,
and of the necessity that we have of him, how
miserable we are without him, poore, beggerly,
in bondage to the Divell, therefore wee must
have him to recover us out of debt, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich

us, and <hi>it is a protecting, preserving love,
till he brings us to Heaven his owne place, where
we shall ever be with him:</hi> The consideration
of these things will warme our hearts, and for

            <p>We should therefore in the next place attend

And is it love lost? No, but as Christ is the

love againe, as we see in this booke oft, <hi>my
Love,<note place="margin">How farre wee may love other things besides Christ.</note> my Dove.</hi> As all streames meete in the

<hi>We may love other things, and we should doe so,

Christ, and may be meanes of drawing up our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
unto Christ.</hi> We may love our friends
(and we ought to doe so) and other blessings
of God, but how? No otherwise then as
tokens of his love to us: we love a thing that
our friend sends to us, O but it is as it doth
convey his affection to us. So must we love
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:17813:269"/>
all things as they come from Gods love to us
in Christ.</p>
            <p>And indeed whatsoever we have is a love
token,<note place="margin">That all we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Christ, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are love tokens.</note> even our very afflictions themselves,
whom I love, I rebuke and chastise.</p>
            <p>Againe, that we may inflame our hearts with
the love of Christ,<note place="margin">Wee must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our hearts in the love of Christ.</note> as we are exhorted by <hi>Iude,</hi>
Let us consider the vanity of all things that
should entise us from Christ,<note place="margin">Jud. ver. 21.</note> and labour every
day more and more to draw our affections from
them, as we are exhorted, <hi>Psalm. 45. Hearken
o daughter and consider, and incline thine eare,
forget also thine owne people and thy Fathers house,
so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty.</hi> So if
we will have Christ to delight in us, that wee
may say we are his, let us labour to sequester
our affections more and more from all earthly
things, that we may not have such hearts, as
Saint <hi>I ames</hi> speaketh of, adulterous hearts. O
ye Adulterers and Adulteresses know you
not that the love of the world is emnity with
God.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is reason for this exhortation,
for all earthly things, they are all vaine and
empty things, there is an emptinesse in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is in the world (save Christ) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should not set our affections too much
upon them; <hi>A man cannot be wise in loving
any thing but Christ, and what he loves for Christ.</hi>
Therefore let us follow that counsell, to draw
our selves from our former company, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
pleasures, delights, and vanities, wee
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:17813:270"/>
cannot bestow our love and our affections bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then upon Christ. It is a happinesse, that
we have such affections, as joy, delight and
love planted in us by God, and what a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
is it, that wee should have such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
object to fill those affections, yea to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
and more then satisfie them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle wisheth that they might know
all the demensions of Gods love in Christ,
there is a <hi>height,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let us thinke of the demensions, the
height, breadth and depth of our misery out of
Christ. The more excellent our natures are, the
more miserable they are if not changed: for
looke what degree of excellency wee have (if
it be not advanced in Christ) we have so much
misery being out of him; therefore let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to see this, as to value our being in him,
so to be able upon good grounds to say, <hi>I am my

            </p>
            <p>Againe, let us labour to walke in the light of

that we may be able to say without deceiving

               <note place="margin">The maine end of preaching.</note> All preaching (I say) is for

saith <hi>Iohn, All our preaching is that wee may

               <hi>walking in the

to say wee are Christs, and have communion
with the Father and the Sonne, when yet wee
walke in darkenesse, in sinnes against consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

to have a great deale of knowledge, and then

never thinke of the fellowship with Christ
and with God, these things are meere riddles

Pastorall (to understand the word a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
a Song of a Beloved concerning a Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
therefore Christ in many places of this
Booke, he takes upon him the terme and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
(as it were) of a loving Shepheard, who
labours to finde out for his sheepe the fattest,
fruitfullest, best and sweetest pastures, that they
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:17813:273"/>
may grow up as Calves of the Stall, as it is
<hi>Malachy</hi> 4. 2. that they may grow and be well

               <p>You have (to give light to this place) a

up in the Church desire to know with

is in the greatest heate and storme of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as at noone day the Sun is hottest: <hi>For why
should I be as one that turnes aside by the flocks of
thy companions?</hi> that is, by those that are not true
friends, that are false shepheards, why should I
be drawne away by them? I desire to feed where
thou feedest among thy sheepe. Why should I
be as one that turnes aside by the flocks of those
that are Emulators to thee? as <hi>Antechrist</hi> is to
<hi>Christ:</hi> thus the Church puts forth to Christ,
whereunto Christ replies, verse 8. <hi>If thou know
not O thou fairest among women, goe thy way
forth by the footsteps of the flocks, and feed thy
kids beside the Shepheards tents:</hi> that is, if thou
know not, goe thy way forth, get thee out of
thy selfe, out of the world, out of thy former
course, put thy selfe forward, stay not complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
goe on, putthy selfe to endeavour, goe
thy way forth, whither? <hi>in the footsteps of the

flocks,</hi> see the steps of Christians in the best
times of the Church in former times, tread in
the steps of those that lived in the best ages of
the Church; <hi>feed thy kids,</hi> thy Christians, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Shepheards tents,</hi> the best shepheards;
marke where the Apostles and Prophets fed
their sheepe, there feed thou, and marke the
footsteps of the flock that have lived in the best
times, for of all times since the Apostles and
Prophets, we must follow those Virgin best
times. All Churches are so farre true Churches
as they have Consanguinity with the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Apostolicall and Propheticall Churches.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>we are now to goe out by the footsteps

marke the shepheards where they have their
tents. So these words have reference to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall,</hi>
especially to the <hi>Evangelicall</hi> times,
whereunto we must conforme ourselves, for the
latter times are Apostate times, after a certaine

Churches and truth, and embrace no
truth for the food of our soules, but that wee
finde in the Gospell. For Antichrist feedes
his flockes with winde, and with poyson, and
with empty things. For what hath beene the
food in Popery? sweet and goodly titles, as
if they poore soules had the best Pastors in the

in Religion, tush if we know that we

know enough, more then we can practise, they
thinke these <hi>Compendiums</hi> will serve the
turne, as if there were not a necessity of growing
still further and further in distinct knowledge.
Alas the soule needs to be fed continually, it will
stagger els and be unsufficient to stand against
temptation or to performe duties.</p>
               <p>A second generall point out of the text is this,
<hi>That as Christ feedeth still his flocke and people,
so hee feedes them fully, plentifully, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to mans inventions, seeing there is a fullnesse

is not in that is winde, or poison, in the
Word is a full kind of feeding. In former times
when they had not the Scriptures, and the
comforts of them to feed on, what did the
poore soules then? and what doe those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in Popery feed on? Upon stones (as
it were.) There was a dreame of an holy man
in those times (divers hundred yeares agone)
that he saw one having a deale of manchet to
feed on, and yet all the while poore wretch
he fed on stones. What folly and misery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

gnaw upon stones? and what is all the schoole
learning almost, (except one or two that had
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:17813:276"/>
better spirits then the rest) but a knawing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stones, barren distinctions, empty things,
that had no substance in them? they had the
Scriptures (though they were locked up in
Latine, an unknowne tongue) they had the
sweete pastures of Christ to feede in, and
yet all this while they fed (as it were) on
stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This should shew us (likewise) our owne blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

of the Gospell runne aboundantly,<note place="margin">Our happinesse to bee borne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such plenty of spiritual food</note> sweetly and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly.</hi>
There is a fullnesse among us (even
in the spirits of the worst sort) there is a fulnesse
almost to loathing of that heavenly Mannah:
but those soules who ever were acquainted
with the necessity of it rather finde a want
then a fullnesse, and still desire to grow up to a
further desire, that as they have plentifull
meanes, so they may have plentifull affections
after, and strength by those meanes: let us
know our owne happinesse in these times.
Is it not a comfort to know where to feed and
to have pastures to goe to, without suspition
of poyson? that we may feed our selves with
comforts fully without feare of bane, or noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
mingling of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> in the pot, which
would disrelish all the rest? To know that there
are truths that we may feede on safely. This
the Church in the former place, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 6, 7.
accounted a great priviledge, <hi>Oh shew mee

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:17813:276"/>
so then it is a great priviledge to know where
to feed, and so to be esteemed, that thereby
we may be stirred up to be thankfull for our
owne good, and to improove these priviledges
to our soules comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the second branch that must be touched
a little,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Observ.</note> 
                  <hi>is,</hi> That there is fulnesse no where but in Gods
house, and that there and there onely is that
which satisfieth the soule with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atnesse and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

they feed the soule, for we have many corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which hinder our Communion with
God, so that a Christian delights to have his
corruptions rebuked; for he knowes if he leave
them, he shall grow into further communion
with Christ, wherein stands his happinesse in
this world, and the fulnesse of his happinesse in
the world to come.</p>
               <p>If this be so, let us know then, that when we
come to Religion we loose not the sweetnesse
of our lives, but onely translate them to a farre
more excellent and better condition, perhaps
we feede before upon vaine Authors, upon (as
it were) gravell, vaine company, but now we
have our delight (and perhaps finde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>

which fed our idle fansie (vaine trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>es and
the like) now we have holy truths to delight
our soules, <hi>Beleeve it, a Christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

what comfort is to purpose till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> be downe right
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:17813:277"/>
and sincere in Religion.</hi> Therefore <hi>Austine</hi>
saith of himselfe, <hi>Lord I have wanted thy sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
over long, I see all my former life</hi> (that I
thought had such sweetnesse in it) <hi>was nothing
at all but huskes, empty things; now I know
where sweetnesse is, it is in the Word and Truth.</hi>
Therefore let us not misconceive of Religion,
as of a mopish and dull thing, wherein we must
loose all comfort, if we give our selves over to
the study therof; must we so? must we loose
our comfort? Nay, we have no comfort till
we be religious indeed; Christ feeds not his
among Thornes and Briers and stinking weeds,
but among Lillies; dost thou thinke he feeds
thee among unsavoury, harsh, fretting, galling
things? No, <hi>he feeds among Lillies.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

that thou commest to comfort, to refresh thy
soule, let us make use of this for our soules com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to make us in love more with the waies of
Christ.</p>
               <p>Now to seale this further,<note place="margin">How Christ the true shepheard feeds, is further explained.</note> see what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith in some paralell places, <hi>Psal. 23. The
Lord is my Shepheard,</hi> and what is the use that
<hi>David</hi> presently makes hereof? <hi>Why, I shall
want nothing,</hi> hee will feed me plentifully and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>boundantly, the whole <hi>Psalme</hi> is nothing but
a commenting upon that word, <hi>the Lord is my
Shepheard,</hi> how doth he performe the duty of
a shepheard, <hi>He makes me to lye downe in greene
pastures and leads me by the stil waters,</hi> it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meant of the body, but of the soule chiefly,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:17813:277"/>
                  <hi>he restoreth my soule,</hi> that is, when my soule
languisheth and is ready to faint, he restores
it, and gives me as it were a new soule, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth
it. We see say recreation is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a thing a new, so he restores my soule,
he gives me my soule a new with fresh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
Thus the blessed Shepheard doth, and
how? Because, <hi>he feedes among the Lillies,</hi> the
promises of the Gospell; then hee doth not
onely doe good to the body and soule, but hee
guides all our waies, all our goings out, <hi>Hee
leads us in the paths of Righteousnesse,</hi> and why,
because I deserve so much at his hands? No;
for his owne name sake, because hee hath a
love to me, because he hath purchased me with
his blood, and given his life for his sheepe,
hath bought me so deare, though there bee no
worth in me. He goes on, though <hi>I walke
through all temptations and troubles,</hi> which are
as <hi>the valley of the shadow of death,</hi> that is (where
there is nothing but disconsolation and misery)
<hi>yet I will feare none ill, thou with thy rod and
staffe dost comfort me.</hi> If I, as a wandring sheep,
venture to goe out of the way, thou out of thy
care being a sweete and loving Shepheard wilt
pull me in with thy hooke and staffe againe,
he hath not care onely to feed us, but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

for body &amp; soule and guidance, so surely
the goodnesse of the Lord shall follow me all the
daies of my life, for he is a perpetual Shepheard,
he will not leave us till he hath brought us to

               <p>The like place you have, <hi>Isa. 40. 11. Hee

and feeds them plentifully and sweetly, not

but a comment upon the text, therefore being
paralell places they may helpe our memories:
<hi>I will feed them in good pastures upon the high
mountaines of Israel, there shall their fold be,
there shall they lye in a good fold and in a fat pasture,
I will feed my flocke and cause them to lye downe,
saith the Lord God, I will seeke that which is lost,
and bring backe that which was driven away, I
will bind up that which was broken, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
that which is sicke, and destroy the fat and
the strong and feed them with judgement.</hi> Those
that are Christs true sheepe have somewhat to
complaine of, either they are sicke, or broken, or
driven away, somewhat is amisse or other, but
Christs care preventeth all the necessities of
his sheepe, he hath a fit salve for all their sores:
And (to apply this to the businesse in hand)
doth not Christ feede us <hi>among the Lillies,</hi> doth
he not now feede us with his owne body and
blood in the Sacrament? would you have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
food? <hi>My body is meate indeed, and my

the Sacrament, we feed on the body and blood
of Christ spiritually, and are refreshed thereby,
as verily as our bodies are refreshed with the
bread and wine. For God doth not feede us
with empty symbolls and representations, but
with things themselves, that the soule which
comes prepared by Faith, is partaker of Christ
crucified, and is knit to him though now in
Heaven; there is as sure an union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
betweene Christ and the Christian soule,
as there is betweene the food and the body

this sweet food of our soules with hungry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,

given us the best comforts of his Word, and

to God for this, that he will feede us so sweetly,
