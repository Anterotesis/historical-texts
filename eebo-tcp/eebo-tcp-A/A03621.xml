            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ecce agnus dei, qui tollit peccata mun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>di,

notwe looſt but our labour. this
mouche it hindrth it declarithe hym
that praythe to be aninfidele. To
pray unto that god or goddes that is
not able to healpe him nor hyre his

I hope this deteſtable errour is cum to

ſcripture Canonicall teachethe. But
there is an other yle as great as this to
be reprehendyd of all ſouche as know

how to pray a right. the benig of yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis

And ſay they be godd to put the

Exod. 20. Deu. 6. in the New there

But that Chriſt concerning the law

ſayd: Non ueni ſoluere legem, ſed
adimolere, Matth. 5. For aſmouche as
Chriſt lefft the commaundementes of
the old lawe unto the churche in the
which he ſaythe thow ſhalt not make

men authorite that ſay if ymagys be

They declare the infinite mercy of

of his mercy may be knoyn in this
that he would not that all man kynd

his mercy unto Adam not only by

ſonne, the promeſſe of grace and
the promis of euer laſting lief unto
ſouche as repent and belyue in hym.
The ſignes of his Ire and diſpleaſure
unto man is this that he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept

by the law made open the mater unto

            <p>Second: theffectt: the healthe of the

            <p>Thyrd: the uſe: that they ſhuld lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

Chriſt was made man, thuſe, and thef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect
of his humanite in theſe wordes:
Sic Deus dilexſt mundum, ut filium
ſuum unigenitum daret, ut omnis qui
credit in eum non pereat, ſed habeat ui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tam
aeternam. The cauſe of his cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
was the ſinne and ſikens of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
betyn by the ſerpent in paradyſe: thef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect
of his cumming was the healhe
of this ſikenis: the uſe of his cumming
was to belyue that his deathe upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
croſſe was and is ſufficient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinne and to optayne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

lyuely expreſſyd. and how many thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
concur as neceſſary unto the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:4402:48"/>
of ſinne and yet man only iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by faythe. The word of God, the
preacher of the word, Chriſt himſelfe,
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tricion of Nicodemus, the holy
gooſt that mouyd Nicodemusto cum
by night unto Chriſt, the conſentyng
wil of Nicodemus untho the wordes
of Chriſt. Yet only was hedelyueryd
from ſinne by the fayth that he had in
the deathe of Chriſt, as Chriſt ſaith: ſic
oportet exaltari filium hominis, ut om<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nis
qui credit in illum non pereat, ſed
habeat uitam aeternam. This muſt be
diligently markyd. For as the fathers
of the old church uſid the ſerpent, ſo
muſt thoſe of our church uſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
body of Chriſt, they lokyd upon
him only withe the yees of faithe they
kyſſyd hym not, they caſt no water u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
hym and ſo wayſhyd there yeys
therwith all, they touchyd hym not
with there handes, they eat hym not
nor corporally, nor really, nor ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially,
<pb facs="tcp:4402:49"/>
yet by there belyue they optay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nid
healthe, ſo Chriſt him ſelfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chit

belyue and loke upon the merites of
his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffryd upon the croſſe and
ſo to uſe his precious body againſt the
ſtynge of originall and actuall ſinne.
Not to eat his body, transformid into
the form of bred, or in the bred with
the bread: under the bread. behind the
bred or be fore the bread, corporally,
or bodely ſubſtancially, or realli, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
or ani ſouch wayes as mani men
to the great iniurijs of Chriſtes body
dooth teach, but as the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>el
only by fayth eat the body ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
not yet born, ſo by faythe dooth the
Chriſtianes eat hym now being aſcen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyd
into heauen and none other wice
as Chriſt ſaythe unto Nicodemus: om<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nis
qui credit in eum, non pereat grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
that we could as well eat his carnall
body, as we eat other meat yet the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
<pb facs="tcp:4402:49"/>
therof nothing auaylyd. And
if the Apoſtelles had corporally eatin
hym in his laſt ſupper it had profetyd
nothing. For he toke not his body of
the holy uirgine to that uſe to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
for the remiſſion ſinne Or to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
hym that eat him, but to dye for
ſynne and that wayes to ſanctifie his

by deathe the frute of his incarnacion
ſhuld be diſperſyd into the worold.

Likewyce he gouernith this churche

Noui quod non habitet in me, hoc eſt
