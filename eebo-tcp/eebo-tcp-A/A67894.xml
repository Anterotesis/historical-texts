            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS ensuing <hi>Discourse</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penned by mee about eight yeeres since, not only for recreation amidst my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer studies, but as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative also, by which I desired to fit my self, either for a voluntary exitement, or a necessary suffering; I intended it only for a private use: For I then residing in the County of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> which had newly groaned under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall tyranny of Bishop <hi>Wren,</hi> as did all other parts of his Diocesse; did know that the Presse was then onely open to matters of a contrary subject. But now upon the perusall thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that it might be of some use, in respect of the many distractions amongst us at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, when a blessed Reformation is so neere the
<pb facs="tcp:50931:3"/>
birth, and yet the Church seems to want strength to bring it forth, I was content to yeeld to the publishing thereof. I did at first, purposely omit the citations of those many and select Authorities, out of which this ensuing <hi>Discourse</hi> was drawn, lest the margin thereby should have swoln to a greater proportion then the <hi>Discourse</hi> it self, some whole Sections or Paragraphs being almost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely extracted out of the Records of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And I have through the whole <hi>Tractat</hi> chiefly laid down the matter of fact out of Story, not only extant in print, but yet remaining also in <hi>M. S.</hi> and have lest the debate of the dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part of it, to those, whose calling and leisure is more proper for it. My many present imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both publike and private, did scarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit mee to supervise it, and to amend it in some few places, which puts mee almost out of all hope ever to transmit to posterity any one of those severall great and more necessary Works I had in part collected and prepared (for the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Church and Kingdome) in the time of my leisure and freedome.</p>

The <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Turk</hi> have both upheld and propagated their abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the sword, although no indifferent and impartiall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can deny, but that the <hi>Romish Antichrist,</hi> in this one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb facs="tcp:50931:4"/>
exceeds the <hi>Ottomanish Muphti,</hi> in that he makes it a part of the Tridentine Faith, and so a <hi>Tenet</hi> of his Religion, to persecute, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy and root out all the Euangelicall party, under the false and personated names of <hi>Heretiques:</hi> Whereas the <hi>Turk</hi> acknowledgeth this <hi>Truth,</hi> that the <hi>Conscience</hi> neither can, nor ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; and therefore they permit the free exercise, not only of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion in all their dominions, but of the <hi>Popish</hi> also, in many places of the same, whom yet they justly abhor, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> do also (led by the morality of the second Commandement) for setting up Images in the places of their publike Assemblies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>Idolatry</hi> by adoring them.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, if it desire to intermix any superstitious Ceremonies or Idolatrous actions, with the power and purity of the Gospel, must likewise be enforced to borrow some part of the other Characters also from the Church <hi>Malignant,</hi> by enforcing the observation of such additions with the persecution of Gods children in their estates, goods, and liberties, equalling in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the shedding of their bloods; and reckoned up together by the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> for so many kindes or species of martyrdome. There are in all parts of the world, amongst the very <hi>Christians</hi> themselves, the greater number ignorant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and vicious, who neither regard to know the truth, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to suffer for it, but will alwayes run with the multitude, and be carried with the stream: They will of <hi>Protestants</hi> become <hi>Papists</hi> to morrow, rather then lose either goods, life or liberty; of <hi>Papists</hi> the next day <hi>Anabaptists</hi> with <hi>Sebastian Castellio,</hi> and <hi>James Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi> of <hi>Anabaptists</hi> the third day (if by that means they may escape danger, and rise to preserment) become <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Abisens:</hi> For, doubtlesse, in running from truth to falshood, as in turning from the <hi>medium</hi> to an extreme, there is no essentiall, but only a graduall difference. As <hi>Constantine</hi> filled the Empire with <hi>Christians,</hi> so <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> with <hi>Atheists</hi> and Persecutors.

               <p>THe <hi>Electorall</hi> House of <hi>Saxonic,</hi> upon the devesting of that brave and pious Prince <hi>John Frederick</hi> the true heire by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and the investing of the younger House, to usurp that honour, hath ever since proved a greater friend to the Popish party, then to the purer Churches of Christendome, of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Helvetick</hi> confession. <hi>Miurice</hi> that usurped that Dutchie and Electorate upon the incaptivating of the said Duke <hi>John Frederick</hi> his Cousin, first ruined the Princes of the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> union, to which himself had subscribed, and then casting an ambitious eye upon the Empire it self, broke his faith with the Emperor that had raised him; and having patched up that defection by the means of <hi>Eerdinand</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> afterwards setled in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Throne, he lastly perished by a violent death in a pitcht battell, sought against his fellow-Protestants, and left his brother <hi>Augustus</hi> to succeed him. This new Electorall family aided the Leaguers in <hi>France,</hi> against that victorious Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> the Great: They ruined and took prisoner their Cousin, the Duke of <hi>Saxon Weymar,</hi> (the principall branch of their House) in the Castle of <hi>Goth,</hi> in the time of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, they put in their far-fetcht pretentions to the Dutchie of <hi>Cleeve</hi> and <hi>Juliers</hi> in our dayes, and joyned their Armes with the Archduke <hi>Leopold,</hi> against the Marquesse of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> the indubitate heires thereof, whose right also was asserted by the whole Protestant party besides of Christendome. These were the fruits of their miserable errors in doctrine brought in and established by <hi>James Andreas Osiander,</hi> and their fellow <hi>Pseudo-Lutherans,</hi> retaining still their Images and Altars in the places of their publique worship, although they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them to minister matter of offence to many of the better lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and matter of superstition to most of the ignorant multitude. Nay, hence in the yeer 1580. did the <hi>Pseudo-Lutherans</hi> proceed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Ministers of <hi>Saxonie</hi> to subscribe, amongst other Articles,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50931:5"/>
to that monstrous error of the Ubiquity of Christs body, exploded with just derision by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all learned Papists: And from enforced subscription (which is ever for the most part the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of persecution) they fell in the yeare 1591. upon the death of Duke <hi>Christian,</hi> the best of all the Electors of the aforesaid <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> line and race, to shed the innocent bloud of that brave Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and faithfull servant of the State, <hi>Paulus Krelius,</hi> Chancellor of that Dutchy, for no other delict, but because he was a known friend to the purest doctrine, &amp; a stout Protector of those whom they stiled <hi>Calvinists.</hi> After which followed the suspension and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Urbanus Pierius,</hi> Professor of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and of divers other learned and godly Ministers; yea, within a yeare or two after, such was the furious virulencie of the Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sich,</hi> led by the Scholars of the Universitie there, (who have since, in these later <hi>Germane</hi> wars, fully tasted of the divine indignation) as they fell upon the houses and movables of such as embraced the <hi>Helvetick</hi> Confession, despoiled them of their goods, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted divers other outrages upon them. But most fatall have been the effects of this last Duke of <hi>Saxonie's</hi> hovering neutrality in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, when at first he refused to be comprised in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant union, entred into by the <hi>Germane</hi> Princes in the yeare 1617. for their necessary safety, when secondly he sided the yeare follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the Emperor <hi>Matthias,</hi> against the Protestant <hi>Bohemians.</hi> And thirdly, when in the yeare 1620. he joyned his Armies with those of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the second, (that but a few yeares before lay hid in obscurity, in his slender Patrimony at <hi>Gratz.</hi>) and so proved one of the chief causes of the utter subversion (for ought we yet see) of the Religion and Liberties of <hi>Germany.</hi> For had not <hi>Frederick</hi> the fifth, Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> rather aimed at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of true Religion in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> then at any ambitious ends of his own, he had never hazarded the peace, plenty, and quiet he enjoyed at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> to have accepted that controversall crown at <hi>Prague,</hi> and to have entred that Kingdome in a hostile manner, which for above the space of twelve moneths before had been filled with warre and misery.</p>

               <p>I Doe not finde that any higher or greater punishment was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon Hereticks themselves in the Primitive times, though they remained obstinate after all other meanes used for convincing them of their errours, then exile or banishment. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi> writing to <hi>Proculianus</hi> the <hi>Donatist,</hi> acknowledgeth such as erre from the truth, must be drawn home by milde instruction, and not by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell enforcement. And when Bishop <hi>Itacius,</hi> in the yeare 383. being a man of a turbulent spirit, and fierce nature, had caused <hi>Priscillian</hi> the Heretique, and divers of his followers to be put to death; he was first condemned for that bloudy act by <hi>Thcognistus:</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> afterwards meeting with some Bishops at <hi>Triers,</hi> that had partaken with <hi>Itacius</hi> in that cruell execution, would not so much as entertain any communion with them. <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in the Synod of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in stead of bloud and irons, caused a publick dispute to be afforded the <hi>Arrians</hi> themselves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had been before condemned by the Councell of <hi>Nice:</hi> The like mercifull provision did <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and <hi>Lewes</hi> the Good in <hi>France,</hi> ordaine for such as were counted <hi>Sectaries</hi> in their times.

               <p>IT is likewise contrary to the practice of the best Princes, and the wisest States of this latter age of the world, to make matter of heresie it selfe a capitall crime. <hi>Francis</hi> the first of that name, King of <hi>France,</hi> having decreed a persecution against the poore Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of <hi>Merindoll,</hi> and <hi>Cabrieres,</hi> and being informed by <hi>William Bellay,</hi> Lord <hi>Langay,</hi> Governour of the Province, that they were harmless men, very laborious in their callings, just in their dealings, loyall to their Prince, charitable to the poore, and very frequent in their prayers to God, &amp; their innocency being likewise cleared in a great measure by Cardinall <hi>Sadolet</hi> himselfe, he caused them to be freed from further persecution, till being falsly informed by one <hi>Minerius,</hi> a turbulent fellow, that there were fifteen thousand of them up in armes in rebellion, he rashly gave them over to the fury of their enemies, yet not as Heŕetiques, which he alwayes accounted them, but as Traytors, as he was then mis-informed of them. In <hi>Germany, Ferdinand</hi> the first, taught by the error of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his elder Brother, found no such meanes to make his Government happy, and his Empire flourishing, as to decree the liberty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Which course the good Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Sonne following, dyed as happy as he lived victorious. The <hi>Venetian</hi> State indure no Inquisitors in matters of Religion, nor if any of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be accused of Heresie, doe they suffer it to be questioned before any of the Clergy alone, who are thirsty after bloud, but before them joyntly together, with their Civill Judges. The first Monarch in <hi>England</hi> that made matter of Religion, a capitall crime, by a publick Act or Statute, was the usurper <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who having by the perswasion and assistance of <hi>Thomas Arundell,</hi> that traytor, Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his fellow-Prelates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and murdered his lawfull Soveraigne, <hi>Richard</hi> the second, to curry favour with those bloudy Canniballs, was forced to yeeld to the murdering of Gods Saints: since whose time the bloud of the Martyrs in <hi>England,</hi> have proved the seed of the Church, although by the short raigne of that Kingdomes unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Mary,</hi> their number comes far short of those in <hi>France,</hi> and

               <p>AS it is against the practice of the Primitive Church, the course held by the Christian Emperours, and the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the wisest Princes and States of the latter age, though otherwise Pontifician, to make matter of heresie a capitall crime, to inforce the Conscience, and to put to death, for the cause of Religion meerly, so it is against the Rules of charitie and reason.</p>
               <p>First, It is against the Rules of charity, if we had no other light to guide us, but the most wise answer of <hi>Englands</hi> last match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>Edward,</hi> being then but a childe, when he was pressed to yeeld his assent to the burning of an Heretique; <hi>What</hi> (said he) <hi>shall I send him to hell?</hi> By which he truly intimated, that whereas in all other offences, the Malefactors are punished with death, because it may be hoped they have repented the sinne; but to destroy an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick before conviction, is to be the Devils Catour, and to send him in provision even to Hell it selfe. For the very pertinacious holding of an Heresie is agreed on by all sides to be a damnable sinne, and then the cutting them off in that sinne, is to be the immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of their perdition. This doth that virulent Romanist or monster of men, <hi>Nicholas Harpsfeild,</hi> in his <hi>Wiclevian</hi> History openly boast of, <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 717. That those (blessed Champions

of Christ whom he calls) Heretiques, did in the fires that consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their bodies, taste the first-fruits of the eternall fire they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red afterwards. On the other side, if they suffer not but for feare of death, hope of preferment, or other base ends, turne from one Religion to another, especially from the truth to errour and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without instruction, or reasonable conviction, they onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble outwardly; as the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Gran ido</hi> did under that bloudy <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who being enforced to be present at the Masse in the morning, practised their own Mahumetanisme in the evening; or els their conscience being shipwracked by their Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie before conviction, with <hi>Francis Spira</hi> they are swallowed up of despaire, or with <hi>Peter Espinae,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> of the <hi>Henetick</hi> faction in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths time of <hi>France,</hi> with lust and Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme, who practised that emasculating sinne with his own sister. The <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Willian</hi> the firsts time, till the eighteenth yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, were the onely Usurers of the Realme, and brought in large contributions and tallages to the Kings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they lived, and enjoyed here the freedome of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: At their deaths their whole Estates escheated to the King, which their next heires commonly redeem'd for one full third part of three: But to incourage them to turne Christians, it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Assize, by which they were govern'd under their own proper and peculiar Justices, that if any <hi>Jew</hi> dyed, whose heire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Christian, he should inherit all the estate, of his Ancestors, without any further sine or composition with the Prince. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Rolls-house in <hi>London,</hi> and other places in other Cities of the Kingdome were appointed for the entertainment of those Christian converts, and were thence called <hi>Domus Conversorum:</hi> All which may clearly be gathered out of those Records of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, commonly called, <hi>The great Pipe Rolles,</hi> and the <hi>Communi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:50931:8"/>
second Commandement, they proved, as commonly the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> at this day do, when they turn <hi>Turks,</hi> the wretchedest var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets in the whole Kingdome. What were the poor <hi>Indians</hi> wont to say, when to avoid the <hi>Spaniards</hi> extreame and inhumane cruelties, they were drawn to their <hi>Masses,</hi> but that since they became <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> they had learned to swear and drink? It was an excellent and just sentence which one of the Grand <hi>Seignienrs</hi> pronounced against divers hundreds of <hi>Christians,</hi> that falling down-before him, made declaration, that they had deserted their <hi>Sacra,</hi> and given up their names to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he inquired of them why they did so; and they confessing plainly, that they did it to be freed from those many taxes, contributions and oppressions which they before groaned under; he rejected their enforced conversion for outward ends, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their taxes and levies to be continued. This Heroick action of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Monarch, was not much short of that policie of one of the ancient <hi>Christian</hi> Emperours, who having his Army mixed of <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and desiring to discover who of the first were little better then those of the latter, made, like another <hi>Jehu:</hi> a publike Declaration for the restoring of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> upon which, divers of the <hi>Christian</hi> Commanders shewing themselves forward to desert the truth, and to follow the stream and time, he presently reproved and cashier'd them; alledging, that all such were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to serve any Prince that had proved unfaithfull to that divine Majesty, by which Princes rule.</p>

               <p>AS it is against the <hi>Dictamen</hi> of Christian Charity, to make mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion a capitall crime, or to enforce the conscience, without a full and clear conviction, from the profession of one Religion to another, or to any new burthensome Ceremonies, to be superadded in the publick worship of God, although the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it self remain the same it was before in the generall; so it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rules of Reason it self.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50931:8"/>
and that hee saw himself neer the minute in which hee was to give an account of all his cruelties to the supreme Judge of Heaven and earth, he made an effectuall speech to the chief Commanders of his Army, being most of them <hi>Romanists: To acknowledge and obey the King of</hi> Navar (<hi>then a</hi> Protestant) <hi>as their lawfull Soveraigne, and the lineall heire of the</hi> French <hi>Crown, and to know this undoubted truth for the future; That Religion which is distilled into the souls of men by God himself, cannot he enforced by man.</hi> The same truth likewise, and almost in these very words, did the Lord <hi>Brederode,</hi> and the other <hi>Protestants</hi> of the lower <hi>Germany</hi> alledge for their just excuse in their united <hi>Apologie,</hi> published in the yeere 1566. and further added; <hi>That if the</hi> Papists <hi>did conceive their Religion to be the truth, they should in sieed of blood, fines, imprisonments and exilings, follow the seasonable advice of wise</hi> Gamaliel, <hi>and try a while, whether the</hi> Protestants <hi>separation from them were of God or not; for otherwise, if by force and tyrannie they did compell them to professe and practice those actions in Gods worship which they accounted abominable, and did also restrain them from performing those holy duties towards God, wherein they were convinced the truth of his service consisted, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences must needs be shipwracked and undone, and so in stead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them new</hi> Converts, <hi>they should leave them</hi> Atheists <hi>and</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.

of Religion neither ought, nor ever could be composed by blood and cruelty, but by Gods Word and seasonable conferences, he had never made his raign and memory so infamous to posterity as now it is, nor drawn the divine vengeance upon himself, by shedding so much innocent blood as afterwards he did.

                  <hi>of</hi> August, <hi>I dined at</hi> Partriges <hi>house with my Lady</hi> Jane, &amp;c. <hi>After that we fell in discourse of matters of Religion, and she asked what he was that preached at</hi> Pauls <hi>on Sunday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and so it was told her to be one :::::::: I pray you (quoth she) had they Masse in</hi> London? <hi>Yea forsooth (quoth I) in some places: It may be so (quoth she) it is not so strange as the sudden conversion of the late</hi>

                  <hi>Duke, for who would have thought, said shee, hee would have so done? It was answered her, Perchance hee thereby hoped to have had his pardon.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50931:10"/>
Pardon! (quoth shee) Wo worth him, hee hath brought me and our stock in most miserable calamity and misery by his exceeding ambition; but for the answering that hee hoped for life by his turning, though other men be of that opinion, I utterly am not: for what man is there living, I pray you, although hee had been innocent, that would hope for life in that case, being in the field against the Queen in person as Generall, and after his taking so hated and evill spoken of by the Commons, and at his coming into prison so wondred at, as the like was never heard by any mans time; who can judge that hee should hope for pardon, whose life was odious to all men? But what will yee more? like as his life was wicked and full of dissimulation, so was his end thereafter: I pray God I, nor no friend of mine die so; should I, who am young, and in the flower of my yeeres forsake my faith for the love of life? Nay, God forbid; much more hee should not, whose fatall course, although hee had lived his just number of yeers, could not have long continued: But life was sweet, it appeared so hee might have lived, you will say, hee did not care how; indeed the reason is good: for hee that would have lived in chains to have his life, belike would leave no means unattempted: but God be mercifull to us, for hee saith, Whoso denyeth him before men, hee will not know him in his Fathers Kingdome. <hi>How justly may the</hi> masculine <hi>constancie of this excellent Lady, whose many vertues the pens of her very enemies have acknowledged, rise up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against all such poore spirits, who for feare of death, or other outward motives, shall deny God and his truth, and so crown the Trophees of the</hi> Antichristian <hi>or mongrill adversaries by their lamentable apostasie. For what shee here spake Christianly, shee within a few moneths after performed constantly, her life being taken from her on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of</hi> February, <hi>1553. having lived first to see M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Harding <hi>her fathers Chaplain revolted to</hi> Antichrist, <hi>to whom she wrote an effectuall Letter of admonition and reproof, published by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Fox <hi>in his Acts and monuments,</hi> p. <hi>1291. not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the perusall of the ablest</hi> Christians <hi>and greatest Doctors.</hi>

are thereby increased &amp; propagated, and so the end for which force and violence are used, is no wayes obtained thereby. This was verified in the death of <hi>Prisciliian</hi> the heretique of old, by which his followers were mightily encreased, and having before but reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced him as a holy man, did afterwards adore him as a Martyr. The present age verifies it in the death of <hi>Michael Servetus</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and other <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> though most necessarily cut off by the sword of the Magistrate, for their blasphemous opinions and lawless Tenets, tending to the utter subversion of all Civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in their Dialogues, published in the <hi>English</hi> tongue in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, though they craftily withdrew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Anarchicall Tenets (agreeing almost <hi>verbatim</hi> with the workes since penned by <hi>James Arminius,</hi> and the latter <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi>) doe extoll that <hi>Servetus</hi> as a Prophet of the Lord; and their numbers are at this day so increased, as they constitute or make a considerable party in divers parts of Christendome. But those cursed enemies of the truth, that thinke by persecuting it, to abolish it, as they fight against God himselfe in so doing, so have they heretofore, and shall still in despight of all their devillish poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for the time to come increase and propagate the same. This, if all other Instances wanted, would sufficiently appeare in that famous example of an <hi>English</hi> Schoolmaster, a most zealous <hi>Papist</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, who afterwards in the beginning of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> government, frequenting the fires of some of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, was so convinced with hearing what they spake, and seeing how chearfully they suffered, as he himselfe relinquishing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ignorance and idolatry he had so long embraced, at last wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed the truth with his own bloud. Not he onely, but many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands also besides, were doubtless inabled by the cleare shining of those fires, to discerne the foulnesse of those mysteries of darkness, under which they had been so long held captive. And after her short Raigne (infamoused by so much bloud-shed) was expired, it facilitated the way for her royall sister <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to restore the truth at an easie rate. When the Executioner came behind <hi>John Hus,</hi> to kindle the pile that encompassed him: <hi>Come hither my friend,</hi> (said he) <hi>and kindle it here before, for had I feared what thou bringest, I had not appeared at this Stake to day.</hi> His death brought so incredible progresse to the true Church in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as did also that of <hi>Jerome</hi>

of <hi>Prague</hi> his <hi>Contemporanie,</hi> that their bloudy persecutors had just cause within a few yeares after their decease, to acknowledge their own errour in having hastened their ends. As fruitfull a seed-time to the Church in <hi>France,</hi> proved the death of <hi>Annas Burgus,</hi> a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the yeare 1559. under <hi>Francis</hi> the second. A man he was so vertuous and innocent in his life, as some of the very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Truth laboured his delivery when he was in prison, and so resolute and chearfull in his death, as it incouraged thousands in that Kingdome, in the constant profession of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. What better successe had all the bloudy executions of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand de Toledo,</hi> that merciless Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and of his new erected Bishops in the lower <hi>Germany,</hi> but that the Gospel at the last got the victory over hell, and all the powers of darkness? Neither indeed could those cruell Inquisitors have expected other issue, had they but truly considered what Religion had been; and <hi>that Princes and States may command the bodies, but not the soules and consciences of men;</hi> Which having been once perswaded by Instruction and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to embrace and beleeve any opinions, though hereticall, and therefore much more the Truth it selfe, can never be driven from them, but by the same meanes of a further and more cleare Instruction. The godly have ever lookt upon chaines, prisons, racks, and fires, as the tryall and reward of their faith, more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to doe evill, then to suffer evill, well knowing that they shall neither suffer more, nor their cruell enemies be able to inflict more, then God shall turne to his own endlesse glory, and their everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting good. Did the <hi>Heathen</hi> Poet desire to be sent back to the Mines (a life more tedious then that of the Gallyes) rather then he would commend a few bad Verses, contrary to his judgement?

And shall we thinke that Gods Saints who have their reason heightened and irradiated by grace, and their soules immoveably founded upon a lively and living faith, will feare to lose their estates, liberties, and lives for the Truths sake?

His sonne <hi>Philip</hi> the second, the most inveterate enemy of the Gospel that ever lived, did not onely set up Shambles and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries for Gods Saints in most of his own large Dominions by his Inquisitors, but continually ayded the Rebells in <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> against their lawfull Soveraignes, and plotted to invade all other Protestant Dominions in Christendome, that so at last by one generall carnage of them all, he and his holy Father the Pope, might have shared the Christian world by a double Monarchy of the Church and Empire between them.

This enraged his jealous Father, who having in the yeare 1568. first imprisoned him, within a few dayes after poysoned him in a dish of broath. His Mother in Law follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him within a few moneths after, sent out of the world by the same kind hand and meanes, (say the <hi>French</hi> Writers) the violence of the poyson causing her to miscarry also by an abortion.

strength and numbers, obtained a more firm and advantageous peace then ever they had before enjoyed: whereas those three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries of all these miseries perished within a few yeers after, by the just judgement of God, in the very act of their hostile pursue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his children: The Marshall of Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> was slain at the battell of <hi>Dreux, Annas de Memorancie</hi> under the very walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Francis Lorainer,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> was pistolled by <hi>John Poltrot,</hi> at the siege of <hi>Orleance.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> seeing that open force could not destroy the truth, nor root out the Professors thereof, about two yeers before the hellish massacre began at <hi>Paris,</hi> and continued to the perpetuall infamy of <hi>France</hi> in divers other Cities in that Realm, held a secret Councell in the Castle of <hi>Blois</hi> with <hi>Katherine de Medices</hi> his mother, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> (called also <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi>) his two brothers, and <hi>Henry Lorainer,</hi> son and heir of the before pistolled Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> by what means they might best draw the <hi>Protestants</hi> into their toile to destroy and murther them. The same Councell was held again by King <hi>Charles</hi> in the house of <hi>Hieronimo de Gondy</hi> at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Clou,</hi> and the time and order of the bloody marriage banquet to be served in at the nuptials of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> with the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> his sister, was there agreed upon, and resolved of, almost, in the same manner as it was afterwards put in execution upon the 24. day of <hi>August,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St <hi>Bartholomews</hi> day, in the yeer 1572. in which were most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely slaughtered within the space of few dayes, of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, many of them also being great and honourable personages of either sex, about thirty thousand: And while the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was busie in prosecuting that mercilesse and inhumane exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, it was seriously advised upon, and disputed of, in the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers Cabinet-councell, whether it were not necessary that hee himself, and the rest of his family then there, should also be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched at the same time in that tumult: King <hi>Charles</hi> himself never saw good day after that bloody massacre, although his Court syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants had promised him it should prove the first happy day of his absolute Monarchie; for though hee had been long drenched in lust, (a sin seldome separated from a Persecutor) by his ordinary advowtrie with a mean wench of <hi>Orleance,</hi> on whom hee begot <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Engolisme,</hi> after Earle of <hi>Auvergne;</hi> and though he had been trained up by his mother, to see the flaughter of beasts, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50931:14"/>
ever in the chases loved to both his hands in the bloud of the fallen game, (all which might have served to have stupefied his conscience, as they did enflame his sierce and cruell nature) yet so stinging a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse in his inward man did ever pursue and haunt him after that mercilesse slaughter accomplished chiefly by his often swearing and forswearing himself, (by which the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Chasrilion</hi> were deceived) as that his eyes rolled often uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the day with feare and suspicion; and his sleep was usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in the night with dismall dreams &amp; apparitions, like <hi>R.</hi> 3. of <hi>England,</hi> after the murther of his two Nephews in the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> nay, though he survived not this inhumane slaughter sull two yeares, yet had he plotted and decreed the death of the said <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the removall of his Queen-mother &amp; her instruments from the helm of State: But some of his agents that were to have acted these last feats, playing false with him, (as he had some few dayes before the said massacre poysoned that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Princesse for learning and piety, <hi>Joan D'Albret</hi> Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> Grandmother to <hi>Lewes</hi> the thirteenth, now King of <hi>France:</hi>) so did his mother or the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> by way of prevention or anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion minister to him his fatall physick, of which, after many sharp and grievous torments, he deceased upon <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> having not then attained to the five and twentieth yeare of his age, in the yeare 1574. the violence of the venome leaving in his intrailes (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon his distection) many blew spots and swellings.</p>

               <p>WE have seen the gain and advantage that King <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth of <hi>France</hi> made by his barbarous persecutions, 'tis likely that those very flatterers which assured him those cruelties should make him an absolute Monarch, did help to absolve him of his Monarchy. He had his punishment first, his mother, his two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Cardinal &amp; Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> that had not only joyned with him in it, but encouraged him to it, they still survived him, and for ought men saw, were firmly stablished in much safety and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; though <hi>Guise</hi> might have been warned by the death of <hi>Claude,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> his brother, slain at the siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> in the yeare 1573. The first act by which <hi>Henry</hi> the third (the new <hi>French</hi> King,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50931:15"/>
and brother and heir of <hi>Charles</hi> deceased) discovered his impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of spirit, and want of judgement, was his clandestine and sudden stealing out of <hi>Poland,</hi> where he had been but a few moneths before elected and crowned King: This was the first unfortunate step of his following his mothers weak <hi>Dictates,</hi> and rejecting the able ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises of his own Councell. But her next instructions which shee as fatally gave him, as he weakly pursued, being to root out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the truth with fire and sword, involved him and his kingdome into innumerable miseries. The good Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the second, in the Kings passage out of <hi>Poland</hi> through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> State, during his stay there, gave him both of them more faithfull counsell, earnestly advising him to maintain the former <hi>Edicts</hi> of Pacification, and not to enforce the consciences of men in matter of Religion: The same opinion was generally held by his wisest Counsellers, and by all sober and discreet <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> at home, who saw plainly, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> encreasing was the onely meanes now left under heaven, in time at length, to draw the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Conclave</hi> to yeeld to some reformation of the Church, which it exceedingly needed. But other <hi>Papists</hi> there were of loose and <hi>Atheisticall</hi> lives, as <hi>Lewes Lorainer,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Guise, Henry Lorainer</hi> his elder brother, Duke of <hi>Guise, Renate Villoclare,</hi> (a man, saith incomparable Monsieur <hi>de Thou,</hi> fatally preferred to this Kings attendance by his mother) and divers others, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the King to break the former <hi>Edicts</hi> of Pacification, and never to sheath his sword, till he had utterly ruined the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whom some of their foul-mouthed fellow-brethren, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> of this age, have stiled <hi>French Puritanes,</hi> and would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had they lived in his time, have joyned their ghostly advices with those of the Cardinall of <hi>Guise</hi> for the utter extirpation of all such as dissented in judgement or practice from themselves in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ceremony. I have often wondred in the perusall of the story of this King, whose troublesome raign did necessitate his frequent consultations; that when divers advices were propounded, he ever pitched upon the worst and most fatall to himselfe: But I found the two main causes of it to be; first, his blind and inveterate hatred of the truth: and secondly, his weak and degenerate spirit, by which the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> the Arch-enemies of the Gospel, became at the last so potent, and triumphed so notoriously over his impotency, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50931:15"/>
they forced him to seek to those very <hi>Protestants</hi> for support, against whom himself had taken a most wicked and solemn oath, as the head of a faction amongst his own Subjects, for their utter subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Infinite almost, was the treasure he spent upon his Minions and pleasures, (his very expences for maintenance of his dogs onely in that age, amounting unto twenty thousand pounds yearely at least) but most was exhausted in the prosecution of his civill wars against the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and his servile ancillating therein to the ambition of others. <hi>Guise</hi> and his faction now grown strong, (and assured of support from <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spain,</hi>) after his expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and heaping a world of other insolent affronts upon him, was drawn by him in the yeare 1588. to the Assembly then held at <hi>Blois;</hi> he came thither with <hi>Lewes Lorainer,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Guise</hi> his brother, and <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Jenvile</hi> his son, upon the same royall assurance of safety with which <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth had (by his advice) deceived the <hi>Protestants</hi> before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane massacre in the yeare 1572. And now let all <hi>Popish</hi> and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly addicted, <hi>Pseudo-Lutherans,</hi> who make it a sport to fine, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison, suspend, vex, and impoverish their fellow-Christians for the lightest matter, draw neer and stand amazed at Gods secret judgements: For during this Assembly at <hi>Blois,</hi> was this <hi>Henry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> slaughtered, against the publike faith given him, not onely within the Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> but in that very room in which sixteen yeares before he had advised the bloudy massacre of <hi>Paris</hi> to be committed and executed. Two circumstances also that attended his fatall minute, do adde much horror to the punishment it selfe: The first, that he was but new risen from the bed of his adulterate lust, the very morning he was murthered, having not been able to conquer the chastity of a Gentlewoman attending the Queen-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before that night; and therefore was so eager upon reaping the fruits of his long fiege, as he repaired not to the Councel-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber till he was often sent for, and scarce ready. The second, in the manner of his first wound, which was given him in his throat, and caused immediately the bloud so abundantly to stream out of his mouth, as he never had time once to call on God for mercy or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse, but spent the last minute of his life, in the revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on his murtherers. A little after the Cardinall of <hi>Guise</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a great gamester at Cards and Dice, perished likewise in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50931:16"/>
same Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> by a violent death. <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> the Queen-mother, who had been the chief cause, for neer upon thirty yeers before her death, of the shedding so much innocent blood in <hi>France,</hi> being present at the same time, in the Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med secretly, that so great an action should be entred into, and gone through without her advice; and (when she understood that <hi>Charles Lorainer,</hi> Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> was escaped, being the younger brother of the murthered Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi>) presaged to the King her son, the sad issue of that rash attempt, which he interpretting (as it seems) to be rather the expression of her wishes then her fears; and having, by many wosull experiences, seen the effects of her <hi>Italian</hi> revengefull spirit, took a course to pacifie her wrath; for not long after, she there ended her unhappy life by poyson, (saith <hi>Elias Reusner</hi>) in the same Castle also, where she held the first secret and bloody Councell for the execution of the foresaid inhumane massacre. <hi>Francis</hi> her youngest son, died before her, upon the tenth day of <hi>June,</hi> 1584. in the one and thirtieth yeer of his age, of so violent a poyson ministred to him, doubtlesse by some of the <hi>Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niolized Guisards,</hi> as it caused his very blood to gush out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in severall places; the sight of which purple streams, might well call upon him to remember with what inhumane triumph he tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on the bloody streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the great slaughter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on Gods Saints and Martyrs, about twelve yeers before. There now only remained <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the <hi>French</hi> King alive, of all the first contrivers and principall executioners of that inhumane massacre, which no age, no time, no action of the most barbarous nations of the world could ever pattern; neither believe I, can any ancient or modern History parallel the following punishments of the chief actors therein in all respects: who not only all of them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by violent and bloody ends, but proved also the murtherers one of another. <hi>Charles Lorainer</hi> Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> was presently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of his brother, made Generall of the holy League; <hi>Paris</hi> it self, and in a manner, all the Popish cities beyond the <hi>Loire,</hi> giving up their names and forces to the <hi>Henotick</hi> faction, supported by <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the fifth, from <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the second from <hi>Spain.</hi> When the King saw that neither his acting the Monk with the Flagellators, nor his playing the Persecutor against the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> would secure him from a speedy ruine, by the violent hands
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50931:16"/>
of the rebels: He sends to the victorious King of <hi>Naver,</hi> his brother in Law, and to the Euangelicall Army, before whose known valour the <hi>Popish</hi> Forces hastened back from the <hi>Loire</hi> to the <hi>Seine; Henry</hi> the third pursues them, and pitched his royall Pavilion at St <hi>Clou,</hi> not far from the gates of <hi>Paris.</hi> But his old cruelties and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the godly, were doubtlesse the <hi>Remora</hi> of his new expected victories; and the divine providence so ordered it, that in the very place where the last resolution was taken by himself, his Mother, his brethren, and others, for the speedy execution of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned belluine Massacre, about seventeen yeers before, nay, in the very same house of <hi>Hierome de Gondy,</hi> and in the very same roome or chamber (saith <hi>John de Serres</hi>) was he murthered by <hi>James Clement,</hi> a Jesuited Monk, in the yeer 1589. and in the thirty and ninth yeer of his age. The assassination was furthered by the authority of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, by the seditious preachings of the Jesuites, Priests, and Friers, in <hi>Paris,</hi> (who had secretly drawn infinite numbers into open rebellion before, by their auricular confession) and by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Lady <hi>Katharine Mary,</hi> Dutchesse of <hi>Mompensier,</hi> sister of the deceased Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> whose horrible transport with malice against the <hi>Protestant</hi> party, and desire of revenge against the King himself, did so far excaecate and blind her nobler endowments, as she prostituted her body to that Jesuited wretch (as impartiall <hi>de Thou</hi> himself relates) to incourage him the more in the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the murther, and so to stupefie and harden his soul by that fatall sin of lust, that it might not startle at the commission of any other wickednesse whatsoever. Yet as this King some moneths before his death altered his former bloody resolutions against Gods servants, so did the Divine providence at his death afford him some hours of repentance and sorrow, after the bloody knife had been sheathed in his belly: In which he acknowledged his error and sin; his error, in having been so long mis-led by his ambitious and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vassalls; his sin, in having persecuted his <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects, and inforced the consciences of many to submit to <hi>Popery</hi> against the known truth by cruelty and threatning.</p>

               <p>IN this fifteenth age also (within the compasse of which wee shall confine our discovery of Gods Judgements upon persecuting
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50931:17"/>
Princes) the truth began to spread forth its beames in this other world of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in a more resplendent lustre then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: not but that I dare undertake to prove by some select, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, fearce known monuments of Antiquity, that the Gospel was planted here in the Primitive time, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> Religion flourished here neer upon four hundred yeers, before <hi>Austine</hi> the Monk, the first Popish Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> poysoned the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gods worship with his burthensome Trinkets and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Finally, that it was from the first plantation preserved amongst the <hi>Welsh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> to the dayes of <hi>John Wickleffe,</hi> without any interruption, and was secretly practised also in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Henry</hi> the seconds time, at the least, to the begun Reformation of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth. But this requiring a reasonable Volume of it self to be at large deduced, I must passe over, as improper for this place. We may begin in <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in whose raign no <hi>Papist</hi> can deny, but that divers <hi>Protestants</hi> were not only hunted after, fined, imprisoned, compelled to abjure, and otherwise disciplined; but were likewise consumed in the merciless flames, as <hi>Heretiques.</hi> And therefore when the Papall side take so much pains to recount either the ill successes of his own raign; or the dying issulesse of all his posterity, as the signes and characters of Gods indignation against him, they do but furnish the Orthodox party with weapons against themselves. For the truth is, he did only abolish the usurped power of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> not the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician or Papall Church, which to this day, as also in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages in <hi>France,</hi> hath been so hedged up and incircled under certain restrictions and limits, as it is of small consequence to help the Prelates, and of little power to hurt the King; So that <hi>Cuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> the Dominican proved it at large in an elaborate Work, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the yeer 1609. and the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> determined it in the yeer 1611. that the <hi>Pope</hi> had no power or Jurisdiction in that Kingdome in matter of Temporalities. Neither did <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth in <hi>England</hi> proceed any further in this particular of abolishing the <hi>Popes</hi> power, then those his two coaetaneous Princes, <hi>Francis</hi> the first, and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, did at sundry times in their severall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, upon lesse provocations: So the same <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Councell assembled at <hi>Bononie,</hi> superscribed his Letters only, <hi>Conventui Bononiae,</hi> as did afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the second of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50931:17"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> writing to the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Conspirators, fule it only the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Trent;</hi> who also in the former and better part of his raign fairly cut shorter a great-part of the <hi>Popes</hi> Ecclesiasticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>France.</hi> And how little <hi>Philip</hi> the second himself of <hi>Spain,</hi> the sworn enemy of the godly, regarded the <hi>Pope</hi> further then he did ancillate to his ambitious ends, appeares plainly in this one particular, that when upon the unfortunate death of <hi>Sebastian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugall</hi> there were divers competitors for that kingdome, and that <hi>Don Antonio</hi> had already assumed the title thereof, he would not admit the <hi>Popes</hi> intercession to have the matter compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Treaty, or referre the cause to his decision: Nay, that bloody <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of whose fatall end we have but a while before discoursed, when <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, in the yeer 1563. had cited <hi>Odetus de Coligny,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Chastillion, John de Monluce,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Valence,</hi> and others of his Subjects, to appeare at <hi>Rome</hi> before his Inquisitors, he sent him a stout Message by <hi>Henry Clutinius</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador then at <hi>Rome, That if hee did not speedily withdraw that cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee would no longer acknowledge him for Pope.</hi> At which bold Declaration, the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Conclave</hi> being affrighted, the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that businesse ceased by the very withdrawing of the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self, and by the <hi>Popes</hi> future silence. All which open affronts, the <hi>Popes</hi> in this fifteenth age after our bleffed Saviours incarnation, endured from these Kings; not because they were more deare to their Subjects then their Predecessors, or the <hi>Popes</hi> lesse potent then in former times, (for their strength in <hi>Italy</hi> was more encreased in that age, then in ten fore-going) but indeed it was the light of the Gospel that began about these times to dawn every where, that made way for dispelling those chains of darknesse, with which both Prince and people had in those former ages been enfettered; So as the <hi>Pope</hi> fearing, lest all should fall from him, as some <hi>Germane</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Republiques, and Cities had already done, was fain to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the <hi>French</hi> King, to submit to the Emperor, and to Court the King of <hi>England,</hi> by the intercession of foraine Princes for a reconcilement. But to proceed from <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England,</hi> the Father to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of the same Realm, his daughter, of whom, and her wisdome, the <hi>Pontificians</hi> so much boast. It is certain that she entred her raign with the breach of her publique faith; For whereas the Crown was set on her head by the German
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50931:18"/>
and Commons of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> although they knew her to be a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi> (which shewes that the godly <hi>Protestant</hi> usually nicknamed by those that are prophane, lustfull, and Popishly affected, is the best Subject any Soveraign can be happy in) yet she in one of her first acts of Councell, took order for their restraint, long before the Masse and Latine Service were generally received in <hi>London</hi> it self, and caused that Diocesse to taste the sharpest Inquisition and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that raged during her raign, which was happily shortened by her husbands contemning her person, and her enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering her Dominions; neither of which she ever had power to revenge, or recover; so as though the cause of her death procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from no outward violence, yet was her end as inglorious and miserable, as her raign had been turbulent and bloody. She might have taken warning by the sudden and immature death of <hi>James</hi> the fifth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> her cousin Germane, who raising per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution in <hi>Scotland</hi> against his loyall and innocent <hi>Protestant</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in the yeere 1539. burning some, exiling and imprisoning others, and forcing many to blaspheme, in abjuring the known Truth, by the advice and procurement of <hi>James Beton,</hi> Archbishop of St <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>David Beton,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Arbroth</hi> his brother, never saw good day after: two brave young Princes his sons were the yeer following cut off by abortive ends in their cradles. Wars to his great losse and disadvantage were raised between himself and his Uncle <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth King of <hi>England,</hi> and all things fell out so crosse to his haughty and vast minde, as it hastened his death, which fell out in the yeere 1542.</p>

reverend <hi>Latimer,</hi> and learned <hi>Ridley.</hi> But I shall content my selfe to have abstracted, as a taste for the rest, the notorious punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by a higher hand upon two Arch-Prelates, the one of <hi>England,</hi> the other of <hi>Scotland: Thomas Arundell</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> having been the successefull traytor, by the help of his reverend fellow-Bishops, to establish <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in the Throne of <hi>R.</hi> the second his liege Lord, and Cousin-German, pressed the new King (whose broken title needed his Prelates supportment) to use his temporall sword for the destroying the disciples of <hi>John Wicklesse,</hi> whose numbers were so increased at that time, as they even filled the kingdome; the King assents, and having by their mercilesse instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shed the bloud of Gods Saints, he raigned neither long nor happily: <hi>H.</hi> 5. a brave and martiall Prince, his son, succeeding him, the <hi>Protestants</hi> began to meet more publikely, and to professe the truth more openly then before; the Archbishop thereupon renews his former suit to the son he had before pressed with successe upon the father, and prevailed. In particular, he first aimed at the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sir <hi>John de Old Castle,</hi> Knight, commonly called the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who had most affronted him. This noble Gentleman was extracted from an ancient Family of <hi>Wales,</hi> where he had large pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and much alliance, by whose means he after lay long-hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there, notwithstanding all the search his bloudy enemies made after him: he had issue by <hi>Katherine,</hi> daughter of <hi>Richard ap Yevan</hi> his first wife, <hi>John,</hi> who died before himself, and <hi>Henry de Old Castle,</hi> who survived him, and to whom King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare of his raign, restored divers Mannors and Lands which had been entailed upon him; he married to his last wife, <hi>Joan,</hi> the sole daughter and heire of Sir <hi>John de la Pole,</hi> Knight, whom he had begotten upon the sole daughter and heire of the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> which <hi>Joan</hi> had been first married to Sir <hi>Robert de Hemenhale</hi> a <hi>Suffolk</hi> Knight, and was secondly the wife of Sir <hi>Reginald de Bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi> Knight, by whom shee had onely issue that survived her; the said Sir <hi>John de Old Castle</hi> her third husband, in her right enjoyed the Castle of <hi>Couling</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and many other large and great pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions; and by the marriage of her also he was neerly allied to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and many other great Peers of the Realme at that time, and did doubtlesse enjoy the stile and title of Baron <hi>Cobham,</hi> as is infallibly proved by severall Writs of

All which I have thought fit to transmit to posterity touching this noble martyr, being no where to be found in any publike story, not onely to shew how many supportments he had, besides the favour of King <hi>Henry</hi> himself, to have retarded the Clergie from question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, but also, how easily he was destroyed by the bloudy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of those endarkened times, when the Soveraign had but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them the use of his power to ancillate to their cruell reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; of which impotent act of the Kings, saith Archbishop <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> himselfe, <hi>Rex virum clarum sibi<expan>

                  <hi>Mary,</hi> the hereditary Queen of that Realme, he thought it a work worthy of himself to double-die his Cardinall robes in the bloud of the Saints; and therefore, to make a sull and cleare way for that his sanguinary project, he forged a Will of the deceased King, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing himself chief Regent there during the young Ladies inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability to govern; from which, upon the discovery of his false play, he being removed, and a while committed to safe custody, he was no sooner delivered, but he presently enterprised to raise a new and fatall war between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to root out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the truth, by a violent and bloudy persecution. Amongst others, cited and imprisoned, or exiled in the yeare 1545. he seized on <hi>George Wischart,</hi> a very eloquent and learned Preacher, who by the <hi>Latine</hi> Writers of that age, is surnamed <hi>Sophocardius,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own Popish <hi>Canons,</hi> adjudged him to present death himself, (which is never done, except in the merciless <hi>Inquisition</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> by those bloudy <hi>Wolves</hi> themselves, but by delivering the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs into the power of the lay-Magistrate) and in the Court before his Castle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrews,</hi> caused the same to be executed, the said <hi>George</hi> being first strangled, and his body afterwards burnt to ashes, the Cardinall in the mean time had a chamber prepared for him, with Carpets and Cushions on the windows, out of which to be a triumphant spectator of this godly mans murther, from which he departed not more delighted then (as he himself thought) secured, beginning to fortifie his said Castle against all assaults: But Gods judgement from eternity awarded against him for this latter as well as his former cruelties exercised upon his faithfull servants, slept not; for within a few weeks after, the Cardinall having falsified his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to the Lord <hi>Norman Lesle,</hi> son of the Earle of <hi>Rothsey,</hi> a devout <hi>Romanist,</hi> he upon the thirteenth day of <hi>May,</hi> the same yeare, with some fourteen resolute Gentlemen in his company, entred the same Castle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> where the Cardinall lay; and having first assured himself of the command within, and the gates without, he executed that bloudy Prelate in his bed, without law or justice, who had but a little before, most unjustly condemned and murthered the aforesaid <hi>George Wischart;</hi> and willing to expose the dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse of that purpurated persecutor, as it were, all weltered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared with bloud to the view of the people, who abhorred his cruelties, and rejoyced at his fall; they casually and contingently

laid it along to be seen of all men upon that very window out of which a little before, leaning at his ease upon rich Cushions, he had proudly beheld the butchering of that godly martyr.

               <p>IT may somewhat amaze the reason and judgement of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate man, though an <hi>Atheist,</hi> why the <hi>Pope</hi> himself or his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Clergie should so extreamely hate and violently perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute (even more cruelly then they doe <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi>) the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall partie, and especially those of the <hi>French, Scottish</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetick</hi> confession, who doe commonly joyn eminency of piety and godlinesse, with a most sound and absolute body of doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with that of the Primitive Church. But if wee consider that the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe, all Popish or popishly affected Prelates, and all the <hi>Romish</hi> rabble, like the Scribes and Priests in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours dayes, ayme nothing at all at Gods glory, or the salvation of mens soules, but onely at the maintenance of their wealth, pride and tyranny, not intending to yeeld an inch or haires breadth to any the least reformation: wee cannot but see that their self-love, and wallowing in all sensualitie, is the cause of the hatred of the godly, who both by their lives and writings condemne and oppose their wickednesse and errors: For as the persecutions of the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> against the Orthodox Fathers exceeded the cruelty of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Emperours, so hath that of the <hi>Romish Babylon</hi> far surpassed and out-stript them, both being joyned together, they feare not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50931:20"/>
the diminution of their Votaries by the perswasion of <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> but onely by the sound reasonings of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> whose Religion hath already gained from them, not onely Cities, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publickes, and Provinces, but whole Kingdomes also; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing the truth it selfe is against them, they count it high time to fall from reasoning to policy, and from institution to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell persecution, as a ready meanes to carry through their bad cause. Incomparable Monsieur <hi>de Thou</hi> (who is a glory to the <hi>Romish</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue it selfe, and whose History the most exact and excellent that ever was written by a humane pen, ought alwayes to be deare to the Christian world) discovers plainly to us this truth, in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe the bloudy Legacy Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third left to his Conclave when he died in the yeare 1359. For having called di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Cardinalls into his bed-chamber, he exhorted them by all meanes to maintaine and continue the office of the Inquisition, as the onely meanes left upon earth to establish and support the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion: then which Confession there can none be more cleare of the falshood of their pretended Catholick Church; for if no other way remaine but bloud and butcheries for them to establish and repaire the lofty and proud Towers of their <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> then have they doubtlesse no part left in the Church founded by our Saviour and his Apostles; for that was at first reared up and finished by the preaching of the Gospel, and may certainly be continued and supported to the worlds end by the same meanes. It is not for Christians, but for Pagans and Infidells, who know not the way of instruction, to propagate their Gentilisme and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry by fire and sword. Besides, that epidemicall sinne of lust, both naturall and against nature, being peculiar to the Popish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and the rest of their Clergie, is a maine ground of their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefied Consciences, and so prepares and fits them for the shedding of innocent bloud, or any other sinne whatsoever. <hi>Peter Espina<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

The chief abetters and ring-leaders of which butchery, Monsieur <hi>de Thou</hi> himselfe confesseth to have been <hi>Boidon, Mornieu,</hi> and <hi>Clou,</hi> three of the most wicked and vilest varlets that a Kingdome

At <hi>Tholouse</hi> also, a few dayes after, there was a great slaughter of the godly committed, but by whom? not by the better sort of Citizens, or sober and morally vertuous men, but one <hi>Turry,</hi> and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other infamous lewd persons like himself, joyned themselves together, for the effecting of that bloudy execution: The like villany was accomplished at the great city of <hi>Roane</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> by one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronie,</hi> a most infamous Ruffian, and a great many other base varlets, who assembled themselves to him as their ring-leader; but in none of them were these two hellish sins of advoutrie and bloud more adaequately coupled together, then in one <hi>Ruygaillard</hi> the master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butcher at <hi>Angiers,</hi> who having long continued an Adulterer, was at last enticed by his harlot, to murther his own wife.

Amongst the <hi>Turks, Jewes, Indians, Persians,</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at this day, the most zealous and holiest as they conceive them in their Religion, are most esteemed and honoured, and onely in the greater part of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches, the most knowing and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of the Evangelicall truth, and the most strict and godly in their lives are hated, nicknamed, disgraced, and vilified; and grace which should onely adde a lustre to learning, riches, honours, noble extraction, and all other outward gifts, either naturall or acquisite, that alone obscureth all the rest, and brings the contempt, not onely
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50931:22"/>
of great ones, but even of the scum and dregs of the multitude upon the persons so qualified. Doubtlesse, this shewes that the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, where the Gospel is maintained in the power and purity of it, is the very truth it self. And that the Prince of darknesse seeing the greatest zealoters amongst the <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> hasten on in a false and fatall course, never opposeth them, no more then he doth the debauched, loose and Atheistical <hi>Protestant,</hi> but only stirreth up all he may the hatred, scorn and persecution of all sorts against those pious <hi>Christians,</hi> who are convinced of the truth, and by their innocent lives and godly conversations, maintain and demonstrate, that it undoubtedly is the true Religion which they professe.</p>

                  <hi>LVther</hi> had scarce planted the Cospel in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the yeere 1517 but within the space of some five yeers after, <hi>Melchior Hofman, Thoms Muncer, Bernard Rotman,</hi> and other <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> planted there also, as may be strongly collected, divers <hi>Pelagian</hi> blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of free-will, recidivation from grace, and the rest, to which they joyned community of goods, and the extirpation of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie and Magistracie, saying, <hi>Luther</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> were two false Prophets; but of the two, <hi>Luther</hi> was the worst, because <hi>Luther</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially laboured to advance Gods grace, and to beat down the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call tenet of mans free-will. <hi>Michael Servetus</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Bernardin Ochinus,</hi> as may probably be gathered, did succeed <hi>Muncer</hi> and <hi>Rotman,</hi> as the chief Doctors of that pestilentiall Sect; but as may easily appear, upon diligent search, did cunningly conceal their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous doctrine, of not allowing temporall Princes and Magistrates, because they saw it inevitably drew upon them the necessary oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of all Kings, and well governed States. <hi>Theodore Bibliander,</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Castellio</hi> the <hi>Savoyard,</hi> grew famous amongst their fellow <hi>Anabaptists</hi> after <hi>Servetus</hi> death: and the same <hi>Castellio</hi> translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Latin</hi> the <hi>Dialogues</hi> which the said <hi>Ochinus</hi> had written in the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>German</hi> tongue, which <hi>Dialogues</hi> are ordinarily at this day imprinted with the rest of <hi>Castellio's</hi> Works: And in the last age from the time this Sect took its first beginning in <hi>Holland,</hi> till about the yeer 1611. they knew no other name or appellation, but of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> only, which title also, with much alacrity and confidence,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50931:23"/>
they assumed and appropriated to themselves in their own books they published: <hi>James Arminius,</hi> a flashie and shallow Divine of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> (as may easily be evinced) was so taken and overtaken with the perusall of <hi>Castellio's</hi> Dialogues, and the secret conferences of some of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> themselves, as it clean turned his judgement from the truth to falshood; and therefore to justifie his own apostasie, and to perpetuate the memory of his new Masters labours, without once doing honour to his name; he re-prints his said <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and other Works, almost <hi>verbatim,</hi> altering only the frame of them, and patching them out also with some pieces he had borrowed from the Jesuites polemicall volumes against the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> the latter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, and the first defending the hereticall tenets of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> the <hi>Britain,</hi> as learned <hi>de Thou</hi> himself freely acknowledgeth. After the death of <hi>Arminius,</hi> in the yeer 1611. the name of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> by which the maintainers and asserters of those errors had for above fourscore yeers last past, been known and called by (as in the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> published in the yeer 1552. <hi>Article</hi> 8. and elsewhere) and sometimes also <hi>Anabaptists</hi> or <hi>Servetians,</hi> from <hi>Michael Servetus,</hi> as by the same <hi>de Thou</hi> in his story, <hi>lib.</hi> 34. <hi>p.</hi> 239. began to be deserted, as too odious and grosse for this learned age, and by the ignorance of the Orthodox Divines, who saw not the admirable use of story in their polemical <hi>Tractates,</hi> they have atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the senslesse and new name of <hi>Arminians,</hi> when poor <hi>Arminius</hi> himself took up his errors upon trust at the third or fourth hand, stealing that out of <hi>Castellio,</hi> which he had borrowed from <hi>Ochinus,</hi> the scholar of the <hi>Spaniard Servetus:</hi> And <hi>Barnevelt</hi> himself in his <hi>Apologie</hi> confesseth, that he had learned those points in <hi>Germany</hi> many yeers before he knew <hi>Arminius;</hi> nay, as men extracted from base beginnings, and advanced to high honours, do commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by an adulterate and a false descent to noble ancestors: so these impudent fellows are not ashamed to father their forgeries on judicious <hi>Luther</hi> himself, as if there were no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Orthodox <hi>Protestants,</hi> then was between <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> whereas it appeared plainly, in the yeer 1560. by the very confession of the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, that upon a strict inquiry then made, it was found, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> dissented from the <hi>Romanists</hi> in forty points of doctrine. But those of the <hi>Helvetick</hi> and <hi>Augustane</hi> confessions amongst themselves but in two, whereas if these new
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50931:23"/>
coiners do but daily increase their dangerous errors for the time to come, as they have done for the time past, since <hi>Sebastian Castellio's</hi> death, they will dissent as much from learned <hi>Luther,</hi> as he did from the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves. And how little coherence there was between <hi>Luther</hi> and those <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of his time, whom <hi>Castellio</hi> followed, is apparently expressed in the very Preface it self prefixed before his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and other his <hi>Latin</hi> Works, printed in the yeere 1613. where the Author of the said Preface (a stout <hi>Anabaptist</hi>) freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that <hi>Martin Luther, John Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Martin Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha,</hi> did all defend Gods absolute and eternall Decree, and the Power of his Grace, following therein S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine;</hi> and falsly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, That a way is thereby opened to a secure and loose life: which inconvenience, saith the same Prefacer, <hi>Erasmus Roterodamus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Bibliander,</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Castellio,</hi> fore-seeing and desiring to prevent, did oppose the said doctrine, and maintained free-will to be in man, or an ability in and from himself, without the assistance of Gods grace, to do good. The <hi>Pseudo-Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> that had even overspread the whole Dominions of the Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> before the Enangelicall Jubilee was there cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the yeer 1617. were within two yeers after, the direct Instruments of ruining the Gospel it self: For they mistake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ignorantly, or are wilfully blind in the passages of that time, who impute all the miseries that <hi>Germany</hi> hath now for these eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeers last past groaned under, to <hi>Frederick</hi> the fifth, Prince <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Palatine,</hi> his accepting of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Crown, in the yeere 1619. in respect that the <hi>Protestants</hi> of that Kingdome, after the election of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Gratz,</hi> for the King thereof, in 1617. find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was wholly swayed by the Jesuites themselves, or his Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited Counsellors, and began to infringe the liberty of Religion there established, they acquainted the Emperor <hi>Matthias</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, during whose life, the said <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was not to intermeddle with the affaires of that Realme. But the Emperor, whether hee feared that his said Cousin of <hi>Gratz</hi> should supplant him, as he had formerly done his own brother, <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the second; or whether out of immoderate love to him, I know not, neglected the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> just Petitions and Romonstrances; whereupon, in the yeer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, there being a great Assembly of them in the Chancery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, within the Castle of <hi>Prague,</hi> and some sudden alteration
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50931:24"/>
happening, they threw out three of the Emperors Counsellors at the windows, and though none of them were slain or maimed with the fall, yet the <hi>Bohemians</hi> themselves took this outrage to be an offence so unpardonable, as they presently prepared themselves for an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and defensive war, elected thirty Directors to govern the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and raised two Armies to be in readinesse, the one under the Earl of <hi>Thurne,</hi> and the other under <hi>Ernest,</hi> Count of <hi>Mansfield.</hi> The Emperor also, and his Cousin <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> made great preparation for war, nominating the Counts of <hi>Dampetre</hi> and <hi>Buequoi</hi> for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, upon which there presently followed divers hot skirmishes, between the forces on both sides, the miserable Inhabitants of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> proving already a lamentable prey to the licencious Souldier. And now let any indifferent and impartiall man judge, what fault or error all this time, did the said Prince <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> commit; Nay, on the contrary, the Jesuite himself confesseth in his <hi>Austrian</hi> Laurel, <hi>pag.</hi> 104. that the said Prince <hi>Elector</hi> laboured by all means to have composed this difference in a Treatable and amicable way by his letters and Internuncio's, till seeing the Emperors Armies, notwithstanding all his intercession to have entred and wasted <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> their aime to be chiefly at the extirpation of Religion; and himself as the prime Prince of the new Union, to be obliged in honour and conscience to have a care of the Euangelicall cause, hee was necessitated to joyn his Armes to theirs, not refusing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Crown, being, for ought hee knew, most justly laid at his feet, after a generall and unanimous election: Could he fore-see that any Euangelicall Prince should be so <hi>Pseudo Lutheranized,</hi> as to betray the whole body of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, and the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall liberties of the Empire in <hi>Germany</hi> to the <hi>Antichristian</hi> adversary? In all humane reason, had the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> but looked on, and done nothing, much more had he but assisted the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> professing the same Gospel with himself, that fair branch of the third family in Christendome had now flourished in those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient regalities their Ancestors enjoyed, and the Church and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had been as glorious and happy as now they are desolate and miserable. But God that decrees all most justly and wisely for his own glory, and the good of his children, will, I doubt not, by some means, though yet hidden, replant again the royall branches of this Imperiall Vine, as to the admiration of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

world, both enemies and friends, he hath hitherto supported the Royall root of those branches with patience and alacrity.</p>

               <p>AS the vicious and Atheisticall <hi>Popish</hi> and popishly affected Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and prophane Christians hate and persecute the pious <hi>Protestants</hi> more then they doe adulterers, swearers, perjurers, or any other notorious delinquents; so the moderate and vertuous <hi>Papists</hi> of both Orders, abhorre their slaughters, and desire their peace and freedome. Sir <hi>John de Old-Castle,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth of <hi>England,</hi> being convented before <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and divers other lustfull and bloudy Prelates; <hi>Whilest I was</hi> (saith he) <hi>a swearer, a rioter, and every way else vicious, you never reproved me or questioned me, but since I have imbraced this despised do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of</hi> Wicklesfe, <hi>which hath taught me how to conquer my sinnes, and to lead a godly and an honest life, now you are enraged against me with malice, and seek my destruction.</hi> The same true observation was made by <hi>Annas Burgus,</hi> that brave Senator of <hi>Paris</hi> in the yeare 1559. under <hi>Henry</hi> the second of <hi>France; That there were many adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, perjuries, oaths, and other infamous offences, daily committed, and already punishable by the Lawes, and yet such as were guilty of all or any of those crimes were countenanced and advanced; but against the</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants <hi>all cruelty was practised, who were guilty of no other offence, but of imbracing the truth of the Gospel revealed unto them by the Spirit and Word of God, and of discovering by the same light, the horrible vices and errors of the</hi> Popish <hi>power, that so there might follow an emendation.</hi> To this purpose also tended that Christian advice which a person of noble extraction <hi>David Hamilton</hi> gave to his Cousin <hi>James,</hi> Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> then Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the yeare 1545. when Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Beton</hi> would have perswaded and drawn him to have joyned with himselfe in the persecution and slaughter of the godly in that Kingdome. <hi>I cannot but wonder,</hi> saith he, <hi>that you should give up the innocent servants of God himself, against whom no crime is objected, but the preaching of the Gospel, into the hands and power of men most infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for lust, cruelty, and all other wickednesse, when in the meane time those very enemies of the truth themselves cannot deny, but that the lives of such as professe this doctrine they hate, are full of integrity and vertue.</hi>

And therefore, although the prophane and bloudy Prelates could never be drawn to pitie Gods children, much lesse to love them for their piety and innocency, being therein more inhumane then divers of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperours themselves, who upon informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vertuous and harmlesse deportments of the <hi>Christians</hi> by their governours of Provinces under them, did cause their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions to be slackned and ceased. Yet have divers Princes and other moderate Pontificians in the fore-going age, been moved by the upright and honest lives of Gods children, to further their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of conscience, and to abhorre the cruelties of their <hi>fellow-Romanists</hi> practised upon them. <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, sonne of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the second, and <hi>Francis</hi> the first, the <hi>French</hi> King, were hence drawn to permit unto their own Subjects freedome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: The Earles of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> (though zealous <hi>Papists</hi>) laboured with the Dutchesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> that the low-countrey <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> might be free from fines, imprisonments, and all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions in respect of Religion.

At the City of <hi>Lions</hi> also, where the inhumanity of the murtherers almost equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that of <hi>Paris, Mandelot</hi> the Governour there, did his best to have prevented it, and in his heart, with many other grave and sober Citizens of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, utterly detested it.

therein, for divers dayes after; and generally, in all <hi>Provence,</hi> those of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion drew out the mangled bodies out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with great humanity interred them. <hi>Monsieur Carragie,</hi> a noble Gentleman the Governour of the great city of <hi>Robin</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> did likewise oppose the massacres there to the utmost of his power, as did also <hi>James Benedict Lagabaston</hi> the prime Senator of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> who thereby became himself in danger to have been slain by those seditious varlets, who had been at first stirred up to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit those murthers by the wicked sermons of a lustfull Jesuite, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Enimund Auger.

And it well appeared, what base varlets they generally were in most places, who were the executioners of those villanies, because their Religion consisted chiefly in robbing and spoiling the <hi>Protestants</hi> houses, suffering many of them in the mean time beyond their cruell resolutions to escape safely away. Nay, whereas the furious people of <hi>Paris</hi> already inraged with a blinde zeale, came to a certain white Thorne-tree that blossomed the day of the massacre in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Innocents</hi> Churchyard, in that city, as if God by a miracle had approved their barbarous and sanguinary action; the more judicious <hi>Papists,</hi> conceived this to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by powring of hot water upon the root of that tree, or by some other secret imposture; or if it were a true miracle, then the <hi>Protestants</hi> alledged, that it might much more justly be interpreted to the advantage of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church then of their own: That first the place where the tree grew, being dedicated to the memory of <hi>Innocents,</hi> argued the innocency of those who were martyred; and that as the same tree at that season of the yeere, being in <hi>August,</hi> though it shewed life, yet could not have blossomed without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: So the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church and Religion in <hi>France,</hi> which seemed by this blow to be utterly extinct and ruined, should again

them; but if the wisdome of any Church conceive it self upon great and sound motives rather obliged to retain them, and to adde new burthens rather then to abolish or change the old; yet doubtlesse withall some course may be considered of, how those who in all main and fundamentall truths are the true servants of God, the humble and obedient children of the Church, and of innocent and vertuous lives, might in the mean time enjoy the Ordinances of God in peace and quiet: For doubtlesse, if one <hi>Protestant</hi> may lawfully vex, cite, fine, suspend, deprive, excommunicate, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison another (which in some cases necessitates a lingring death) for things accounted by themselves no way essentiall to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship normans salvation: then is all we have said against the <hi>Romists</hi> Synagogue of no validity at all; nay, there being no <hi>Magis</hi> and <hi>Minus</hi> in persecution, it will follow necessarily, that for the same causes one <hi>Protestant</hi> may as well put to death another, as impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son him; and so <hi>Samaria</hi> shall of necessity justisie her sister <hi>Sodome.</hi> That the supreme Magistrate in things lawfull ought to be obeyed for Conscience sake, is a certain truth: But yet it is too apparent that such as are more violent for these lesser matters, so to ravage and trample on the weaker and more humble Christians, by pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing obedience to the Magistrate, are commonly themselves the most outrageously disobedient; for though they seeme most eager to obey him in these formall and outward commands, yet where the commands of God himself and the Magistrates meet together, forbidding Adultery, Fornication, swearing, blaspheming, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gaming, starving of souls, maintaining erroneous doctrines, and divers other horrible and Atheisticall offences; here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor Prince, Law nor Gospel, heaven nor hell, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain their lustful practices or scandalous lives.

               <p>THere were in all ages, even in the first and purest times, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions set out by the Primitive Christians, to be a Guide and a Rule for all Conditions to walk by: and when the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed was penned by the learned Fathers of that Councell, it was all that was required of any to be publikly confessed, that had been either accused or suspected of Heresie. The <hi>Protestants</hi> in all ages, when they were questioned, (and especially since the yeere 1500. that the differences about Religion have even filled <hi>Europe</hi> with the sharp disputes of the sword and pen) have not only offered to do whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ancient Fathers required as an act sufficient to cleare and acquit such as were in their times suspected of heresie, but further to put their cause to the triall of the Scriptures, the best and surest Rule; nay, to admit the Decrees of the first Generall Councels, and the united Tenets of the Orthodox Fathers for the first five hundred yeers. But the <hi>Romish</hi> Synogogue degenerating, first in manners, and then in doctrine; first introducing innumerable Trinkets and Ceremonies, to pester Gods publique worship, and afterwards se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Idolatries, absolutely to kill and poison it, could not satisfie themselves with pressing upon the <hi>Protestants</hi> the confession of those <hi>Truths</hi> they yet maintain'd an I held; but that not a grain of corn might remain in their great heap of chaffe, nor one true Professor be hidden amongst the multitude, they invented four manner of unchristian and tyrannicall courses, whereby to insnare and illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queate not only the most innocent, but even the most prudent and sagacious man alive. First, they proceeded against any person they suspected, without accuser, witnesse, or proofe, and fettered his eares with so many Questions to be answered unto upon oath, and with so many severall examinations at severall times, that at last, as <hi>John de Monluce,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Valence,</hi> well observed of the <hi>Spanish Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in the yeer 1562. that it was <hi>Decipula ad vexandos bonos &amp; illa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50931:29"/>
acquitted. A second invention was to adde many new matters to be confessed as matters of faith, which were before left as matters of liberty and fact, either to hold or not to hold; and in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular did that fatall Conventicle of <hi>Trent</hi> so blasphemously transcend the bounds of all sobriety, as to adde twelve new Articles of faith to the ancient Creed, to be believed upon pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and to this they commonly adjoyned, as a slip or branch of it, adjuration of all former truths, or at least a Recantation. Miserable experience hath taught the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Pseudo-Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the tyrannie of the <hi>Romanists</hi> in this particular, who having assisted them to ruine those godly <hi>Protestants</hi> in the Empire, of the most sound and Orthodox <hi>Helvetick</hi> or <hi>French</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, did, as a reward of their treacherie, finde them more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable against them, inforcing upon them a most dangerous and blasphemous abjuration, then against the others. These two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wayes of <hi>Inquisition</hi> went yet no further then the tongue, but the next that followed included the hands also, and compelled subscription to many false blasphemies, and dangerous heresies. Thus the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Saxonie</hi> desiring to root out all the godly Ministers amongst them of the purer Confessions, would have them subscribe to those two portentuous and monstrous errors, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation and Ubiquity. And it was a notable <hi>Machiavilian</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of <hi>charles</hi> the ninth of <hi>France,</hi> who having enforced the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> in the yeer 1572. by the cruell murther of divers in their sight, and by threatning death to themselves, to cause them to write to Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth, by their Letters under their own hands, that both their conversion to Popery, and abjuration of the truth, had been grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and voluntary. But the fourth and last invention is a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and never failing way, either of discovering the godly, or of shipwracking their consciences, being one of those sins Divines call <hi>Peccata vastantia Conscientiam,</hi> and that is their enforcing them to adore their severall Idolls, by bowing to and towards their hee-Saints and shee-Saints, Altars, Reliques, Crucisixes, and their great <hi>Moloch</hi> of the Masse. This skill they learnt from the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> themselves, who to avoid multiplicitie of Interrogations, with the first holy and Primitive Christians, who abhorred the placing of Images in their publique Temples and Oratories; they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50931:29"/>
asked them in a few words, Will you sacrifice to the Image? <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth of <hi>France</hi> never demanded of <hi>Henry de Clermont</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whether he would turne Papist; but, <hi>will you goe,</hi> (said he) <hi>to Masse?</hi> He knew raw flesh to be harder for a true <hi>Protestant</hi> to digest, then all the other parts of Popery. And doubtless, he that will adore and bow unto or towards an Image, the Sacrament, an Altar, a Communion Table, or any other creature, where the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not meerly Civill, will never stumble at any other part or point of Popery, but may safely passe to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Rhemes.</hi> Oh that the Papists could but see their own vanity in bowing to and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Wafer Cake as God! For they confesse it is not transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated into Christs flesh, unlesse the Priest that consecrate intend to turne and change it. And what then if the Priest be so ignorant, as many be, that he know not the words at which his <hi>quu</hi> or <hi>turne</hi> is come by his imagination onely to worke a miracle? what if his minde be roving about his necessary affaires, or more unnecessarie and vainer thoughts, usuall with them that reade one particular often over, and so inadvertently he forget to joyne his intention to the words of Consecration? Doubtless, these cases and divers besides, might be instanced; in which the Priest hath often and doth daily faile to create his Saviour (blasphemy I confesse posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to affirme) for want of meere advertency and premeditation within the rules of the <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue it selfe. And then what follows, but formall and materiall Idolatry, by their owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, when they adore it? So as should the Papists themselves see a Protestant Prelate or Minister bowing to and adoring the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, before or after Consecration, he could not but account him a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly affected Priest belonging to his owne Church, or an absolute Idolater; For in the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of Religion, published by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> agreeing expresly with the <hi>Helvetick</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Confessions, it is plainly let downe; That Transubstantiation or any change of the substance of Bread and Wine, is repugnant to the plaine words of the Scripture, overthroweth the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions; That the body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper of the Lord onely after an heavenly and spirituall manner; And that the meane whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50931:30"/>
faith; And that the Sacrament was not by Christs Ordinance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped; So the Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> When therefore any Papist shall see his Masse celebrated by any <hi>English</hi> Divine, with Elevation and Adoration, or bowing to and towards it, both gestures being condemned by the doctrine of that Church, he must either within, and by the rules of his own Church give him up for an adaquate Idolater, in giving adoration to the substances of Bread and Wine, which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Romanists</hi> abhorre and condemne, or else in charitie sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose howsoever in outward shew he seem an heretick, yet in truth he is a good Catholick; and did intend in and by the words of Consecration to make his Saviour; and so supposing his body to be really there before him, doth adore and bow to it. The <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> condemne the Popish Transubstantiation; the Jesuites deride the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Consubstantiation and Ubiquitie, and both just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But should they heare of any subtle wittall, that hath in theso dayes found out a third and more sublime invention out of the Bush that the man in the Moone carries at his back, and can finde Christs body in the Sacrament as really and naturally as it was in the Virgins wombe; but yet will not say, he is bodily there either <hi>Con, Sub,</hi> or <hi>Trans,</hi> they would most justly hisse him out of their Churches and Schooles. Doubtlesse, the Popish Transubstantiation is of the three the most rationall and profound error, because that being accompanied with a supposed Miracle, and may be at any time excused by the inadvertent default of the Priest, admits the losse opposition. And I have often wondred why some of that active rabble could not as well and as secretly on the sudden have suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited true flesh instead of the <hi>Hostia,</hi> as they have by an insensible legerdemaine sprinkled pure and lively bloud from a lancinated singer upon the Wafer Cake it selfe. Certainly, there is no truth in Scripture more plainly set down then that doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of the more Orthodox reformed Churches, in which they maintaine and teach, that Christs body is ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, and there remaineth as visibly and circumscriptively as it did upon earth before it ascended, that it is onely present given and taken in the Sacrament, after an heavenly and spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that to worship it, or make it a sacrifice, are blasphemous and dangerous deceits, from all which it will undoubtedly and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50931:30"/>
follow, that Christs body is no more present at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment really and carnally after the words of Consecration, then it was present with the Bread before it was brought into the Church, or with that which is left after the administration of the Sacrament ended, and is carried againe out of the Church, where also it may as lawfully be adored, as at any time during the holy administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it selfe, each adoration being grosse Idolatry. Were the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantest men and silliest women able in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert this truth, even by dispute against those bloudy Bishops and Idolatrous Priests, that would have obtruded Christs reall presence in the Sacrament, and their blasphemous sacrifice of the Masse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and after to die for it; and shall wee not thinke thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands will be now ready also in all humilitie and patience to lay downe their lives for the same Truth? How dangerous in all ages this idolatrous adoration or bowing to Images, Altars, the <hi>Hostia,</hi> Reliques, and such other trumpery, hath been to the very moderate <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, appeares by a pretty relation in the History of learned <hi>De Thou;</hi> That <hi>Francis</hi> the second in the yeare 1559. being perswaded by the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and some others of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that there was no way to discover and irretiate the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> like that of their Images, did cause them to be erected and set up with Candles burning before them in severall streets and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent places of <hi>Paris,</hi> to which there assembled divers tankard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, scullions, and other such like of the dregs and scumme of the people, who to the shame of the Priests and all Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, prophanely chanted and sang before them: And when any passed by, were he <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> if he did not presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them money towards the maintenance of those Tapers, and adore the Idoll, they fell upon him; and not contented to make him tast of their fists and handy-blowes, or to throw him into the dirt, and trample on him, did after all those grosse abuses carry him to prison, there to be further questioned; many sober <hi>Papists</hi> having hast of businesse, not seeing the Images, or otherwise not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the disorderly carroling of such a company of Varlets, were by them basely assaulted, beaten, and spoiled, to the great distaste, and open repining of the best and discreetest Citizens, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies truly caec-obedient and zealous <hi>Romanists.</hi>

               <p>YEt must we not think that <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Heretiques</hi> ought so to be indulged, as thereby to be confirmed, and made more pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their <hi>heresies.</hi> They ought to be instructed, reproved, and discountenanced, and if they prove irrecoverably obstinate, exiled. Wee see God himself commanded the <hi>Jewes</hi> to put an Idolater and a blasphemer to death; and though I do not conceive that to be an Evangelicall precept, but onely a judiciall law, proper and peculiar to that people and Church, yet doubtlesse it may thence by the rule of Analogie be concluded, that where Idolatry and Heresie are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, as amongst <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Montanists</hi> or <hi>Altar-adorers,</hi> or where blasphemy and heresie meet in one, as amongst the <hi>Arrians, Pelagians,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> the followers of <hi>Sebastian Castellio,</hi> and <hi>James Arminius,</hi> there a more severe course may be warrantably pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised to stop the dispersing of that poyson, then for the suppressing of any other <hi>Heretiques,</hi> who are not guilty of those two abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but onely hold some lesser errours. Incomparable <hi>Monsieur de Thou,</hi> saith in the Preface before his History, dedicated to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of <hi>France,</hi> that exile or banishment was the first and greatest punishment that ever the ancient Church inflicted upon <hi>Heretiques,</hi> (which on all sides is acknowledged to have been a true Church) as wee see in the banishment of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> under those two pious Emperors, <hi>Theodosius</hi> &amp; <hi>Valentinian;</hi> and in the exilement of divers kinds of <hi>Heretiques</hi> under <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Marcianus:</hi> But when men have joyned, either open rebellion and treason, or proditorious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to their Religion, as the <hi>Papists,</hi> or have maintained <hi>Anarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Theses</hi> as a part of their doctrine, condemning <hi>Monarchie, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie,</hi> and all civill government, as the <hi>Anabaptists:</hi> In these cases, although they did absolutely defend dogmaticall and fundamentall errors, yet were their exilement or a greater punishment justly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on them, because the case is now altered from matter of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to matter of offence &amp; crime. Had the <hi>Protestants</hi> been but once guilty of such an unmatched villanie, as the <hi>Powder-plot</hi> was, in any part of the world where they are tolerated, they had doubtlesse been for ever rooted out from thence; for though some desperate <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> only were ingaged in the execution, yet in the generall, questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse, all the <hi>Recusants</hi> of <hi>England</hi> knew, that a great action was in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50931:31"/>
hand, against Church and State; and that their <hi>Romish Synagogue</hi> was to be erected in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> upon the ruines of them both: And for the prosperity of it, as <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> himself confessed, they all prayed. Nay, when divers <hi>English Papists,</hi> admonished by the guilt of their own conscience, fled upon the discovery thereof into <hi>France,</hi> and were kindly received there by the Governour of <hi>Callis,</hi> and he comforting them, in respect they had left their countrey, estates and friends; No, saith one of them to him again, <hi>Wee grieve not at all for those losses, but that so brave and excellent an action</hi> (meaning the Powder-treason) <hi>had no better successe.</hi> At which answer, the said Governour was so extremely incensed (as hee often after him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self related to the same <hi>de Thou,</hi> who delivers the Story) that hee verily thought to have precipitated the varlet headlong into the sea. And as for their <hi>Romish</hi> doctrines, manifestly tending to treason, conspiracy and rebellion, they were so exactly collected together into one bo ly by learned Bishop <hi>Morton,</hi> and published in the yeere 1605. a little after the discovery of that treason, as wee shall need a great deal of charity to believe they can be good subjects in and under any <hi>Protestant</hi> Prince or State. Neither do the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> come much short of the <hi>Papists</hi> in their dangerous tenets or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, although they exactly imitate their old master <hi>Pelagius</hi> in one particular, which <hi>Vossius</hi> himselfe confesseth of him, teaching many of their desperate doctrines, as he did, privately, which yet they conceale and suppresse in their published Tractates, which have given so many fatall wounds to the true Church of God in this and the last preceding age; for the proofe whereof, wee shall need to produce no other witnesses then those two sincere and impartiall Historians, <hi>John Sleidane,</hi> and the same <hi>Monsieur de Thou,</hi> from whom wee may learne, that after <hi>Melchior Hofman</hi> had broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his wicked Tenets in <hi>Germany,</hi> about the yeere 1520. and with his disciples, <hi>Thomas Muncer, Bernard Rotman,</hi> and <hi>John Leyden</hi> had assumed to themselves the name of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and drawn many of the baser sort after them, whom they perswaded not to suffer any of Noble blood to remain; and that there could be no other lawfull Magistrate, but one of their Sect: they easily drew them to take armes, and possessing themselves of the city of <hi>Munster</hi> in <hi>Westphalia,</hi> had like to have proved the utter ruine of it, had it not been delivered by the armes of some of the <hi>Germane</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50931:32"/>
Princes, after which followed the execution of divers of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. After these men succeeded as chiefe propagators of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <hi>John Cerdo,</hi> hanged at <hi>Brussels, Michael Servetus</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> burnt at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Apelman</hi> executed at <hi>Vtrecht</hi> in the yeare 1570. all three of them, though guiltie of divers grosse heresies, yet were condemned and put to death for blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and other notorious crimes. <hi>John Williams</hi> their successor, finding their treasonable and <hi>Anarchicall</hi> positions to afford them no safety in any well governed Monarchie or Republique, got him to <hi>Ruremund,</hi> in the Dutchie of <hi>Guelders,</hi> and there having drawn to his partie some three hundred varlets and mean sellowes, hee told them no goods could rightly appertain to any man but of their own Sect, and therefore assured them, whatsoever they could get by pillaging and robbery, was a lawfull gain: by which means ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny horrible and grievous thefts and spoiles were committed in <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland,</hi> and in the Dutchie of <hi>Cleve</hi> adjoyning. The said <hi>Williams</hi> also being taken, was for his many abominable offences and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies burnt at <hi>Buslaken</hi> in the Dutchie of <hi>Juliers,</hi> yet died so coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously, like <hi>Servetus</hi> his fellow <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> as that their Sect was exceedingly confirmed and increased thereby; so as had not their other portentous crimes justly necessitated their capitall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, it had been much better for the true Church of God, their lives had been spared: For whereas before ignorant men had for the most part presidented their Church and kingdom, (for their chief Prophets commonly governed all the rest after their own wills) these mens sufferings drew on, as may be easily gathered, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Bibliander</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Castellio,</hi> to give up their names to the maintenance of the same blasphemies, who cunningly defended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their publique writing those points which <hi>Pelagius</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broached, whom <hi>Arminius, Vorstius,</hi> and the other <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of the nether <hi>Germany</hi> have since followed; but for those dangerous and unsafe doctrines of condemning Magistracy, extirpating No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and permitting robberies, howsoever they may still in private teach and adhere to them, and would, perhaps, if they could once make the stronger partie in any State, soon enough practise them, yet they have most politickly omitted, not onely the maintenance, but the very mention of them also, in the said published Works and Tractates. Thus also the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, upon occasion, being
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50931:32"/>
pressed with any of their seditious tenets, will deny them; as <hi>Peter Cotton</hi> the Jesuite did their allowing of the murther of Kings after <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> was stabbed by that wicked Jesuited var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, <hi>Ravaillac;</hi> and <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> at his execution protested, that he ever abhorred the <hi>Gunpowder-plot.</hi> The <hi>Pelagians,</hi> in the time of the ancient <hi>Britaines</hi> were the undoubted instruments of the ruine of <hi>England,</hi> then called <hi>Britaine,</hi> of murthering <hi>Constantine</hi> the father and <hi>Constans</hi> the son, both successive Kings there, and of setting the Royall Crown upon the head of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianized</hi> traytor against his Soveraign, who in lieu thereof to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them, soon filled up, as may be probably collected, the Bishops Seas, to which neither Baronies nor Sericality were then, nor for five hundred yeares after annexed, with hereticall and lazie droanes, who had well-neere ruined the true Church of God in those dayes. All the world may know what warning King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that learned Prince, gave to the united States of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by his published Works upon the death of the <hi>Anabaptist Arminius,</hi> and succession of that blasphemous <hi>Vorstius</hi> in his roome and chaire at <hi>Layden,</hi> that if they did not in time look to the suppression of those blasphemous Heretiques, they would in the end prove the ruine of their Church and State. God of his infinit mercy grant that they may never be able to bring desolation or subversion to them; nor to any other Church, Kingdome, or State of Christendome, where the Gospel and the truth are established, by the increasing of their numbers and powers to an excessive and formidable proportion.</p>

1500. never to have grown to that senslesse and belluine height of malice against the godly, as neither to suffer them to enjoy their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and quiet of their consciences at home, nor yet peaceably and innocently to leave their deare and native countrey, and to plant themselves in such parts of the world as they may enjoy their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace without offence or scandall to any. <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was one of the most prodigious offenders against God, in his time, having vitiated women of the noblest rank, violated contracts of the deepest nature, murthered his eldest son, and third wife, unjustly detained the Kingdome of <hi>Navarre,</hi> broken his oath with <hi>Arragon, Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the most resolved and premeditated persecutor of Christendome, being wholly actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; precipitated to it by <hi>Nicholas Perenot,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Granvellan,</hi> and the bloody Inquisitors, yet in the yeer, 1575. he set out a publick Declaration touching all the Inhabitants of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> that it should be lawfull for any that would not embrace the <hi>Rom m</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to depart from thence whither soever they would, and to sell their estates, or else to. retain them, and to receive the profits of them: And not many yeers after, he gave liberty also to the very <hi>Mahometan Moores</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> amounting to divers thousands, to depart freely thence, into any <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> there to enjoy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the bloody Inquisitors, and with his own shipping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed many of them safe into <hi>France,</hi> through which, by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clous permission of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, they had safe and free passage. <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth also, the <hi>French</hi> King, did by his Agents earnestly sollicite <hi>Lewes de Clermont,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and <hi>Gaspar de Colignie,</hi> Earle of <hi>Cistillion,</hi> Admirall of that Kingdome, being the chief Commanders and Directors of the <hi>Protestants</hi> affaires, to depart the Kingdome, with the rest of the Religion; and that they might begin a Plantation in the Island of <hi>Florida</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> hee not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave leave to the first expedition, which was undertaken by <hi>John Ribald,</hi> in the yeer 1562. but also, at the same Admirals intreaty, did contribute very largely himself to the second navigation, which was entred upon, not long after the first, by <hi>Renate Laudonere,</hi> and divers other <hi>Protestants.</hi> But it pleased God, that this fair occasion, not only of enlarging the <hi>French</hi> Empire, but also of planting a blessed Church amongst those <hi>Heathen</hi> people, was in the very bloome and infancy prevented and brought to nothing by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50931:33"/>
of <hi>Luidonere</hi> himself, and by those factious <hi>Romanists</hi> about the King, who occasioned new civill wars and tumults in the Realme. After the horrible and inhumane massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the yeer 1572. which was partly resolved upon, because the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> would not upon any terms remove out of <hi>France,</hi> and so desert and leave their deare and native countrey: <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> intending to take that occasion, to extirpate the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion out of his own Dominions, which he might have done by their slaughters, yet gave them liberty to depart whithersoever they would in safety, and full time to sell and dispose of their goods and estates. Nay Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whose bloody persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall make her raign infamous to the worlds end, yet in her first yeer expressed so much mercy, as having publikely declared, that she meant to restore the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion; shee further permitted to all her subjects that would not professe the same, free liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of her kingdome; by which the lives and ravagings of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds were saved, and amongst them divers of the Clergie; for the first sensible persecution began then in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where the Idolatrous bowing to the Masse and Altar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wickedly practised and pressed, divers immediatly left the same Colledge thereupon. Now if the Popish Prelates of those times, who accounted the <hi>Protestants</hi> arch-heretiques, and mortally hated them, did yet perswade the Kings and Princes they served, and too often misadvised, to permit the <hi>Protestants</hi> freedome of departure, with liberty and time to sell their goods and estates; is it possible that there should live in and under any <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterately hating Prelates, against the weaker and humbler Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who dissent from them, as themselves pretend, only in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of form and order, arbitrary to be abolished or retained by the supreme Magistrate, as neither to suffer them to live quietly at home without vexation, suites, fines, suspension, deprivation, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, which in many cases occasioneth their immature deaths, nor yet suffer them to depart quietly, to plant a Church amongst the very <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves, to the honour of God, and the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Soveraignes Empire and profit? Is it possible that so many miles distance should not abate and asswage the very malice of <hi>Rome</hi> it self against them? Were their departure like that of the fugitive <hi>Romanists</hi> a few yeers since, to joyn with the publike enemies

of the Kingdome, to invade it, and to be more forward to subdue it to a cruell and barbarous Nation, as they were in eighty eight, then the adversaries themselves, then might there be some colourable reason to use all extremity and cruelty against them for their ruine and extirpation; but when their hearts and soules breath forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but loyaltie and innocencie, the throne and kingdome fare the better for their prayers and humiliations, and the worst they desire, is but the quiet of their own consciences; how is it possible they should be so prodigiously hated of any, that would but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend truly to love the Gospel, and heartily to vote the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it? Certainly it is impossible they should be so transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with barbarous rage, as some of the <hi>Popes</hi> have been, who rather desired to see the ruine of those innocent Christians, then of the very <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> unlesse they will yeeld themselves to be as deeply toxicated with the dregs of that <hi>Romish</hi> cup as the Jesuites are, who in the yeere 1578. began to preach and teach publikely, that it was a more acceptable work to God, for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes to root out and persecute all Sectaries and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes amongst themselves, then for them to joyn their forces against the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> A doctrine, saith <hi>Monsieur de Thou,</hi> (one of their own Historians) contrary to all Christian pietie and mansue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who with the rest of the sober and moderate <hi>Romanists,</hi> by their charitable and advised censures, given of the strictest and most tender conscienced <hi>Christians,</hi> (notwithstanding they most abhor any the least intermixtures and additions in Gods Worship, which have been introduced by the <hi>Papists</hi>) shall at the last day rise up in judgement against the invectives of many seeming <hi>Protestants,</hi> of both orders, against the same persons, endeavouring thereby to prepossesse the eares and fascinate the judgements of the greatest Princes, that so they may obtain license and power under them, utterly to ruine and destroy their humble and pious fellow-Christians, who are notwithstanding permitted quietly and safely to enjoy the publike liberty of their conscience in those Kingdomes and States where the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion it self flourisheth.</p>

And further implored his own Subjects, <hi>Not to endeavour to force him to the change of his Religion, which he knew to be the truth, being a cruelty hee desired not to practise upon the meanest of them.</hi> The <hi>Protestants</hi> will yeeld up their Religion as false and wicked, if ever such an example can be produced against them, where they had libertie of conscience sincerely afforded them, and yet took up armes against their lawfull Soveraign. But those unreasonable <hi>French Papists,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true limbs of the <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue, whose faith was then facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whose Religion was then rebellion, would embrace no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of peace, no offers of pacification from their own undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly lawfull and warlike King, as long as he continued in the open profession of that truth, in which he had been educated under <hi>Joan D'Albret,</hi> hereditary Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> his royall and godly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who also upon her death-bed had expresly charged him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to recede from it. This brave Prince seeing nothing but an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine threatened to his kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> either by cantoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing it into <hi>Provinces,</hi> or setting a forainer on the Throne, (which <hi>Charles Lorainer</hi> Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> had out of some ambitious and self-respects of his own, a while opposed and prevented) in the yeer 1593. submitted himself to a publike recidivation, which though it brought on an outward peace to that Realme, yet was the King himself never freed from continuall Treasons and Conspiracies, hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against him in the dens and nests of the Jesuites, till at the last he perished under one of them to the irreparable losse, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>France,</hi> but likewise of all Christendome. Neither did the <hi>Papists</hi> cease to vilifie his very act of reconciling himself to their Church, saying, as <hi>Monsieur de Thou</hi> himself confesseth, that either

his conversion was fained, as it had been before in the yeer 1572. and that a false Catholike would do more hurt in their Church then a true <hi>Heretique,</hi> or else that he loved the Crown of <hi>France</hi> better then he did the kingdome of Heaven, that to gain that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inward convincement, would turn from one Religion to another.</p>

               <p>AFter this martiall Prince had deserted the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion to the great astonishment and excessive griefe of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Gospel, both at home and abroad; What did his <hi>French</hi> Subjects of the <hi>Helvetick</hi> Confession instantly rebell against him, and deny him due and lawfull obedience, as his Popish Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had done before? Nothing lesse; but all the disobedience they shewed to him, or expressed towards him, consisted in humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Remonstrances, that they might still enjoy the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique libertie of their Consciences; and he as graciously yeelded to their just and Christian Petitions; and all the time he raigned, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgat their cause or prayers, or suffered any of his bloudy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, or Jesuited Counsellors, to molest, vex, cite, fine, suspend, deprive, or imprison any of them, and much lesse to butcher them, or draw bloud from them; because he knew every one of those acts are essentially true and down-right persecution, as well as shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their blouds; onely there is a graduall difference in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes of the sufferers as well as in the cruelty of the destroyers. As strange was the example of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of <hi>England,</hi> who led by the advice of some of his Sycophanticall Popish Prelates, thought to have established the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, without admitting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Papacy, whose unerring spirit is to that Synagogue like the soule to the body, or the Sunne to the firmament. But he soone saw his error, and would doubtless, had he lived, have made that integrall and saving Reformation, which his Royall Sonne so piously finished; for he himselfe and his new Popery, were more abhorred by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Vassalls, as a monstrous and inconsistent Church, then the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> themselves, who had made a rationall and intire defection from that man of sonne. For the Pope and his Conclave employed Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:50931:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths neare kinsman) as their Ambassadour to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth the Emperour, to exhort and perswade him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to invade the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Dominion, rather then to make warre against the <hi>Turke</hi> himselfe. And the reason why the Pope was so vehement in his prosecution against that King, doth palpably and fully appeare from the very words ensuing of the Decree of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, in his Extravagants set forth by himselfe in the eighth yeare of his Papacy, about the yeare 1300. <hi>Subesse Romano pontifici</hi> (saith he) <hi>omni humanae creaturae declaramus, dicimus, definimus, &amp; pronunciamus omnino esse de necessitate salut is:</hi> We declare, define, and pronounce, that it is necessary for every one that is to be saved, to be subject to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> The same doctrine doth the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, bearing date there in the yeare 1564. &amp; the <hi>Romish</hi> Catechisme set out a little after, doth maintain and confirme in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth Sections thereof, in their exposition of the twentieth Article of their new Creed, (to which Creed their Prelates and other Ecclesiasticks are compelled to sweare, that they hold it to be the true Catholick faith) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strongly disputed for also by <hi>Suarez</hi> in his first booke and twelfth Chapter against the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> by <hi>Gregorie de Valentia</hi> in his <hi>Analysis, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his third booke and fifth Chapter of the Church Militant; That though any Prince, Prelate, Priest, State, or Church, should receive all the other parts of the <hi>Romish</hi> faith &amp; Religion, abolishing the doctrine and discipline of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and should onely deny the Popes Supremacy and subjection to him, yet they should still remaine damnable and wicked hereticks; So as the light of the Sunne is not more cleare then that the Pope in this one particular imitates God himselfe, hating more a linsey-woolsey mungrell halting Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <hi>Protestant,</hi> then a true and zealous one. Blessed therefore are those Monarchs, Princes, and States, who preserve the Evangelick truth, without the least intermixtures of false doctrine and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall additions; for to halt between light and darknesse, and to intermix Idolatrous actions, or Popish errors, with saving truths, will necessarily draw on the ruine of the godly, and the hatred of the Papacy, and bring downe Gods judgements as causal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an absolute, entire, and plenary defection and recidivation. And then if the Popes headship be once admitted, a volume would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50931:36"/>
not suffice, how not onely every proud Prelate, but even every Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Priest; might trample on the Soveraignes Crowne and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, murther their fellow-subjects, and be guilty of a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther villanies, without dreading or regarding the punishment of the Temporall sword.</p>

Justly therefore did <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of <hi>England</hi> free himselfe from this Papall Tyranny: and if he had been possibly sensible of those bodily pangs, or inward remorses and horrors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death-bed, which the Papists mention, yet could not these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine flagellations be imputed to his defection from <hi>Rome,</hi> and error, as they pretend, but to his shedding of so much innocent bloud of Gods Saints, by the instigation of his sanguinary Prelates. For in <hi>France</hi> after that barbarous and cruell Massacre in the yeare 1572. upon the eighth day of <hi>November</hi> the same yeare, there appeared a dreadfull Comet, touching which some learned <hi>Protestant</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately published an elaborate and exquisite Poem, presaging that it was Gods Herald or Messenger to denounce his judgement shortly to ensue upon that Kingdome, for their newly perpetrated inhumane butcherie.

parts of the body, but in the inwards and vitals also, as it drew on divers horrid convulsions, and in many blindnes it self before they dyed. The strange originall, the hidden nature and those unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld torments it produced, sometimes resembling the very stabs and gashes made with swords and poygnards, gave all impartiall judgements just ground to conclude it to be the finger of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in punishing the mercilesse murthers of his dear Saints. And a blessed warning it may be to all Christian Kingdoms and States, that a seasonable remedie to stop the growing of the plague, pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and other severall diseases and judgements may questionlesse be applyed, by inhibiting and abolishing the power and malice of such Popish Prelates as count it their chiefest solace to waste and persecute the pious and godly <hi>Protestants,</hi> that so the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church might againe flourish, as it did in the Primitive times under learned, religious, sober, faithfull, preaching Pastors and Ministers.
