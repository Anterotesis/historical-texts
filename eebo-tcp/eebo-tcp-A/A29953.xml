            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Anſwer <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> and ſhall inſtance in <hi>two</hi> of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt which occur to my Memory at this time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>One</hi> is of <hi>Alphonzo</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> who having conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> Gave it to his <hi>Natural Son</hi> by his laſt <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Leon,</hi> who having conquer'd <hi>Portugal</hi> from the <hi>Moors,</hi> Gave it in Marriage with his <hi>Bastard Daughter</hi> to <hi>Count Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſo that here are <hi>two</hi> Examples, <hi>one</hi> by <hi>Teſtament,</hi> the other <hi>per Donationem inter Vivos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here is to be noted, that no <hi>Ancient</hi> or <hi>Hereditary Rights</hi> were diſpoſ'd of, but the <hi>Conquerors</hi> new <hi>Acquiſitions,</hi> for 'tis Affirm'd by moſt Lawyers, that no <hi>King</hi> in a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that is by the ancient <hi>cuſtom</hi> and <hi>fundamental Laws</hi> of the Realm <hi>meerly ſucceſſive,</hi> either to the <hi>Heirs male</hi> or <hi>Heirs general,</hi> can any wayes diſpoſe of his Kingdom, in prejudice of the <hi>next Heir</hi> in blood, according to the Cuſtom; no not, though the Parties intereſſed, ſhould Commit <hi>Treaſon,</hi> or be excluded by any Act of the <hi>States</hi> or <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Treaſon</hi> cannot avoid a <hi>Lawfull ſucceſſion</hi> in <hi>blood,</hi> We have an Example in <hi>Louis</hi> the 12th. Who was in Armes againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. both Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and Our <hi>Own</hi> King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

7th. ſtood attainted of <hi>high-Treaſon</hi> at the time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.4.</note> and by the Judges in their Conſultation, in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plowd Com. <hi>f. 238.</hi>
               </note> what ſhould be done for the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Attainder,</hi> it was with unanimous conſent Reſolved, That the <hi>Crown</hi> takes away all defects and ſtops in <hi>blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cok's Litt. <hi>f. 16.</hi>

               </note> but however for the ſake of <hi>Honour</hi> (ſays the <hi>Lord Verulam</hi>) it is ordain'd by <hi>Parliament</hi> that all <hi>Records</hi> in which there was any memory or mention of the King's <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder,</hi> ſhould be defaced, cancelled, and taken off the Flie.</p>
            <p>So in the Caſe of <hi>George Duke</hi> of <hi>Clarence,</hi> We find the Pue'<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple (though he was their great <hi>Favourite</hi>) were not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about his <hi>Attainder,</hi> ſince they had Learnt by the Kings Example, that <hi>Attainders</hi> do not interrupt the Conveying of a <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is Evident, that by the Laws of this Kingdom, there can be no <hi>Inter-Regnum</hi> within the ſame, and that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by Deſcent, the next Heir in blood is compleatly and abſolutely King, without any <hi>eſſential Ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> to be done, <hi>Ex poſt facto</hi>; and that <hi>Coronation</hi> is but a <hi>Royall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,</hi> and outward <hi>Solemnization</hi> of the <hi>Deſcent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having conſidered the <hi>Subject</hi> in the <hi>leſs Diſputable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> I come to the <hi>Grand Doubt,</hi> That is,</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>An Act of Parliament may alter the Courſe of Right Succeſſion in Blood?</hi> There are, I muſt confeſs, <hi>Statutes</hi> that make it <hi>Treaſon</hi> but to deny it, but never otherwiſe made, then only for fear or flattery of the <hi>preſent</hi> Prince, and <hi>after,</hi> never obſerved; and I am confident, 'tis the Deſire of the ſober and temperate ſort here, That any <hi>New One</hi> of that nature, may have the <hi>ſame</hi> Fate. I hope we are pretty well ſecur'd, having a King of ſuch excellent Wiſdom and Princely Virtue, bearing ſuch a ſacred regard to His Laws, that the <hi>Royal Aſſent</hi> ſhall never be raviſht from him, to ſtamp ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate Coin, as muſt paſs Currant for diſabling His <hi>Royal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,</hi> to inherit the Crown of theſe three Kingdoms.</p>
