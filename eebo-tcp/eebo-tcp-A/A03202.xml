            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thus excuse. That as <hi>Playes</hi> were then some fifteene or sixteene yeares agoe it was in the fashion. Nor could it haue found a more seasonable and fit publication then at this Time, when, to the glory of our Nation, the security of the Kingdome, and the honour of the City, they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne againe the commendable practise of long forgotten Armes, the continuance of which I wish, the discipline approue, and the encouragement thereof euen with my soule applaude.

            <p n="2">2 I come to excuse the name of the Play?</p>
            <p n="3">3 I the errours in the Play.</p>
            <p n="1">1 And I the Author that made the Play. Touching the name, why is it called, <hi>True and Strange,</hi> or <hi>The foure Prentises of London?</hi> A Gentleman that heard the subiect discourst, said it was not possible to be true; and none here are bound to beleeue it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Tis true, that <hi>Alexander</hi> at thirty yeares of age con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the whole world; but strange he should doe so. If we should not beleeue things recorded in former ages, wee were
<pb facs="tcp:21217:5"/>
not worthy that succeeding times should beleeue things done in these our ages.</p>
            <p n="1">1 But what authority haue you for your History? I am one of those that wil beleeue nothing that is not in the Chronicle.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Our authority is a Manuscript, a booke writ in parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which not being publique, nor generall in the world, wee rather thought fit to exemplifie to the publique cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, things concealed and obscur'd, such as are not common with euery one, than such Historicall Tales as euery one can tell by the fire in Winter. Had not yee rather, for nouelties sake, see <hi>Ierusalem</hi> yee neuer saw, then <hi>London</hi> that yee see howerly? So much touching the name of our History.</p>
            <p n="1">1 You haue satisfied me; and, I hope, all that heare me. Now what haue you to speake concerning the errours in the Play?</p>
            <p n="3">3 We acknowledge none: For the errors we could finde, we would willingly amend; but if these cleere-sighted Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with the eyes of their iudgements, looking exactly into vs, finde any imperfections which are hid from our selues, our request is, you would rather looke ouer them, then through them, not with a troubled eye, that makes one obiect to seeme two, but with a fauourable eye, which hath power in it selfe to make many to seeme none at all.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Oh now I vnderstand you. Three Prologues to our Play, pardon mee, y'aue need of three hundred, me thinkes, and all little enough. But to end our beginning in a word. Thus much by the patience of these Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Spectators, should you oppose your iudgements against vs: where we are three, which some would thinke too many; were we three thousand, we thinke our selues to few. Our Author submits his labours to you, as the Authors of all the content he hath within this circumference.</p>
