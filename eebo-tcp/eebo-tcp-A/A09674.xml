            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Patronage, theſe
few Sermons of a deceaſed
worthy friend, it is not ſo
much the acknowledgment
of thoſe great favours and
noble reſpects wherewith
you were pleaſed to grace
<pb facs="tcp:14651:3"/>
Him, and ſince his death
haue vouchſafed to extend

be to be regarded (how
properly and peculiarly they
doe belong to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
both in reſpect of the
Authour and the Argument.
The Authour was one,
whom, for his ſingular dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in the Arts, depth
of iudgement, ſharpneſſe of
wit, and eſpecially his skill in
languages, Hebrew, Greeke,
Arabicke, you were pleaſed
to make choice of for one of
your Readers during your
abode at <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi>
in <hi>Oxon,</hi> in which time you
<pb facs="tcp:14651:3"/>
ſo obliged him by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
teſtimonies of your
good affection to him, that
He oft profeſſed to mee how
great &amp; iuſt an intereſt your
merits claimed in all his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

you here ſee is but an Eſſay
to ſome maſter-peece which
you might haue expected, if
he had liued to finiſh what he
attempted in the Greek An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
&amp; obſeruations on
the Hebrew Text. For the
matter, it being a Theame of
the weightieſt buſineſſe in
Chriſtianity, the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
of all; which if it bee
not firſt rooted in the heart,
all other our concluſions and
ſpeculations in Diuinity will
<pb facs="tcp:14651:4"/>
bee but like the building a
Caſtle in the ayre, and may
giue the ſoule content per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
of a rare ſpeculation,
but cannot of a powerfull,
experimentall, ſoule-quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and ſoule ſauing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
The Argument, I ſay,
being ſuch, as I could not
harden my ſelfe againſt the
requeſts of ſome who deſired
the publiſhing thereof for
the good many ſoules might
reape by it, ſo neither could
I thinke any, fitter to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage

are from the want of it, and I

thus:<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Text.</note> If any man loue not the

for to ſuch S. <hi>Paul</hi> directs his

loue not Chriſt Ieſus let
him bee accurſed in the higheſt
degree. It cannot be expected
that ſuch as ſit in the darkneſſe
of Gentiliſme ſhould loue that

caſe bee lamentable becauſe
they heare of no Sauiour, yet
ſure theirs is farre more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
who heare him daily prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

this is the ſenſe, but in my

that there is no man ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,

Now what can a man haue to

that God is ſuperabundantly

            <p>You haue heard the firſt part
of his burden who in the light
of the Goſpell does not really
loue Chriſt Ieſus to wit, that he
has no part in Chriſt &amp; therfore
all the curſes of the law belong

there needed no more to bee

as heauy a doome as this is, yet
is it but light in compariſon of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14651:20"/>

vp vnto himſelfe a farre
more compleat vengeance for
his diſeſteeme and contempt of
the Goſpell. It were well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
if when Chriſt Ieſus
comes vnto a man and that man
receaues him not, if hee left
him in no worſe caſe then hee
found him, though that were
vnconceauably miſerable: But
it's neuer ſo. For if hee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes
not Chriſt as a Sauiour,
hee is ſure to haue him hence
forth his accuſer, and if he will
not admit him <hi>ad ſalutem,</hi> hee
ſhall haue him whether hee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14651:20"/>
will or no <hi>ad Teſtimonium.</hi> It's
true which our Sauiour told
<hi>Nicodemus Ioh. 3. 17. That
God ſent not his Sonne into the
World to condemne the world,
but that the world through him
be ſaued: Chriſt</hi> doth not knocke
at any mans heart with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that he may haue the more
aduantage againſt him if he let
him not in, no hee comes with
purpoſe and deſire to brind in
ſaluation with him, but if hee
and his ſaluation be ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
that we entertaine him
onely with a few cold comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at doore, as I may ſay,
and ſo diſmiſſe him. O then he
goes away in a rage, complaines
to his father that for ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
wretches hee ſhed his
deareſt blood. And therefore
though God ſent not his Sonne
into the world to condemne it,
yet it followes in the next
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14651:21"/>
verſe, <hi>Hee that belieueth not is
condemned already, becauſe hee
belieueth not in the name of the
onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi>
Condemned <hi>&amp;c. hee beleeueth
not. Why?</hi> the Law had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned him before.
True, but now God offers him
a pardon by his Son to exempt
him from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, which
ſeeing hee ſcornes, or cares not
to accept, God will now not
onely haue the other condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to continue it's force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, but hee will load
him with another more heauy,
which ſhall neuer be reuerſed
by any pardon. This is made
more plaine by the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>This is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
that light is come into the

this is that great and finall

are ſo little ſenſible of it, ſo
dully affected with it, that they
care not for making any vſe of
him, but had rather continue
Satan's priſoners ſtill, then
come forth into his maruailous

Chriſt Ieſus and his Goſpell, is
that which makes a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly

remaines henceforth no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

him and our ſoules. And this is
one reaſon why our ſaviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to leaue this world,
ſpeakes ſo much in Saint Iohn
of what the comforter ſhould
doe for him after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>He ſhall teſtify of me</hi> Iohn

Whoſoeuer therefore makes
the Holy ſpirit to labour in

vaine not ſuffering his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to make any impreſſions
vpon his heart, or to get thence
any glory for him whoſe agent
hee is but thinkes hee does
Chriſt Ieſus kindneſſe enough
in that he ſuffers himſelfe to be
called a Chriſtian rather then
a Iew or a Mahumetan, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
rather then a Papiſt. In
what a fit of diſcontent, in
what a chafe (may we thinke)
doth that man ſend or rather
driue away the ſpirit of
Grace. All that I haue ſaid in
this ſecond conſideration is
compriſed in that terrifying
place <hi>Hebr. 10. 28. 29.</hi> which
I know is there applyed vnto
Apoſtates, but wee muſt note

more eaſy, nothing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.
God is not mocked, he
requireth truth in the inward

loue that can be imagined. Doe
you thinke beloued but that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14651:31"/>
the Iewes in our Saviours time
were confidently perſwaded
that they loued God: they
perſecuted our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
becauſe they could not
apprehend him to be the ſonne
of God, but for God himſelfe
they made full account that
they, and none but they loued
him aright. Here was, I dare
ſay, as ſtrong a perſwaſion of
loue to God,<note place="margin">It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a cuſtomary loue to God.</note> if confidence
would beare out the matter as

But behold how miſerably
they were deceaued <hi>Joh. 5.
42.</hi> our Saviour expreſſely tels
them, <hi>But I know you that yee
haue not the loue of God in you.</hi>
The like groſſe deceit of the

vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> why they were

reſolutely haue loſt their liues
in our Saviours time as their

their poſterity ſince, ſo that

<hi>Moſes</hi> &amp;c. Laſtly, to rouze vs
out of the ſlumber of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
let vs take notice of
one example more taken out of

Mat. 7. 22. Luc. 13. 26. where
we reade, <hi>that many ſhall come

we thinke our ſelues, could we
challenge acquaintance with
him vpon the ſame te armes
when he ſhall come in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſee all this might doe vs no
good, ſeeing our Saviour will
ſend many ſuch packing with

knowes them not,</hi> and if he will
not know them, you may bee
ſure they were ſuch as had not
for all theſe floriſhes dealt
kindly and louingly, with him.
Wherefore beloued, you ſee
how much it concernes vs to
pauſe a while on this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We all thinke we loue Chriſt

wee ſee that many, who

<hi>Beza</hi> indeed ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting

and obey his Goſpell with
ſound and honeſt hearts, who
are true Chriſtians in whom is
no guile. For wee muſt note
that as the whole Law of God

Chriſt, which to ſpeake more

for it is no preſumption
for a man to belieue that hee
ſhall bee ſaued vnleſſe hee bee
vnaſſured of this ſuppoſition
that hee is a Chriſtian. In a

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14651:39"/>
grace of God: his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and rewarding grace, and
then his qualifying or ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace, we preſume vpon
that becauſe wee preſume
vpon this, wee make full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his mercies and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
becauſe wee make no
queſtion of thoſe holy qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in our ſelues which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
vs to belieue in him and
to loue him. Now then ſeeing
wee all ſuppoſe that the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
fauours of God doe moſt
vnfallibly appertaine vnto all
and none but ſuch as loue Chriſt
Ieſus, 2. that our ſelues are all
ſuch, the firſt ſuppoſall beeing
cleere out of my text, all our
care muſt bee for the ſecond,
to ſee that we are not miſtaken
in our account of our ſelues.
The triall of all, lies in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
whether we are indeed
thoſe men in reſpect of Chriſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14651:40"/>
which wee verily thinke our
ſelues to bee. That therefore I
may acquaint you both with
the neceſſity and methode of
this triall, that I might ſhew
you both what need wee haue
to examine the ſincerity of our
loue vnto Chriſt and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and after what manner we
ought to goe about, that if it
may pleaſe the opener and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of hearts to effect any thing
by ſo contemptible an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I may awake ſome one
out of that pleaſant, but deadly
ſlumber which poſſeſſeth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands

<note place="margin">The diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is into three moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble points of our loue vnto Chriſt.</note> I haue reſolued by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

opportunities to diſcourſe vnto
you of three generall heads, or
moſt conſiderable points in our

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14651:40"/>
Chriſt; the reaſons wherefore
wee are Chriſtians. 2. the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

ought to loue him, or in what
pitch of reſolution to reſigne
our ſelues vnto him. 3. the
effects and operations of our
loue vnto him, or the ſpeciall
fruites of our ſincerity. In my
diſcourſe of the ground of our

1. I will diſcouer two decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable

fall ſhort of thoſe glorious
hopes which were built vpon
them. 2. I will lay open the
true ground &amp; proper originall
from whence all ſincere affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vnto Chriſt ariſeth. The
firſt of thoſe deceiuable grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14651:41"/>
which will take vp as much

            <p>The fall of man hath not ſo
farre worne out of his heart the
impreſſions of a Deity, and the
engrafted notions of religion,
but that we all bring into the
world with vs thoſe reſtleſſe
inſtincts, and importunate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſions
which will not ſuffer
vs to bee at quiet vntill we are
initiated into ſome Religion or

though it were the ſcope of

altogether irreligious, and the

ſhrewd grudgings and terrible
gripes of naturall conſcience.
And though in the deniall of
diuine prouidence vpon the

that no art or invention can

ſhould be more elevated, more

put to it by our ſelues or others
we can think of no better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for our choice of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
then ſuch as theſe becauſe
we had the fortune to be born
in a place where Chriſt onely
was talked of, becauſe we haue
heard <hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
much ſpoken againſt, and
were ever told that this is the
beſt religion, becauſe the King
and Lawes haue baniſhed all
other Sects, and haue eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

defence wee can make for our

that our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing but
thoſe common reliques of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
inſtincts which I ſpoke
of before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chriſtned, as it were
by humane lawes &amp; cuſtomes,
and that we are Chriſtians up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no waightier inducements,
then wee might haue beene
<hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Idolaters.</hi> I tremble
to ſpeak it; if an <hi>Indian</hi> ſhould
bee demanded why hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
the Divell, changing
only the circumſtances hee
might giue as ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

this example though it might
ſquare but too well to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is too odious to be inſiſted
vpon. Aske a common <hi>Iew</hi>
why he blaſpheames our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

devoted to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they
wil both in effect giue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame reaſons of their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheamies
and ſuperſtitions,
which a common ignorant
Chriſtian will giue why hee is
rather a Chriſtian then a <hi>Iew</hi>
or a <hi>Turke,</hi> juſtifie their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
hatred and deteſtation of
Chriſt, by the ſame arguments,
which cauſe him to profeſſe
ſpeciall loue and ſervice vnto
him. Nay you will ſay there
is no Chriſtian ſo barbarouſly
ignorant but he may ſay more
for himſelfe then any of thoſe
vnbeleeuing miſereants can,
he hath heard the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
read, beene made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the bleſſed Sacraments
he hopes to haue his ſinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
him by Chriſt, &amp; though
hee bee not able to proue it by
formall argumentation, hee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14651:45"/>
knowes well enough that
<hi>Turkes</hi> and all ſuch as ſpeake
againſt Chriſt are accurſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells.
I thinke indeed there
are not many Chriſtians but
may ſay ſo much and perhaps
more, by wrote, and taking it
vp vpon truſt, but this is quite
beſides the purpoſe. For I doe
not now queſtion the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
in the duties or opinions of
his religion, but I cal vpon him
for his ſpeciall reaſons which
cauſe him to performe thoſe
duties, or embrace thoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
He hath beene partaker
of the bleſſed Sacraments, but
what better reaſon can hee
giue why theſe Sacraments
can doe his ſoule good: then a

For the preſent indeed the
Chriſtians caſe is infinitely the
better,<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians caſe is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, only by reaſon of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of correcting his errour.</note> becauſe hee may with

and hath all requiſite opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to that purpoſe, but if he

him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

change places with him. In
the meane time, there is not
any difference in their errors
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14651:48"/>
diſcernable to reaſon, for this
is certaine, that diverſity of
objects cannot put any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the aſſents, where the
grounds are exactly the ſame,
yea if ſome of the acuteſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne

is but one and the ſame
aſſent, being originally to
thoſe, and terminatiuely to
this, I can ſcarce allow the
difference to be ſo great. For
then it skills not how falſe or

or weakly it's inferred

though one conclude an

of both is the ſame, if they
aſſent vnto their concluſions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14651:49"/>
vpon no other <hi>medium</hi> then

they both agree. For example,
the principle vpon which the

the Goſpell ſtands, is this:
That Religion which my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

commanded me, and
the common cry of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

the <hi>Turke</hi> bee caſt vpon
execrable blaſphemies &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties,
and the Chriſtian vpon
heavenly and holy truths, their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14651:49"/>
error is directly the ſame,
though more fortunate in one
then in the other. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſuch a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath his
aſſent &amp; imaginary loue by lot
of his birth and education, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
fixed vpon ſauing truths
yet vntil he bethinke himſelfe
of more proper and ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for his choice, he retaines
ſtill in his breaſt habitually and
implicitly the ſeeds of all thoſe
helliſh impoſtures, which by
other men, in other places,
haue beene entertained and
ſwallowed vpon the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.
Suppoſe a Chriſtian,
who can make no better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
for his profeſſion then
ſuch a one as I haue laboured
to make him aſhamed of, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
after his birth in
England had beene conveyed
into Turkie, and there inſteed
of Baptiſme circumciſed after
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14651:50"/>
the Turkiſh manner, and there
ſo cunningly trained vp in the
Turkiſh ſuperſtition, that hee
had no occaſion giuen him to
ſuſpect himſelfe not to haue
beene borne a Turke: no queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
but he would haue bene as
zealous there for the raſcall
Mahomet: as now being bred
in England, he is for the bleſſed
Lord of the world. And no
marvel, for the very ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>currences
which haue made
him a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here, muſt needs
haue made him a Mahometan
at Conſtantinople, ſeeing that
whatſoeuer arguments drawn
from lawes, cuſtomes, birth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
pleade here for Chriſt
would there perſwade as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
for Mahomet, Neither
ſpeake I this as if this would
argue any notorious imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the man: for doubtles
this would be any mans caſe:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14651:50"/>
Suppoſe any of thoſe renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Champions of Chriſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Queene <hi>Mary</hi> ſent to heauen
in fiery Chariots, had beene
nurſed and brought vp amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt
the Saracens, vnleſſe God had
vouchſafed them a miracle for
their converſion, we cannot i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
but they would haue
beene Saracens. Suppoſe the
deuouteſt Saint of God at this
day breathing had beene trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp at the feet of ſome
Iewiſh Rabbin if we looke no
higher then ordinary meanes,
we muſt needs conceaue that
with the helliſh mallice of a
Iew he would haue defied that
bleſſed Sauiour of his, whom
now he worſhips day &amp; night.
I mentioned not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſhew the weakeneſſe
of the perſon, but of ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of his Chriſtianity, as chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
only the ſcene of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14651:51"/>
and education, might haue
made him hotter againſt it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
now he is for it. So that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fundamentall reaſon why
ſuch a Chriſtian is rather a
Chriſtian then a Iew, Turk, or
Idolater, is becauſe Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beſpoke him as ſoone as hee
came into the world, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
not thoſe madde ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions
either to ſpeake with
him at all or not till it ſelfe had
prevented them and gotten
poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For we may obſerue
that albeit generally in the
world errour keepes truth out
of the ſoules of men by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation,
<note place="margin">A formall Chriſtian is a Chriſtian by educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, &amp; the cuſtome of his country</note>
damming vp all the

ſome corners where divine

to allow truth an authoriſed,

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14651:51"/>
ſtart of errour, and prevailes as
much by prepoſſeſſion here as

beating that away with the

by which it ſelfe is elſewhere

more punctually is not a fight
betweene truth and errour
though by the vndiſcerning
vulgar it be miſtaken for it, but
a kinde of blindfold combate
betweene prejudice and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
or of cuſtome againſt
cuſtome. For in theſe caſes
though truth blocke vp errors

ſtealing into the ſoule, yet doth
not ſhe preſently enter in her

            <p>But here may ſome demand,
if the ſumme of all this that
hath beene ſpoken bee true, to
wit,<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our birth and education amongſt Chriſtians.</note> That our loue vnto Chriſt

that it's an advantage of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable

hath pleaſed the Father of

it ſhould bee a cauſe, but a

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14651:53"/>
theſe are ſome ſpeciall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
apprehended by vs
to bee inherent in the perſon

to bring vs to the knowledge
of theſe. Even ſo in our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

            <p>To conclude this diſcourſe,

thoſe heavenly trances and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vtterable

which now ſhe is tranſported.
All that loue which wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

wee proceeded no farther?
why this will advantage vs

wee are Engliſhmen. All this
is but the outſide of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Chriſtianity thruſt vpon

What ſaith the Apoſtle 2.
Romans, 28. <hi>Hee is not a

               <gap reason="foreign">

which is borne and bred a

whatſoever. But all theſe will
giue him no title to thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
promiſes which are
made vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his
ſeed according to the faith. He
is no Iew in reſpect of them.
In like manner he is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
who is but outwardly
one: who ſlides inſenſibly to
himſelfe into the viſible garbe
of Chriſtianity; by naturall
generation. He only is a Iew,
who is one <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the

ſecrets of his heart, and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a Chriſtian, who hath bin
made one by a ſecond birth of
his ſoule, inviſible to others;
but admirably ſenſible vnto
himſelfe, being borne not of
bloud, nor of the will of the
fleſh, nor of the will of man,
but of God, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it, c. 1. v. 13 Well the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
if thou wouldſt not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

then ſuch as nature and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
may ſuggeſt. Firſt of all
looke backe vpon the eſtate of

beene able to rememeber. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
thus vpon ſo much of

not remember a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thy ſelfe being judge, thou
didſt but diſſemble with thy
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14651:60"/>
Saviour, when thou thoughtſt
of him but very ſeldome, and
then but perfunctorily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any heat of affections,
when thou tookeſt not much
to heart any thing hee hath
done for thee, when thou
tookeſt no conſcionable care
to liue vnto him, becauſe hee
had died for thee. Reflecting
thus vpon thee time paſt, canſt
thou not diſcerne but that thy
loue vnto Chriſt hath beene
ſpun out in an even thread
even from the cradle vntill
now, but that the pulſe of thy
affections vnto him hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
beaten much after the
ſame manner, without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
variation. In a word
can'ſt thou not remember but
that thou haſt loued him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
as well, if not better,
then thou haſt in the latter
time of thy life paſt. I ſay if
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14651:60"/>

thee with vnanſwerable
reaſons, why theſe ſuppoſalls
ſhould not pull thee backe, its
a plaine caſe, that only the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite

art thou not ſure that thou haſt
ſuch ſpeciall peculiar reaſons
for thy religion as could not
haue ſuffered it, much leſſe
haue cauſed thee vpon any
ſuppoſalls to haue beene of any
other. Haſt thou not with an

in Chriſt Ieſus thoſe
vn paralel'd tranſcendencies
which put an inſinitely vaſt
difference betweene him and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14651:61"/>
thoſe many Antichriſts in the
world. Laſtly, haſt thou not at
ſome time or other, in ſome
meaſure had thy conſcience
convicted of ſinne, revived
with ſuch gracious influences
diſtilling from his louely cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance,
and refreſhed with
ſuch words of eternall life
from him, as thou knoweſt
(goe whether thou wilt)
cannot be expected from any
one elſe. If thy heart anſwere
no to theſe interrogatories, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thy ſelfe thou knoweſt
not yet what this meanes to
loue Chriſt, I ſhould but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thee to tell thee thou art a
Chriſtian, yea I ſhould in ſome
ſort mocke thee, by giuing
thee a glorious title, which if
thou continue as thou art, will
no way benefit thee, yea it
will not only keepe thee out
of heaven, but ſinke thee dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14651:62"/>
into Hell. Giue glory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God that thou liueſt in a

haſt all encouragements, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
invitations to bee
more entirely acquainted
with thy Saviour, and to grow
as intimate with him, as any

be content to conſider that thy

three ſcore yeares ſince the
Saviour of the world hath
vouchſafed after a moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

vs early and late, to call and
cry vnto vs, to take notice
what need we haue of him, to
bethinke our ſelues of our infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
wants, which none but
hee can ſuppl, counſelling vs

Infidels; that there ſhould

Chriſtians as the beſt, ſhould
thinke no otherwiſe of Chriſt,
then ſome doe of S. <hi>Patricke,</hi>

things which grate ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly

wounds, and even make them
bleed a freſh, without ſighs

and a great deale of ſecret

            <p>I haue obſerued vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
much table merriment
which hath beene made by

ſuch vnnaturall mirth be farre

which was in Chriſt Ieſus.
You, who by the bleſſed
change wrought in your

vnto life, conſider with a

to grow acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

know what price to ſet vpon

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14651:65"/>
the ſoule of the meaneſt idiot
is of equall value with yours,
and that it coſt the redeemer
of the World as many ſtripes
and wounds as yours, O then
pitty thy brethren ſo likely to
periſh, for whom Chriſt died,
yea the rather, becauſe they
being ſtuffed with ſottiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts,
will be ready to laugh
at thoſe who ſhall pitty them:
Take all opportunities to doe
them ſome ſpirituall good as
occaſion ſhall be offered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with them and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for them: and let Chriſtian
ſympathies bee the leaſt you
can afford them; you know
what you meane, when you
pray daily that Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
may come; remember,
you pray not in earneſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
you doe your faithfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denuour
to helpe it forward, as
in your owne hearts, ſo in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14651:66"/>
hearts of your brethren,
with which at any time you
converſe. Conſider I beſeech
you, what, a diſmall fogge of
Popery doth yet darken this
Iland, Popery which few
thinkes of, I meane that blind
abſurd implicite faith of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,
as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues.
For there is not a pin
to chooſe betweene him that
beleeues in groſſe, what the
Church of England beleeues,
and him that beleeues as that
ſynagogue of Satan the
Church of Rome beleeues, it
neither knowes any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly,
what either Church
beleeues. Meditate on this,
and what zeale, what conrage,
what indignation you feele in
your breaſts againſt the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
impoſtures of Rome,
let them fly I beſeech you vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions, againſt this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14651:66"/>
Proteſtant Popery. But I ſee
no hope but that the Colliars
faith will haue the greateſt
number of profeſſors, whilſt
accurate Catechizing of all
ſorts of people, which did ſo
much good in the primitiue
Church, is in ours ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected. But I conclude,
beſpeaking you in the words
of <hi>S. Iude, But yee beloued,
building vp your ſelues on your
moſt holy faith, praying in the
holy Ghoſt. Keepe your ſelues
in the loue of God, looking for
the mercies of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt vnto eternall life. And
of ſome haue compaſſion making

ſuppoſitions. 1. That Grace,
that is, all the gracious, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promiſes of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a better life, doe infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
appertaine to all ſuch as
loue Chriſt Ieſus in ſincerity:
that is, to all ſuch as are true,
ſerious, reſolute Chriſtians.
2. That wee our ſelues are all
ſuch men, that we are all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
good enough to ſerue
the turne, though wee are not
ſo forward and exemplary,
though we keepe not ſuch ſtir
with our profeſſion as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe. The firſt ſuppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is out of all queſtion, and can
never bee brought into diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by thoſe which ſubmit
to the Scriptures, it being the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14651:71"/>
ſcope, not only of my Text, but
alſo of the whole Goſpell, ye a
of the Law and the Prophets.
So that (with reverence bee it
ſpoken) it ſhall bee as poſſible
for God, that is the eternall
truth it ſelfe to lye, as for that
ſuppoſition to fayle any man,
who obſerving the conditions
of it, caſts himſelfe vpon it: ſo
that in ſtrict propriety of
ſpeech, it is not of it ſelfe any
prop of preſumption, but only
by accident as it's ſubject to
miſ-application by vs. Well
then, preſumption ſtands more
directly, and leanes more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
vpon the ſecond ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore all our care
muſt bee every man for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
to ſee that wee are not
miſtaken in our account at
home, to bee ſure wee are all
ſuch men as wee deeme our
ſelues to be, that is, ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14651:71"/>
as may vpon good ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
grounds, lay clayme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and plead intereſt in all the
glorious promiſes in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <p>Vpon this I obſerved all
the conditions required on our
part, and by conſequent, the
whole tryall of our aſſurance,
to be compriſed in this ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our loue towards him;
and farther, for the exact triall,
and through examination of
this, I impoſed vpon my ſelfe
the handling of three moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
points which make
vp it ſelfe, and evidence vnto
vs the ſincerity of our loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt. 1. The true imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
ground, or originall of it.
2. The requiſite degree or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
of it. 3. The eſpeciall
fruits and effects of it.</p>
            <p>Concerning the originall
of our loue vnto Chriſt, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14651:72"/>
many inſufficient deceauable
grounds of it, I vndertooke the
diſcovery of one which I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to be moſt dangerous and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall:
to wit, natural inſtincts
of religion in generall reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Chriſtianity by birth &amp;
education. This diſcovery, I
haue already elſewhere at
large, as God enabled me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
In the ſecond place,
I promiſed a declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
true, proper, and ſure ground
of ſincere loue vnto Chriſt: &amp;
this by the aſſiſtance of the
bleſſed ſpirit, you ſhall haue
paid at this time.</p>
            <p>Well then, what is the moſt
immediate and proper ground
of the ſincere loue of a poore
ſinner vnto his Saviour Ieſus
Chriſt? I anſwere out of the
queſtion, when in earneſt hee
finds himſelfe to bee a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſinner, and apprehends
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14651:72"/>
Chriſt Ieſus to be his gracious
Saviour, and one of whom hee
ſtands in infinite need. Or to
to deliuer it more fully, it is a
cleare,<note place="margin">The grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians loue to Chriſt.</note> diſtinct, particular, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
apprehenſion of his owne
infinite wants and miſeries by
reaſon of ſinne, &amp; of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of loue &amp; mercy which
Chriſt hath performed to cure
theſe and ſupply thoſe, &amp; that
as freely &amp; purpoſely for him,
as for any man elfe.</p>
            <p>To cleare and confirme this
excellent point I will, as God
hath directed my meditations.</p>
            <p>1 Firſt proue it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>2 And then demonſtrate
why it is ſo.</p>
            <p>That it is ſo, appeares by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
places of holy Scripture,
out of which I will cull ſome
few, which ſeeme to me moſt
pregnant and pertinent. Firſt,
<hi>I loue the Lord,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14651:73"/>
Pſalm. 116. 1.</hi> marke his
reaſon; <hi>becauſe hee hath heard
my voice and my ſupplications.</hi>
But what kinde of <hi>ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
were theſe? vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
were they made? you
may ſee both, <hi>v. 3, 4. The ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of death compaſſed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and the paines of hell gate
hold vpon me: then called I vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the name of the Lord, O
Lord I beſeech thee deliver my
ſoule.</hi> Theſe were my ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which the <hi>Lord hath
heard, and therefore I loue him,</hi>
yea, <hi>becauſe he hath inclined his
care vnto me</hi> in theſe my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
agonies, <hi>I will call vpon
him as long as I liue.</hi> 2. we haue
an eminent place, <hi>1. Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 19.
We loue him,</hi> marke his reaſon,
<hi>becauſe he firſt loued vs.</hi> True,
ſome may ſay, God hath loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs with innumerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of his loue in our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14651:73"/>
creation and preſervation, and
we doe reciprocally loue him
for them: but what's this to
the loue of Chriſt? To omit as
impertinent to this place, that
in ſome ſort we owe both our
creation &amp; temporall preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnto Gods loue in Chriſt;
ſeeing it is not probable, but
the whole frame of nature
ſhould haue beene diſſolued
preſently vpon the fal, had not
God of his mercy intended a
Redeemer for mankinde to be
revealed in the fulneſſe of
time: but to let this paſſe, S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> in theſe words, <hi>becauſe he
firſt loued vs,</hi> vnderſtands that
loue of loues, that boundleſſe,
incomprehenſible loue of God
wherewith hee hath loued vs
in Chriſt: as it plainly appeares
by comparing 9. &amp; 10. veries.
In this (that is) in this infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more, then in any mercy of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14651:74"/>
creation or preſervation, was
manifeſted the loue of God
towards vs, becauſe that God
ſent his onely begotten ſonne
into the world, that we might
liue through him. <hi>Herein is loue</hi>
(that is) herein infinitly more
then in any thing elſe, <hi>not that
we loued God, but that he loued
vs, and ſent his ſonne to bee the
propitiation for our ſinnes.</hi> To
recollect, and to bring it home
to the point in hand, when as
the fame S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeakes v. 16.
<hi>Wee haue knowne and beleeued
the loue that God hath to vs,
when we find our ſelues to have
been eeven dead men, and that
God ſent his Son, that we might
live through him;</hi> when wee
perceaue our ſelues overloden
with ſinnes, and that Chriſt
was ſent purpoſely to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
for them; O here is
the true originall of our loue
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14651:74"/>
vnto him, now wee loue him,
becauſe hee firſt loued vs. A
third place, &amp; I'le trouble you
with no more, is <hi>Luc. 7. 37.</hi>
where we haue a whole para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this purpoſe, deliuered
by our Saviour himſelfe to
make the Phariſees vnderſtand
what that poore woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meant
by thoſe ſtrange diſtracted &amp;
ſeemingly madde expreſſions
of her loue vnto him in waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his feet with teares, and
wiping them with her haire,
&amp;c. The parable is of a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
&amp; his two debtors; I need
not repeat it, moſt of you
knowe it already, others may
pervſe it if they pleaſe. The
application of it is, that then
ſinners doe indeed fall in loue
with their Saviour when they
perceaue themſelues to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
head and eares, as wee ſay
in debt vnto God, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14651:75"/>
moſt vnable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
one farthing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
feele that God begins to put
his bond in ſuite which they
had forfeited long before they
were borne, when he ſends an
arreſt for them by the terrours
of his Law, their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
&amp; the ſpirit of bondage.
Laſtly, when they feele them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
even haled towards
that priſon from which never
any man came out, which was
once in, and then moſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
comes in Chriſt Ieſus
with his merits, ſatisfies his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the full, reſcues them
out of the ſergeants hands, that
they being deliuered out of
the hands of their enimies may
ſerue him without feare, in
holineſſe and righteouſneſſe
before him all the daies of
their life. Indeed the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the application verſ.

4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7. ſeemes to thwart and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
all that which I haue ſaid.
<hi>Her ſinnes which are many are

words as they are, admit a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſenſe, neither am I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
with how little adoe
they may be reconciled which
haue beene hitherto ſpoken.</p>
            <p>But if I might bee worthy
to deliuer mine own opinion,
with due reſpect vnto the
tranſlaters, I would alter one
word in the tranſlation, which
I ſuſpect ſhould runne thus:<note place="margin">The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</note>
               <hi>Her ſinnes which are many are
forgiuen, therfore ſhee hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
much.</hi> The ſenſe requires
this conſtruction. 1. Becauſe
the whole ſcope of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is to ſhew that hee loues
moſt to whom moſt is forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and not contrarily, that moſt
is forgiuen to him that loues
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14651:76"/>
mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. 2. The antitheſis in the
ſame verſe requires it, the
words, but to whom little is
forgiuen he loueth little, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
this theſis; becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſinnes are forgiuen her ſhee

requires this inter pretation, ſo
the conjunction <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> admits it:
for albeit not in the pure
Greek <hi>idiom,</hi> yet in the Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſticke
vſe of it, anſwers to
all the acceptions of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the ſignification of <hi>ideo,
quapropter, &amp;c.</hi> Neither may
it prejudice this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that our Saviour after all
thoſe expreſſions of loue from
the penitent woman, and his
apologie for himſelfe and her
to the Phariſee, tells her that
her ſinnes are forgiuen her:
this was but that ſentence of
abſolution for her greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14651:76"/>
and aſſurance outwardly
pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, of which no doubt
but ſhe had before ſome grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inklings within, and the
vertue of which ſhe had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
taſted, though not in that
comfortable meaſure, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
manner as ſhe deſired.</p>
            <p>But now I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be miſtaken in the point
as if my opinion were, or I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to proue out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-cited
places, that there is
no true loue vnto Chriſt, but
what is grounded vpon an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
perſwaſion of the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our ſinnes by him. Alas
how many poore ſoules euen
languiſh with a ſpirituall thirſt
after him! how many blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hearts both feele and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
moſt vehement pangs
of importunate loue towards
him: how many broken ſpirits
euen ſpend and exhale them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14651:77"/>
in continuall ſallyes as it
were, and egreſſions of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnto him, who haue indeed
heard, but not as yet taſted
how gratious he is, who haue
not as yet perceaued in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
thoſe inward whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of comfort, <hi>Feare not, I
am thy ſalvation: bee of good
cheere thy ſinnes bee forgiuen
thee:</hi> in a word, who haue not
as yet felt themſelues <hi>ſealed to
the day of redemption by that
holy spirit of promiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reſcue the truth out of
theſe clouds, and to preſent it
in her brightneſſe vnto you,
we muſt firſt obſerue that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
degree of true ſpirituall
loue vnto Chriſt, proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a proportionable act of ſauing
faith: Secondly, that there is a
twofold loue, 1. One of deſire,
which is an earneſt longing
after that, which wee beleeue
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14651:77"/>
would doe vs much good if
wee could attaine vnto it.
2. Another of complacencie,
when hauing attained that we
deſire, we hugge, and embrace
it, and ſolace our ſelues in the
fruition of it. Now as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in the loue of any other
object: ſo likewiſe if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Chriſt, Ieſus, the firſt of
theſe loues is the introduction
to the ſecond; and both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
iſſue from a proportionable
act of faith precedent. That
affectionate longing and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
loue wherewith we pant
and gaſpe after Chriſt having
never yet been refreſhed with
any comfortable teſtimony of
the ſpirit ſince the beginning
of our humiliation, proceeds
from that former act of faith
whereby we aſſent vnto al the
Goſpell promiſes as moſt true
and good in themſelues, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14651:78"/>
infinitely better vnto vs then
any thing in the world could
we bee once aſſured that they
belong vnto vs as well as to
other men. That other loue of
complaconcie, when with the
Pſal: we returne vnto our reſt,
becauſe the Lord hath dealt
bountifully with vs, &amp; ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repoſe our ſelues in the lap
of our Saviour, with content
vnſpeakable and full of glory,
proceeds from that laſt act of
faith, whereby we are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſwaded by thoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
whiſpers of the ſpirit of
adoption, that Chriſt is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
our Saviour as any mans
elſe, and that our debts (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
as they were) are can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
to a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rthing, as well as
the ſmaller ſummes of others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it will not be amiſſe
to obſerue two things of this
loue of complacency ariſing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14651:78"/>
from a perſwaſion of Chriſts
loue vnto vs in particular.
1. It's ſubject to all variations
or changes, ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of that perſwaſion. For as
often as in any violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſenſible diſertion our
perſwaſion ſeemes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
this loue of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is either for a time quite
ſtupified, or elſe it falls back as
it were into that thirſty auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
loue of deſire. 2. This loue
of complacencie admits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
proportionably to the
degrees of that perſwaſion. If
that be cleare and ſtrong, this
loue is more cheerefull &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant:
if that be weake and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
this loue is not ſo ſpright
full,<note place="margin">Faith may be ſincere though mixed with Anxiety.</note> but ſomewhat lumpiſh
being cold with many feares,
and jealouſies. Whence this
loue of complacency may not
vnfitly be ſubdivided. 1. Into
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14651:79"/>
Ordinary loue which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a weaker degree
of that laſt act of faith, and
though ſincere, yet being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
is mixed with anxiety
in the ſame proportion as that
is with doubting. And 2. into
Heroicall loue which ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from a more eminent and
tranſcendent pitch of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
concerning our owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
in particular: this
is that perfect loue, which S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> ſaies, caſteth out all feare
(to wit) of diſtruſte, bringing
vs into a more intimate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with God. I call the
firſt Ordinary, becauſe moſt
Chriſtians though effectually
called doe ordinarily feele but
ſuch a timorous loue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
The ſecond which I
call Heroicall in that ſenſe in
which eminent vertues haue
their Epithite, is conſtantly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14651:79"/>
in ſuch as either beſide the
evidence of the word and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
haue had ſome ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
to put them out of all
doubt concerning their eſtate
to Godward, on ſuch as by a
conſtant cloſe walking with
God,<note place="margin">Conſtancy in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe frequent taſts of Chriſts loue, and the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſpirit aſſure vs of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> haue beene long exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in a Chriſtian courſe,
haue often entertained Chriſt
Ieſus at ſupper in their hearts,
and habituated themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a more familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
with that holy ſpirit
which brings all the good
news from heauen to thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
ſoules which carefully
wait for it.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I according to
the skill that is giuen mee,
proued the originall of the
ſyncere loue of a ſinner vnto
Chriſt Ieſus bleſſed for ever,
to be a ſerious tender appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of his own extreame
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14651:80"/>
need of Chriſt, and of Chriſts
ſuperabundant loue vnto him:
I haue likewiſe explained this
truth, and vindicated it from
ſuch exceptions as croſſed my
way. I come now to diſcouer
the demonſtratiue reaſon of
this truth, and after I haue
ſhewed that it is ſo, to ſhew
you now why it muſt be ſo.</p>
            <p>Wee are all borne into the

and while wee continue in
that naturall ſtupid condition,
wherein we were borne, <hi>wee

               <note place="margin">There is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our nature ſo much as the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Saviour or the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of one.</note> yea, <hi>enemies in our

meere animall, naturall

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14651:81"/>
of redemption which he
hath compaſſed for them. Had
the prodigall ſonnes ſtocke
held out, and hee lyen ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floate
in the full-tide of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               </gap>e country,
and quite forgot that hee ever
had a father: yea when the
tide was gone and had left
him vpon the ſands: when the
revells were ended, his brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quite worne out into beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
and himſelfe preferred
to be an attendant of a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of hogs, if he could but haue
got his belly full of huskes, he
would hardly haue thought of
returning home: but when
theſe were denyed him, and
hee could ſee nothing but
death before him, O now hee
comes to himſelfe, and begins
to thinke of a father hee had,
and reſolues to goe vnto him,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14651:82"/>
though he might well ſuſpect
his entertainment. Well,
whatſoever that may proue,
he is ſure hee goes to a father,
and therefore on he goes, and
when hee, was yet a farre off,
full of aboding feares, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate

father about his necke before
he was a ware of him, acting
an over-joyned man, hee hangs
about him and kiſſes him,
trims him vp with a robe and
a ring, conducts him home in
a kinde of triumph, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him with the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a feaſt and muſicke! Here
was a change for the prodigall
enough to haue turned his
braines as we ſay, but ſure it
could not but turne his heart.
Had that beene of marble or
adamant, this could not but
melt it into loue. O what a
ſwelling, a thronging, a wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14651:82"/>
did hee now feele in his
bowels of tendreſt paſsions,
impatient for want of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
O how did he now lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him with teares of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and teares of joy, being
much pulled, whether it
would beſt become to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

in briefe how mad is hee
with himſelfe that hee had

            <p>I haue inſiſted the longer

them both in our

<hi>God who is rich in mercy for his

hath let vs runne our ſelues

he giues Satan leaue
to inſult over vs, whatſoever

are driven out of all, and ſo
farre, that wee ſee plainely,
there is but one way with vs,
even to periſh everlaſtingly,
vnleſſe we can get to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
vnto him. Now wee
begin to come to our ſelues,
and perceiuing our onely

we can get the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

finding the Scriptures ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory,
that there is <hi>no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Father, but by the
Sonne, that hee that hath the
Sonne hath life, but he that hath

the wrath of God abideth on
him. Ioh. 3. 30.</hi> O now wee
begin to ſee it was to ſome
purpoſe, that wee haue heard
Preacher so talke ſo much of
Chriſt; now wee beginne to
hearken better after him, to
value and admire him; now
wee wonder how wee could
endure to bee without him ſo
long, that we could thinke ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14651:84"/>
ſlightly of him heretofore,
now thoſe holy fits of loue
grow vpon vs apace, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſuddaine, with the <hi>Spouſe</hi>
in the <hi>Canticles, wee are ſicke
of loue.</hi> Now are wee entred
into the loue of deſire, and
while our poore ſoules are
ſweating in theſe reſtleſſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
wee heare at length
Chriſt Ieſus in a milde ſtill
voice, inviting all ſuch as are
weary &amp; heavy laden to come
vnto him, that hee may giue
them reſt: vpon this wee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
our ſelues towards him,
with our burden vpon our
ſhoulder, and when wee are
got within kenne of him, hee
ſeemes ſometimes to goe
backward from vs, to make
vs more eager after him, and
thus oft-times he lets vs ſtand
trembling and ſhaking, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and groaning vnder our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14651:85"/>
burdens, till wee are even
ſinking and ſwovvning vnder
them, and then hee conveyes
them away, cleares vp the
heavens over vs, ſpeakes like
a husband vnto our ſoules by
his Spirit, he preſents vs vnto
his Father, who now ſmiles
vpon vs with a reconciled
countenance, and then vnto
his Angels who amongſt all
their <hi>Halleluiahs,</hi> receiue
ſome addition vnto their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
mirth by our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Now no man need tell
vs what Chriſt hath done for
vs, we feele reall experiments
of all in our owne hearts,<note place="margin">There are Reall taſts of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by Chriſt in the hearts of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</note> now
wee haue ſeene, and felt, and
taſted how infinitely he hath
loued vs, we are ready to make
our boaſt of it, and with the
<hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> to invite all ſuch as
feare God purpoſely that wee
may declare vnto them what
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14651:85"/>
hee hath done for our ſoules.
Now we are in that loue of
complacency, now wee cling
vnto him, and would faine
come out of our ſelues, to
creepe vnto him, affecting not
only a vnion, but vnity with
him, now wee beſtirre our
ſelues in all the holy comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of heavenly loue, never
thinking wee haue done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
frequently bathing our
ſelues in thoſe delicious inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies
of our ſpirituall marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
which how much they
paſſe all vnderſtanding, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to their experiences; to
whom theſe things are no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes.</p>
            <p>You ſee the excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
by which our ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
rebellious hearts are
wrought over vnto the ſincere
loue of Ieſus Chriſt: I ſuppoſe
it now expedient to cleare
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14651:86"/>
this diſcourſe of the originall
of vnfained loue, from ſome
doubts and ſcruples which
may ariſe from it.</p>
            <p>1 Whether none can loue
Chriſt in ſincerity, but thoſe
that are brought vnto it by
this method? I anſwere not
one ordinarily, if his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
bee wrought by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Word.<note place="margin">The ſenſe of our owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery makes vs in loue with Chriſt as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note> The reaſon
is plaine out of what hath bin
deliuered. Wee are to loue
Chriſt as a Saviour: how can
we be brought to thoſe, vntill
we feele our ſelues loſt, and
vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what need we haue
of a Saviour? Wee are to loue
him as a Mediatour: what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is there for this, vnleſſe we
firſt plainely perceiue God
to be our enimy? Laſtly, wee
are to loue him as our Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:
what ſenſe is there for that
if wee feele not our ſelues in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14651:86"/>
ſome dangers, if wee feele no
aches or gripings, no ſmart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
our ſoules, if we finde no
good that Chriſt hath done vs,
or can doe vs? Himſelfe tells
vs, <hi>the whole haue no need of
the Phyſitian; onely the ſicke,</hi>
ſuch as feele and acknowledge
themſelues to be ſicke, will
make vſe of him. But here it's
requiſite to obſerue, that the
ſeverall paſſages of this great
alteration wrought in our aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ections,
are more or leſſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
according to the ſeverall
conditions of the perſons. We
are all prodigalls, yet ſome
more, ſome leſſe: we are all
gone into a farre countrey, yet
ſome roue a great deale far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then others: For illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſome haue had a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
education then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and beene trained vp in
a more innocent civility, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14651:87"/>
the time of their viſitation,
which oft-times overtakes
them very early, and takes
them in before they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the villaines of
the world, or vices of the
times: ſuch, though common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they take weeping croſſe in
their way too, as they come
home vnto Chriſt, yet they
paſſe not through ſo many
pikes, ſo many panges, and
terrors but with leſſe ſtirre &amp;
diffficulty arriue ſafely at his
boſome, and get within his
embraces. On the other ſide,
ſome are ſtarke prodigalls,
meere Publicans ſuch as haue
taken their full ſwinge in the
wildeſt exorbitancies, ſuch as
haue ſerved an apprentiſhip,
perhaps two or three to the
World, the Fleſh, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
ſuch as theſe, when it
pleaſeth God to put his hooke
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14651:87"/>
in their noſtrils, to turne them
round, and make them looke
towards heauen, are brought
to the loue of Chriſt, even
ſteppe by ſteppe in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
which I haue formerly
deſcribed. The other are
brought vnto the loue of
Chriſt, but theſe being once
brought vnto it, loue him
more vehemently, for it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>he loues moſt to whom
moſt is forgiuen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Doubt,<note place="margin">Whether our loue to Chriſt would not be more exact if we did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the brightneſſe of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> Whether our
loue vnto Chriſt would not
be more pure and acceptable
vnto him, if it aroſe from an
exact, ſteddy contemplation
of thoſe infinitely amiable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and tranſcendent
beauties, which are reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in his perſon; he <hi>being the
brightneſſe of glory, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
image of his Father,</hi> Heb.
1. 3. or as it is ver. 7. 26. <hi>The
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14651:88"/>
brightneſſe of the everlaſting
light, the vnſpotted mirror of
the power of God, and the
image of his goodneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwere by propoſing
three briefe conſiderations:<note place="margin">Chriſt only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Saviour moues vs to loue him.</note>
1. That is the trueſt loue of
Chriſt, which beats vs out of
our naturall enmity againſt
him, and brings vs home with
longing affections vnto him.
Now it's moſt true, that the
perſon of Chriſt, abſolutely
conſidered without the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Saviour vnto vs, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with moſt attractiue
excellencies, and raviſhing
beauties: but if a glimpſe of
that orient luſtre ſhould flaſh
in the face of an vnregenerate
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or impenitent ſinner, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the ſanctifying ſpirit
ſhould at the ſame inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
his heart, it might driue
him out of his wits but not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14651:88"/>
out of his ſinnes, it might ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
him into a deſperate
tranſe, but not advance him to
a kindly extaſie.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe if one ſhould goe
about to winne an enimy of
grace vnto the loue of Chriſt,
by the moſt accurate Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall
diſcourſes of thoſe
infinitely ſuperlatiue beauties
in the Deity abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
either they would bee
phantaſticke riddles vnto
him, or at leaſtwiſe prevaile
no more with him to that
purpoſe, then it would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to loue one deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whom he mortally hated,
to tell him that hee was a
comely Gentleman. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
theſe myſticall contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations
were effectuall this
way, yet he that is yet vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the power of
converting grace, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14651:89"/>
vndiſpoſed to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
about them. An acute,
but vnſanctified ſchoole man
may overſtraine his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
with a weariſome
gaze vpon thoſe inviſible
beauties,<note place="margin">Subtlety without the grace of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will not kindle the loue of Chriſt in our hearts.</note> and dazle it into a
more diſtempered ignorance,
but not in to ſuch a raviſhment
of loue, as may warme and
elevate his affections where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the penitent ſoule, which
by the grace of converſion,
hath felt thoſe ſacred coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
affections already kindled
in it ſelfe, may advantage her
ſelfe excellently by ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
by her intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
all aſpirings and affaires, as it
were to ſee him that is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and by refreſhing her
ſelfe with ſweeteſt meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thoſe inconceivable
glories which are aboue,
where Chriſt ſits at the right
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14651:89"/>
hand of God. So that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
though they
cannot ordinarily begin ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
loue vnto Chriſt in our
hearts, yet they may keepe it
vp, blowe it into a purer
flame, and advance it to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Angelicall ſublimity.
3. That loue of Chriſt is moſt
ſincere and acceptable vnto
him, which giues him moſt
glory of that which he deſires
moſt to be glorified in: that is,
of his goodneſſe,<note place="margin">Our loue to Chriſt muſt bee practicall.</note> his attributes,
and workes of mercy in our
Salvation. Hee requires not an
ayrie, but a fierie loue. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
not ſo much that ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue
loue, which conſiſts in a
ſimple amaze of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or bare admiration
of thoſe vndiſcovered perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his nature, which
haue not as yet done vs any
good, though one day the ſight
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14651:90"/>
of them ſhall be a part of our
bleſſedneſſe. Chriſt requires
that loue of vs, whereby wee
confeſſe our ſelues beholding
vnto him, that loue which laies
vs flat before him, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we acknowledge we owe
our ſelues vnto him. I may
much admire and applaud a
man of excellent parts, for his
rare endowments, and yet
thinke my ſelfe no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
vnto him, then hee is
to me, yea I may beare grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
againſt him in my mind,
and be farre from any affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
loue towards him: Even
ſo with ſome Schoolemen,
and writers of myſticall theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
I may buſy my braine,
and ſet my minde a ſtaring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that abſolute <hi>Ideaa</hi> of vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
beauty in the Deity, and
yet as long as I continue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of what Chriſt hath
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14651:90"/>
done for my redemption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a frozen and a flinty
heart.</p>
            <p>If we loue Chriſt only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee hath loued vs, it
ſeemes that in our loue vnto
him, we haue a chiefe eye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our ſelues, and that we loue
our ſelues more then him,
which ordinarily cannot bee
pleaſing vnto him, or any way
ſtand with ſincerity.<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our loue to Ch. is our own ſalvation, the end his glory.</note> For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
wee muſt diſtinguiſh
betweene the impulſiue and
the finall cauſe of our loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, or in termes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
plainer, betweene the
firſt inward occaſion of it, and
the maine ſcope of it. My care
of my owne ſoule originally
driues me to harken after a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and when I haue found
him, and finde withall, that
he hath bought me out of my
ſelfe, <hi>that I am not my owne,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:14651:91"/>
as it is, 1. Cor. 6. 19. hence
forth the maine ſcope &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
aime of my loue vnto
him is to doe that for which
chiefely I was created and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
to let goe all intereſt
<hi>the loue of Chriſt conſtraineth
vs,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul:</hi> why ſo? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
wee thus iudge, that if
one died for all, then were all
dead:</hi> here is that originall of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14651:91"/>
our loue implied which I haue
ſo largely inſiſted vpon, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>and he died for all, that
they which henceforth liue,
ſhould not liue vnto themſelues,
but vnto him that died for
them, and roſe againe.</hi> This is
the end of Chriſts loue vnto
vs, and muſt bee the buſineſſe
and maine driſt of our loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. So that our loue vnto
Chriſt, ariſing from a tender
apprehenſion of his loue vnto
vs, is not mercenary, but
makes moſt for his honour,
ſeeing that if he had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
vs, we ſhould in ſome
ſort haue ſtood vpon equall
tearmes with him. Laſtly, it is
his good pleaſure, that wee
ſhould loue that moſt which
is beſt for vs, that in which
moſt conſiſts our perfection, if
therefore wee loue him as our
perfection, conceauing our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14651:92"/>
ſelues to bee worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without him if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
our ſelues, as it were,
into him, &amp; according to that
ſweet phraſe of the Apoſtle,
<hi>hide our liues with him in God:</hi>
Though all this while impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
we loue our ſelues, yet
wee need not doubt of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
this is the very loue
which hee requires. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paules</hi>
loue vnto him was ſuch as
this. <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I liue, yet not I,
but Chriſt in me, and the life
which I now liue in the fleſh, I
liue by the faith of the Sonne of
God:</hi> marke the reaſon, &amp; firſt
the inducement to all this,
<hi>who hath loued mee, and giuen
himſelfe for mee.</hi> It's time by

raiſe a tumult in a well ſetled

Ile ſay, if all of them ſound as
riddles and vncouth myſteries
vnto thee, if thou never knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
any thing like to what was
propoſed by thy ſelfe, as I
feare many haue not. If thou
knoweſt not what it meanes
to <hi>come heavy laden, poore in

Chriſt:</hi> why then I wonder
thou ſhouldſt bee ſo ſottiſh as
to conceaue, or impudent as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14651:95"/>
to affirme, that thou loueſt
Chriſt, if thou wouldſt haue vs
vnderſtand thee, that thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
him in ſincerity. I doe
ſuppoſe that thou loueſt him
vpon cuſtome, as thou doſt the
faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy country in which
thou haſt beene borne &amp; bred,
but ſo does the greteſt part of
the world defie him, vpon as
good a ground as that ſo does
a Turke loue <hi>Mahomet,</hi> one of
the bafeſt miſereants that ever
was, vpon as ſubſtantiall a
ground as that. But we ſpeake
of that tranſcendent loue of
him, which cannot poſſibly be
due vnto any one elſe, and
which would be moſt due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, though all the lawes &amp;
cuſtomes in the world ſhould
vniverſally conſpire to crye it
downe, doſt thou profeſſe ſuch
a loue vnto him, and knoweſt
not wherefore? nor vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14651:95"/>
occaſion thou wert moued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

what it is to loue Chriſt, and
how himſelfe was brought vn
to it, to conſider the confident
ſtupidity of multitudes in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place who will not be put
out of their dreame, that they
meane as louingly to Chriſt as
any man, when as indeed they
are not as yet come ſo far as to
perceaue any proper reaſon
why they ſhould loue him, or
what reaſon he hath to expect
any loue from them. I knowe
they will ſay, they loue him
becauſe he died for them, and
they hope to be ſaued by him:
Alas theſe are words of courſe

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14651:96"/>
it is not the ſaying of this, or
beleeuing it confuſedly like
ſome old ſtory or tradition wil

which may eaſily bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
by trying them by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14651:96"/>
this originall. To inſtance in
ſome particulars: There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Ruffian in this kingdome,
who if he ſhould heare a <hi>Jew</hi>
blaſpheaming Chriſt, his blood
would quickly bee vp; hee
would long to bee doing with
him, and bee hardly kept from
hacking him in peeces. O
what a friend vnto Chriſt will
ſuch a man ſuppoſe himſelfe
to be, he will conceipt he hath
behaued himſelfe like a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler,
&amp; done him knights ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and a hundred to one, but
in this humour, he will call his
companions <hi>to come and ſee the
zeale which he hath for Chriſt
Jeſus.</hi> But if there were any
ſuch ſwaggering <hi>Zelot</hi> in this
aſſembly, I would aske him
theſe queſtions: Doſt thou not
think a hot ſpirited Turk would
haue fallen as foule vpon the
<hi>Iew,</hi> if hee had taken him vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14651:97"/>
his <hi>Mahomet?</hi> Wouldſt
thou: not vndergoe as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a quarrell to winne the
fauour, or pleaſe the humour
of thy miſtreſſe? Would'ſt
thou not thy ſelfe, or at leaſt
doſt thou not know ſome who
will quarrell as ſternely about
a pipe of Tobacco, or the pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of a health? Laſtly, haſt
thou not ſuffered thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
to blaſpheame Chriſt in
their oathes, perhaps a whole
day together, and thy zeale all
the while hath beene very
well contented with it? You
ſee by theſe queſtions from
what variety of carnall vnſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
motiues this ſeeming
plauſible zeale may ariſe: and
therefore in all ſuch caſes, it
much concernes vs, to haue an
eye to the true originall of all
duties of loue, to conſider, not
ſo much what wee doe, as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14651:97"/>
what makes vs to doe it,<note place="margin">Wee muſt not ſomuch conſider the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as the cauſe of it.</note> and in
a word, to judge of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not by the heat, but by the
fewell. For a ſecond inſtance:
Many in reading the hiſtory of
our Saviours life, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his ſweet, debonnaire and
vnoffenſiue carriage, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
the contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinners,
the inſolencie of proud and
churliſh miſcreants which he
endured with an vnimitable
patience, will find their hearts
euer and anon riſing in indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt the Scribes and
Phariſees, and euen tenderly
ſympathizing with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Theſe men may preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagine themſelues to bee
deepely in loue with Chriſt,
but they may bee miſerably
miſtaken. Let them conſult
with their owne experience,
and obſerue, whether they are
not moued to as ſenſible paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14651:98"/>
by the reading of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtory, though prophane, if
it be any way proportionable
vnto the Evangelicall ſtory for
occurrences: twenty to one
but they will finde it ſo: There
is not any good ſtory, either ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
or prophane, but for the
moſt part it drawes the mind
of the reader, for the time at
leaſt, in to ſome factio. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it's evident, that ſuch ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the affections, may
proceed from a bare hiſtoricall
faith, joyned with that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ingenuity of nature,<note place="margin">Many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of our loue to Chriſt may bee the fruits of a bare Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall faith ioined with common ingenuity.</note> which

vertues of Worthies, long
ſince deceaſed, and to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate
their vndeſerved diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
Yea, which is worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
they may proceed
from this common ingenuity,
by the meere working of the
fancie, without any hiſtoricall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14651:98"/>
beleefe at all. Wee finde it by
experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in reading amorous
ſtories, or hiſtories of ſtrange
adventures, which though we
knowe and beleeue to be fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet oft times, it handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contriued; they raiſe more
ſerious tumults of paſſions in
our mindes, then the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſtories wee can meet with.
Now the reaſon of it (if my
owne fancy fayle me not) is,
becauſe the imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
hath the ſame command over
the paſſions, which the Poets
haue giuen <hi>Aeolus</hi> ouer the
windes, is it ſelfe ſtirr'd vp to
ſympathize with all ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
as are exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhaped &amp; limb'd according
to it's owne Ideas &amp; inward
contrivances: and in this caſe,
the imagination poring vpon
the repreſentation it ſelfe, ſo
that ſuite well with it's owne
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14651:99"/>
images within, it regards not
not much, whether it be of an
acted truth, or of a poſſibility,
forgetting, as it were, for the
preſent, to diſtinguiſh what
might haue beene from what
hath beene. This obſervation
directs me to a third Inſtance,
with which I will conclude:
ſome perhaps may weepe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
at a Paſſion-Sermon, &amp;
preſently imagine their teares
to be diſtillations of tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
vnto Chriſt; They
may be ſo, but they may very
eaſily not be ſo. Who knowes
not, that the charmes of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
about any ſad argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
may eaſily ſteale good ſtore of
teares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an auditory of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or of ſoft natur'd men?
Solemne Muſicke, a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
wil doe as much: any liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repreſentation of a Tragical
accident, whether reall or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14651:99"/>
will doe as much: amongſt
thoſe that can bee ſo
il buſied, as to ſit three or foure
houres at a Tragedy, ſome can
be ſo wiſely, good natur'd too,
as to weepe heartely at it. You
ſee into what variety of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
offices of loue vnto
Chriſt may put vs, while wee
conſider them looſe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and examine them not
by that which ought to be the
fundamentall inducement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in our hearts, you ſee
how expedient it is to judge
of theſe complementall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of loue vnto our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

that his Diſciples ſhould come

whatſoeuer comforts
or favours wee could expect

glorify his juſtice by turning
them into curſes: But now for
his everlaſting mercies, thoſe

vſeth not to part with them ſo
eaſily: hee lets not them goe
out of his hands: by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
hee proclaimes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies
the infinite worth and
value of them: if any man bee
ſo taken with the luſtre of
them that for joy <hi>Mat. 13. 44.
he goes and ſels all that he hath

               <note place="margin">God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently giues an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſalvation to all who loue Chriſt ſincerely.</note> and thinkes hee

preſently ſeales vnto him an
everlaſting aſſurance of them

giues poſſeſſion of them at the

with the glory which

I anſwere there can be indeed
no meritorious worthineſſe
in all this, but there is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
worthineſſe: for by

Thus much I intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but what I did but touch
vpon, and in reference to God
the father, I will now ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
with ſpeciall references
vnto God the ſonne. It is all

a pearle at all, and to
eſteeme it leſſe worth then a

though wee preferre Chriſt
before never ſo many profits
and pleaſures, yet if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
behind one darling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
which wee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to keepe whatſoever
may become of his glory or
our intereſt in him: wee doe
in the iſſue eſteeme him not
at all, becauſe wee ſtill wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14651:113"/>
value him below that
which is infinitely worſe then
dung in compariſon of him.
When a ſaleable commodity
is offered vpon reaſonable
price, we vſe to ſay that if it
be not worth that, it's worth
iuſt nothing: Now our part in
Chriſt is ſo infinitely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
any thing that wee can
poſſibly giue for it, that by
farre better reaſon wee may
ſay, that he that thinkes it not

he hath even to his laſt breath,
indeed thinkes it worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all. Let a woman loue
her husband better then a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of men, yet if ſhee loue
but any one man in the world
better then her husband, hee
will giue her but little
thankes for louing him aboue

            <p>But to amplify this point
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14651:114"/>
more diſtinctly, let vs briefly
conſider that tranſcendent
pitch of loue we owe firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the benefits of Chriſt; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
vnto his perſon; All
thoſe ineſtimable benefits
which wee make account of
by Chriſt may bee reduced to
2. heads 1. a ranſome 2. an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
The ranſome is
from horrours and thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are infinite for
ſmart, variety and duration,
which wee haue all deſerved
a thouſand times over,<note place="margin">Had the bleſſings procured by Chriſt beene infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely leſſe then they are, they had bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable.</note> and
therefore the caſe being thus
with vs, though wee looked
for nothing but ſuch a ranſome
by our Saviour, though he had
procured vs only this that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this life wee ſhould ſpend
eternity in a <hi>Limbus</hi> vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with any paine or
pleaſure, yea though hee had
procured vs only the morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14651:114"/>
of our ſoules, that they
might periſh with our bodies;
I ſay this alone had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all proportion, better for
vs then the whole world: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what would a thouſand
worlds doe vs good if after a
while wee muſt bee packed
out of them all into that place
where we ſhall everlaſtingly
curſe the day that ever wee
were borne or made reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creatures. But now that
beſides all this, wee make firſt
account for an inheritance by
him, an <hi>inheritance immortall,
vndefiled, reſerved in heaven
for vs,</hi> ſeeing wee expected to
be <hi>made heires with Chriſt in
that glory which hee had with
his father before the beginning
of the world,</hi> of that glory, the
leaſt ſparke of which if viſible
to bodily eyes would ſhame
all the beauty, pompe and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14651:115"/>
bravery of the world, and
whatſoever the Magnifico's of
the earth are proud of, it is a
ſtupidity worſe then any mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to conceiue, we eſteeme
ſufficiently of ſuch glorious
hopes, if vpon deliberate
choice we make much but of
any one indearement of this
life which may any way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our aſſurance of them. 2.
for our loue vnto the perſon of
Chriſt, equity requires that we
ſhould loue him with a loue
yet more overtopping then
either our ranſome or inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and therefore it will be
yet a more intollerable extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14651:117"/>
wee ſhould haue to loue any
thing elſe: and therefore it is
not to be accounted loue vnto
him, if wee can afford as much
and more to ſomething elſe:
2. Becauſe if we loue but one
thing better then we doe him,
that one thing may force vs
to deſpight, forſake, and betray
him as accurſedly as if we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
a hundred things before

preferres but one thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his communion with
Chriſt will quickly be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his owne heart to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
more. He therefore that
would certainely knowe how
much hee loues his bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that would judge exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the meaſure of his loue
vnto him, muſt not doe it by
feeling the pulſe as it were, or
calculating the degrees of his
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him; but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14651:117"/>
his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Chriſt
with his affections vnto other
matters, and conſidering how
farre that hath got the ſtart of
theſe, and what overplus it
hath beyond them all in the
compariſon; for ſo much and
no more doth hee indeed loue
Chriſt. For it deſerues obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
that we cannot judge
of an affection by its ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
what it does alone by
it ſelfe, but onely when it is
brought within the liſts, when
it's put to wreſtle for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
with other affections in
the ſame heart. Where it
comes to paſſe that of two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the ſame kinde, the
weaker may proue the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if ſeated in a heart, where
as weake as it is, it hath the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
over all the other
affections proportionally wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
then it ſelfe; and the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14651:118"/>
may proue the weaker if it
dwell in ſuch a heart, wherein
it is overmatched with ſome
one at leaſt ſtronger then it
ſelfe. Did I loue Chriſt Ieſus
with as eminent degree of
loue as ever did the moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Martyr, yet were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that I ſhould loue any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearement
of this life never
ſo little beyond that pitch, my
loue would be as good as none
at all; yea the ſame meaſure of
loue which made him a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Martyr, would not keepe
me from being an accurſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate,
ſeeing that if I were
put to it, as he was, that I muſt
either renounce my Saviour
or my other contentment, this
would hold me ſo faſt, that it
would make mee moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
let him goe: and this
would bee not becauſe my
loue vnto Chriſt was in it ſelfe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14651:118"/>
weaker then the Martyrs: I
ſuppoſed the contrary: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my affection vnto ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe was ſtronger then
any affection in the Martyr, &amp;
too ſtrong to be over-maſtred
by my loue vnto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But here ſome may put in a
fooliſh queſtion; though a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Chriſt muſt not loue
any thing better then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
yet may he not loue ſome
things as well? I anſwere the
conceipt is impoſſible. Firſt,
Becauſe it is an impoſſibility,
that for any continuance our
affections ſhould bee ſetled in
an equall ſize vpon two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which commonly fall
croſſe one to the other &amp; may
ever and anon bee brought in
oppoſition one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now whatſoever wee
loue beſides Chriſt vnleſſe it
be in ſubordination vnto him,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14651:119"/>
either actually, when we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
thinke of it &amp; intend
it, or habitually, in the generall

wee loue it in oppoſition to
him either explicite &amp; direct,
or implicite and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
as the Schooles ſpeake
(that is) ſuch neglect of him
as he wil interpret oppoſition.
All this we learne from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
who hath pronounced it
impoſſible that one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould

2. Morally, in reſpect of their

invited and entreated to drink
on free coſt of the water of
life, and yet muſt we venture
our liues for it, and breake
through a whole hoſt of Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines
for it, as the Worthies
of David did for the waters of
Bethel. <hi>2. Sam. 23.</hi> Are wee
made beleeue that Chriſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
vs freely, and yet muſt we
buy him, and buy him with all
that wee haue? I anſwere,
1. That proclamation in the
Prophet, and invitation in the
Apocalyps are not to be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
as if God required
nothing on their parts who
ſhall partake of his promiſes
in Chriſt, but only to ſtep forth
and challenge them. The ſenſe
and ſcope of thoſe places is
this, whereas worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
though never ſo
vaine and tranſitory cannot be
gotten without price, ſo that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14651:121"/>
he that is pennileſſe muſt bee
content to goe without them,
thoſe heavenly and everlaſting
commodities are attaineable
to all ſorts of men, as well to
beggars as to Princes, poverty
can hinder no man from buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, hee that hath not a
penny may come and drinke
as freely of the waters of life
as he that hath coffers full. As
God expects from vs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we haue, ſo that which
we haue for him ſhall ſerue
the turne though it bee never
ſo little, though wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the ſhirt on our
backes; but our naked, deſeaſed
carkaſſes, yet if we are willing
to giue them for Chriſt, they
ſhall bee ſufficient pay. God
turnes away no chapman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee cannot giue enough,
but only becauſe hee will not
giue what he can. For if there
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14651:121"/>
be firſt a willing minde, God
accepts <hi>according to that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hath and not according to that
a man hath not,</hi> as it is ſpoken
in another caſe. <hi>2. Cor. 8. 12.

the pearle, to buy Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that wee haue, ſuch like
ſpeeches are in no wiſe to bee
vnderſtood properly but Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically;
for in propriety of
ſpeech, when wee forſake all
to winne Chriſt, wee doe not
lay down any price vnto God
for him, who hath giuen him
for vs all and offered him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

we ridde our ſelues of ſuch
things as may hinder vs from
receauing him being freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
If one ſhould offer mee
handfulls of Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I for the

of clay, I ſhould quickly be rid
of the clay that I may finger
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14651:122"/>
the gold, yet I doe not pay him
for his gold with my clay, but
only prepare my ſelfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
it. In like manner there
being an infinitely greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
betweene Chriſt
and the moſt pretious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
that wee can forgoe
for him; then there is between
gold and clay when wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
our ſelues of any
thing that wee may make
roome for Chriſt, wee doe not
purchaſe him, but prepare to
entertaine him comming of
his owne accord vnto vs.</p>

then, vpon the point, none can

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14651:122"/>
that none are ſaued but Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;

ſhould require it. If
this aſſertion make any mans
eares to tingle, I knowe not
why the hearing of my Text
ſhould not be as offenſiue vnto
him, or the reading of divers
other ſpeeches of our Sauiour,
requiring a reſolued diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
and contempt of life
in any man whoſoeuer hee be
that dares to ſet his hand to
his plough, or ſeriouſly ſet his
face towards heauen.</p>
            <p>There is a Popiſh ſcribler
not worth the naming in a
pulpit, who would perſwade
vs that theſe ſpeeches of our
Saviour are not precepts of
neceſſity vnto all that ſhall be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14651:123"/>
ſaued by him, but onley coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells
of perfection to ſuch as
will not bee contented to bee
doore-keepers in heauen, but
ayme at ſome higher place.
For my part I cannot expreſſe
how injurious I conceaue this
gloſſe, as well to our Saviours
perſon, as to his doctrine. But
if any man preſent to ſet his
owne heart at quiet, bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to bee of this fellowes
mind, I leaue him three things
to pauſe vpon. 1. Our Saviour
did not ſpeake thus much only
to ſome ſelect, forward men,
only to his ſpeciall Diſciples,
but as it is in the verſe prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<hi>there went great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
after him, and he turned
and ſaid vnto them, If any man,
&amp;c.</hi> But perhaps though hee
addreſſe his diſcourſe to them
altogether, yet hee intended it
not to each of them ſingle. No,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14651:123"/>
what then meane the firſt
words of my Text, <hi>If any man
&amp;c.</hi> what meanes the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his diſcourſe, verſe, 33.
<hi>So likewiſe whoſoever he be of
you that forſaketh not all that
he hath he cannot be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
2. The conſiderations
which ſhew the equity of
thoſe conditions required by
our Saviour, the reaſons indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him to require ſo great a
meaſure of loue, as you haue
heard before, equally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concern
every man, and therefore there
is no reaſon why wee ſhould
imagine that our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
theſe hard tearmes only
to ſome few &amp; not to all that
would haue any intereſt in
him. 3. Contempt of life in
compariſon of a communion
with Chriſt is moſt vniverſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
requiſite in all ſorts of men.
1. Becauſe the Church never
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14651:124"/>
enioyes ſuch a calme, but a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
ſtorme may vnexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
daſh it away, and therefore
there is no man though borne
in the moſt peaceable time of
the Goſpell, but ere the glaſſe
of his life bee runne out, hee
may be over taken with a fiery
triall. 2. Yea there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour
of the Goſpell, though
hee liue and dye during the
publike tranquillity of it, yet
he may privately bee brought
to that plunge, that he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hazard his life, or elſe in
ſome fearefull, horrible maner
againſt his conſcience diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Chriſt Ieſus. 3. Many
may take away our liues
which cannot take away our
other contentments, as Popiſh
Aſſaſcinats haue depriued
Kings of their liues when they
could not of their kingdomes.
It is certaine that whoſoever
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14651:124"/>
cares not for his owne life is
maſter of another mans, &amp; by
conſequent of any mans reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that loues his life better
then hee doth it. How eaſie
were it for a Ruffian that had
no religion of his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pull
ſuch a one into a corner and
with a naked blade to make
him forſweare his religion, as
often as he pleaſed, yea if the
tricke were in vſe, ſuch a one
might be robbed of his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon the high way ſeeing
any man that were ſo diſpoſed
with a Piſtol at his breſt might
make him deliuer vp his faith
with as much haſt as his purſe.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It may bee replied if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
follower muſt loue him
more then his owne life, then
it ſeemes that the weakeſt
Chriſtian, if indeed a Chriſtian
muſt loue him as much as the
moſt renowned Apoſtles, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14651:125"/>
the beſt of them all could
loue him no more then ſo, for
<hi>greater loue then this hath no
man then that he lay downe his
life for his friend,</hi> witneſſe
Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, <hi>Iohn. 15
13.</hi> It ſeemes likewiſe that all
muſt haue an equall portion
of faith; both which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies
palpably contradict
both Scripture and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
I anſwere firſt without
queſtion all that ſhall be ſaued
muſt bee ſaued by the ſame
faith, <hi>viz:</hi> by faith of the ſame
nature, though not in the ſame
quantitie. Now that which
breeds the miſtake in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
is a conceipt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that to
loue Chriſt more then our
liues proceeds not from the
nature of ſaving faith ſimply
conſidered, but from ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
degree of it, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
is erronious. For it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14651:125"/>
obſervable, that the nature
of faith, if true and ſaving, bee
the degree of it never ſo ſmall
neceſſarily includes thus
much: it being an aſſent vnto
all Scripture revelations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
vnto the Goſpell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
as moſt true and good in
themſelues, and farre better in
the choice then any profits or
pleaſures in the world, yea the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
life or whatſoever may ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it vnto vs. Whence an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
writer of our own
who hath dived profoundly
into the nature of juſtifying
faith, hath weaued the words
of David, <hi>Pſ. 63. Thy louing
kindneſſe is better then life,</hi> into
his compleat definition of that
faith whereby the iuſt doe
liue. 2. Though all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt muſt aſſent to ſo
much be their faith, &amp; expreſſe
if need bee, ſo much by their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14651:126"/>
loue, yet according as thoſe
taſts and reliſhes of heaven
imprinted in their ſoule by
the ſpirit, vpon which the
aſſent of faith, and fervency of
loue are grounded are more
or leſſe liuely and pleaſant,
the faith and loue of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
admit ſundry degrees and
meaſures: but not properly in
regard of their eſteeme of the
object, (for all, as I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
muſt eſteeme it better then
life) but in reſpect of the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and ſetling of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
in themſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that
howſoever all faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
iudge and eſteeme their
hopes by Chriſt to bee better
then life, yet they may bee
more or leſſe in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thoſe apprehenſions
which cauſe this eſteeme may
be more or leſſe cleere and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.
3. Tis true, that to dye
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14651:126"/>
for the profeſſion of Chriſt is
the greateſt poſſible expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of loue vnto him, for the
matter of it there may bee
great diverſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by ſeverall degrees of faith,
and loue may bee expreſſed by
it. Amongſt ſo many thouſands
as haue beene crowned with
martyrdome in Primitiue and
latter times, no doubt but there
was infinite variety of degrees
of faith and loue, all which had
but one common expreſſion
for the matter; but for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it, ſome laid down their
liues more cheerefully and
triumphantly reioycing that it
was giuen to them, not only to
beleeue, but alſo to ſuffer: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with more deliberation,
ſtaggering, &amp; reluctancy ſome
with <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times before they would
dye for him, recanted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iured,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14651:127"/>
and runne through a hundred
of baſe ſights before they
would come to the ſtake,
others behaued themſelues
more honourably &amp; heroical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and being glad of ſuch ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
conveyance to heaven died
with a kinde of Angelicall
Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>To drawe towards a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion:
if any honeſt tender
heart, which vſes to tremble
at the word, and to mourne for
its own infirmities, be brought
into dumps by this doctrine,
cauſing it to thinke thus with
it ſelfe; if every one that loues
Chriſt to any purpoſe muſt
loue him better then life, and
be able to dye for him, then
ſure al my loue vnto him is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> When I am in
my beſt moodes his louing
kindneſſe is dearer vnto mee
then thouſands of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14651:127"/>
and I am of <hi>Davids</hi> mind
that it is <hi>better then life,</hi> but
yet if my life were in queſtion
for it, I know not what would
become of me, ſure I ſhould
never hold out but flinch moſt
ſhamefully. For comfort and
direction vnto ſuch a ſoule I
commend theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
1. This feare of flinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is a good ſigne, that thou
wouldeſt not flinch for feare:
you know what <hi>Peters</hi> loud
proteſtation <hi>(though all men
forſake thee yet will not I)</hi>
came to not long after, you
know the ſtory of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pendle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
or you may reade it in
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fox,</hi> vnleſſe thy life were
exceeding deare vnto thee,
it would be no ſuch great te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of thy loue vnto him,
to part with it for his ſake;
vnleſſe death were very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
Martyrdome would
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14651:128"/>
not bee either ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
ſacrifice vnto God,
or glorious wonder amongſt
men. To feare martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
yea and to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it with ſubmiſſion vnto
Gods will, is warranted by
our Saviours owne example,
when he prayed ſo earneſtly,
that if it were poſſible the
Cup might paſſe away from
him, but ſtill with ſubmiſſion
vnto his fathers pleaſure. That
place concerning our Saviour,
<hi>Heb. 5. 7.</hi> is very remarkable,
<hi>who in the daies of his fleſh,
when he had offered vp prayers
and ſupplications, with ſtrong
crying and teares vnto him,
that was able to ſaue him from
death, and was heard in that
he feared.</hi> I ſtand not vpon the
words in that <hi>hee feared,</hi> for
indeed the conſtruction of the
words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is very
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14651:128"/>
vncertaine, that which I eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
note, is, that it is ſaid
here, our Saviouor <hi>was heard</hi>
how was hee heard? Marke
how, and thence will ſpring a
ſecond branch of comfort. His
Father <hi>heard him,</hi> not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing
the Cup from him,
but in ſtrengthning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him to
drinke it with victory: ſo art
thou ſure to be heard, if thou
prayeſt as hee did: either the
Cup ſhall bee removed from
thee, or ſweetned vnto thee.
Remember withall, that God
is never more for vs, then
when wee are moſt for him,
that his glory lies at ſtake as
well as thy life, and that hee
is more curious of that, then
thou canſt bee of this. <hi>God is
faithfull who will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuffer vs
to be tempted aboue that we are
able; but will with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alſo make away to eſcape
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14651:129"/>
that we may be able to beare it.
1. Cor. 10. 13.</hi> Remember
that thy Saviour hath had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of all the amazemets
and horrors of death when he
ſuffered it for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot forget, both to
pitty and ſuccour thee when
thou art to ſuffer it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for him:
<hi>for in that he himſelfe hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
being tempted he is able to
ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi>
as the Apoſtle ſweetly infers,
<hi>Heb. 2. 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, let mee commend
this caution vnto the tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſoule; Anxious diſtruſtfull
care for the future in matters
of the ſoule, is more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and diſpleaſing vnto
God, then in matters of the
body. Remember therefore
thy Saviours advice, <hi>care not
for to morrow, let that care for
it ſelfe.</hi> Afflict not thy ſelfe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14651:129"/>
with ſuch ſad ſuppoſals, what
if Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies
ſhould come againe; what if
I ſhould bee brought before
ſuch a fellow as <hi>Bonner,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy Saviours reaſon
for his advice, <hi>ſufficient for the
day is the evill thereof.</hi> Which
as it is too true for matters of
this life, ſo it's much more true
in buſineſſe of our ſpirituall
life. If thou art indeed entred
into a covenant with God, if
thou haſt ſeriouſly and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
reſolued to liue the reſt
of thy time in the fleſh by the
faith of the ſonne of God who
hath loued thee and giuen
himſelfe for thee, if thou art
indeed one who knowes what
an infinite, endleſſe, vnwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
diligence is required to a
conſtant, cloſe walking with
God, why then thou haſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day, every houre, omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14651:130"/>
and commiſſions to looke
vnto, thou haſt continuall
ſwarmes of thoughts, words,
and actions moſt warily, and
preciſely to watch over, thou
muſt tread every ſtep as nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and gingerly, as if thou
wenteſt amongſt ſna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and
walkedſt vpon pinnacles, thou
muſt ever and anon chaine vp
thy beloued affections ſhorter,
and deale roughly with thoſe
luſts, which perhaps are as
deare vnto thee as thy life.
What haſt thou thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
every day; and haſt thou
time to make ſuppoſitions for
the future, and to torment
thy ſelfe with preſages? <hi>Let
to morrow care for it ſelfe:</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
from fleſhly luſts which
fight againſt thy ſoule and moſt
dangerouſly in times of peace:
ſtand vpon thy gard againſt
thy ſinnes of daily incurſion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14651:130"/>
againſt ſuch temptations as
are incident to thy preſent
condition, in ſimplicity of
heart reſigne thy ſelfe vp vnto
him, that hath loued thee and
given himſelfe for thee, and
thou be confident, <hi>that neither
life nor death, neither things
preſent nor things to come ſhall
ever be able to ſeparate thee</hi>
from him: this being moſt
certaine that he that does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
liue by faith, hath that in
him, which, if need ſhould be,
will enable him to die in it &amp;
for it.</p>
            <p>But what reaſon had I then
at this time to trouble mens
heads with ſuch a thorny diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Martyrdome? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.
1. The habite of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome,
as I haue ſhewed, is
included in the moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
principle of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
loue of Chriſt better
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14651:131"/>
then our ſelues, ſelfe reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or deniall: and therefore
they deſerue no anſwere but
ſilence, who ſhall thinke a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of it at any time to bee
harſh and vnſeaſonable. 2. As
the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
the Iewes, <hi>Wee haue
had miſchiefe vpon miſchiefe,
and rumor vpon rumor,</hi> and if
miſchiefe and rumors continue
and multiply vpon vs as faſt as
they haue done of late, the
daies may bee ſooner vpon vs
then wee are aware, when
there may be too much occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to practiſe this point and
no time to preach it. The Lord
open our eyes and change our
hearts, the Lord of his mercy
order matters for vs, above all
that wee are able to aske or
thinke, contrary to the cry of
our ſinnes, contrary to proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
that the event may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14651:131"/>
proue ſuch diſcourſes vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
Here now ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a large application of the
maine doctrine branched into
divers vſes, but that if God
giue leaue ſhall ere long be
the exerciſe of another houre.</p>
